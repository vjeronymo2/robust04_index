			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Portugal (8): Farm reform will be painful - Drought has added to the problems of the agricultural sector WHEN last winter's drought was at its worst in Portugal's southern Alentejo province, desperate farmers and entire communities joined in emotional processions and prayers for rain. Whether by divine intervention or as a result of the passing seasons, rain duly came, but not soon enough to avoid the debilitating consequences of one of the country's worst drought in decades. In March, the government hastily put together a Es20bn package to help those in the most badly affected areas, but farmers say they are still waiting for the promised compensation. With about 1.5m hectares severely affected by drought, farmers say they will go bankrupt unless assistance is available soon. 'The whole Alentejo region is in ruin because of the effects of the drought,' says Mr Manuel Rebocho from the Commission for the Fight Against Drought, which was set up this year to represent farmers in the Alentejo. The drought was a sad reminder of the broader problems facing Portuguese agriculture, which threaten the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of farming families. In 1990, almost 18 per cent of the labour force worked on the land or in the fishing industry, according to a European Commission report. Portugal has 10 per cent of the Community's farmers, but they produce only a fraction of EC output. Agriculture accounted for 5.5 per cent of Portugal's gross domestic product in 1989. Difficult conditions and limited prospects have contributed to a sharp decline in the number of people living on the land. Since 1986 the rural population has fallen by about 1.7 per cent annually. The total number of farms has declined from about 700,000 a decade ago to 550,000 today. Mr Raul Miguel Rosado Fernandes, president of the Portuguese Farmers' Confederation, (PAC) admits Portugal has too many farms and that a more efficient figure would be closer to 100,000 farms. He says a large number of farms have been abandoned already, and many small farms are teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. 'The average farm has about five cows. Nobody is interested in taking over these farms, or protecting under-performing co-operatives.' The potential social problems are enormous. 'We must have other choices for these people - in industry and the service sector,' says Mr Armindo de Sousa Ribeiro, former president of Ifadap, the financial support institute for agriculture and fisheries responsible for channelling EC funds into agriculture. But while farming in the north is often a complementary activity with the bulk of a family's income coming from other sources, farmers in the south have no such cushion. With skills limited to farming and low educational attainments - illiteracy is above 30 per cent in rural areas - and farming as a way of life, providing alternatives will be difficult. Portuguese agriculture is divided between small family farms found mainly in the north and much larger units in the cereals-dominated south. The problem is that family plots are far too small to be competitive, while the larger farms are poorly managed and badly need investment in irrigation and new production methods. Inefficient distribution and marketing networks are further obstacles. Since Portugal joined the EC in 1986, considerable funds and expertise have been channelled towards its agriculture. Between 1986 and 1991, EC aid for Portuguese agriculture was about Es195bn - representing 16 per cent of structural funds received by Portugal. This year, the EC has pledged Es40bn for agriculture. EC aid is used to improve infrastructures and communications in isolated rural areas, provide electricity and running water, and to finance training programmes aimed at keeping young farmers on the land. Many farmers have benefited, especially in the region around Lisbon and along the Tagus river where the proximity to a large market and easier access help to make farming more competitive. Mr Manuel Rocha, a farmer in the Ribatejo province close to the capital, says EC subsidies worth about Es30.5m helped him expand and modernise his 18-hectare farm, and switch from producing oranges to peaches and plums. He says it was easy to obtain subsidies, but complains that technical assistance was scarce, and advice on marketing practically non-existent. Farmers' organisations say the government's economic policy does not help. With some of the highest interest rates and energy prices in Europe, farmers argue they cannot produce more cheaply. Mr Rosado Fernandes says the impact of EC membership on Portuguese agriculture would have been much more positive had the government adopted a less restrictive monetary policy. All the same, until now Portuguese agriculture has enjoyed the benefits of EC membership without many of the accompanying hardships, but reform of the Common Agricultural Policy will change all that. Ironically, getting the Community to agree on farm reform was one of the main achievements of this year's Portuguese EC presidency, but it will be a hard pill to swallow for Portugal's farmers. Phased reductions in beef and cereal prices, along with cuts in subsidies and the dismantlement of many import restrictions from January 1 1993, will hurt Portugal's farmers who had until recently largely been shielded from outside competition. Many farmers know they must improve productivity and diversify to compete against other European producers by 2001 when Portuguese agriculture's extended transition period to adapt to EC rules will end, but it is likely to be a painful transition.</p>

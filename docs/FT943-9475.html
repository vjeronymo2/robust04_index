			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / New route for rural superhighway: In his latest report looking at the progress of a scheme to stimulate a community's economy with electronic equipment, Paul Cheeseright finds that the future is now seen to lie in hard-headed income generation The advertisements this week for a chief executive for Kington Connected Community Company mark a change in direction for the village-based scheme in Herefordshire. The chief of KC3, as the company styles itself, will receive Pounds 20,000 a year - plus performance-related bonus - but also a brief to put the project on a more commercial basis. The past was enthusiastic innocence. The future is hard-headed income generation. Mr Mark Pierce, project manager at the Rural Development Commission, said: 'It's got to generate enough resources to stand on its own two feet in three years.' KC3 is an experiment. Apple Computer provided machines, British Telecommunications provided telecoms, and supporting companies such as Rothwell Group and System Support Networking provided training and software, all with the aim of seeing if a rural community could gain economic impetus from a Pounds 300,000 injection of electronic equipment. A year into the experiment it has become clear that the presence of equipment does not itself provide an increase in economic activity. Other sponsors providing support in cash and kind are the Department of Trade and Industry, Hereford and Worcester Training and Enterprise Council, and Leominster District Council - a telecentre in Kington, the focus of the project, is in a district-council building. KC3's sponsors accepted that linking the use of the equipment to economic activity would require careful management and that use of the equipment would have to create the income necessary for the company's continued existence. The development commission has paid for the services of management consultants Morton Hodson, which has put forward recommendations for a new course for KC3. Mr Gerald Harris, a Morton Hodson partner, said: 'There wasn't much of a management structure there before. There wasn't much systematic long-term thinking on future needs.' The new chief executive will be either a young manager on the way up or an older manager not too worried about money. Mr Pierce said: 'He's going to be a commercial operator first and foremost with private-sector experience. But he or she will need to be able to balance the private and public sectors.' The KC3 team will remain small - with the main members being the new chief executive and the manager of the telecentre - but it will draw expertise from outside as it is needed. The chief executive will have to devote immediate attention to two types of revenue-raising schemes. First, there are those which provide a service for which the public sector is prepared to pay. These include acting for the Employment Service in holding a computerised register, open to the public, of job vacancies in the area, and developing databases of teleworkers and agricultural skills. Second, and more difficult to establish, are those where KC3 will act as a business in its own right. The telecentre is starting to offer office bureau services. The new chief executive will examine how to offer KC3's facilities for direct marketing and how to provide a language translation service linking teleworkers to their customers. If the software can be devised for a Kington tourism package, providing electronic contact between local facilities and booking agents, the technique could be franchised to tourist authorities. Mr Harris said that once the income started coming in there would be the capacity to switch to non-income generating activities, such as computerising the records of the Kington Historical Society. But if the experiment is to be a success, the electronics must prompt the establishment of new local business. 'That's the really challenging bit,' Mr Harris said.</p>

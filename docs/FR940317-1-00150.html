Similar files will be maintained for incidents investigated by a claims office or other Army official that might give rise to an affirmative claim in favor of the Army. The investigative file will be merged into a claims file when a claim is filed or asserted. Investigative files not otherwise merged into a claims file will be retained until transferred to another Army claims office or until the time for filing a claim has expired.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.233  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Arrangement of claims files.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Instructions on the arrangement of claims files are found in &sect;536.196 and in DA Pam 27&hyph;162.

W. de Klerk said on Thurdsay [3 February].    Speaking at a press conference during the Natiomal Party's  [NP] federal conference at Kempton Park, Mr de Klerk said the NP  believed in a balance of power as well as the division of power  to various levels of government. "The ANC made these  concessions reluctantly, but they have a hidden agenda to revert  to their old policies of centralism if they get too much power,"  he said.    The NP had refrained from making unachievable promises in  its  manifesto. "We say we will do what is possible within the  bounds of what the country can afford. That is why we say that  only if there is economic growth will we be able to build  houses, schools and clinics. Because of fatal flaws in the  ANC's policies, if they are approved, there will not be economic  growth and their policies will not be worth the paper they are  written on."</p>

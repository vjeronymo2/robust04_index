He noted that in his upcoming address to  the National Assembly, he will stress the necessity of rapidly  adopting the budget and the bills that are extremely necessary  for foreign debt negotiations and the IMF agreement.    According to the president, it is very important to achieve  a  consensus in the parliament on measures needed by the country.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Dangerous Military Tieup" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- Japanese and U.S.  brasshats met in Tokyo recently to discuss "the Japan-U.S.  cooperation system for coping with a possible dispute on the  Korean peninsula."    NODONG SINMUN today views this as a clear proof that the  U.S.  and Japanese reactionaries, in league with each other, are  proceeding with designs of aggression and domination on Korea  and other Asian countries.    They regard aggression on Korea as the key to achieving  military upperhand and supremacy in Asia, the analyst says, and  continues:    The United States is intending to stifle the DPRK by using  the Japanese territory and its military and economic potentials,  while the Japanese reactionaries are scheming to convert Japan  into a military power in a short period and gratify their desire  to stage a comeback to Korea by cooperating with the United  States in the execution of its policy.    It must not go unnoticed that the Japanese reactionaries are  openly revealing their design to reinvade Korea, charging the  DPRK with "nuclear development" and "missile threat" at a time  when the United States has intensified the anti-DPRK campaign to  stifle it as never before.    It is a lie to describe the Japan-based U.S. Forces as  something for "Japan-U.S. security." They have been deployed  according to the U.S. aggressive strategy of forward deployment.  Their basic mission and duty are to play the role of a shock  brigade in the execution of the U.S. policy of aggression and  war against the DPRK and other Asian nations.    The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries must give up their  criminal military tieup and aggressive moves against the DPRK  and other Asian nations.</p>

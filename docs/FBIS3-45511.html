			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade </F> Regulations Governing the Selection and Assessment of Accounting  Personnel Stationed in Counseling Offices Abroad"--promulgated  by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation on 5  October 1993"]    [Text] The regulations are drawn up with a view to  strengthening the financial management and bookkeeping  operations in economic counseling offices, commercial counseling  offices, and economic and commercial representative offices  (economic [commercial] counseling offices for short hereafter)  abroad, enhancing their level of management, specifying the  responsibility scope of their accounting personnel, and ensuring  that all accounting personnel sent to economic (commercial)  counseling offices abroad are well qualified for their jobs and  can fulfill their work tasks satisfactorily.  <H5>  I. Selection of Accounting Personnel </H5>   1. Principles governing selection.    A) All economic (commercial) counseling offices involved in  foreign economic aid programs and enjoying diplomatic funding  should select and detail professional accounting personnel who  have certain work experience in the accounting field. All  economic (commercial) counseling offices enjoying diplomatic  funding only should detail professional or part-time accounting  personnel (i.e. concurrent posts taken by personnel of other  professions or by people outside the authorized personnel quota)  according to their own conditions.    B) Professional accounting personnel should be familiar  with, and have a good mastery of, the financial accounting  system as well as the financial system in Chinese embassies  (consulates) and acquire knowledge of the financial accounting  operation of foreign contracted labor services. Part-time  accounting personnel should have a good mastery of the financial  accounting system of Chinese embassies (consulates).    C) Professional accounting personnel should be selected from  among the professional financial accounting personnel in  relevant units and departments, such as the Financial Accounting  Department, the Administrative Department, and multifaceted  companies [cheng tao gong si 2052 1152 0361 0674] under this  ministry; part-time accounting personnel should have the  educational qualifications of technical secondary school, high  school, or above.    2. Selection methods.    A) Candidates selected by the Personnel Department in  accordance with the above principle will be assigned to the  financial sections of the Administration Department and  multifaceted companies to become familiar with relevant  financial accounting operations. They should take an exam on  accounting operations according to relevant stipulations and the  Personnel Department will be notified of their exam results.  All those passing the exam can immediately go through the  necessary exit formalities, while those who fail the exam should  not be sent abroad as accounting personnel.    B) All professional accounting personnel who have worked as  accounting personnel in economic (commercial) counseling offices  and are competent can be exempted from taking the exam. The  Financial Accounting Department will sponsor irregular training  courses on the financial accounting operations of economic  (commercial) counseling offices. Those who can obtain the  completion certificate from the training course are also exempt  from taking the exam when sent abroad.  <H5>  II. Tasks of Accounting Personnel </H5>   1. Observe, publicize, and implement relevant policies,  decrees and orders, stipulations, and financial and economic  disciplines of the state.    2. In accordance with the stipulations of the financial  accounting system concerning foreign economic aid, manage the  funds and properties of foreign economic aid programs; take  charge of the settlement of local costs and contract purchase  price of projects under the economic aid contracted  responsibility system; and keep, work out, and submit accounts  of economic activities already incurred in a timely fashion.    3. In line with the stipulations of the financial accounting  system of Chinese embassies (consulates), manage the diplomatic  funds and properties of economic (commercial) counseling  offices; and keep, work out, and submit accounts of economic  activities already incurred in a timely fashion.    4. Supervise and check the financial revenue and expenditure  of projects under the economic aid contracted responsibility  system and find out and reflect problems to higher levels in a  timely manner.    5. Acquire knowledge about the overseas-based financial  accounting operations in representative offices, contracted  projects, labor cooperations, and joint ventures of various  international economic and technical cooperative companies;  provide them with relevant information about the country in  which they function; relay and supervise the implementation of  relevant internal documents and systems; and give assistance to  work in this aspect.    6. Conduct frequent investigations into and studies of the  financial accounting system, foreign exchange management,  taxation rules, operation of banking institutions, and financial  markets in the resident country, and send investigation and  research data back to the relevant departments at home without  delay.    7. Take good care of accounting records. An accounting  archive should be set up in line with relevant stipulations to  classify, codify, and bind accounting vouchers, books, and  various fiscal statements; specify the period for safe custody;  and assign special people to take charge of records management.    8. Do a good job in the handover of accounts. Before  their departure from economic (commercial) counseling offices  due to job transfer, accounting personnel should go through  handing over procedures with their successors in the resident  county. A handover inventory should be signed by the two  parties concerned and an overseer of the handover. It is  imperative to make a detailed inventory of fixed assets, reserve  materials, and cash in the treasury and ensure that there is  neither discrepancy between accounts and actual resources nor  disagreement between accounts. As regards temporary credit and  debit, detailed account statements should be worked out by unit  or by an individual and handed over with the proper endorsement  of the units and individuals concerned. A "Statement on the  Balance of Bank Deposits" should be prepared to ensure the  accuracy of the deposited amount.  <H3>  III. Supervision, Examination, and Leadership Over  Accounting Work </H3>   1. Relevant departments, including the Financial Accounting  Department, the Administration Department, and multifaceted  companies, should organize, in a planned way, accounting work  inspection groups and call meetings on overseas-based accounting  work every year; check and give guidance to the financial  accounting work of relevant economic (commercial) counseling  offices; and hold lectures and tuitions on relevant financial  accounting operations to help accounting personnel deal with  certain problems and enhance the level of financial accounting  work.    2. As regards those economic (commercial) counseling offices  which are plagued by a relatively larger number of problems, the  ministry's Financial Accounting Department should work with the  relevant departments, organize a special work group, conduct a  comprehensive examination of the situation, and help solve  existing problems. The work group can also make suggestions to  the Personnel Department on the dismissal of truly incompetent  accounting personnel working in economic (commercial) counseling  offices.    3. Leading comrades of all economic (commercial) counseling  offices stationed abroad should strengthen their leadership over  the financial accounting work of their own offices, take the  lead in observing financial and economic discipline, support  financial accounting personnel to handle matters impartially,  and conduct regular supervision and examinations on the  financial accounting work of their own offices.    4. Accounting personnel who are on holiday back home should  go and report their work to the ministry's Financial Accounting  Department and the financial sections of the Administration  Department and multifaceted companies at a prearranged time.  Meanwhile, the Financial Accounting Department and the financial  sections of the Administration Department and multifaceted  companies will brief the accounting personnel on newly  promulgated financial accounting systems and offer explanations  and answers to relevant questions.  <H5>  IV. Supplementary provisions </H5>   These Regulations shall come into force on 1 June 1990.  [signed] Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade  [dated] 3 April 1990</p>

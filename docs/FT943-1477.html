			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee rally halted - Market report London COFFEE futures ended a see-saw session in the minus column yesterday. Having reached a near 9-year high of Dollars 4,140 a tonne in the morning, the November position closed at Dollars 4,055, down Dollars 36 on balance. One dealer explained that early expectations that prices would move higher, continuing the rally of recent weeks, had given way to a 'sense of disappointment' and light liquidation. At the London Metal Exchange a slight retracement in both COPPER and ALUMINIUM took most of the other base metals off the boil by the close of business. Dealers said copper was now looking to overcome its recent high of Dollars 2,550 a tonne, for three months delivery, to spark further gains and confirm its perceived upside potential. Three months aluminium edged up to a fresh 3 3/4 -year high of Dollars 1,626 a tonne on bouts of speculative buying and short-covering before slipping under light producer selling and profit-taking to close at Dollars 1,623.50, down 50 cents on balance.

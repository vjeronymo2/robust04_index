			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAN ANYONE SPARE A DIME FOR THE FUTURE?  </P> <P> Years ago, a majority of Californians took greater personal responsibility for  their wastes. Water came from a local well. Sewage went into a back-yard septic  tank and trash was burned in an incinerator or hauled to a local dump at the  edge of town. Today, a rapidly expanding population, economic growth and  environmental concerns have made these essential operations a vital element of  government services.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, a growing number of California cities have failed to invest in  their infrastructure needs. Without immediate attention, the consequences will  profoundly affect our quality of life for generations.  </P> <P> Five years ago, the Governor's Task Force on Infrastructure projected a 10-year  public works deficit of more than $50 billion. That gap has only grown in the  ensuing years. Our Golden State has a huge bill coming due for the neglect of  sewer systems and trash facilities. Roads, bridges, water-delivery systems and  municipal facilities are similarly in need of attention.  </P> <P> How big an issue is it? A few statistics from the city of Los Angeles  illustrate the problems statewide. First, the sewers. By midnight tonight, more  than 440 million gallons of waste water will have passed through about 6,000  miles of Los Angeles' antiquated sewer system. Voters in the 1970s and early  '80s routinely voted down sewer-bond measures. The relationship between an  aging sewer system and the pollution of Santa Monica Bay was not grasped. With  time and the tolerance of the bay running down, the city finally made a  commitment to modernize its sewer system and, in so doing, to clean up the bay.  </P> <P> The city has embarked on a $3.4-billion sewer improvement program that will  result in a state-of-the-art waste-water facility. And, in November, 1987, Los  Angeles stopped dumping sludge, the solid remains from sewage, into the bay  waters off our coastline. Although the costs are enormous, Los Angeles is in  fact playing an expensive and high-stakes game of catch-up for failing to  support earlier efforts to upgrade its infrastructure.  </P> <P> With its capital improvement program in place, Los Angeles is fundamentally on  track with its sewer system. However, the city is in much poorer shape with  respect to solid waste -- the stuff we put in garbage cans. We must address  this issue today and not wait for a California version of the now-symbolic  "Mobro" barge that cruised the East Coast in search of a site to unload its  cargo of trash.  </P> <P> Greater Los Angeles generates more than 14 million tons of trash every year  that has to go somewhere both out of sight and environmentally safe. Meanwhile,  we're running out of places to put it. In less than five years, the city-owned  landfill will be filled to the top.  </P> <P> The long-term solution to our trash problems requires a major commitment from  the public and private sectors to reduce the amount of material going into the  waste stream in order to relieve the pressure on our limited landfill reserves.  Next, we must recover valuable natural resources by recycling. Market  incentives are also needed for products using recycled materials.  </P> <P> The cost of public works investment is substantial, but so is the cost of  underinvestment. Thus, while there are many needs and never enough money,  public officials must inform the public shareholders in our municipal  corporation of the depreciation of their infrastructure assets. Investment in  these essential facilities is as much a state responsibility as a local concern  because of their importance to our economic vitality and quality of life.  Leadership in Sacramento is needed.  </P> <P> First and foremost, we must initiate, at the state level, a comprehensive,  multi-year capital outlay planning process for each infrastructure element to  meet California needs. Next, innovative financing mechanisms to assist local  governments in financing capital needs should be explored. For example, the  state could aggressively pursue "bond pooling," in which the small bond issues  of local governmental entities are assembled into larger issues. This strategy  improves marketability and reduces costs for local issuers.  </P> <P> Through appropriate legislation, the state could selectively insure public  infrastructure debt through an independent insurance fund supported by premiums  charged to participating entities. This would lower the interest cost to  borrowers.  </P> <P> Finally, to ensure that state and local governments can finance vital projects  like schools, roads, prisons and water facilities for their citizens at the  lowest possible cost, tax-exempt bonds must be protected. Nationally, the  Public Securities Assn. estimates that $27.5 billion in additional costs to  local taxpayers would result if this exemption were lost. California should  join the growing number of states that have endorsed an amendment to the U.S.  Constitution to keep Congress from taxing these bonds.  </P> <P> If California's basic transportation, water supply and waste disposal systems  continue to deteriorate, the state's vibrant economy, as well as its heralded  quality of life, will erode. We must maintain a continuing investment in our  public infrastructure. Today's headlines that describe collapsing sewer pipes,  gridlocked roads and trash with nowhere to go are a consequence of our failure  to provide for California's future. It is up to our leaders to tell us the  facts and the costs. Today's investment is tomorrow's quality of life.  </P></p>

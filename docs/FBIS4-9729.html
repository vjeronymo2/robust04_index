			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Bank of Mexico has released its 1993 annual  report. As of 31 December, the Bank of Mexico's international  reserves were $24.537 billion, a $6-billion increase at the  close of 1992. These figures appear in the Bank of Mexico's 1993  annual report, 172 pages of Mexico's primary economic indicators.    The Bank of Mexico cites economic trends following  noteworthy  achievements in Mexican economic development, like significant  progress in structural changes and the control of inflation,  which was reduced one digit to 8 percent, and increased work  productivity and in midlevel salaries. Nevertheless, an economic  slowdown may result from uncertainty regarding NAFTA  ratification. Other factors that discouraged private spending in  investment as well as consumption negatively impacted on  employment.    The gross domestic product grew 4 percent in 1993 and the  surplus in the balance of payments was higher than in 1992,  accompanied by a high level of enthusiasm in nonpetroleum  exports and lower deficits in the trade balance and the current  account. The trade balance deficit was $13.81 billion, a  $2.5-billion reduction compared to last year's deficit. Crude  exports were reduced while petroleum byproducts increased. The  average price of Mexican petroleum on the international market  went down from $14.83 to $13.20 per barrel. In its 1993 report,  the Bank of Mexico forecasts an upturn in the Mexican economy  for 1994, with benefits for all the nation's sectors.</p>

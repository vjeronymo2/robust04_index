			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Animal rights group cash frozen THE BANK accounts of Lynx, the animal rights group that campaigned against fur farming, were yesterday ordered to be frozen by the High Court, after it lost a libel case and was unable to pay damages and costs. A High Court jury decided that the group, in literature circulated to MPs, had wrongly accused Swalesmoor fur farm, near Halifax, West Yorkshire. Damages were awarded of Pounds 40,000, along with costs put at over Pounds 100,000. Mr Mark Glover, a founding director of Lynx, said it was expecting a winding-up order to be sought against it.</p>

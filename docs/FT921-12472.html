			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Unions begin vote on German steel and bank strikes VOTING began yesterday in the strike ballot of 100,000 trade union members in the German steel industry to decide whether to call their first stoppage since 1979. One of the two big unions in the German banking industry will also decide today whether to hold a similar strike ballot, after the breakdown of wage negotiations last week. The threat of the two strikes, combined with the prospect of a stormy pay negotiation opening in February for the 3m government workers and a hefty pay claim from 4m engineering workers, leaves Germany facing its most troubled industrial relations period in recent years. Officials in IG Metall, the union representing both the steel and engineering workers, insisted over the weekend the mood was running strongly in favour of a steel strike. Wage negotiations in the industry broke down after nine sessions, with the difference between the employers and unions reduced to barely 1 percentage point: according to various calculations, IG Metall was ready to settle for 6.5 per cent, down from the 10.5 per cent original claim, while the employers are offering between 5.3 and 5.7 per cent. A 75 per cent vote is needed in the ballot to call a strike. Wage negotiations for banking workers broke down last Wednesday, and today the white-collar workers' union, DAG, will decide whether to hold a strike ballot. The HBV, the other trade union representing banking workers, is also threatening a ballot, rejecting the bank employers' latest offer of five per cent as 'outrageous' after a year of record banking profits. Negotiations for government workers begin on February 7. They want a 9.5 per cent rise, the figure recommended by IG Metall to regional branches as the maximum demand for engineering workers. Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, whose increased taxes to finance German unity have helped fuel the wage demands, warned trade unions that any stoppage would be 'a blow to the economic re-unification of Germany'.</p>

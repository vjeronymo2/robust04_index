			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems seek end to N-subsidy THE removal of the Pounds 1.2bn-a-year subsidy to the nuclear industry and a one-off deal to sell British Coal stockpiles at below market prices were advocated yesterday by the Liberal Democrats in their response to the government's review of the coal industry. The party believes that the continuing losses of the nuclear industry should be borne on the public-sector borrowing requirement, although the small element of the non-fossil fuel levy that goes into renewable sources of energy would be maintained. The party believes that some of the 20m or so tonnes of coal stocks at pit heads should be sold - to the electricity generators for preference - at below market value, to give the coal industry a fresh start.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Liberian National Transitional Government [LNTG]  has lauded the efforts of the Economic Community of West African  States [ECOWAS], ECOMOG [ECOWAS Cease-Fire Monitoring Group]-  contributing countries, the United Nations, and the  international community for the human and material sacrifices  they continue to make in restoring peace to Liberia.    In a statement issued at the end of the first cabinet  meeting  of the State Council and its cabinet, (?it called on) the United  States Government, the European Community, and other countries  to extend full diplomatic recognition to the Liberian  Government. The government said this will strengthen the LNTG  and advance the peace process.    In a related development, the LNTG is calling on the leaders  of warring factions and armed combatants to unconditionally  surrender all their arms and other implements of war to ECOMOG.  The Liberian Government's call is in consonance with its recent  declaration of full authority over the entire country made at  its first cabinet meeting on Friday [13 May]. The cabinet's  statement has pointed out that with all components of the  transitional government -- that is, the State Council, the  Transitional Legislative Assembly, the Judiciary, and the ad hoc  Election Commission -- fully constituted and functioning, the  LNTG is now the governing authority of Liberia, effectively  ending all factional claims to territory.    Meanwhile, the cabinet has expressed appreciation to the  leaders of parties to the Cotonou Accord for the cooperation and  sense of compromise that led to the creation of the LNTG and  also leaders of armed factions not signatories to the accord for  their recognition of, cooperation with, and commitment to the  LNTG and the peace process.</p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Duma blocks Russian budget Russia's State Duma (lower house) yesterday refused to pass the 1995 budget at first reading - a blow to the government. Officials The government which had expected the budget to be passed following a commission's recommendation of a joint parliamentary-government to vote for it after following a series of minor changes had been made to the original draft. However, the vote - of 215 for - was only 11 votes short of the required number, and government sources were said last night that they hoped the budget would pass during a second debate today.</p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Price rises brighten outlook for NZ wool - Auction returns yesterday reached the highest level for 27 months New Zealand wool growers are looking forward to the future with increased confidence following a rise in prices to 27-month highs yesterday. With demand forecast to outstrip supply the market uptrend is expected to be maintained over the next two years. Declining sheep numbers in the country, the world's biggest producer of carpet wools, are expected to lead to production this season falling to its lowest level for nearly 20 years, while supplies will be further reduced as the Wool Board, now called Wools of New Zealand, sells the last of its stockpile. Wool brokers say that a growing appreciation of reducing availability of New Zealand's coarser type wools has been a major factor in the market strength of recent weeks. The indicator at yesterday's North and South Island auctions reached NZDollars 5.18 (Pounds 2) a kilogram, up six cents from last week. When the season began three weeks ago it stood at Dollars 4.87. Mr Patrick Conway an analyst with Wools of New Zealand said yesterday that there would be disappointment if New Zealand did not achieve an average price for this season in the Dollars 4.75 to Dollars 5 a kilogram range, compared with only Dollars 4.14 in the year to June. Mr Charles Hall of JS Brooksbanks and Company, a German-owned export house, thought , however, that while the outlook was for rising prices in the immediate future, there were grounds for caution on whether they would keep on rising at recent rates. He pointed out that many of the major buyers over the last two years, including India, Nepal, Iran and Turkey, now faced serious financial and economic problems, while there were question marks over the buying power of China, which takes the bulk of the clip. Nevertheless, Mr Hall noted that a lot of business was being done with buyers from Europe, the US, Japan and China, much of it for delivery some way in the future. He saw that as an indication of overseas confidence that recent higher prices would be sustained over the next five to six months. Mr Conway said an analysis by Wools of New Zealand showed that the amount of wool available for sale in the current season would be the lowest since the 1976 season. New Zealand's production in the 1994-95 season is forecast to fall 2 per cent to 205,000 tonnes. And the board has cut its stockpile from 87,000 tonnes when it was forced to stop supporting the market in 1991 to 21,000 tonnes this week. Total availability this season is thus indicated at 230,000 tonnes, compared with recent annual consumption of New Zealand wool of 245,000 tonnes - 226,000 tonnes for the export market plus domestic sales of 19,000 tonnes. 'Clearly this level of demand is unable to met from supply this season, let alone in the 1995-96 season when all the former board stocks are sold and production is 205,000 tonnes,' Mr Conway said. 'If demand remains at the current level, price increases must occur.' He noted that while some customers such as Turkey were having major economic problems, there were indications that demand at retail level in Germany remained very strong for hand knitted carpets from Asia. Retail sales remained high in China, and there were reports that its supplies of wool were low. 'Looking ahead over the rest of the season we expect other markets, such as Europe and Japan to show greater demand, offsetting the difficulties in Turkey and other weak economies,' he said. 'Overall we see aggregate demand to be at the same level as last season, or perhaps slightly stronger as the major economies move out of recession.' Releasing figures for the 1993-94 season, Mr Roger Buchanan, Wools of New Zealand's group manager, fibre technology, said that there was an encouraging 12 per cent, or NZDollars 140m increase in sales to NZDollars 1.285bn. Fibre export sales were up by 25 per cent to 226,000 tonnes. Mr Buchanan said the volume increase was mainly due to sales of wool from the board's stockpile, and a 9 per cent increase in production. China increased its purchases by 65 per cent to 60,260 tonnes, while the combined China/Hong market accounted for nearly one third of New Zealand 's fibre exports. Total shipments this year were more than 72,000 tonnes, a rise of 59 per cent. Another encouraging feature of the year was the increase in shipments to western Europe - mainly reflecting recovery in the British economy. British mills increased their wool imports by 41 per cent from June 1993 to 23,000 tonnes. There was also keener interest from Germany, Belgium and Italy. India and Nepal remained important markets, accounting for 29,100 tonnes, up 200 tonnes from last year. Exports to India increased from 11,200 tonnes to 17,200 tonnes, a rise of 54 per cent; but exports to Nepal fell from 17,700 tonnes to 11,900 tonnes. The continuing recession in Japan was reflected in sales remaining significantly below those of earlier years.</p>

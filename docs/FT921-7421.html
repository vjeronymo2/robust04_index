			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / The Long View: All over the place 'I'VE HAD a bellyfull of German bankers,' grumbled my old friend Steve the strategist, hotfoot from Frankfurt this week on a leg of one of his regular world tours. 'I never want to hear the phrase 'monetary discipline' again. They say they hate inflation, but they just love the power it gives them.' London, I murmured, could be the right place to escape from such people. With the General Election coming up he was unlikely to hear anything about discipline. Instead there would be soaring deficits, tax cuts and a political competition to promise ever-higher spending. True, he could find much the same sort of thing in the US too, with a few extra bimbos to add some glamour. Steve admitted that he had almost forgotten about the British election. Most people outside the UK thought the election was 15 months ago, and Margaret Thatcher inexplicably lost. The election might seem a big deal to the natives, but if both the leading British political parties were committed to remaining part of the DM currency bloc the international markets would probably stay relaxed about it, although no doubt the forex traders would want to test out any new regime thoroughly. Steve has bigger fish to fry. In fact, he told me, these are the kind of circumstances in which strategists ought to be able to earn several times over their first-class air fares and sojourns at 'conferences' at the Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok. There were all the signs of a major bust-up in the leading markets, with indices going in all different directions. 'When Hong Kong is the global stock market leader you have to watch out,' said Steve. 'It's not so bad as when Australia is heading the league table, but not far off.' The big stock markets had a nice little surge over Christmas but only Wall Street had managed to hit new high ground in February. For the rest, Toyko was threatening to break decisively down through the 21,000 level on the Nikkei - a fall of 45 per cent over the past two years, while Wall Street was up 20 per cent over the same period. As for Europe, it was going nowhere very much at all, kept under lock and key by the Bundesbank's high interest rates. Steve said: 'We have a rip-roaring bull market in the US with historic p/e's on the industrial blue chips hitting 25 and all the small punters piling into the over-the-counter garbage stocks touting Aids cures. 'Net sales of equity mutual funds had trebled year-on-year by the fourth quarter as the suburban punters piled in, fleeing from microscopic deposit rates on savings accounts. It frightens the foreign investors out of their wits, but they dare not stay out of the game. 'Over in Tokyo we have the mirror image. Tokyo housewives have said goodbye to investment trusts, which are the Japanese mutual funds, and so long as the financial scandals keep breaking in the newspapers one after another they are going to stay right out. The corporate tokkin funds are also heading fast for the exit. He added: 'All right, we hear that the Big Four securities houses and the Ministry of Finance are going to fix the market, but that sounds more like the old problem than a new solution. 'This leaves the foreigners as the only buyers in town, and suddenly they can actually see real value in the industrial sectors, but they are feeling awfully lonely out there, and worrying what will happen when the Japanese banks have a rare meeting with reality.' At least, I commented, the yen and the dollar were not locked together. There was a certain amount of give in the system. In Europe, on the other hand, we had divergencies that were being suppressed by exchange rate rigidities. Suddenly there was a lot of talk about a German recession, but as a recession it seemed to be about as technical as our own 'technical recovery' in the UK in the third quarter of last year. In Frankfurt, said Steve, the German bankers were uncompromising. If the rest of Europe didn't like it they could always devalue. The ERM was not EMU  -not yet, anyway. German short-term rates seemed unlikely to drop significantly before the end of the year. Of course, realigning within the ERM would not solve the interest rate problem. But the pressures within France, Italy and the UK seemed to be boiling up to some sort of climax. 'I'm formulating my survival strategy, only as a contingency plan, of course,' confided Steve. 'Suppose Tokyo takes another dive as the financials melt down. That would bust the fragile boom on Wall Street, kind of 1987 only heading east to west. 'Those punters in condos in Florida would head back into bond funds, or take 3 per cent in the First Tampa Bay S &amp; L, gritting their teeth and even talking about voting Democrat. Meanwhile the Europeans would be realigning in panic. 'So my reading is, short the dollar, go long of DM cash, and then get ready to move when the dust has settled into UK and French bonds, where the yields will be high, and Japanese industrial equities, where it will even soon be worthwhile cashing the dividend cheques. 'The first thing, though, is to get the hell out of Hong Kong.' I raised an eyebrow. This did not seem to be what his latest client circulars had been saying. If my memory was not failing me the advice was to stay with Japanese blue chips and US second line growth stocks. 'Sure,' said Steve. 'The 60 per cent probability is still that US economic growth will jerk up by the second quarter, and the Japanese will be able to shuffle their way out of trouble as usual. 'Besides, our corporate finance department has a couple of big international M and A deals in the pipeline which could abort if the markets get nervous. I had never heard Steve talk quite like this before. He has absolutely no sense of humour, so he could not have been pulling my leg. Perhaps the jetlag had finally caught him up. Or maybe he had been talking to too many bankers in Frankfurt, and he'll soon get over it.</p>

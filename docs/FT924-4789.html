			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Beijing tries to pull mat out from under Patten: Giving confidence a shake is intended to undermine support for reform plans THE announcement by Beijing yesterday that it would repudiate any business agreement the Hong Kong government enters into without China's consent is designed to do two things. The first is, in the short term, to undermine confidence in the economy. This will further weaken the support Mr Chris Patten, the governor, enjoys among local politicians and the public for his plans for more democracy in the territory. In the longer term it is intended to undermine the ability of the Hong Kong government to make agreements with local and foreign businessmen unless Britain is prepared to accept condominium government for the colony before Beijing re-assumes sovereignty in 1997. It is a bid for much closer involvement in the day-to-day government of the colony. It was this form of shared government that China only partly secured when a year ago it signed a memorandum of understanding with Britain which allowed for the colony's multi-billion dollar airport project to go ahead. This agreement, which for the time being is dead in the water, allowed China a role in approving the finance of the project and any large contracts and business franchises related to it. In the immediate term, the warning issued yesterday throws into question the development of the colony's container port, the electricity industry and cable television. It does this, not because the Hong Kong government is unwilling to talk about commercial matters with China - something it already does - but because Beijing is incensed at Mr Patten's plans for further democracy in the territory. These include, by 1995 elections, a broadening of the franchise for the 40 seats out of 60 on the Legislative Council which are not directly elected. China has made clear - through its surrogates in the colony's media and community - that it is prepared to talk to Britain only if Mr Patten's plans are withdrawn and Britain agrees to conduct elections due in 1995 on China's terms. Observers say Beijing is making plain to the people of Hong Kong that it will accept only strictly limited democracy in the colony. It is also, in effect, telling them and the British government that it is no longer prepared to talk to Mr Patten. According to one local financier: 'China does not care about confidence in the short term. It is quite clear that they want this man (Mr Patten) and they want him out.' The tactics may be crude, but they have been effective. China's threat last week to repudiate the HKDollars 10bn (Pounds 850m) development of the colony's ninth container terminal was the chief cause of the near 3 per cent fall in share prices on the Hong Kong stock exchange yesterday. Since early October, when Mr Patten unveiled his proposals, China has waged a daily war in the media against him. Public support for the governor has stood up well, although over the past 10 days there has been a noticeable weakening in favour of compromise with Beijing. The business community - which at first welcomed his proposals - has been quickest to disown them. Most in business now believe that, given China's intransigence and the reality of its takeover in 1997, Mr Patten has little option but to withdraw his proposals and sue for peace. China has been robust in its attacks. Chinese officials are quick to remind local businessmen where their loyalties should lie and equally quick to point out that China will remember the position they adopt. These threats have been made to local politicians as well as businessmen sometimes quite openly and in the presence of senior Hong Kong government officials. The Hong Kong government pointed out, in its response to Beijing's statement, that China was in breach of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law for Hong Kong, which was promulgated in 1990. Both documents guarantee that any government contracts lawfully entered into would be honoured by Hong Kong's future government. The government's measured response stressed that Hong Kong, as matter of course, consults China on large scale commercial matters which straddle 1997. But officials pointed out that the business of government would come to a standstill if every agreement, no matter what the size, had first to be approved by Beijing. Last night the government gave every indication that it would press ahead on the course Mr Patten has chartered. The destination is the local legislature in the New Year when Mr Patten has undertaken to present legislation. A vote is expected in the spring, probably in April or May, after the budget. Analysts said yesterday that they expected the Legislative Council to try to modify Mr Patten's proposals in an attempt to accommodate China, although they had little confidence that Beijing would welcome such action.</p>

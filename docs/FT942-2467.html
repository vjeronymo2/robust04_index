			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Dour opening tussle lives up to tradition Defending champions Germany had the perfect start last night in their bid to retain the title when they won 1-0 over Bolivia, who had their star player sent off minutes after he came on as a substitute. Opening games have a tradition of producing dour displays and few goals, and after an undistinguished first half this one looked unlikely to be a spectacle to match the noisy and colourful pre-game opening ceremony which was watched - according to the organisers - by 750m people in 180 countries. US president Bill Clinton welcomed players and fans, claiming 'soccer is the universal language that brings us all together,' while guests among the 63,117 sell-out crowd at Soldier Field in Chicago were German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez De Lozada. On a hot, humid day with temperatures above 30 degrees centigrade, both teams were cautious and slow to get into their stride. The first yellow card of the tournament was shown to Germany's Jurgen Kohler in the 7th minute, as the Mexican referee sought to impose his authority early. Most of the neutrals in the crowd were behind the South American underdogs, who were content to soak up German pressure and grew in confidence as the game went on. In the 1990 tournament in Italy, Germany won their first game 4-1 against Yugoslavia but probably never played as well again during the tournament. Last night's German team included seven of the side that won the 1990 final against Argentina, and two of them combined to break the deadlock on the hour. A long ball by Lothar Matthaus beat the Bolivian offside trap and striker Jurgen Klinsmann rounded goalkeeper Carlos Trucco to stroke the ball into an empty net. From then on Germany were rarely threatened and Bolivia looked to their bench for salvation. Marco Etcheverry, their key midfield playmaker - and little short of national hero - had been struggling with a knee injury and was left out of the starting line-up. When he came on for Ramallo, he had a quarter of an hour to make his mark. With his first touch he set up a shot for Erwin Sanchez and there was a sense that his very presence might inspire his countrymen to greater efforts. But with the ball at the other end of the field, he aimed a frustrated shove at Matthaus and was immediately shown the red card. He had been in the game for four minutes. Having banked three points, Germany must now be confident of progressing as they prepare for their next game against Spain on Tuesday.</p>

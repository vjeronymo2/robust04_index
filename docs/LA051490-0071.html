			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1 ARRESTED IN PROTEST AT L.A. COUNTRY CLUB  </P> <P> Nearly a month to the day when police in riot gear arrested 11 people  protesting alleged racism at the exclusive Los Angeles Country Club, about 75  demonstrators staged a return march to the club Sunday, led by black community  activist Don Jackson.  </P> <P> Jackson was the only demonstrator arrested.  </P> <P> He was booked at West Los Angeles Jail on suspicion of trespassing, a  misdemeanor, and released on bail later in the day, police said.  </P> <P> Wearing a bright green golf cap and white golf shoes, shirt and sweater,  Jackson entered the club's main driveway entrance at 10101 Wilshire Blvd. and  demanded that security guards let him in. They denied him entry because he was  not a club member. Jackson refused to leave the property until someone  explained how he could join. Instead, he was arrested.  </P> <P> Accompanying Jackson was a white man who carried his golf clubs. "I brought him  to prove the point that if a white man could carry a black man's golf clubs,  then a black man should be allowed to join a white man's club," Jackson said.  "And if (country club managers) want to stand as barriers of racism and  American apartheid, I want to be here to confront it."  </P> <P> Student organizers of the protest said the country club has not had a black  member in 22 years. They also allege that recently, a black friend of a club  member was denied entry to the club.  </P> <P> Managers of the club could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

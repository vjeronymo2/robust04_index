			<p>BFN     [Text] President Kim Yong-sam stressed today that the  government is fully prepared to handle any provocation from  North Korea.    At Chongwadae [presidential offices] today, President Kim  held a meeting with businessmen, including the presidents of  finance institutions. There he pointed out that the people's  insensitivity to national security is a problem. At the same  time, however, people should not be uneasy about national  security. He also stressed that, as the president, he should  safeguard the state and defend people's lives and property and  he has been mapping out solid countermeasures to be fully  prepared to ward off any provocation from North Korea. People  may have trust in the president and government.    President Kim expressed strong confidence in national  security by stating: We can handle, in a brief space of time, a  provocation from North Korea because the government is  maintaining an unprecedentedly solid system of cooperation  between the ROK and the United States; because the government is  maintaining an around-the-clock system to watch the North;  because the morale in the military is higher than ever before as  politically oriented soldiers have been removed; and because our  firing power and maneuverability are in an excellent status.    President Kim made it clear once again: The government is  coping with the matters related to the North on the basis of the  great principle that North Korea should not possess nuclear  capability and that peace on the Korean peninsula should be  maintained. Although North Korea is showing an unstable and  shocking attitude toward the United States through withdrawing  from the International Atomic Energy Agency, all of their  strategies are not working as they planned.    President Kim predicted that the countries concerned at the  UN Security Council are now fine-tuning the wording of sanctions  against North Korea. They will put sanctions into action in two  or three weeks after they complete their consultations on the  intensity of the sanctions. They will heighten the intensity of  sanctions gradually.    President Kim asked the financiers to make efforts, equipped  with confidence in national security, to achieve this year's  goal of 6 percent economic growth, to keep the increase in  commodity prices under 6 percent, and to achieve an annual  export goal of $90 billion.</p>

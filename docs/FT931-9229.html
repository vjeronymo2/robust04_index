			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Ghost still haunts politicians THE shadow of the Banco Ambrosiano, which collapsed in 1982, has returned to haunt Italian politics, Robert Graham writes. The first victim has been Mr Claudio Martelli, who was forced to resign as justice minister and hand in his membership of the Socialist party. Mr Martelli had earlier been told that Milan magistrates were investigating him for involvement in the fraudulent bankruptcy of Banco Ambrosiano. Mr Martelli has denied any involvement and says he intends to fight to clear his name. One of the six warrants of investigation sent to Mr Craxi by Milan magistrates also concerns the bankruptcy of Ambrosiano. Why should the collapse of a bank 11 years ago have such relevance to the present wave of investigations into political corruption? In brief, magistrates believe unlocking some of the unknown secrets of Ambrosiano  - especially through access to Swiss bank accounts -  will shed light on the complex system of illicit party financing which was perfected in Italy during the 1980s. Of particular interest to the magistrates is a bank account held with UBS in Lugano in the name of Mr Silvano Larini. They are looking into the circumstances of Dollars 7m (Pounds 4.6m) paid to this account, No 633369, by Mr Roberto Calvi, the head of Banco Ambrosiano who was found hanged from London's Blackfriars Bridge in 1982 just before the bank's collapse. The magistrates allege the money was in recompense for ENI, the state oil concern, having extended a Dollars 50m loan to help the troubled Banco Ambrosiano. At the time of Ambrosiano's collapse, ENI had Dollars 160m loans extended to this bank with close links to the Vatican. The warrants against Mr Craxi and Mr Martelli, seeking the waiver of parliamentary immunity, focus on allegations that the two were involved in using the UBS account to receive the Calvi funds for the Socialist party. Both politicians have denied such involvement. Magistrates have known about this secret account for more than a decade since it appeared in documents found when searching for Mr Licio Gelli, the disgraced head of the powerful masonic lodge, P2. Only recently, the account was discovered to be in the name of Mr Silvano Larini, a Milan architect and close friend of Mr Craxi. Mr Larini was last year found to be a key figure in the Socialist illicit money-collecting network and an arrest warrant was issued for alleged corruption. He managed to escape but last Sunday he handed himself over to magistrates after being on the run for eight months. According to Milan magistrates, he has subsequently confirmed the Swiss bank account was in his name and he had allowed it to be used to handle the Dollars 7m which came in two tranches from Calvi. Independent confirmation of Mr Larini's account of these illicit funds was also sought last week by Milan magistrates when they interviewed another mysterious player in the Ambrosiano episode -  Mr Florio Fiorini. At the time of the ENI loans to Ambrosiano, Mr Fiorini was finance director of the state oil concern. He is now in a Swiss jail on charges relating to the fraudulent bankruptcy of his finance group Sasea.</p>

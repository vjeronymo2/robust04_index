The classifications are Class Free, Class A, Class B, and Class C. States or areas that do not meet the minimum standards for Class C are required to be placed under Federal quarantine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The brucellosis Class Free classification is based on a finding of no known brucellosis in cattle for the 12 months preceding classification as Class Free. The Class C classification is for States or areas with the highest rate of brucellosis. Class B and Class A fall between these two extremes. Restrictions on moving cattle interstate become less stringent as a State approaches or achieves Class Free status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The standards for the different classifications of States or areas entail maintaining (1) a cattle herd infection rate not to exceed a stated level during 12 consecutive months; (2) a rate of infection in the cattle population (based on the percentage of brucellosis reactors found in the Market Cattle Identification (MCI) program_a program of testing at stockyards, farms, ranches, and slaughter establishments) not to exceed a stated level; (3) a surveillance system that includes testing of dairy herds, participation of all recognized slaughtering establishments in the MCI program, identification and monitoring of herds at high risk of infection (including herds adjacent to infected herds and herds from which infected animals have been sold or received), and having an individual herd plan in effect within a stated number of days after the herd owner is notified of the finding of brucellosis in a herd he or she owns; and (4) minimum procedural standards for administering the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before the effective date of this interim rule, California was classified as a Class A State because of its herd infection rate and its MCI reactor prevalence rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To attain and maintain Class Free status, a State or area must (1) remain free from field strain Brucella abortus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> infection for 12 consecutive months or longer; (2) maintain for 12 consecutive months an MCI reactor prevalence rate not to exceed one reactor per 2,000 cattle tested (0.050 percent); and (3) have a specified surveillance system, as described above, including an approved individual herd plan in effect within 15 days of locating the source herd or recipient herd.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing the brucellosis program records for California, we have concluded that the State meets the standards for Class Free status. Therefore, we are removing California from the list of Class A States in &sect;78.41(b) and adding it to the list of Class Free States in &sect;78.41(a). This action relieves certain restrictions on moving cattle interstate from California.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

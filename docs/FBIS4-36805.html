			<p>BFN     [Text] A new three-hour cease-fire initiative was announced  by Sanaa at dawn today. Sanaa announced the initiative at the  request of Yemeni Deputy Prime Minister Brigadier General  Mujahid Abu-Shawarib who is in Paris. This came in an official  statement distributed to the press in Sanaa at dawn today. The  statement says that the Yemeni Socialist Party leaders submitted  this request to Brig. Gen. Abu-Shawarib, who referred the  request to the command in Sanaa, which gave its approval. The  cease-fire is for only three hours from 0600 local time [0300  GMT].    The statement adds that if the southerners do not abide by  the cease-fire during the specified period, the northern forces  will resume their military operations.    Brig. Gen. Mujahid Abu-Shawarib is playing the role of  mediator between the two warring parties in Yemen to have them  hold a dialogue.</p>

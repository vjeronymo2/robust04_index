			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> MOSCOW FORMS A RUDIMENTARY EXCHANGE FOR COMMODITIES  </P> <P> The city of Moscow has formed a rudimentary commodities exchange as the first  step toward a market economy.  </P> <P> The exchange was created in an attempt to improve the distribution of  desperately needed goods, such as construction materials and high-technology  equipment, the city's mayor said at a news conference Saturday.  </P> <P> It is a precursor to the dismantling of the centralized economic system, which  officials say has taken the city to the brink of collapse.  </P> <P> "We have two enemies to creating a market economy," said Mayor Gavriil Popov, a  respected reform economist. "One is the shadow economy and the other is the  administrative system that rules our centralized economy. A commodities  exchange will strike a blow to both."  </P> <P> The exchange is the first fulfillment of reforms promised under the city's new  leadership, elected in March. It is designed to serve as a go-between, bringing  buyers and sellers together outside the constrictions of the centrally planned  "command-administrative" system.  </P> <P> Critics say the poor distribution of goods and materials is among the most  glaring weak points of the Soviet economy.  </P> <P> Popov has vowed that the city will stand in the vanguard of democratic change  -- even if it means colliding with the Kremlin.  </P> <P> Asked if the central authorities would disapprove of the commodities exchange,  Popov replied: "Well, let's put it this way: No one is asking their  permission."  </P></p>

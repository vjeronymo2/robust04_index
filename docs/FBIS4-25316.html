			<p>BFN     [Text] Guiyang, June 9 (XINHUA) -- China will invest 1  billion yuan in highway projects in 21 provinces and autonomous  regions in central and western China.    The funds will be issued as payments instead of relief funds  to farmers for their work on highway construction projects in  poverty-stricken areas.    Yang Zhong, deputy director of the leading group of the  aid-the-poor projects under the State Council, recently noted at  a conference in Guiyang that it is one of the measures taken by  the central government to help improve communications conditions  in poverty-stricken areas.    Since 1985, the departments of communications in the related  provinces and autonomous regions have constructed about 150,000  kilometers of highways in rural areas, including roads for farm  machines.    The highways link more than 1,500 towns and 10,000 villages.    According to Yang, now there are still 1,700 townships and  more than 17,000 villages in China which have no access to  highways.    He said that most of the villages and townships are in the  poverty-stricken regions in the central and western parts of the  country.    He said that the construction of highways should be placed  at  the top of the economic development agenda in poverty-stricken  regions. Such projects are expected to promote the growth of the  market economy and break the isolation of the regions.</p>

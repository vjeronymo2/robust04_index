			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Unilever responds to ACT change by lifting final payout UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer group, yesterday became the second company to propose an increased dividend to compensate investors for changes announced last week in the chancellor's budget. Unilever said it would recommend at its annual meeting next month that UK shareholders' final dividend for 1992 be lifted from a previously announced 15.6p to 16.13p. The increase would ensure shareholders who do not pay tax will not lose out because of lower rates of advanced corporation tax. The increase will have the effect of maintaining the gross dividend at 20.8p. The increase was prompted by an equalisation agreement in place between Unilever plc of the UK and Unilever NV of the Netherlands. Under the agreement, the two companies' dividends are kept in line and ACT in the UK is treated as part of the dividend. The recommended final dividend for Unilever NV is unchanged at Fl 4.30. Although Unilever is unusual because of its capital structure, its decision to lift the payout will add to calls for other companies to follow suit. This follows last week's move by Rentokil, the environmental services company, which increased its final dividend because of the Budget changes. Other cross-border joint ventures may also be affected. Royal Dutch/Shell, the international oil company, refused to comment on its dividend policy. While it has a similar dividend distribution arrangement to Unilever, Royal Dutch/Shell's ACT question would be overshadowed by other factors, such as currency translation. Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch publishing merger which started trading on January 1, is still considering the impact of the ACT changes on its dividend policy. Under the merger agreement, the two companies intend to recommend equivalent gross dividends based on an equalisation ratio from October this year. Lex, Page 22</p>

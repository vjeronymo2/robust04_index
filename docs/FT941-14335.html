			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (20): Enter blue-chip Argentaria - The first four institutions on the Madrid stock exchange in terms of market capitalisation are all controlled by the government / Country Analyses - Spain There was no whispering, back-door entry by Argentaria into the FT500. The Spanish banking group came in with a bang that shot it into the upper echelons. Previously unlisted, through being wholly state-owned, Argentaria placed 25 per cent of its equity on the market in May, and then another 25 per cent in November, and displaced Banco Bilbao Vizcaya as the largest Spanish bank in terms of market capitalisation. May's Argentaria One had netted Pta120bn in a heavily subscribed placement, and the combination of unsatisfied investor demand and the bank's strong third-quarter figures ensured a further Pta170bn for the Spanish exchequer when Argentaria Two was offered six months later. With Argentaria now recognised as a solid blue chip, the top Spanish companies at present have a distinctly 'statified' air about them: the first four institutions on the Madrid stock exchange in terms of market capitalisation - the telecommunications group Telefonica; the electrical utility, Endesa; Repsol, the energy corporation; and Argentaria - are all controlled by the government. Together, they represent 35 per cent of the Bolsa's total capitalisation. Argentaria's chairman, Francisco Luzon, says he would like to avoid tapping the markets again this year, although he concedes that the decision whether to make a further share offering depends on the government. He hopes to consolidate a business which saw a 30 per cent rise in operating profit in the first nine months of last year and a 6 per cent rise in its deposits. There is nothing, of course, to stop the government reducing its equity in Argentaria to below 50 per cent while still controlling the group. It did exactly that in April last year at Repsol, when it placed 13 per cent of the energy conglomerate and lowered the state shareholding to 41 per cent, realising Pta110bn in the process. At Telefonica, the government maintains its control over domestic communications with a 32 per cent shareholding. However, the eyes of most fund managers scrutinising Spanish companies are likely to be focused in the coming months on Endesa, where the government is expected to sell off part of its 67 per cent shareholding. Endesa, long a favoured Spanish stock, is viewed by analysts as more attractive still, as a result of a government-sponsored reorganisation of the domestic electricity sector that will come into operation this year. The overhaul includes a fine-tuning of the pricing system and a series of asset sales by the more indebted utilities to more financially healthy ones such as Endesa. The state-owned utility will lose the price advantages that it has enjoyed, but will gain far more through the acquisitions. Essentially, it will increase its retail market strength and improve a generating mix that has, in the past, been over-dependent on coal. The final approval of the electricity sector's overhaul could well be followed by a decision to reduce the government's equity in Endesa. The fortunes of Telefonica and of Repsol will also be closely monitored, for both face challenges in the months ahead. Telefonica's is centred on the impact of deregulation; while Repsol, which has already waged the liberalisation battle, is finalising details for the purchase of Enagas, Spain's monopoly gas supplier, and is set to create one of the biggest natural gas companies in Europe. Telefonica is putting on a brave face as it prepares for competition on its home turf, and this could well be justified on account of the government's apparent determination to protect the company by delaying as long as possible the implementation of deregulatory measures drawn up the EU. The company claims that it will hold on to a market share of at least 75 per cent of the deregulated services, and that it will at most lose 4 per cent of its revenue. The chairman, Candido Velazquez, has nonetheless taken competition on board, and has signed up JP Morgan as a key partner to assist Telefonica's bid for strategic alliances and foreign acquisitions. The Spanish company announced last month that it was undertaking 'intensive co-operation' with Unisource, and this is viewed as a first step towards taking an equity stake in the joint venture that links the telecom companies of the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. Meanwhile, Telefonica is establishing itself in Latin America, where it has holdings in telecom operators in Chile, Argentina and Puerto Rico. Repsol continues to be highly profitable. It reported a 27.5 per cent rise in operating profits to Pta112.6bn in the first nine months of last year, brought its chemical division back into profit in the third quarter, and posted a 63 per cent profit increase to Pta27bn for Gas Natural, the gas supplier which it controls and 45 per cent owns. Repsol's healthy balance sheet is more than useful as it prepares to have the group acquire, through Gas Natural, the government-owned distributor Enagas in a deal worth more than Pta80bn.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Spanish companies by market capitalisation  -----------------------------------------------------------------------        Company                       Dollars m   FT500 rank    Sector  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1     Telefonica                      11118.6           45       223  2     Endesa                          10595.4           48       221  3     Repsol                           8732.3           66       212  4     Banco Bilbao Vizcaya             6060.3           92       112  5     Banco de Santander               5721.9          101       112  6     Iberdrola                        5399.8          106       221  7     Argentaria                       5248.8          107       112  8     Banco Central Hispanoamericano   5038.5          113       112  9     Banco Popular Espanol            3497.7          160       112 10     Banco Exterior                   3321.2          171       112  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 11     Banesto Group                    3139.8          184       112 12     Gas Natural                      2143.7          260       222 13     Centros Comerciales Pryca        2087.4          264       493 14     Autopistas                       2013.0          273       304 15     Fomento de Construcciones        1745.2          312       611 16     Compania Espanola de Pet.        1506.5          356       214 17     Bankinter                        1343.1          398       112 18     Sevillana de Electricidad        1221.5          419       221 19     Mapfre (Corp)                    1139.6          438       151 20     Fecsa                            1080.1          449       221 21     Union Electrica-Fenosa           1075.7          451       221 22     Tabacalera                       1054.9          464       425 23     Dragados y Construcciones         933.5          496       613  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

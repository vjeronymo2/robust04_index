			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "Technology Transfer Increasingly Sought"] </F>   [Text] China, stands poised to enter the global economy by  exchanging more technology with foreign companies.    This aspiration was expressed in Beijing yesterday by Ren  Jianxin president of the Supreme People's Court, in his speech  to 400 participants of the Licensing Executives Society (LES)  International Conference.    LES International, established in 1974 in San Francisco, is  a  global non-governmental body specialized in the study and  promotion of technology trade that covers the transfer of  copyrights, trademarks, patents, know-how and trade secrets.    United Nations estimates predict the world's technology  trade  will hit $230 billion in 1995, compared with $50 billion 10  years ago.    "The world's economic trend has provided many Asian  countries, including China, with an excellent opportunity to  develop their own national economies," Ren said.    "Technology transfer and licensing, closely linked with  economic development, shall have broad prospects in a region  with great vitality."    Between 1979 and 1993, China struck over 7,000 technology  trade contracts with foreign countries valued at almost $48  billion, according to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Co-operation.    Last year alone saw 493 technology import deals worth $6.11  billion and 141 technology export deals worth $2.15 billion.    The imports included large equipment, licensing, technical  services and consultancy for product design, technique and  manufacturing know-how.    Ren also noted that China has developed a sound legal system  for protecting intellectual property rights.    China's rewritten Patent Law and Trademark Law has offered  extended protection. Copyright protection has also been brought  into line with international norms, and the security of trade  secrets has been stipulated in the Anti-Unethical Competition  Law enforced in December 1993.</p>

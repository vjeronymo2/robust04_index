			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Message from PDK president Khieu Samphan to FUNCINPEC </F> chairman Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh in reply to the  latter's 8 January message issued on 15 January; place not given  -- read by announcer]    [Text] Most humbly to Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh,  chairman of the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an  Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] party,  Phnom Penh:    Highness, I would like to express sincere thanks to you for  graciously sending me a cable dated 8 January. In the spirit of  promoting a prompt process, I ask your permission to inform you  of the following:    1. In the message dated 8 January 1994, you wrote that you  support the five-point initative of his majesty the king and  that all five points should be simultaneously implemented.  However, the other side has not yet accepted his majesty the  king's five-point guideline.    A. The Phnom Penh faction continues to demand that the party  of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] fulfill its three preconditions  first, which are cease-fire, surrender of the liberated zones,  and dissolution of the army. Moreover, they have demanded that  the PDK be integrated into their military and civilian  structures which, basically, are the communist Vietnamese  structures set up since 1979.    B. Their so-called need for constitutional amendments is  merely a deception, and it means that they have already imposed  a condition on the negotiations.    C. On the battlefields themselves, they have launched  large-scale offensives in an attempt to crush the forces of  Democratic Kampuchea [DK] and block genuine national  reconciliation and they have talked about nothing but fight,  fight, and fight.    Such actions cannot promote genuine national reconciliation  because they are not a genuine rallying of national forces but  an attempt to force the PDK into the cage that the communist  Vietnamese have prepared since they first invaded Cambodia and  to make the PDK commit suicide.    I would like to take this opportunity to inform your  highness  that the PDK is supporting the five-point guideline of high  majesty the king not to get this or that position for its own  benefit within the government or in this or that ministry. The  truth is that the serious situation facing our nation and people  at the present calls for all national forces, including DK, to  take part in solving it by playing a role in the government and  in an army that truly belongs to the nation known as the Khmer  Royal Armed Forces.    The five-point initiative of his majesty the king stems from  his wisdom, sagacity, and years of political experience, and he  clearly understands that the situation requires that there be a  solution not just by giving this or that position to this or  that personality without according him any possibilities or  rights to contribute to solving the nation and people's serious  problems.    2. Concerning the technical group, I would like to propose  that under the current circumstances it is desirable to allow  the technical group to function as soon as possible without  giving it any name, just as your highness graciously proposed to  me on 17 December 1993, and with the participation of a  representative of the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party. This  is not just for form's sake. It also bears a political  significance. If the technical group functions according to any  formulas other than that described on 17 December 1993, even if  it uses his majesty the king's five-point initiative as the  basis for discussions, the spirit and the wishes of his majesty  the king would not be fulfilled. Only by proceeding in the  manner agreed upon between your highnness and I on 17 December  1993 can we meet and discuss ways to bring about early and  lasting peace.    3. I sincerely inform your highness of the above because the  desire and wishes of the PDK and myself are to see your highness  and the FUNCINPEC party, along with other national resistance  forces, enjoy full capacity and right to perform the work in  accordance with your patriotic ideal. The overwhelming majority  of our nation and people who gave their votes to your highness  and the FUNCINPEC party also have these same desire and wishes.    Very humbly yours.    [Dated] 15 January 1994    [Signed] Khieu Samphan, president of the PDK</p>

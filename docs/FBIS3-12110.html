These transactions  involved the purchase of $2.8 billion in securities to be used  as collateral for the agreement with creditor banks.    According to Cardoso, the absolute secrecy with which the  transactions were made was due to the need to "protect the  country from speculators." Malan, who suggested the securities'  purchase to Cardoso, explained to senators that the government  deemed it advisable to hedge against a possible U.S. Treasury  refusal to place a special issue of securities for Brazil on the  market -- which was what indeed occurred.    The Senate -- which is co-responsible for negotiating the  rescheduling of Brazil's external debt -- was not notified of  the transactions made by the BC on the secondary international  markets. According to Cardoso, only himself, Malan, and BC  Foreign Area Director Gustavo Franco knew about the "hedge"  [preceding word in English] (protection) strategy. The minister  neither said nor was asked whether President Itamar Franco was  informed about the collateral's secret purchase.    Cardoso authorized the BC to purchase collateral last  October  or November on the condition that the securities constituted a  good deal regardless of their possible use in the  debt-rescheduling agreement. A source close to the BC reported  that the 30-year-maturity U.S. T-bills that were purchased had  been on the market for some time.    Senators voiced distrust about this event until 23 March.  Senator Espiridiano Amin (PPR-SC) [Progressive Renewal  Party-Santa Catarina] went as far as accusing Cardoso of using  the debt-rescheduling agreement for electoral purposes. On 24  March, however, the atmosphere was calm again and all the  members of Congress questioned endorsed Cardoso's decision not  to disclose details about the transactions -- cost and interest  rate -- before reaching an agreement with creditor banks on 15  April.    According to Senator Jose Focaga (PMDB-RS) [Brazilian  Democratic Movement Party-Rio Grande do Sul], rapporteur of  Resolution No. 96 that ratified the agreement's terms, the  T-bills' secret purchase does not harm the Senate's guidance.  Malan believes the agreement approved by senators did not  entail the U.S. Treasury's special issue.    Malan termed "pure speculation" estimates to the effect that  the BC had to pay between $60 million and $80 million more for  the collateral as a result of purchasing it directly on the  market. According to Malan, speculators were not able to detect  the BC action in time. In any case, Malan considered it much  more important that the BC strategy enabled working out an  agreement with creditor banks. Malan made it clear that the U.S.  Treasury will not issue T-bills especially for Brazil unless the  latter reaches an agreement with the IMF.</p>

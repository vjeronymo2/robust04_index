			<p>BFN     [Text] Vice-premier and Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam sent  a letter to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali regarding  an important measure [chungdaehan chochi] taken by the DPRK  Government recently to establish a new peace guarantee system  [saeroun pyonghwa pojang chegye] on the Korean peninsula. The  letter is as follows:    His Excellency Butrus Butrus-Ghali, UN Secretary General:    Esteemed His Excellency Secretary General,    Paying my respects to Your Excellency, I send this letter to  you regarding an important measure taken by the government of  the Republic recently to establish a new peace guarantee system  on the Korean peninsula.    As you know already, the DPRK Government, through a  statement  of the Foreign Ministry on 28 April, proposed to the United  States to hold negotiations to establish a new peace guarantee  system that would replace the old armistice mechanism.    As you confirmed personally during your visit to our country  toward the end of last year, an unstable [pulanjonghan] state of  truce, neither peace nor war, has lasted for over 40 years on  the Korean peninsula.    The situation on the Korean peninsula has become all the  more  strained [kinjang haejigo issumyo] and the possibility of a  total armed conflict is gradually increasing [chonmyon muryok  chungdolui kanungsongun chomjom to kojigo issumnida] with the  amassing of huge reinforcements in and around South Korea and  the stepping up of military actions against us on the pretext of  the nuclear issue by the United States from the start of this  year.    The Korean Armistice Agreement and its observation mechanism  should have controlled such actions, but they have failed to  play any role due to the U.S. side's systematic acts of division  and destruction [chegyejogin yurin malsal haengwiro hayo].    In 1956, the United States expelled the Neutral Nations  Inspection teams stationed at appropriate ports of entry under  Paragraph C, Article 2 of the Korean Armistice Agreement from  the area under its control and, on June 21, 1957, it  unilaterally renounced Subparagraph 13d of the Korean Armistice  Agreement which stipulates that the introduction into Korea of  reinforcing combat equipment shall be ceased. Since then, the  United States has shipped sophisticated weapons including over  1,000 pieces of nuclear weapons into South Korea without any  restrictions and it has become all the more undisguised of late  in its shipments of such combat equipment.    While working to systematically destroy [chegyejoguro pagoe  hayo odaga] the military armistice mechanism, the U.S. side  completely paralyzed [wanjonhi mabi sikyossumnida] it on March  25, 1991, by unilaterally appointing a South Korean serviceman  as the senior member of the UN Forces side to the Military  Armistice Commission [MAC] without any legal justification or  qualification in view of the Armistice Agreement.    Present-day reality in which the basic provisions of the  Armistice Agreement that should guarantee peace on the Korean  peninsula have been scrapped [pagi toeyotko] and the armistice  observation mechanism now remains in name only, requires that  decisive measures [kyolchongjok taechaek] be taken to establish  a new security guarantee system to save the situation [sataerul  susubhago] which has reached a danger line [wihom kyeson] and to  prevent arms buildup and the outbreak of another war.    In fact, the Korean Armistice Agreement signed on 27 July  1953, was a tentative measure taken to stop combat actions  between the two hostile sides [kyojon ssangbangsaiui] in  anticipation of future conversion into a peace agreement.    Therefore, the adoption of resolution 3390-B, calling for  the  dissolution of the UN command and the replacement of the  Armistice Agreement by a peace agreement at the 30th session of  the UN General Assembly in 1975, was a very just measure [maeu  chongdanghan chochi] to ensure a lasting peace [hangujogin  pyonghwa] on the Korean peninsula and it opened a bright  prospect for the final solution [chonggukchok haegyol] of the  Korean question.    The DPRK Government has taken initiatives and proposed  negotiations on many occasions to ensure durable peace [kongohan  pyonghwa] on the Korean peninsula and made tireless efforts  [kkujunhi noryok hayossumnida] to put them into effect.    Nonaggression was vowed by the North and the South through  the agreement on reconciliation, nonaggression, cooperation and  exchange between the North and the South adopted in 1992 as a  result of our positive efforts. But we are still in a state of  truce vis-a-vis the United States which keeps its Armed Forces  stationed in South Korea.    The UN command, recognized as a signatory to the Armistice  Agreement, serves the strategic aim of the United States to  isolate and stifle [korip apsal] us and establish control over  Asia and the Pacific region, which is an aim which has nothing  to do with the UN mission to keep peace in South Korea. I  think, therefore, that there is no condition for the U.S. Forces  present in South Korea to act as the UN Forces any longer.    Taking into consideration the actual conditions where a  grave  situation threatening peace [pyonghwarul wihyop hanun omjunghan  sataega] had been created on the Korean peninsula but there was  no rational institutional mechanism capable of controlling it,  the DPRK Government proposed to the U.S. side to negotiate the  establishment of a new durable peace guarantee system that will  replace the old armistice mechanism and, at the same time, took  practical measures, recalling all the members of the Korean  People's Army [KPA] side from the MAC, setting up the KPA  mission at Panmunjom as a new mechanism for negotiations with  the U.S. Forces side and of appointing the chief and members of  the mission.    This is, to all intents and purposes, an innovative and  well-intentioned step [hyoksinjogigo sonuijogin chochi] to make  a breakthrough in establishing a new security guarantee system  for peace on the Korean peninsula and a peaceloving step that  took into account the publicly accepted international usage  whereby some countries abandoned the relationship of hostilities  after the Second World War and declared peace relationship  instead.    I think that the United Nations must pay due attention to  our  proposal in the sense of liquidating its unpleasant past affairs  [pulmihan kwagorul chongsan hanun] with our country, its member  state, and in the sense of fulfilling its resolution to replace  the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement.    The nuclear issue over which some countries are now making a  fuss is, in fact, not a question to be discussed by the United  Nations, but one that must be solved through DPRK-U.S. dialogue  [chomi taehwa].    If the United Nations, yields to the unjust demand  [pudanghan  yogudaero] of some countries and attempts to resolve the nuclear  issue on the Korean peninsula in such a manner as to impose  sanctions on someone else, it will, no doubt, bring catastrophic  consequences menacing peace [pyonghwarul wihyop hanun  pagukchogin hukwarul kajo oriranun koson] in Asia and the rest  of the world, not to speak of the Korean peninsula.    With a view to accelerating [taguchigi wihayo] the process  of  replacing the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement in  accordance with the resolution of the 30th General Assembly, the  United Nations must take a practical step to dismantle the UN  command, a framework of the old armistice structure.    In conclusion, I express the hope that Your Excellency will  pay particular attention to our peace overture to establish a  new peace guarantee system through DPRK-U.S. negotiations [chomi  hyopsang] and actively cooperate in its materialization.</p>

IN THE SPIRIT OF  VIGOROUS DISCUSSION OF THE ISSUES, HERE IS A SELECTION OF LETTERS THAT  DISAGREES WITH US.;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES: PROPS. 128, 130, 138  </P> <P> According to my sample ballot, Prop. 130 wins the prize for the highest cost  bond issue.  </P> <P> The total is $1,327,000,000!  </P> <P> For the $1.3 billion, Prop. 130 proposes to buy 3,000 acres of something called  the "Headwaters Forest." It would be outrageous to allow Earth First! (one of  the sponsors of Prop. 130) to siphon off this many taxpayer dollars for its  selfish purposes when there are so many unmet needs in our society.  </P> <P> PETER GANAHL  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

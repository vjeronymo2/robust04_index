			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 15, RIA -- Satisfied with the talks  with Chinese colleagues, Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the State Duma  of the Federal Assembly of Russia, pointed to the importance of  restoring Russo-Chinese parliamentary contacts at a briefing at  the end of his delegation's second day in China.    "The talks are conducted in a businesslike and serious  atmosphere," he said. The Russian delegation "is accumulating  information vital for cooperation." The sides expressed  interest in developing contacts between the north-eastern part  of China and Siberia, exchanged opinion on international  problems and discussed the situation in the planet's hot spots.    Rybkin said that good relations developed between the State  Duma and the Russian Government in the past four months. He  also said about potential candidates to the post of the Russian  president: "We will continue to be short of leaders until we  establish elections of administration heads." When asked if he  would run for the post, Rybkin replied that many people don't  suspect the burden of responsibilities of the president.</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (1): Oil for the world's investment machinery - Global custodians have moved on from the task of merely keeping securities safe. They are now in the business of asset administration Global custody, once a sleepy backwater of the banking industry where clerks endeavoured to keep securities safe, is no more. Instead, it is a global multibillion-dollar business which provides the oil for the world's investment machinery and the glue which holds the system together. Indeed, custodians say, their sector is saddled with a misnomer. 'We are really in the asset administration business,' said Valentine Feerick, head of global trust and custody at Mellon Trust Europe. 'We need to be able to play a role from the point where somebody agrees to buy a security to the point where somebody sells it. For international banks such as Mellon, the core 'master trust' business is relegated to a mere housekeeping activity. The real business is up-to-the-minute information provision for clients whose investments are crossing international borders and time zones at an alarming rate. In addition to the traditional services of cash and foreign exchange management, dividend collection, and monitoring corporate actions, clients want custodians to handle securities lending into esoteric markets, investment accounting and performance measurement and attribution. 'What our customers will look to us to provide is valuable information that will help them make the right decisions about their asset strategies,' said Marshall Carter, chairman and chief executive officer at State Street Bank, one of the world's largest global custodians. Competition in future years for banks such as State Street may well come not from other banks looking for a slice of a lucrative new business but from leading information providers such as Reuters and Bloomberg which already are adept at sending information around the world at low cost, Mr Carter said. Customers will want their custodian not only to collect mountains of data for them, but to distill it into a readily useable form. Charles Cassidy, who runs State Street's European custody business, points out that regulators' efforts to curb risks in securities settlement mean that clients need even more from their custodian. Earlier this year, the US Federal Reserve began to charge banks for their intra-day borrowings, a cost which has now been passed on to institutional investors. 'Money now has a value during the day and information about money now has a value during the day,' he said, noting that clients want their custodian to monitor their borrowings minute by minute to cut the cost of credit. While clients are demanding an increasingly sophisticated product, they have been able to exploit fierce competition in the business which is driving pricing down further. The long-envisioned shake-out has yet to materialise. However, there are signs that some institutions which provided their own custody are now re-thinking that strategy - a move which could ease competitive pressures. Earlier this month, Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer and a leading international investment manager, caused a rumble by quietly asking 10 international banks to bid to manage its Pounds 40bn portfolio of UK and international securities which it handles in-house. It is the largest single contract since the California Public Employee Retirement System sought bids for its business in early 1992. David Hanson, director at Prudential Portfolio Managers, said the Pru simply made the decision that while it meets its own custodial needs perfectly well at present, the future requirement for investment in technology had caused a re-think. Custody, he said, is simply not Prudential's core business and the insurer would rather concentrate on what it is good at - investment. However, there are few signs that third-party custodians are retreating from what is for some a very profitable business. Robert Binney, head of Chase Manhattan's European custody business, says that custody is the single largest contributor to Chase's profits for the Europe, Africa and Middle East regions. Morgan Stanley, one of the few investment banks to establish a significant toehold in custody, says that 1993 was a 'banner year' for profits in its custodial business. In 1994, profits are already up 60 per cent. It is the fourth most significant contributor to group profits for the bank. 'Everybody is talking about a shake-out in the custody business. But I'm at a loss to see who is getting out,' said Mr Cassidy. 'But what we do see is a tiering of the business.' John Lee, a partner at Lee Schwartz Associates, says that a group of 10 international custodial banks now account for 80 to 90 per cent of the business worldwide. A further 70 to 80 banks may service significant parts of individual countries or regions. Michael Grass, head of global custody at Barclays Bank, predicts that the degree of annual expenditure on technology and the number of new markets for which there is a demand for service mean that no bank can afford a comprehensive service. Instead, 'we will see alliances. Banks will say, 'Look, you offer this service and I'll offer that service and we'll face the market together'.' Already, there are signs that Mr Grass's prediction is coming true. Leading custodians are reporting increasing interest in so-called 'white labelling', the provision of their service under the brand name of the end-client's own custodian. The arrangement allows banks which cannot invest in the necessary technology to retain a long-time relationship with a client while providing high-technology custodians with an additional source of revenue. Meanwhile, if there is any trend which has shaped the business in the past year, custodians say, it has been the pace of expansion into cross-border investment, particularly from the US which has traditionally been reluctant to look overseas. That move abroad has taxed the abilities of custodians, particularly in emerging markets where the flood of foreign investments has swamped the system in some countries. According to InterSec Research, a US-based consulting firm, US pension funds sharply increased their international holdings to 7.4 per cent of all assets by the end of 1993, up from 4.7 per cent the year before. And despite weakness in equities markets worldwide, the trend continued into 1994 with the value of US pension assets invested abroad rising by a further Dollars 22bn in the first half of the year. Most of that went into equities. And, significantly for the global custodians, there has been a considerable increase in investment in emerging markets where settlement systems and custodial services have often been rudimentary. Baring Securities is predicting that by 2010, roughly 45 per cent of the world's stock market capitalisation will be in emerging markets. If there had been any doubts about the need for effective custodial services in these emerging markets, the example of India would have erased them. Earlier this year, custodians operating there had to close their doors to new foreign investment and set limits for existing customers as the paper-based system creaked to a virtual standstill. And despite the introduction of a number of reforms intended to ease the paper crunch, custody in India is still threatening the ability of foreigners to invest there. GSCS Benchmarks, a publication which tracks the performance of custodians in each country, estimates that by the third quarter of 1994, three out of every four trades were still failing to settle on time. 'Simply stated, the situation in that market has reached a point where any prudent fiduciary, whether a money manager or a custodian, should be advising clients not to invest there,' GSCS said in its latest bulletin. India is not alone, GSCS says. Malaysia is showing signs of proving equally problematic and even some mature markets, such as Japan, have relatively high levels of trades which fail to settle on time. Overall, the pressures on custodians to service arcane markets and meet increasingly sophisticated needs is taxing the industry's imagination and its ability to finance further technological development. Long-term, only a handful of international operators are likely to rise to the challenge.</p>

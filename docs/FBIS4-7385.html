			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Text" of premier's response to bishop's proposals given to </F> Bishop Nguyen Minh Nhat by Vu Quang, the chairman of the  Religious Affairs Committee]    [Text] On 3 March 1994, Vu Quang, the chairman of the  government's Religious Affairs Committee met and worked with  bishops on the Standing Committee of the Vietnam Council of  Bishops headed by Bishop Nguyen Minh Nhat, the council  president. As ordered by the premier, the chairman of the  Religious Affairs Committee gave Bishop Nguyen Minh Nhat  Document No 46 CV/TGCP of 17 February, which gives the premier's  response to "the proposals made by the Vietnam Council of  Bishops" at the youth conference of the Council of Bishops held  in October 1993. The following is the complete text of this  document.    Sincerely, Bishop Nguyen Minh Nhat, Chairman of the Vietnam  Council of Bishops    Sirs:    On "the proposals of the Council of Bishops" that were sent  to the premier on the occasion of the recent youth conference of  the Council of Bishops, the premier has asked the Religious  Affairs Committee to inform you of his ideas as follows:    1. As for traveling around to perform the duties of bishops  and priests, the government has always tried to facilitate this.  Decree 69 and Circular 02, for example, state that "bishops who  go to carry out tasks in a diocese and priests who go to carry  out tasks in a parish for which they are responsible do not have  to request permission."    2. Assigning and transferring priests in a diocese is to be  done based on the work requirements of the church, but in order  to facilitate control by the local authorities, matters must be  discussed and an agreement must be reached with the local  authorities.    3. As for publishing houses to print religious publications,  according to the Publishing Law and decrees of the government  and the circulars of the Ministry of Culture that provide  guidance in implementing the law, the Ministry of Culture will  discuss things with the various religious groups in order to  designate a number of publishing houses and facilitate the  printing of religious publications.    4. The premier welcomes the contributions made by the  dioceses, parishes, and orders to educating our children and  youths. The state has given attention to expanding education,  has implemented policies to vary the forms of training and  instruction, and has encouraged the opening of private and  semi-private schools along with the public schools. The dioceses  and orders can send people for training and contribute money,  materials and equipment, and instructional materials to these  schools.    5. As for religious orders, Decree 69 states that orders can  accept people into a monastery. However, in order to facilitate  things, those people are responsible for completing the ordinary  administrative control procedures with the authorities where the  monastery is located and in the place where they reside.    6. As for priests who have returned after a period of  training, the government has taken steps to integrate these  people into the life of the local people. Priests who have  returned from studying can carry out their religious duties if a  bishop gives his guarantee and the local authorities recognize  them as good citizens. The government's Religious Affairs  Committee has provided specific guidelines on this point.    7. The government has also facilitated attending a seminary  or entering a monastery. This is the same as for other citizens  who attend a government school. Circular 02 states that people  who want to attend an official school or enter a monastery or  convent are Vietnamese citizens who must adhere to the policies  and obey the laws of the state.    8. As for opening the Hue seminary, the government approved  this in 1980, but the Council of Bishops and the Hue Diocese  were not able to do this. Today, if they are able, they can  carry out the procedures and open this seminary.    9. Based on the agreement between the church and the local  authorities, the facilities of the Dalat Pontifical Institute  are presently being used by the Nuclear Research Institute on  behalf of the national interest. The government will review this  matter.    10. In preparing to enroll people in a seminary, the  dioceses  with potential students can discuss things with the existing  seminaries in order to open preparatory classes at the  seminaries. But the important thing is that to ensure that the  preparatory classes are of good quality, the contents, programs,  and rules of those classes must be prepared carefully.    11. As for places of worship and places for making donations  and the matter of repairing and building churches and chapels,  the premier's Directive 379 and the circular guiding the  implementation of this directive have provided concrete  guidelines. The bishops, priests, and Catholic population must  discuss things with the various-echelon authorities in order to  thoroughly understand and implement the things stipulated by the  state.    The above points are the views of the premier in response to  the proposals made by the Council of Bishops. The premier hopes  that in carrying out specific tasks, there will be frank  discussions and exchanges of opinions with a constructive spirit  of solidarity among all the parties concerned in order to  maintain the ordinary religious activities of Catholics and  create favorable conditions for people to participate in  building and defending the fatherland.</p>

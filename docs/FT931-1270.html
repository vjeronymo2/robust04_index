			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Swansea barrage completed SWANSEA yesterday marked the completion of a river barrage, the first such barrage in the UK, with a campaign to promote the way in which the city is changing its legacy of industrial dereliction. The barrage, built at a cost of Pounds 17m with Pounds 6.5m coming from the European regional development fund, is at the mouth of the river Tawe. At low tide the river has been a muddy eyesore. Water is now retained by the barrage for four miles upstream, improving its appearance and, the council hopes, its attraction to developers which it is seeking for 23 sites near the river. Locks allow boats to enter a 600-berth marina at all states of the tide, and a fish ladder enables fish to swim upstream to spawn. Seals have already been observed above the fish pass. The barrage, which has to cope with a tidal range of 8.6 metres, one of the highest in the world, also generates up to 100kw of electricity for the national grid.</p>

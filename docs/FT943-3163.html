			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Post-Meridien time begins: Forte's control of French chain propels it to new markets Throughout this week, the French and UK press confidently predicted that Forte had won control of Meridien, the international hotel chain owned by Air France. The only doubter was Forte itself. The UK hotel and restaurants group's caution partly reflected its fear of the lobbying power of Accor, its French competitor and rival bidder for Meridien. Earlier this year, Accor delayed a decision by Air France to sell the chain to Forte, arguing that it should remain in French hands. Forte also did not want to be seen as having failed again. Earlier this year it failed to win Ciga, the Italian luxury hotel group, which went to ITT Sheraton of the US. This week, Forte's 13-year campaign to take full control of Savoy Hotel, the UK luxury hotel group, was thwarted by the Savoy's two-tier share structure. Mr Rocco Forte, Forte chairman, did, however, win the right to be represented on a three-member chairman's committee. Yesterday's announcement that Forte is to acquire Meridien is a comprehensive victory. By taking over Meridien's 54 hotels, Forte has doubled its international portfolio of first-class establishments. More important, it has taken Forte into the Asia and Pacific regions, the world's fastest-growing business and tourist markets, where Forte has no hotels. Other important markets, such as North America and the Middle East, are strengthened. Business travellers who use a hotel chain in one part of the world increasingly want to use it in another. Winning Meridien was crucial if Forte was to compete in the business market. Getting overall control of the Savoy group might have been more emotionally satisfying for Forte, but from a commercial point of view, the struggle for Meridien was more important. Forte says the purchase might result in an earnings dilution of 5 per cent in the first year. Mr Bruce Jones, an analyst at Smith New Court thought it could be less, given the increase in bookings that should result from a larger chain. Having won his struggle, Mr Forte faces three questions. How will he pay for Meridien, how will he run it and does his group now have the right balance of businesses? The initial cost will be FFr1.09bn (Pounds 130m) for Air France's 57 per cent stake in Meridien. Forte is required to make an offer to minority shareholders. If they all accept the total price would rise to FFr1.9bn. Forte has three options in funding the purchase. The first is to use existing borrowing facilities. Forte has committed but unused facilities of Pounds 500m. A second option is arranging bridging finance until Forte sells its 25 per cent stakes in Gardner Merchant, the contract catering group, and Alpha Airports, the airline catering company. Both disposals are likely during 1995. The third option is a rights issue. Mr Forte said: 'It's an obvious possibility, but it's not necessarily the way we will go.' Successfully managing Meridien will not be easy. Last year, it recorded a net deficit of FFr29.7m. Mr Forte says the chain has suffered from the uncertainty generated by its sale and from its previous status as a nationalised industry. Forte will also have to persuade hotels to stay in the chain. Of the 54 acquired, 44 have other owners and are managed by Meridien under management contract. Mr Forte accepted that some contracts might be lost. If they are, the price Forte pays will be reduced. But he added: 'We're fairly bullish about our position with the owners.' Some have criticised Mr Forte for selling the contract and airline catering businesses. Contract catering in particular is seen as a recession-resistant industry. Mr Forte is adamant that his group was right to concentrate on its hotel and restaurant business. 'It was the best thing we've ever done. We're now concentrating on fewer businesses. In a service business like ours, it's important for the people at the top to be close to the action.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hotels

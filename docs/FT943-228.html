			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Kent to woo French shoppers Kent retailers are launching a campaign to attract French shoppers to the county in an attempt to compensate for the thousands of British shoppers crossing the English Channel in search of cheap alcohol. The Kent Chamber of Commerce, together with retailers including Boots, BHS, Debenhams, Mothercare, Tesco and Texas, ferry company Sealink, and French coach operators, is organising shopping day trips for the French, called 'Passeport pour Canterbury'. Shoppers will be collected from their home town, taken to Calais and across the Channel to Canterbury and Whitfield. Participating stores are offering a special discount to holders of the 'passeport'. The trip will cost just FFr99 (Pounds 12). The campaign will be backed by three weeks of TV advertising, which began yesterday, will be able to take 35,000 shoppers in the first month. If the scheme is successful it will be repeated. Mr Martin Graham, chief executive of Kent Chamber of Commerce, said that while alcoholic drinks and cigarettes were cheaper in France owing to lower duty levels, goods such as food, clothes and DIY goods were cheaper in the UK. Prices have become more competitive since the devaluation of sterling in 1992, and children's clothes are particularly cheap, as they are not subject to VAT in the UK. 'French tourists don't come here with shopping in mind,' Mr Graham said. 'A lot of people come because they want to see Canterbury. Now we have a chance to communicate the advantages of shopping in Kent and make it as easy as possible for French shoppers to give it a try.' The budget for the project is only Pounds 20,000, but Mr Graham said if the full 35,000 French shoppers were to take up the offer it could raise several million pounds in trade. 'It is partly a question of hurt national pride as everyone was going the other way to shop, but few were coming here,' he added. Mr Graham said most of the thousands of British shoppers who crossed the Channel each day on the so-called 'booze run' do not come from Kent, but from further afield. However, he said Kent businesses had not yet taken advantage of the opportunities to attract French shoppers to the UK.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by </F> Yaron Ben-'Ami and political correspondent Udi Segal on the  weekly "In the Current Situation" program; on 7  January--recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Ben-'Ami] Mr. Rabin, do King  Husayn's statements about the possibility of a parting of the  ways with the PLO and separate Jordanian-Israeli negotiations  create a new situation? If that is indeed the case, how does  Israel propose to handle things?    [Rabin] We are trying to establish a dialogue with every  Arab party to the negotiations on the basis of the Madrid peace  conference and the continuation of the talks in Washington. We  do not create any sort of linkage between progress with one Arab  partner out of the four we are negotiating with. I am referring  to Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and the Palestinians. We will make  progress with anyone prepared to talk to us with whom we can  find a common language, without this being conditional on the  state of the negotiations with the other Arab partners.  However, it is worth remembering one thing: There is a  fundamental difference in the negotiations between us and the  three neighboring Arab countries, with whom we seek to sign a  peace treaty, and the negotiations with the Palestinians. The  Declaration of Principles is not a peace treaty, it is merely an  important step toward peace. The title of the paper signed in  Washington faithfully reflects the nature of the agreement  itself: It is an agreement on an interim accord. We still use  old terminology and call it autonomy while the Palestinians and  the formal documents at the Madrid conference and afterwards  speak of arrangements for Palestinian self-rule.    [Segal] Does King Husayn's declaration of a possible parting  of the ways with the PLO perhaps pave the way for a  Jordanian-Palestinian confederation in the permanent settlement?  Is this not cause for concern? What is Israel's attitude  toward this move?    [Rabin] At the moment we are negotiating a peace treaty with  three Arab countries and holding talks on an interim settlement  with the Palestinians. The Israeli Government has reached no  decision on a confederation with Jordan in the permanent  arrangement. According to international terminology, a  confederation is a framework incorporating two states. Anyone  caring to read the Labor Party's election platform and the  decisions made at its latest convention will see that there is  no mention of a Palestinian state between Israel and Jordan.  Therefore, any attempt to deal with issues pertaining to the  permanent solution now are wrong. We oppose the Palestinian  attempt to raise elements of the permanent solution for  discussion in the course of negotiations on the Gaza-Jericho  First proposal, which is merely the first step in the interim  stage. We firmly and clearly insist on one thing: the  negotiations today are over the interim accord. Both sides must  keep all their options open for the negotiations on the  permanent solution. All the wisdom and logic in reaching an  interim agreement first lies in the attempt to examine whether  Palestinians and Israelis can achieve peaceful coexistence in  Judaea and Samaria. Until we experience whether or not this is  possible, it would be a mistake on our part today to deal with  elements of the permanent solution or to allow the Palestinians  to raise issues pertaining to the permanent arrangement, such as  for example, the refugee issue. At this stage of negotiations  on the interim arrangement, we are not dealing with the issue of  refugees, whether these are Palestinian refugees or Jewish  refugees from the Arab countries.    [Segal] At a meeting of the Knesset Foreign Affairs and  Defense Committee two weeks ago, Knesset Member [MK] Binyamin  Netanyahu pulled out an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Intelligence  Branch document warning about the security risks posed by  autonomy. Your reaction was, and I quote: With all due respect  to the IDF Intelligence Branch, it has been wrong in the past  and these are merely assessments. Sir, do you believe that when  the PLO assumes responsibility we will be able to count on them?  Can 'Arafat guarantee security and deal with the terrorist  squads?    [Rabin] Let us separate the substantive part of your  question and its introductory sentence. At the Knesset Foreign  Affairs and Defense Committee session, MK Netanyahu did, indeed,  mention an IDF Intelligence Branch document which I had not yet  seen. I replied that it was the Intelligence Branch's job to  present the dangers. I never concealed the fact that any  political move carried out by Israel entails some risks. Giving  up all of the Sinai Peninsula and erasing all signs of an  Israeli presence there also engendered danger. Not only  security risks, it also set a precedent regarding the price  Israel would have to pay in exchange for peace with other  countries. It is the political echelon, however, which makes  the decisions. As for the assessments of the Intelligence  Branch, whether right or wrong as it occasionally transpires,  there is the example of the Yom Kippur War which proves that  mistakes have been made, perhaps not in overrating dangers but  rather in underestimating them. Now back to your question.  First of all, Israel retains responsibility for the security of  Israeli citizens and for external security. True, in the  situation which we hope will ensue, the Palestinians in the Gaza  Strip, for example, will control the areas of Gaza city with  over 250,000 Palestinian residents. Clearly, in order to  control such a population -- and because we do not want to place  any Israeli soldiers or policemen at risk -- there will have to  be a Palestinian police force which will be armed with rifles,  not sticks. They will not receive their arms from Israel but  from another source. All the talk about Israel arming the  Palestinian police is simply being fabricated by various  elements who are trying to mislead the public with baseless  lies. There must be a strong police force. This was already  promised -- and I believe rightly so -- by an Israeli prime  minister way back at Camp David. I also think that there should  be a strong police force. This police force must take control  of the street because if it fails to do so, or if it does not  receive strict instructions to impose law and order, the basis  for the whole agreement will be undermined.    [Ben-'Ami] Security problems can also arise from the other  end. What about the settlers' riots and the calls for  insubordination inside the IDF? What about the letter by the  reserve officers?    [Rabin] Let me start off by saying that I consider  insubordination within the IDF to be totally unacceptable. I  was also opposed to it during the Lebanon war. Even if the  public was divided, a democratically elected government has the  authority to tell the IDF what to do and no soldier has the  right to refuse an order. There is nothing worse than calling  for insubordination. I find it inconceivable for a soldier to  refuse to serve in the territories. There were many cases of  soldiers who refused to serve in the territories because the  military occupation of another people was contradictory to their  political beliefs. It is just as inconceivable for soldiers to  refuse any orders except for what the Supreme Court defines as  manifestly illegal orders which contravene the humane and legal  values we seek to instill in our soldiers.    [Ben-'Ami] What about the settlers' terror activities?    [Rabin] If such things happen, God forbid, it will be  Israel's responsibility to deal with it, just as we shall demand  that the Palestinian police deal with Palestinian terrorists in  the areas under the control of the Palestinian police.    [Segal] Sir, was the release of 101 Palestinian prisoners  part of a deal with the PLO to renew the Taba talks? Are  further releases of Palestinian prisoners expected in the coming  days?    [Rabin] No one informed the PLO of the decision to release  over 100 prisoners. I was responsible for this decision. I  would like to reiterate our criteria: None of these prisoners  belonged to the rejectionist groups which continue terrorist  activity, none of them has any Jewish or Palestinian blood on  their hands, and most of them were due to be released soon  anyway. I would like to remind everyone that Israel is holding  between 9,000 and 9,600 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.  These are mostly prisoners or detainees still undergoing legal  proceedings. These prisoners are held in IDF lockups or in  Prison Service installations. On average, over 300 prisoners  are released each month when their sentence is completed or when  the administrative detention of about 130 or 140 prisoners out  of the 9,000 expires. The remainder have either been convicted  or are undergoing legal proceedings. We did not release any  prisoner or detainee still undergoing legal proceedings.  Approximately 200 to 300 prisoners are released each month  anyway.    [Ben-'Ami] Sir, you were in favor of negotiating with Syria  first. In a week President Clinton will meet with Syrian  President al-Asad. Do you expect a change in Israel's  relationship with Syria? Do you foresee a possibility of the  Syrian track taking priority over the negotiations with the  Palestinians?    [Rabin] First of all, I would like to correct what you said.  I have always stressed the need to focus on the  Palestinian-Israeli issue, at least since the last election  campaign and after becoming prime minister. If you watch the  television reports on our election campaign you will see that we  placed the focus on the Palestinian track and I even announced a  timetable of six to nine months that we failed to meet. We  failed to meet the target date but we reached an agreement with  the Palestinians. I always said that the key for a breakthrough  is in the hands of two of our four Arab partners: either Syria  or the Palestinians. Why is this? I always realized that  Jordan cannot -- without getting into the reasons for this now  -- lead a breakthrough. Lebanon, which, putting things nicely,  is very much under Syria's influence, is definitely incapable of  such a move. Therefore, the key to any breakthrough is either  Syria or the Palestinians. We reached a declaration of  principles and we are conducting negotiations with the  Palestinians. I will not say things are easier. There have  been ups and downs, as I said there would be immediately after  signing the agreement in Washington. As for the Syrians, I have  still not received an answer to my question. I said earlier that  the goal of our negotiations with the neighboring Arab countries  was a peace treaty, not some other agreement. To the best of my  knowledge, Syria, up to this very moment, has not explained that  its interpretation of the term peace is similar to the way we  understand it. In other words, borders that are open to the  traffic of goods and people, diplomatic relations and embassies,  a policy of normalization, and a peace treaty between our two  countries that is independent and not effected by our relations  with other Arab partners. I would not be wrong to say that up  to now, the Syrians have been demanding a full withdrawal and  the dismantlement of all Jewish settlements on the Golan Heights  in exchange for a peace that does not even include  normalization. Al-Asad constantly insists he will not be  willing to accept anything less than was accepted by the late  Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat. In other words, Israel's  return to the international border, the evacuation of all of the  Sinai and the uprooting of any Israeli presence there. Al-Asad  insists that this is a precedent for making peace, and he is  adamant not to receive less even in return for a less extensive  peace. At this stage, we have not received a full answer  regarding what kind of peace President al-Asad is referring to,  and we have certainly not accepted the price he is asking in  return for peace. We have accepted the principle of withdrawal  on the Golan Heights to secure and recognized borders. We said  we would not enter negotiations on the geographical dimensions  of withdrawal until we know what kind of peace we are getting in  return. As for what will happen at the al- Asad-Clinton summit  on 16 January, why should I guess? We only have to wait nine  days to find out.    [Segal] Washington pundits believe that the Syrian president  will clearly explain his concept of peace with Israel.  According to some assessments, he will propose full peace with  embassies and open borders. According to your own formula of  full peace in exchange for full withdrawal, are you today  capable of passing a decision on withdrawal from the Golan  Heights?    [Rabin] Up to today, when defining Israel's position, I have  never spoken of full withdrawal. If that becomes a problem, we  shall have to discuss it. Our position today is in support of a  withdrawal on the Golan Heights.    [Segal] Given today's political situation, can you gain a  majority for such a decision?    [Rabin] For a withdrawal on the Golan Heights? Yes.  [passage omitted]</p>

The Russian military on Thursday handed over the list of  officers, junior officers and servicemen stationed in Paldiski.  The list is the basis for giving them temporary permits to stay  in the town.    The registration of Russian military vehicles also started  on  Thursday.    On Tuesday, registration of local inhabitants started with  the aim of determining the composition and number of inhabitants  in the town largely inhabited by non-Estonian population and the  Russian military.    As of Wednesday night, around 1,600 people had filled in the  registration lists. The registration closes on Saturday.    On answering the question on dismantling the training  nuclear  reactors in Paldiski, Tikk declined some reports that the  process was to start around April 5-7, at the time of another  round of Estonian-Russian negotiations. He said, however, that  the dismantling would begin in April, but the date had not been  fixed.</p>

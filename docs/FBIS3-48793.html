Opposition to the combination of single-seat  constituencies and proportional representative erupted suddenly.  To the government and the ruling parties, it was an  "unexpectedly" deep-rooted opposition. Why did the lawmakers of  the SDPJ, the largest ruling party, try to kill the bills, on  which Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa "staked his political  life?" How did the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] manage to  restrict to five the number of its upper house members who voted  for the bills? And what about the behind-the-scenes moves by  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] to get the bills enacted? We  will look at why the ruling parties lost by a wide margin.    The twenty "rebels" from the 73-member upper house SDPJ and  the Democratic Federation for Safeguarding Constitution [goken  minshu rengo], who voted against the political reform bills,  completely reversed the power balance between the ruling and  opposition parties. Seventeen of them voted against the bills  and three abstained. This means that a group, an "opposition  faction," was formed very skillfully without coming to the  notice of the SDPJ executive council or other coalition parties  until immediately before voting on the bills. The rebels came  from all sections of the party, neither bound by age or sex --  from senior members to "madonna lawmakers" who won election to  the upper house for the first time in 1989 when Takako Doi was  chairperson of the SDPJ.    Moreover, Hideo Den, permanent adviser to the Social  Democratic League who seceded from the SDPJ's "leftist and labor  union line," and Masatoshi Ito, who was involved in  "anti-military base struggles" and ran for the post of SDPJ  chairman last September based on his opposition to the  combination of single-seat constituencies and proportional  representation -- also voted against the bills. They have  different political beliefs and views.    We can say that many of the rebels feel a stronger affinity  with Chairman Tomiichi Murayama than with Secretary General  Wataru Kubo. Jinichi Ogawa, chairman of the Regional  Administration Committee and a senior figure among the rebels,  said: "Each individual had doubts about the bills and decided  on his or her own will to vote against them." His comment  showed he thought there was a difference between their group and  a party faction which might force its members to vote against  bills.    The Japanese Private Sector Trade Union Confederation  [Rengo]  and other organizations started to apply serious pressure on  SDPJ members in mid-January when Diet discussions on the bills  entered the final stage. The party convention which ended on 12  January confirmed its resolve that the "bills be approved."  Once that had happened, the SDPJ's executive department and the  prime minister's close associates intensified efforts to  persuade SDPJ upper house members to vote for the bills. At  that time the party's executive department confirmed that up to  19 lawmakers would vote against the bills.    On 18 January, the ruling and opposition parties started to  talk about the idea of revising the bills. The concept included  a plan which would leave some room for corporations and groups  to make political donations. The executive department tried to  persuade the rebels to support the concept, saying "the bills  will be changed for the worse if we continue to oppose this  idea." As a result, though, the rebels became more distrustful  of the bills and strengthened their unity.    On 20 January, the day before the vote, a rumor leaked  out that said: "It seems as though Shinseito has managed to  persuade 10 LDP members to vote for the bills." Lawmakers who  planned to abstain from voting, firmed up their resolve to vote  against the bills for the fear they might be approved. Five  upper house LDP members actually voted for the bills. "Twelve"  rebellious members, the difference between the `yes' and `no'  votes, was enough to kill the bills, even though five more LDP  members than expected voted for them. The figures suggest the  rebellious SDPJ members had a well-planned strategy.    In fact, the rebels had a further strategy. They had a  secret plan to hold a meeting immediately before the vote to  deliberate on a resolution to censure Tsutomu Hata, deputy prime  minister and foreign minister, and Eijiro Hata, agriculture,  forestry and fisheries minister, following the liberalization of  the Japanese rice market. According to the plan, several  lawmakers from agricultural areas, and who align themselves with  the SDPJ group, would be asked to attend the deliberation  meeting and thereby abstain from voting on the reform bills.  Eventually, the LDP gave up the idea of calling for a  deliberation on the resolution on 22 January. As a result, the  SDPJ group had to shelve its secret plan. However, it seems  that dissatisfaction -- including the abstention by Takao  Mikami, a member of an agricultural cooperative association --  over the government's decision to accept liberalization of the  rice market had some impact on the voting.    The opposition faction confirmed: "It is likely that any 20  people would agree and act in concert on all proposals."  However, there is no doubt that the opposition faction now has  the casting vote in the upper house between the LDP and the  ruling coalition parties. Although there are many tasks to be  settled, including compilation of the fiscal 1994 budget, the  positions of the ruling and opposition parties have been  reversed in the upper house. A senior upper house member of a  ruling party muttered: "The political reform bills will not be  approved, no matter how many times we submit them to the upper  house, as long as the current composition of the upper house  remains."</p>

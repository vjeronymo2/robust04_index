			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted on the T-72 tank's features]  The ROK Government has purchased a T-72 tank from the East  European bloc through (Epico) Co., a French arms dealing company  that stirred up a controversial arms fraud case at the end of  last year, to test its efficiency. This move is seen as part of  the ROK Government's countermeasures against North Korea's  possible selection of T-72 tanks as its main force, said U.S.  intelligence sources.    Both the ROK and U.S. Armies think that North Korea deployed  the tanks on the Western front of the Korean peninsula taking  into account the hilly terrain of these areas. They are busy  preparing for countermeasures because, if North Korea chooses  these tanks as their main force, it would pose a great threat to  the ROK.    The T-72 tanks were first introduced in 1977 and Syria was  the first country to actually use them in warfare in 1982 during  the war with Israel. Iraq used the tanks during the Gulf war in  1991.</p>

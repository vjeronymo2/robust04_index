			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Scottish Heritable wins US judgment Scottish Heritable Trust, the mini-conglomerate, has won an Dollars 8.5m (Pounds 5.7m) judgment in the US courts in respect of a claim against KPMG Peat Marwick regarding the acquisition of a 50 per cent stake in Rangaire Corporation in 1988. The Federal Court jury in Dallas, Texas, found in favour of the company after a trial lasting four weeks. The claim filed by SHT alleged that audited financial statements of Rangaire, upon which the company made its decision to purchase a stake, were materially mis-stated. The jury found that the auditors had not committed fraudulent violation of US securities laws, but had been negligent in its audits of Rangaire in 1987 and 1988. The timing of the receipt of the award is dependent on whether or not an appeal is made. SHT anticipates that it will realise about Pounds 3.5m after expenses. Refinancing talks with its bankers are continuing and a further announcement will be made early in 1994. As a result of these talks, it has been decided to change the company's year end to March 31.</p>

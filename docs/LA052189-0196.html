			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMICS OF CULTS IN CONTEMPORARY AMERICA;  </P> <P> CULTS &amp; CONSEQUENCES THE DEFINITIVE HANDBOOK EDITED BY RACHEL ANDRES AND  JAMES R. LANE (PUBLISHED BY THE COMMISSION ON CULTS AND MISSIONARIES, COMMUNITY  RELATIONS COMMITTEE, JEWISH FEDERATION COUNCIL OF GREATER LOS ANGELES: $14.95,  PAPER; 250 PP.)  </P> <P> Although the visibility of so-called destructive cults may have dimmed from  media attention somewhat, many of these groups are every bit as active now as  they were 10 to 15 years ago. And, according to this encyclopedic reference  book, families, social service agencies, religious leaders -- as well as  would-be joiners and ex-cult members -- urgently need to understand the  dynamics of cults in American society.  </P> <P> The volume, dedicated to Maynard Bernstein, the late Los Angeles cult educator,  is an anthology of previously published articles and excerpts plus some  original contributions. They were written by people who have viewed the  multifaceted cult scene from a variety of perspectives: psychiatrists,  psychologists, educators, lawyers, former members, parents, and deprogrammers  and "exit" counselors.  </P> <P> The editors note that perhaps as much as 12% of U.S. cult membership is Jewish,  though only 3% of the American population identifies with Judaism. Yet, while a  Jewish perspective shapes the book, it steers away from sectarianism. Material,  for example, by evangelical Christian sociologist Ron Enroth of Westmont  College is included, and the book's observations and insights should prove  valuable to people of any -- or no -- religious background.  </P> <P> "Our disagreement with cults does not focus on the content of their beliefs,"  the editors say early on. "Rather, we are concerned with what is, in our  opinion, deceptive proselytizing and unethical conduct. . . . We are also  concerned about the political activities of these organizations."  </P> <P> "Cults &amp; Consequences" explores a panoply of topics: defining "cults" and  what makes some destructive; how and why people become involved in cults; how  cult recruiters operate and how indoctrination takes place; various ways  members leave cults and why some stay out while others return; the role and  perspective of parents, and legal issues in deprogramming and child custody  when parents split over cult involvement.  </P> <P> The approach is not glib: The work both recognizes and wrestles with the fact  that there often are perceived benefits to cult membership and that complex  moral and psychological "shades of gray" are involved.  </P> <P> For example, exit counselor Steve Hassan, a former member of the Unification  ("Moonie") Church, says he finds it "particularly hard . . . to use a deceptive  technique like the one many cults use to recruit, even though it is temporary  and used for the purpose of helping people to regain autonomy. . . . My choice  is based on the lesser of the evils. I would rather misrepresent myself than to  encourage the use of forced interventions or do 'nothing.' "  </P> <P> Readers will find the concluding section on resources and references especially  helpful. Dozens of cult awareness and exit assistance organizations are  included. The list of books and articles is much more limited. But co-editor  Andres, who is director of the Commission on Cults and Missionaries for the  Jewish Federation Council of Los Angeles, asks readers to send her "any and  all" cult-related material for future reference.  </P> <P> The book has some annoying glitches, such as occasionally not identifying the  beginning or ending of excerpted materials, omitting items from the table of  contents, inappropriately indenting passages, incorrectly breaking lines and  pages, and typos. Patches of dull writing could be livened up considerably with  a little astute editing.  </P> <P> More serious is the book's patchwork-quilt format, which makes for uneven  quality and considerable repetition.  </P> <P> The book would be easier (and quicker) to read and more riveting if Andres and  Lane had decided to be authors instead of editors, assimilating and quoting  from their abundant materials and excellent sources but writing their own  manuscript.  </P> <P> On the other hand, the format is not without strengths. Most chapters conclude  with a useful study guide with questions for both group and individual use.  Some are provocative: "If your salvation could only be achieved by getting  other people to join with you, would you lie to get them to join?" And: "Where  do you think the line is drawn between non-coercive and coercive exit  counseling?"  </P> <P> The frequent use of summaries, and lists of questions or points set off in  boldface print or ruled boxes, make it easy to find specifics and skip over  material not all readers will need, such as legal technicalities.  </P> <P> The handbook was designed to help a broad range of professionals as well as the  general public; it will provide all a comprehensive and objective overview of  cults and a gold mine of thoughtful answers and tested, practical suggestions  for action.  </P> <P> Some may feel disappointed not to find more definitive information about  specific cult groups -- by name -- telling how to combat them individually. The  editorial decision not to do that was no doubt influenced by fear of hostile  cult litigation, which, in fact, long held up the book's publication.  </P> <P> That the editors and publisher of "Cults &amp; Consequences" weren't finally  intimidated is itself laudable; that there was pressure to suppress the book  underlines how much it is needed.  </P></p>

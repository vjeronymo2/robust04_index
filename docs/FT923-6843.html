			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Leading Article: No free lunch FOR THE post-communist governments of eastern Europe, the road to economic reform is proving so long and bumpy that some of them are now looking for short cuts that do not exist. The latest leader to succumb to the temptation is President Boris Yeltsin, who promised on Wednesday to provide every man, woman and child in Russia with a 'ticket to a free economy' in the form of vouchers to purchase Rbs10,000 worth of privatised state property this autumn. It certainly sounds alluring: a scheme which promises, almost at a stroke, to rationalise rotten state industry, shift great swathes of it to the private sector, encourage share ownership and create a liquid capital market. Unfortunately, however understandable the motivation, the plan is an illusion. Mr Yeltsin's wheeze is not new. Similar schemes are already being implemented or contemplated in several other east European countries - notably the disintegrating federation of Czechoslovakia, where more than 8.5m people are participating in a plan to transfer nearly Dollars 10bn worth of state assets to private shareholders. The Czechoslovak policy illustrates the limitations and risks of mass privatisation. It was launched essentially for political reasons: to create a speedy mechanism for the transfer of state property to private hands and to give ordinary citizens a stake in economic reform. Rather than the desired equity-owning democracy, however, the scheme seems likely to produce confusion. Most of those who have bought vouchers entitling them to shares have entrusted them to private investment funds promising inflated returns. These barely regulated funds are neither ready nor willing to inject the management expertise so badly needed by state enterprises; in consequence many of the old industrial bosses remain in control. And if the promised returns fail to materialise, the result could be a crisis of financial and economic confidence. Russia's programme has defects of its own. For one thing, the timetable is impossibly tight. For another, since much of the equity is to be reserved for employees of the enterprises concerned, it does not look any more likely to produce competent management than the Czech scheme. The lesson is that large-scale privatisation of state industry is no miracle cure for the old command economies. It is unwieldy to implement, politically divisive and cannot fulfil all the conflicting objectives which governments expect - spreading wealth among the citizens, injecting new skills into the economy and creating tradeable financial assets. This may not matter all that much in the long run. The real future for eastern Europe lies in encouraging new private enterprises, not in extending the life of the old state sector. The worry is that in the shorter term, mass privatisation schemes that promise something for nothing may give capitalism a bad name.</p>

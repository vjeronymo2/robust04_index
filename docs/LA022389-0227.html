			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> U.S. PLANS SOVIET HOCKEY GAMES  </P> <P> The thaw in superpower relations spread to the ice rink today as hockey  officials and diplomats announced that the Washington Capitals and Calgary  Flames will play Soviet teams in Leningrad and Moscow next September. The games  will be the first in which National Hockey League teams have competed in the  Soviet Union. "I think it would be a wonderful occasion if we had as much  unanimity inside the United Nations as we have here today about hockey; I'm  sure the world would be a better place," said the second-ranking U.S. diplomat  to the United Nations, Ambassador Herbert S. Okun. He gave a Capitals team  jersey to the third-ranking Soviet U.N. diplomat, Victor A. Zvezdin, who  reciprocated by giving Okun a jersey with the U.S. ambassador's name emblazoned  on the back. NHL president John Ziegler said the trip will cost the two teams a  little more than $1 million.  </P> <P> Soviet club teams have played in North America six times since 1975, the most  recent appearance being this season's 14-game series featuring two top Soviet  teams: Central Army and Dynamo Riga.  </P></p>

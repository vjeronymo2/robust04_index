			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Each-way bets in the markets AUGUST SEEMS to have started a day or two early this year. It is traditionally the prime month for market theories and rumours, as traders try to drum up a little business in a sleepy season. This year there is enough alarmism before the month has even started to energise three normal summers. Presidents Bush and Mitterrand, it is said, may resign rather than face their electors. The EMS, according to the polls, could be threatened when French voters are asked to endorse the Maastricht Treaty. And Mr John Major is seen by some as under such pressure from economic disappointment that his own immovable policy may crumble. This is more than idle talk: prices have responded. Equity markets, despite a technical bounce from their July slide, are discounting a no-change recession; but bond markets, which had previously benefited from the sluggish outlook, have now fallen back to discount possible policy upheavals. Add in continued talk about a possible Japanese market melt-down, despite a belated relaxation of monetary policy, and no further explanation is needed for market nervousness. Political strain The political strain reflects a feeling that governments in all the countries affected are virtually powerless in face of their problems; and such a widespread malaise must be based on more than coincidence. There are three problems of the 1990s which go a good way to account for the syndrome. One is transitory; two are not. The first is the oldest: the bursting of a financial bubble. These collapses have punctuated financial history for centuries; they look like the end of the world for a time, but they never are. Stock market investors in Tokyo, house-buyers in London and banks in New England must all doubt that it will ever be a glad, confident morning again; but after a time assets will look under-valued, lenders will believe that they have put the bad news behind them, and convalescence will begin. The economy tends to need nursing through this period of nervous prostration. Unfortunately, most of the countries which have suffered have governments which believe that any interference with market forces makes matters worse. While time is the only long-term cure, a tonic, as the Australian recovery suggests, might cut the time required. Monetary policy can still be deployed, of course, by even the most ardently market-based regime; but this has been encountering a second problem. In an increasingly integrated world capital market, monetary initiatives seem to have their most powerful effects outside the countries which make them. Germany mounts a squeeze against inflation; but before it has much effect, growth collapses in the rest of the EC. The Fed cuts interest rates to a 29-year low; Mexico booms, while the US remains stuck in a recovery 'which does not look that different from what we now call recession', in the words that Sir Peter Walters of the Midland Bank used to describe British prospects. XH Intractable problems These problems appear at times so intractable that the whole project of international integration looks like a mistake. Hence, for example, the hints in this country, from the new director general of the CBI and the chairman of ICI, to take the two most prestigious examples, suggest realignment, or even a return to independent floating, as preferable. Hence, too, the Bundesbank's evident distaste for having to include Italy's problems on its agenda, and the trouble President Bush has met in getting his North American Free Trade Area ratified. We can only hope that by 1993 we will have governments strong and inventive enough to resist disintegration. Assuming that we can get through the next few months without a big accident, one problem will remain: the populations of all the advanced countries are ageing, especially in Japan and continental Europe, and their demands will impose a budgetary headache. Japan has planned for this for decades. It intends to live on foreign investment earnings. Britain, which has about the smallest long-term problem, has taken the biggest steps to reduce dependence on state funds, and to impose tight management on demand for those funds. British problems still look bad enough to keep long-term real interest rates quite high, even if German and French problems were not driving them higher. Investors must strive to stay rational in face of these forbidding uncertainties. Reason says, for example, that house prices will not fall forever, though debt and repossession will overhang the worst affected areas for some time yet; and that interest rates, now that inflation has stopped in the US and Japan and is slowing sharply in Britain and Germany, are likelier to fall than to rise again. It is not rational to hope that the bull market will soon come roaring back again; but the worst of the correction in London and Tokyo (though perhaps not in Wall Street) may now be over. And remember that this is August, when there are 10 rumours for every real crisis.</p>

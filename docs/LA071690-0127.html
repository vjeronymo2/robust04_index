			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> TURNER SEES LOSS AS INVESTMENT  </P> <P> Television mogul Ted Turner, certain to be hit with another huge loss on his  second Goodwill Games, is confident enough to call the property "investment  spending."  </P> <P> "We will lose money on the Goodwill Games," Turner said during a television  critics' tour. "I don't know yet how much for sure. It'll be far less than the  $60 million that NBC lost in Seoul and ABC supposedly lost in the (Calgary)  Winter Games.  </P> <P> "When they lose that much, they don't build up for next time. We're building.  I'm absolutely certain that we're creating a franchise that will have value. I  don't consider it losing money as much as investment spending."  </P></p>

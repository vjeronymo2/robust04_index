			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Riviera president charged with fraud THE conservative president of France's Riviera region was charged with fraud yesterday in the latest of a spate of French corruption scandals, Reuter reports from Grasse. Mr Jean-Claude Gaudin, the head of the Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region and member of the Union pour la Democratie Francaise (UDF), is accused of creating a false job in his cabinet for an employee who did not do the work for which he was paid and abused his position and contacts to peddle influence. Mr Gaudin's chief of staff, Claude Bertrand, has also been charged in the case on three counts of fraud and complicity in peddling influence. Mr Gaudin said he was innocent and the charges were politically motivated - the 'last episode' of elections last March which returned him as regional president.</p>

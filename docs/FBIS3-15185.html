In an interview with  Interfax he welcomed the positive reaction by the conflicting  sides to the mediatory role of Russia which provides a ceasefire  in the zone of the Karabakh conflict on March 1 in line with the  four-partite agreement.    Oganesyan believes that Russia's mediation goes in line with  the CSCE efforts. He said that the main thing today is to  achieve a lasting ceasefire, to withdraw the armed units of the  conflicting sides. The spokesman said that the mechanism to  provide security for the population of Nagorno Karabakh and the  non-resumption of the hostilities will be worked out during  further talks. Oganesyan expressed hope that the initiative  will establish a long-awaited peace in the region.    A spokesman for the defence army of Nagorno Karabakh has  told  Interfax that, contrary to the ceasefire agreement, Azeri troops  fired at Karabakh positions Tuesday. Obeying the command's  order on ceasefire, Karabakh troops did not retaliate.</p>

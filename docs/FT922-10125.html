			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / As They Say in Europe: The missing ministers ONE thing you have to say about the German foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, is that he always knows when to move on. He quit the coalition with the Social Democrats ten years ago when they looked in trouble, and now he has left Chancellor Kohl in the lurch. As the German Press agency, DPA, put it, his resignation could not have come at a worse time for the Chancellor, who was facing the first large national strike in nearly 20 years, the rise of something nasty on the right and a general pessimism about almost everything. So the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung wrote: 'An era in Germany's post-war history is coming to an end, an era which was linked to the name of Hans-Dietrich Genscher. Like nobody else, he embodied continuity over the years.' It concluded that in Europe, Genscher's weight had increased had increased since the unification of Germany, which is one way of putting it. Germany's problems might have been expected to add to the the pleasure of nations: the media in neighbouring countries find it hard to conceal their true feelings when Germany faces the kind of trouble that normally afflicts them. But under an editorial entitled, 'The price of reunification' in Le Figaro, Georges Suffert said the price was being paid by everybody. 'If the German government gives in (to the strikers), we should not have any illusions.' It would mean the end of the hopes of lower interest rates and maybe worse than that: Suffert quoted Thomas Mann who said Germans show their lack of maturity in times of trouble. One country that seems to show some maturity at such times is Russia. At least that is what the deputy prime minister Yegor Gaidar told all of us who had assembled in Washington as his country was admitted to the IMF and World Bank. We thought his confidence seemed to border on complacency, but that attitude was shared by his country's media. Nezavisimaya Gazeta said western warnings about backsliding over tough fiscal policies were made for 'educational purposes.' The warnings were not meant for national leaders but for their opponents and supporters. 'In fact, the readiness of western partners to share their views with the reformers' team is much more vigorous than necessary.' In other words, please do not bother us with your troubles. The hero of the last IMF meeting was Grigory Yavlinsky - the top Russian economist of 1991. He disappeared with Gorbachev but popped up in Komsomolskaya Pravda. The Russian insouciance was apparent when he wrote about the Group of Seven aid package that had been promised as a result of IMF approval for Russian policies: 'The Dollars 24bn assistance might prove very useful, but only if the country knows how to use the assistance. If the government is not efficient, wise and reasonable in its use of the credits, they may bring serious losses. The trust of the people, not the money, is at stake now.' Germany and Russia may have dominated the international stage last week but that did not mean nobody else had troubles. Most problems turn up at IMF meetings but few noticed the appalling state of affairs in the Netherlands, or its consequences. The country has an incomes policy but it collapsed last week and this meant the Dutch finance minister, Wim Kok, could not turn up for vital meetings. The Dutch have been complaining for years about the way they are left out of the international decision-making process. The one forum they do attend is what is irrationally known as the Group of 10, which consists of 11 countries. It was this group which gave the formal go-ahead to the western effort to stabilise the rouble and much else. Kok missed other meetings too. So in NRC-Handlesblad, Roel Janssen wrote: 'Both at the EC finance ministers' meeting where aid to non-Russia was discussed and at the G-10 which took an important decision for the first time in years, no minister from the Netherlands was there.' The development aid minister, Jan Pronk, was asked about Kok's failure to come to Washington at the one time he could have made an impact. Jos Ter-Horst of the Algemeen Dagblad quoted the reply: 'His absence is an investment in his future presence.' ***** There was an unusual event in Warsaw last week. Piotr Wojcik, who is deputy-speaker of the Sejm, the parliament, took part in a demonstration against parliament. Zycie Warszawy said this was an example of political schizophrenia. 'In politics, it is not enough to have rights. You have to persuade voters about these rights. But it does not mean that in constructing a strong and sovereign Poland, parliamentarians should demonstrate against parliament.' James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC</p>

			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE COCAINE WAR  </P> <P> We propose an effective and efficient tack that would eradicate the market for  drugs. We suggest a systematic engendering and enhancement of individual  self-esteem and responsibility among our youth. Ideally, this would be done at  home, from the crib. Realistically, it's not, so the schools must incorporate  self-esteem and personal responsibility skills, starting in kindergarten.  </P> <P> It is an irrefutable fact that individuals with a strong, positive sense of  self aren't as likely to succumb to pushers' tactics. Conversely, those who use  the wares of pushers fall prey largely because they have low self-esteem and a  lack of coping skills -- and therefore no pride, no self-determination, no  personal responsibility -- to counterbalance the smooth sales job, the peer  pressure.  </P> <P> Imagine the results if the money and manpower spent on fighting the cocaine war  on the enemy's terms were instead expended on well-proven programs that create  and nurture strong self-esteem and personal responsibility, beginning with the  upcoming generation of would-be drug-lord targets.  </P> <P> B.

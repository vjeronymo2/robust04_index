			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Consumer credit side lifts Cattle's to Pounds 9.8m CATTLE's (Holdings), the consumer credit company, yesterday reported a 19.5 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 8.2m to Pounds 9.8m, for the year to December 31. Mr Eddie Cran, deputy chief executive, said that despite no recovery in consumer demand a reorganisation at the consumer credit division, offering weekly credit to about 250,000 customers, saw profits rise from Pounds 6.7m to Pounds 9m. The hire purchase and leasing division, adversely affected by bad debts from small businesses, reported a loss of Pounds 1.5m compared with profits of Pounds 400,000. The number of debtors declined to 33m (40m). Profits from insurance services were marginally up at Pounds 560,000 (Pounds 400,000). After the rapid expansion in 1990 the number of branches have been maintained at 50. Last month's 55 per cent flotation of Rosebys, the retail business, generated Pounds 10m, which helped bring down borrowings to Pounds 65m (Pounds 80m), representing 200 per cent of shareholders funds. Mr Cran said it was encouraging to see Rosebys increase its profits to Pounds 2.17m (Pounds 2m) in a 'dismal year for retailing'. An extraordinary item of Pounds 500,000 relates to the costs arising from the withdrawal from servicing small third party video retail sites. Turnover was up at Pounds 245m (Pounds 203m). Earnings fell to 6.1p (7p). A maintained final dividend of 2.3p is recommended for an unchanged total of 3.8p. In addition, a special interim of 0.5p will be paid reflecting the gain from the company's sale of part of Rosebys.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] As North Korea has suddenly declared its withdrawal  from the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], the  government is seeking various countermeasures while analyzing  the details of North Korea's announcement.    After North Korea suddenly reported its withdrawal from the  IAEA yesterday [13 June], government officials at the National  Unification Board and the Foreign Ministry stayed in their  offices late at night to grasp the real intention of North Korea  by communicating with friendly nations, such as the United  States and Japan. They also came to their offices earlier than  usual this morning and are trying to seek measures, anticipating  North Korea's countermeasure against possible sanctions by the  UN Security Council.    Regarding North Korea's declaration of its withdrawal from  the IAEA, a government official said: North Korea's action is  analyzed to have double purpose, to express its dissatisfaction  at the recent adoption of the IAEA resolution on sanctions  against it and to convey its strong message against the future  sanctions by the UN Security Council.    He continued: The government will strongly cope with North  Korea's threatening offensive, acting in concert with the  international community's effort to guarantee North Korea's  nuclear transparency.    Another government official said: Even after it declared  that it was withdrawing from the IAEA, North Korea did not  mention that it would not allow nuclear inspections at all, but  said that it would not allow inspections for a limited time  until it decides whether to withdraw from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. This hints at North Korea's will  to completely withdraw from the NPT system if the UN Security  Council makes a decision to impose sanctions against it.    He then anticipated that such an action by North Korea,  however, would not block the international community's process  to push for sanctions by the UN Security Council.</p>

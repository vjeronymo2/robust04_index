			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. The PHA application cover letter must indicate the date the PHA's allocation and supportive services plans for housing for disabled families have been or will be submitted to the Field Office for approval. If the allocation and supportive service plans have not been filed, the Field Office shall advise the PHA that the development/MROP activities application cannot be approved unless the plans are approved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Applications will be determined approvable if they successfully pass the minimum approvable score of 182 points for development applications and 140 points for MROP applications. Section 624 requires that applications be selected competitively based on (1) the PHA's need for funds to meet the goals expressed in its allocation plan; and (2) the extent to which applications meet the requirements of 24 CFR part 945 (which contains the Designated Housing regulations).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Field Offices will prepare analyses of allocation and supportive service plans and of applications by furnishing narrative responses to the following items:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Need of the PHA for assistance, taking into account the number of disabled families who are potential residents of the project based on waiting lists, local surveys of accessible housing needs, the needs assessment (see 24 CFR 8.25), a housing survey, a survey of agencies providing services to persons with disabilities, the average length of vacancy for accessible units and the length of time a disabled family has to wait for a dwelling unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Extent that appropriate supportive services will be provided, indicating that prospective residents want the supportive services, that the services are adequately designed to meet the needs of disabled residents, and the experience of the service provider(s) in administering an effective service delivery program for disabled families. If residential supervision is required, the Field Office shall indicate that a written commitment has been obtained for such service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Field Office Reports. The Field Office Public Housing Division shall forward each approvable application to the Headquarters Panel within two weeks of the end of the deficiency ``cure'' period. The Field Office report will include the project number, total number of units and units by bedroom size, structure type(s), cost areas, funding required, the metropolitan/ non-metropolitan designations for each application, and the rating score sheets; in addition, the report is to describe how the application supports the PHA allocation and supportive service plans, and whether the PHA intends to develop the housing for disabled families on scattered sites or in a manner designed to obtain the most integrated setting possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Approvable applications will be referred to the Headquarters Review Panel, which will be convened on an ad hoc basis. This Panel will be comprised of Headquarters staff and will retain the same individuals, to the extent possible, each time the Panel convenes to ensure continuity. The Headquarters Review Panel will review and rank applications based on Field Office rating score sheets, analyses, comments and recommendations. The Assistant Secretary will select applications based on the Headquarters Review Panel's rankings and recommendations, up to the amounts available under the two set asides.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

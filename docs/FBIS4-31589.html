			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jovan Dulovic: "At the Center of Hell"] </F>   [Text] Dusan Vuckovic (age 30), known as Repic, from Umka  near Belgrade, is charged in an indictment with having killed 16  and wounded 20 innocent Muslim civilians from the village Divic  when he was a member of the notorious Yellow Ants volunteer  unit, and with having raped a 35-year-old Muslim woman in Mali  Zvornik (SR [Socialist Republic] Serbia) from whom he then took  1,000 German marks. His elder brother Vojin Vuckovic (age 31),  better known by his nickname Zuca, commander of the Yellow Ants,  is charged with unauthorized possession of a sizable quantity of  weapons and has been released on bail pending trial.    All the details in the indictment have not yet been made  public, but it is known that during the investigation the  brothers were suspected of having released bloodthirsty pit bull  terriers to attack imprisoned civilians and of organizing  nighttime duels, that is, compelled the Muslims to fight each  other to the death with knives. The winner was promised freedom.  It is not known whether the investigation was able to support  those suspicions with evidence or witness testimony. Branko  Njegovan, district public prosecutor, says that on 27 or 28 June  1992 Dusan Vuckovic cut off the ear of a prisoner in the culture  center in the village of Celopek, where inhabitants of the  village Divic had been imprisoned. (This was a commonplace  gesture in units made up of convicts released from prison to  fight on battlefields in Bosnia. They would prove their  accomplishment in ethnic cleansing with the ears they had cut  off, and this was closely bound up with reduction of their  sentences.) Then he fired an entire burst (of 30 rounds) from a  Kalashnikov into civilians.    Dusan Vuckovic has reportedly confessed to having killed  seven people. In a trial of volunteers from some paramilitary  unit (which one has not been announced) the other day in the  same court, Andjelko Trninic (age 27), a machine technician from  Klupci near Loznica, and his contemporary Dragomir Zekic, an  electrician from the vicinity of Zvornik, the prosecutor says,  murdered Milenko Vidovic, a physician from Mali Zvornik, in a  perfidious way on 16 July 1992. What is special about that crime  is the motive and the manner in which it was committed. Arrested  exactly a year ago, during the entire time of criminal  proceedings and the trial Andjelko Trninic was categorical: "I  cut the doctor's throat on patriotic grounds." Trninic actually  is not defending himself, he is not contrite. He speaks of the  crime as though he expects recognition for patriotic service.    Andjelko Trninic's explanation delivered to the court is  interesting: "We heard that Dr. Vidovic was smuggling drugs and  medical supplies, and so Zekic and I went to check it out. When  we had drunk the drink the doctor offered, I pulled out a pistol  and ordered him to show us everything that he had there in the  house. There was a sizable quantity of drugs piled on the sofa,  shelves, and in bureaus. The doctor's justification was that the  drugs were needed for the patients he treats privately. It was  clear to me that Vidovic was a traitor to the Serbian people,"  Trninic concluded. Dragomir Zekic described the act of execution  in more detail: "Trninic then went into the bathroom with  Vidovic, and on the basis of what I heard, I concluded that they  were still talking about the drugs. Some 10 minutes later he  asked me to bring him the knife from the kitchen. I thought he  needed it to open some box or to frighten Vidovic. Then Trninic  ordered the doctor to kneel down beside the bathtub...." They  put Milenko Vidovic with his throat slit into the bathtub and  took an automatic rifle and pistol from the apartment. Trninic  says that he received the order to execute the doctor from his  command, which was stationed at that time in Zvornik. Expert  witnesses concluded that Andjelko Trninic was at the time he  committed [text missing from original].  <H5>  From White to Yellow </H5>   All the things that happened along the left bank of the  Drina  beginning in early spring 1992 have largely remained unknown to  the public. In Mali Zvornik, the very first glance made it clear  at that time that something strange was happening in Zvornik; on  the Serbian side, the bridges were blocked with sandbags, on  which were machine guns with loaded belts, aimed at the other  bank of the Drina, where a big sign said "Srpska republic of  Bosnia and Herzegovina" to mark the border. In addition to the  weapons, uniformed police, members of the military police, men  in camouflage uniforms without insignia, and several civilians  whom all addressed with deference (the republic MUP [Ministry of  Internal Affairs]) were also keeping a close eye on what  happened on the other side. "You do not know, my friend, what  kind of riffraff had collected in Zvornik. Offspring of an evil  father and a mother who was worse. Better not to go there unless  you had to," suggested the border guards on the bridge whom we  mentioned, also remarking that "twice the looters from Zvornik  have attacked the bridge with weapons in an attempt to carry  away booty and arms into Serbia."    Zvornik was at that time crowded with various armed  groupings: the White Eagles, the Dragon's People (they referred  to their leader as the Dragon), the Yellow Ants, the Yellow  Jackets, Cele's Volunteers, Peja's Guards, unidentified little  groups that called themselves "special units," various  detachments for special purposes.... They all looked askance at  one another with weapons in their hands and a bullet in the  chamber. "A quiet war is being waged here for power, and the  situation is very tense," explained the Zvornik TO [Territorial  Defense] commander, who introduced himself as Marko, although  the chiefs of certain units close to the authorities in Belgrade  said that this was a certain Branko Popovic, Mihalj Kertes' man,  who had done a great deal in bringing down the advocates of  autonomy in Vojvodina. From what Marko said, as soon as an armed  group would burst into the city, it would immediately try to  take power, that is, to disarm Marko and the TO forces, and then  to confront the menacing rival armed groups which were also  laying claim to power, and the attempt would fail. Marko was  surviving as commander without any authority or the strength to  restore order.    A few km from Zvornik, in a restaurant named "The Four  Teats"  (owned by two sisters), the leader of one of the most numerous  groups (it is not wise to mention the names even today) openly  said that he had come to Zvornik as a Serbian patriot above  political parties to use his men to purge the Serbian land of  Muslims, justifying the necessity for ethnic cleansing with the  words of Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska republic,  that "the Serbs no longer have any reason whatsoever to beg the  Muslims to live together in the same state." Judging, however,  by the great number of gold chains around his neck, mostly  women's, and the rings on his fingers, one got the impression  that for the members of the paramilitary units killing Muslims  was only a cover for looting. "Tonight, we did our work in the  nearby Muslim village with cold steel, we did not fire a round,"  the volunteers would relate in the restaurant, slapping the  knives decorated with cockades that hung from their belts.  Psychiatrists would have said of many of them that they are  personally unhappy and mentally poisoned and corrupted people  who are able to nurture this kind of aggressiveness thanks to a  corrupted environment.    The Ants of Zuca (Vojin Vuckovic) were spoken of in eastern  Bosnia as one of the most cruel units. "They left nothing alive  behind," members of other quite similar paramilitary units would  remark respectfully. The other day, there was a newspaper  article (POLITIKA EKSPRES, 13 May) that said that "the Yellow  Ants have done much evil in Bosnia, and in early August 1992 the  special forces from Pale managed to disarm and arrest them."  This is what kids would call baloney. The allegedly arrested  Ants were even shown on TV. However, that same evening the  arrestees and the special forces celebrated their successful  farce in the restaurant near Zvornik we have mentioned; its  purpose was obviously to deceive the public. It was supposed to  be interpreted in terms of the law-governed state in Pale  effectively removing the criminals and looters from its  territory.  <H5>  Torching of Villages </H5>   Up to the end of August 1992 there were so many  problematical  people armed to the teeth in Zvornik and environs that there was  no force to disarm them and drive them out of a city overwhelmed  by lawlessness. Anyone could do what he wanted to, loot or kill,  without fear of being subject to criminal prosecution or pursuit  of any kind, in spite of the assertion of the TO commander that  "all the institutions of the temporary government, such as the  prosecutor's office and the court, were in operation," which was  absurd anyway because no one even dared to look crossways at the  members of the "liberation units." The desire to drive the bands  out of Zvornik remained in the domain of wishes. "We have  problems with several armed groups," newsmen were told at the  time by Marko, "but we do not know to whom they belong. We have  contacted Bogdanovic (Serbian minister of police at that time)  and Seselj. They answered that they could not help, because  those groups had gotten away from them. Today, for example,  Azdaja and his people burst into the offices of the TO and  threatened to kill us at gunpoint if we continued to insist that  the paramilitary forces leave the city." The commander of the  most numerous group, who always appeared accompanied by two glum  TO soldiers, had an explanation as to why there was a conflict  with members of the TO. "It seems that Mr. Marko sent the  military police to disarm the volunteers. But because the  volunteers are better fighters, they disarmed the police. We can  expect all this to work out when the gentleman politicians  finally realize that war is not waged in armchairs, but with a  gun in your hand. I think that this new communist movement is  behind these splits," the commander said. It can hardly be said  that those "robber bands," as the police in Mali Zvornik refer  to them, were waging war in eastern Bosnia. This was actually  heedless murdering and looting.    On 10 May 1992, Muslim houses burned in Skelani and in the  nearby villages Mihaljevici, Redzici, Lonjin, Krasanpolje,  Rzine, Dzafici, Osamsko.... "I wanted to see it burn. The owner  and his family had fled, because this restaurant was a meeting  place of the Green Berets under command of Ahmet Tihic," said a  TO member with glowing eyes who poured gasoline on Bekim Fehic's  restaurant at the entrance to Skelani. A bulldozer then razed  the torched Muslim houses. The explanation for the burnings,  except for the desire we have mentioned, was rather  unconvincing. Allegedly, the Muslims never returned to the  burned-out ruins of their houses.    "Never before have there been so many vultures circling in  the sky along the course of the Drina," observed local people in  the Serbian villages on the right bank of the river. They stood  and watched the torched Muslim houses burning on the other side  of the river, accompanied by the sporadic fire of automatic  rifles. It was clear to everyone that ethnic cleansing was  taking place. "Evil will come from all this. One day the Muslims  will return and take revenge," an old man expressed his  suspicion out loud, while the others kept silent. No one was  gladdened by the burning of the houses of those who had been  neighbors until the day before.    The old man's prediction came true after a few months: The  Muslims returned to some mixed and Serbian villages and took  revenge in kind. They torched the Serbian houses and murdered  the Serbian inhabitants. Even by that time there were hardly any  volunteers from Serbia in eastern Bosnia. Most of them had fled  to Serbia, carrying away the booty they had looted and their  weapons.  <H5>  The Sanctions, and so Forth </H5>   The outcome of the trial of Dusan Vuckovic, the first Serb  accused of war crimes, is uncertain, and at this point it is  difficult to judge whether criminal prosecution of criminals  will ensue on a larger scale. Especially because the  international court for war crimes committed on the territory of  the former Yugoslavia will not recognize the decisions of the  national courts. As Antonio Cassese, presiding judge of the  international court, said in the most recent May issue of the  Italian magazine COOPERATIONE, "a number of effective measures  to deter them from that kind of behavior has been envisaged  against those countries which refuse to extradite suspected war  criminals and thereby withhold cooperation from the court. One  such measure might be imposing sanctions of the Security  Council." Because we are already under sanctions, there seems  nothing for us to do but to see what those "other measures" are.</p>

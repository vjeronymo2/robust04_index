			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OPERATORS AT HEART OF 911 SYSTEM;  </P> <P> EFFECTIVENESS OF RESPONSE TO EMERGENCIES DEPENDS ON HUMAN JUDGMENT  </P> <P> For all their high-tech hardware and its ability to relay information in a  split second, authorities acknowledge that the 911 emergency systems in Los  Angeles County are only as good as the people who answer and say, "911  emergency. What are you reporting?"  </P> <P> From the huge communications center below Los Angeles City Hall to a small  glass booth at the sheriff's station in the Santa Clarita Valley, 911 operators  must make snap judgments on calls nearly every minute of the day.  </P> <P> And it is in that oft-repeated human transaction that the system is most  vulnerable to failure.  </P> <P> "Given that we have the hardware, the most important thing is the human  element," said Capt. Robert Spierer, Santa Clarita Valley sheriff's station  commander.  </P> <P> That was no more evident than at 10:36 p.m. on Jan. 20 when a veteran deputy  and 911 operator at the Valencia sheriff's station said, "Have a nice day," and  hung up on a man frantically trying to report a gang shooting and fearing for  his life.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Caller Not Injured  </P> <P> The caller was not injured, but sheriff's officials acknowledged that he was a  victim of human error -- the deputy made a snap judgment that 911 operators are  trained not to make. He decided that a call for help was not legitimate.  </P> <P> The incident, now the subject of an internal investigation, has raised  questions about how 911 calls are handled and how system operators are trained.  Though as many as one in four calls are pranks, one basic rule is that an  operator should never terminate a call for urgent help because he suspects that  it is bogus.  </P> <P> "It is not our place to decide whether it is real," said Los Angeles Police  Sgt. John Emerson, a communications room supervisor. "The caller could be lying  through his teeth, but we have to take it at face value. We have no reason not  to send a car."  </P> <P> Authorities stress that the Jan. 20 incident does not indicate a larger  problem. They say that only a few complaints about the handling of 911 calls  have been made in recent years.  </P> <P> All 911 calls in Los Angeles, including those from the San Fernando Valley, go  to the Police Department's communications center four floors beneath City Hall.  In a dimly lit room nearly the size of a basketball court, more than 100  computer screens glow in 911 and radio-dispatch consoles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mostly Civilian Operators  </P> <P> The operators at the 15 consoles where calls come in are mostly civilians. A  few exceptions are police officers who ask for experience handling 911 calls.  </P> <P> The civilians must complete a seven-month training and testing program before  taking their first 911 call. The program teaches them how to deal with callers  ranging from drunks to children, from those who are hysterical to those who are  injured or unable to explain their emergency.  </P> <P> During training, the operators spend several hours handling simulated emergency  calls before they can take real 911 calls.  </P> <P> An actual call that reports what sounds like a life-threatening situation is  termed a "hot shot." The operator immediately dispatches the information to  patrol cars. The 911 computer automatically tells the operator the caller's  location and the nearest patrol car.  </P> <P> The majority of calls are not emergencies. Those are transferred to radio  dispatchers at 45 other consoles. The calls then are assigned to patrol cars  according to availability and priority. Calls for fire or medical services are  immediately transferred to the Fire Department.  </P> <P> Staffing of the city's 911 consoles varies from shift to shift, police said. On  weekend nights, all 15 consoles are staffed. During daylight hours, fewer  operators are needed. Sometimes only half of the consoles are staffed.  </P> <P> In contrast to the city's quiet 911 center, the Sheriff's Department's 911  facilities seem less rigid or confined.  </P> <P> At the Valencia station, two 911 consoles are in a 5-by-10-foot glass booth  behind the front desk. Emergency calls are sometimes answered at the front desk  or in the station sergeant's office.  </P> <P> When a call comes in, information taken by a deputy is put on a computer screen  and sent to the sheriff's communications center in East Los Angeles to be  dispatched. The 911 deputy also tells the dispatchers the nearest patrol car to  the caller.  </P> <P> Police and sheriff's officials said the dispatching of calls takes only seconds  in either system. But sheriff's officials believe their decentralized method  has an added advantage because calls are answered by law officers with  firsthand knowledge of emergency situations and the area.  </P> <P> "It gives us more of a customized service," Spierer said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> On-the-Job Training  </P> <P> Deputies assigned to 911 receive some instruction from manuals but mostly  receive on-the-job training from a senior operator, or watch deputy, officials  said.  </P> <P> California, which pays for the state's 911 systems, has no training  requirements for operators.  </P> <P> "There are generic minimum standards" for the operation of the equipment, said  Leah Senitte, 911 program manager for the state General Services  Administration. "But everything that happens after a call is answered is the  local agency's responsibility."  </P> <P> Sheriff's officials said that each station fills its 911 positions with  carefully chosen personnel, not with troublesome or patrol-weary deputies.  </P> <P> "We will never put somebody who we believe is not adequate on 911," Spierer  said. "If we have a deputy who says he is tired of the street, he can volunteer  but his qualifications for handling emergency situations are the primary  considerations."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Keys to Advancement  </P> <P> Spierer said the 911 posts are seen as keys toward advancement in the  department. The senior position within the system -- watch deputy -- is the  highest-paying deputy classification.  </P> <P> On Jan. 20, Deputy Jim Greene, a 25-year veteran who had worked in the Santa  Clarita Valley for 19 years -- four of them answering 911 calls -- was the  watch deputy.  </P> <P> Greene picked up the call from a pay phone on San Fernando Road in Newhall. The  caller, Jim Finnila, reported that a teen-ager had been shot and lay bleeding a  few feet away.  </P> <P> Until then the sheriff's system had operated smoothly. An emergency call had  been answered by a seasoned deputy familiar with the area from which it came.  </P> <P> But then something went wrong.  </P> <P> "Get the cops here quick!" Finnila said after indicating that he too was in  danger.  </P> <P> A few moments later Greene made a judgment call that 911 operators say should  never be made. Sheriff's officials said he apparently decided that Finnila's  call was not a legitimate emergency and disconnected the call.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Recognized Address  </P> <P> In this case, one of the positive aspects of the sheriff's 911 system may have  worked against it. According to Sheriff Sherman Block, Greene apparently  believed that the address flashed on the computer was that of a neighborhood  bar, perhaps leading the deputy to dismiss the call.  </P> <P> Greene apparently realized his mistake a few seconds later when a deputy on the  other 911 console informed him about a shooting report at that location. The  call had come 30 seconds ahead of Finnila's, but Greene hadn't known about it.  </P> <P> When a caller provides incomplete information or cannot be understood, the  Sheriff's Department and Los Angeles Police Department require that a patrol  car be automatically dispatched on an "unknown trouble" call to the address.  </P> <P> The 911 operator then must extract more information from the caller and pass it  along to the officer. Even if the operator believes the call might be a prank,  a patrol car must be dispatched, albeit with a warning that it is suspicious,  officials said.  </P> <P> "We have to take a person literally," said Police Lt. David Musil, a  communications center supervisor. "We have to respond."  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department's Spierer agrees that it is better to be safe than  sorry.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Difficult Judgment'  </P> <P> "When there is something that doesn't sound right . . . that is a very  difficult judgment to make," Spierer said. "In 99.9% of the cases, we are going  to take a chance" and dispatch a car.  </P> <P> There is little question that Greene's handling of Finnila's call reflected bad  judgment, Block said. Greene, who no longer answers 911 calls, could not be  reached for comment.  </P> <P> Authorities do not tabulate false 911 calls, but city and county 911  supervisors said many calls are not legitimate.  </P> <P> "911 is really abused," Musil said. "We have people who call up just to ask  what time it is. It is frequent that someone will report something very heinous  and it is not true. They just want to see the lights and sirens."  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department last month released an audit of a three-day period  showing that only 1,430 -- or 28% -- of the 5,077 calls were actual  emergencies.  </P> <P> Medical or fire emergencies, which were immediately transfered to the county  Fire Department, accounted for 15% of the calls. Non-emergencies and referrals  to other agencies made up 31%.  </P> <P> The rest of the 911 calls -- 1,248, or about 25% -- were listed as prank calls,  including false crime reports, the Sheriff's Department said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 5,500 Calls Daily  </P> <P> Los Angeles police said they receive about 5,500 calls daily on the 911 system.  Prank calls are not tabulated, officials said. But 70% to 75% of the calls are  non-emergencies, Musil said.  </P> <P> Citizens frequently complain when their non-life-threatening calls cannot be  handled as emergencies and are instead dispatched according to priority. But  mistakes in which emergency calls are erroneously believed to be phony are  rare, authorities said.  </P> <P> Senitte, the state program manager, said 911 systems in California handle 30  million calls a year and only a handful of valid emergency calls go unheeded.  "It happens only in very rare situations," she said.  </P> <P> In the last two years there were only two justified complaints that Los Angeles  police operators mishandled 911 calls, believing they were not actual  emergencies, Musil said.  </P> <P> In each case, the operator was faulted for not getting enough information from  the caller to realize that the situation was life-threatening. He said he knows  of no case where an operator hung up on a caller reporting an emergency.  </P> <P> Capt. David Gomez of the Sheriff's Department said there were two complaints in  1988 about the handling of 911 by sheriff's deputies. But he declined to  elaborate on the circumstances.  </P></p>

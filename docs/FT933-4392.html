			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Watchdog backs capital standards THE Personal Investment Authority, the proposed new self-regulatory body for retail financial services, yesterday agreed to the controversial proposal that anyone giving financial advice be required to have a minimum of Pounds 10,000 in capital, Norma Cohen writes. Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the Securities and Investment Board, the chief City watchdog, has said he will insist on minimum capital standards. The PIA board is discussing what sort of resources may be said to constitute capital. Minimum capital standards have been opposed. All parts of the retail financial services industry must vote to approve the PIA, to be formed by merging the memberships of existing regulatory organisations, and some have threatened to boycott it if its rules are too tough. Mr Bill Barron, acting chief executive of PIA, said it will not automatically accept all members of other self-regulatory organisations. Among those who may be barred are those whose disciplinary record is poor although not sufficiently poor to have resulted in barring them.</p>

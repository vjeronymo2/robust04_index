			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Virani quits as Control Securities chairman MR NAZMU VIRANI, who is charged with fraud in connection with the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, yesterday announced he would quit as chairman and chief executive of Control Securities. Mr Virani's partial resignation - he will remain a director of the company on a full chairman's salary, of Pounds 250,000 according to last year's accounts - paves the way for a relisting of the pubs and property group, which has been suspended since October at 16 1/2 p. The Stock Exchange said a relisting would now depend on it receiving information relating to the future structure of Control's board. It has been suggested that Mr Virani, who was granted Pounds 1.25m bail at City of London courts yesterday, may resign as a director at a future date. He will be replaced by non-executive director Mr Sydney Robin, who will become acting executive chairman until Control appoints a permanent replacement. Control yesterday stressed that the charges against Mr Virani were in no way connected to the company. 'The SFO have confirmed that Control is not under investigation,' a statement read.

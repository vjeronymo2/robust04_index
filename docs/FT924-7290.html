			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Where miners need a head for heights - Kenneth Gooding on the problem of altitude sickness in the Chilean high Andes THEY CALL it puna in Chile, scoroche in Peru. The mining industry will have to learn new tricks to live with it. Puna is the catch-all term for the very many symptoms caused by what English speakers call altitude sickness. It will have a profound impact on the way mining companies operate in Chile, a country that many see as the most attractive in Latin America for exploration and development. Much of that country's minerals treasure is locked in the high Andes. Some of the best mines and projects are located above 2,800 metres (9,000 feet), the level at which most people begin to feel the onset of puna symptoms. In no particular order these mines include: Coldelco's Andina and Salvador copper operations; Exxon's Los Bronces copper project on the same ore body as Andina; La Coipa gold project (Placer Dome and TVX Gold) and Bema Gold's Refugio project nearby, both in the so-called Marikunga gold district. There is Cominco's Quebrada Blanca copper project. Billiton, Falconbridge and Chevron are partners in the Collahuasi copper project (but Chevron is selling its stake to Minorco). RTZ owns Cerro Colorado, another copper project. Homestake has the El Heuso project, Cominco the Lobo project and Cocar owns Cancan, all seeking gold. Chile also boasts - for a short while longer at least (its owners Billiton, Northgate and Citibank intend to close it at the end of this year) - the world's highest operating gold mine, Choquelimpie, in the mouth of a dead volcano at 4,825 metres (15,777 feet). Billiton is part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group and Shell Chile is helping to finance a study of the effects of high altitude on miners - research that will be of immense value as activity builds up in that country. The air above 2,800 metres is generally described as 'thin'. It contains the same proportions of oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen as at sea level but with increasing altitude there is a decrease in atmospheric pressure. The decrease is gradual and proportional up to about 2,800 metres, but rapidly and disproportionately accelerates as higher altitudes are achieved. When high altitude-low pressure air is breathed into lungs adapted to the higher pressures of lower altitudes, transfer of oxygen from air to blood is reduced and the body experiences oxygen depletion. The body is then forced to work harder to take in extra oxygen and in doing so slips back into oxygen deficit again, creating a vicious circle. The symptoms of puna can include one or all of the following (and the list is not exhaustive): headache, gastric problems, nausea, heart arrythmia, listlessness, vomiting, diarrhoea, lapse of memory, anxiety attacks, feelings of insecurity, loss of appetite, insomnia, shortage of breath, muscular cramps, indecisiveness, lack of motivation, obsessive behaviour, persistent colds, sinusitis, sore throat, painful eyes and loss of vision, fevers and inability to concentrate. All of these are particularly unwelcome on mining sites, where so much heavy equipment is used and operators must feel on top of the job. The impact of puna is different for each individual. Mr Jim Platt, Billiton's chief geologist on the Collahuasi project for four years, has produced a paper on altitude sickness based on his personal experiences. He says there is no way of knowing if an individual needed for the current Dollars 40m exploration programme at Collahuasi will be able to work at that altitude except by taking each one there to see what happens. 'There seems to be no pattern. Extremely fit and active people have been known to suffer badly while some overweight, heavy-smoking types feel no effects,' he says. Mr Platt points out that to guard against the short- and long-term impact of puna, companies in Chile have begun to make use of a 'buddy' system. This involves everyone looking out for the health and condition of everyone else, spotting and signalling any observed deviations from the norm or onset of puna symptoms. This system promotes teamwork and safety-consciousnes. Mr Platt suggests the buddy system is particularly important for detecting potentially dangerous psychological symptoms, such as anxiety attacks, feelings of paranoia and insecurity, a sense of entrapment, intense claustrophobia, obsessive thinking and the edge of a nervous breakdown. By the end of this year the study sponsored by Shell Chile and carried out by the Catholic University of Santiago's cardiology department should be available to throw fresh light on this subject. Among other things, researchers have been checking the Choquelimpie employees at the mine, also at Putre which is 1,100 metres lower and where the mining camp is based, and finally in Arica, a sea-level town, in an attempt to identify any with heart problems or others potentially at risk. Mr Patricio Palma, Choquelimpie's safety officer, says: 'We want to know more about how hearts and lungs function at high altitudes to prevent problems developing, possibly with the help of drugs'. It might also be necessary to change working patterns at the mine, he points out. Fortunately, the cure for puna is simple: the patient is taken to a low altitude as quickly as possible. In severe cases time may be vital. The cure is then so rapid and so complete that some of the afflicted immediately want to return to high altitude, unwilling to believe that they ever had difficulties. Mr Platt insists, however: 'They should under no circumstances be permitted to make a return'. Mining companies wanting to establish a fully-adapted high-altitude crew can expect that for every 100 people selected, 30 to 35 will drop out quickly. Of those, two or three are likely to be very ill indeed. The 65 to 70 who remain may also be subject to significant attrition in the medium term either because they cannot put up with the working environment or as a result of delayed puna symptoms. Mr Platt points to the bottom line for many mining companies in Chile: 'When you are planning to staff a high-altitude project, it is likely that twice the required number of personnel will eventually have to be selected to ensure that basic (mining) needs are met.'</p>

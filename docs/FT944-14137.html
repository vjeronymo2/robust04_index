			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / US power group moves to build Pounds 400m gas plant Enron, the US gas supply and power generation company, said yesterday that it had taken the first step towards building a new Pounds 400m power station on Teesside. The company said a wholly owned subsidiary, Flotilla Power, had signed a connection agreement with the National Grid for a 779MW combined cycle gas turbine power station on 20 acres of disused land at Imperial Chemical Industries' North Tees works. Enron, the leading partner in the Pounds 850m Teesside Power Station, which opened last year on land beside ICI's Wilton works south of the River Tees, will carry out a feasibility study into potential markets for the proposed station. It will consult local bodies, including conservation groups, before deciding whether to seek planning consent from the Department of Trade and Industry. The project would use North Sea gas piped ashore at Teesside from the Everest and Lomond fields through the Pounds 950m Central Area transmission system. Electricity produced would be supplied via the National Grid, linking into power lines near the site. Enron said it was 'reserving its position' by applying now to the National Grid. It has asked the Grid to be prepared to make the connection available from 1998. It said no decision had been taken on whether to go ahead, nor on whether, if the project did proceed, to seek partners. At Teesside Power Station, a 1,875MW plant which is one of the world's biggest combined heat and power stations, four regional electricity companies are shareholders. Flotilla Power's connection agreement with the Grid, and another signed by a different consortium in May 1992 for another site north of the Tees, are conditional on the controversial upgrading of power lines in Cleveland and North Yorkshire, where two sections, for which the Grid has proposed alternative overhead routes, remain unresolved.</p>

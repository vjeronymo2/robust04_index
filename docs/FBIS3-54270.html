Dr. Nabil Sha'th, chairman of the Palestinian delegation to  the Taba talks, has stated that the Palestinian delegation was  forced to postpone the talks to make room for the political  efforts to eliminate the obstacles.    In a statement to MENA today, Sha'th commended the role that  President Mubarak is playing to eliminate the obstacles and  boost the peace effort. He remarked that Foreign Minister 'Amr  Musa's visit to Israel and his talks with Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin and Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres were within the context  of Egyptian efforts to eliminate the obstacles. He explained  that Musa carried to Israel a Palestinian paper outlining the  Palestinian vision of how to resolve outstanding issues. He  hoped Israel would respond positively in this connection.    Sha'th added that Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat would  return to Cairo tomorrow to meet President Mubarak and 'Amr Musa  and discuss the Israeli reply, which Musa brought back with him.

			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> '20/20' TAKES A LOOK AT PALISADES HIGH SCHOOL  </P> <P> "60 Minutes" already has done a segment on alcohol and drug abuse among  teen-agers in Pacific Palisades. Now comes ABC's "20/20" with a somewhat  controversial version at 10 tonight on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42.  </P> <P> The Palisades has been shaken by an unusual number of teen fatalities related  to drugs or alcohol. In researching the "20/20" story, producer Joe Lovett and  his crew angered Palisades High School psychologist Linda Swimmer-Levine by  filming at -- but not trying to stop -- a party on a perilous bluff where drugs  and alcohol were in use. School officials had alerted police to the party, but  no police showed up.  </P> <P> "20/20" uses brief footage from the party to demonstrate the prevalence and  easy accessibility of drugs and alcohol among Palisades teen-agers, blaming  much of it on affluent parents who are inattentive or too submissive.  </P> <P> Reported by Stone Phillips, the segment is basically positive, however, finding  hope in community-encouraged therapy groups that help children and their  parents better understand each other and cope with many of the problems that  have brought the Palisades so much grief.  </P> <P> Palisades High School is characterized here as both an institution of high  academic performance and high drug and alcohol use. What "20/20" doesn't ask  tonight is how both are possible at the same school. HOWARD ROSENBERG  </P></p>

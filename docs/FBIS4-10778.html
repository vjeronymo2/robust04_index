			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Joao Domingos] </F>   [Text] Alcantara -- The PT [Workers Party] government will  give priority to programs like that of the Alcantara Rocket  Launch Center. This is what PT candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da  Silva said on 13 April to Aviation Colonel Jose Celso Lauande,  the center's commander, who met Lula to show him the way the  project is operating. The project has been fully developed with  Brazilian technology.    Lula, who started another stage of his Caravan of the  Citizenry in Maranhao, carefully listened to Lauande's briefing.  To help him ask the colonel questions, Lula was accompanied by  Reserve Colonel Geraldo Cavagnari, who helped the PT design its  program for strategic areas and advanced technology. The PT  candidate showed his indignation at the fact that the center  needs $40 million to operate at full capacity. Of the center's  total cost of $260 million, $117 million remains to be provided,  for which reason the space program has been considerably delayed.</p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Dobson warns generators on coal imports LABOUR yesterday warned electricity generators that investments in port facilities to import cheap foreign coal would become 'white elephants' under a Labour government. Mr Frank Dobson, the party's energy spokesman, said he was confident that the European Commission would allow a Labour government to block imports of cheap foreign coal. He said the party was determined that PowerGen and National Power, the electricity generators, would follow such policies. Mr Dobson was responding to a letter from Sir Graham Day, PowerGen chairman, requesting further information on how Labour planned to make sure the generators followed an energy policy. He said earlier this week that Labour could use the state's 40 per cent shareholding in National Power and PowerGen to appoint directors. Sir Graham pointed out in the letter that the government had no special powers to appoint directors, and that any directors it elected using its shareholding would be legally bound to protect the interests of all shareholders. The clash, the first direct conflict between Labour and the management of one of the privatised generators, could set the scene for a trial of strength over energy policy if Labour wins the election. However, party officials played down the significance of Mr Dobson's remarks. The main thrust of the party's approach would be to strengthen the role of independent regulators, they said. Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, attacked Mr Dobson's remarks about appointing directors and launched a campaign directed at Labour's nationalisation plans. Mr Lilley charged that a Kinnock government would extend public ownership of the recently privatised industries well beyond the water companies and the national grid. Arguing that the proposals would hit shareholders, taxpayers and the consumer, he claimed Labour was 'the only major political party in the world' advocating an extension of public ownership. The charges were greeted with derision by Labour officials, who underlined that the party's only commitments were confined to taking control of water and the national grid only when resources allowed. 'They are making them to distract attention from the problems of the recession and the grave worries people have about public services,' Labour said.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Russians muscle in on oil deals Russia is pressing for equity shares in some of the biggest oil and gas projects being undertaken by western companies in other former Soviet republics, but without putting in any capital. Lukoil, a Russian state-owned energy company, is seeking a share of oil and natural gas fields to be developed by western companies in Kazakhstan. The move comes only weeks after Lukoil was allowed to participate in the Azerbaijan government's 30 per cent share of a British Petroleum-led consortium to develop offshore Caspian Sea fields. The company is relying on political and economic pressure from Moscow to muscle into 'all the major oil deals' in Kazakhstan, said a western diplomat in Alma-ata, the Kazakh capital. 'They are after an equity share in these deals without (putting) any equity into them,' he said. One of Lukoil's main targets is the Karachaganak gas field in northern Kazakhstan. It is the focus of a Dollars 5bn development by British Gas and Agip, the Italian oil company. The Russian companies believe they have a valid claim for a share in the big developments in neighbouring countries because they were discovered during the Soviet era. Oil industry experts say Russian participation in such projects should have little direct impact on western companies, as long as the shares come out of the host government's stakes.</p>

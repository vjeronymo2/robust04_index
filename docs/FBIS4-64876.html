			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, May 10 (AFP) -- The International Atomic  Energy Agency warned Monday [9 May] that it could take its  dispute with North Korea to the United Nations Security Council  if Pyongyang peristed in serious violations of a nuclear  inspections accord.    David Kyd, spokesman for the nuclear watchdog body, said  such  a step would be taken if, for instance, the North Koreans  removed seals placed on nuclear fuel rods by IAEA inspection  teams.    The rods are due to be changed in a five megawatt reactor in  North Korea's Yongbyon complex, and the IAEA wants its  inspectors there to ensure that nuclear material has not been  diverted for military purposes.    Pyongyang is resisting the IAEA's conditions, and Kyd said  its latest reply in an exchange of messages on the subject,  received last Friday, was unsatisfactory.    The United States has warned that if North Korea does not  cooperate in satisfying the international community that it is  not developing nuclear weapons Washington would seek sanctions  against it in the Security Council.    North Korea has said it would treat such a measure as an act  of war.</p>

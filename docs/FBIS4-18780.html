			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Cristina de la Hoz report: "Aznar and Arzalluz Unblock </F> Their Relations and Establish a Line of Cooperation"]    [Text] [People's Party Chairman] Jose Maria Aznar and  [Basque Nationalist Party, PNV, Chairman] Xabier Arzalluz met  Tuesday [29 March] in order to unblock relations between their  parties. The two leaders, who had not talked since June 1991,  decided to establish a stable channel of communication,  especially with respect to autonomy and economic issues and  cooperation in the Congress [of Deputies]. The People's Party  also acknowledges the possibility of taking part in the next  Basque government.    The meeting took place at a private house midway between  Burgos and the Basque Country, and helped break three years of  noncommunication since the two politicians met 12 June 1991.  Accompanied by Jaime Mayor Oreja, People's Party chairman in the  Basque Country, and by Juan Maria Ollora of the PNV, Aznar and  Arzalluz mainly centered their four-hour conversation on the  economic and autonomy situations and on the need to recover a  certain world of values, Mayor Oreja told ABC yesterday.    However, the main aim was to unblock a relationship which  was  virtually nonexistent, since, although both leaders have  attended European People's Party meetings, they have not  directly exchanged a word, although they have indirectly  exchanged many mutual accusations.    Arzalluz expressed his concern about the implementation of  autonomy and even handed the People's Party leader a document  containing his party's stance on the matter, which dwelt  especially on the single social security fund. But there was  most agreement on the situation of "grave" economic and  industrial crisis which Spain is experiencing, as Mayor Oreja  explained to this newspaper, and for this reason Aznar and  Arzalluz decided that their respective parties will continue  their contacts after Easter Week.    The People's Party and the PNV are thus establishing new  channels of communication which will also be manifested between  the parliamentary groups in the Congress, although Mayor Oreja  refused to speak of the existence of any common front, but  asserted, on the other hand, the need for less rigidity in  relations between the two parties.    The initiative for the meeting, the same sources added, was  shared, and came following a conversation four weeks ago between  the People's Party chairman in the Basque Country and  Lehendakari [Basque premier] Jose Antonio Ardanza.    Emphasis was also placed on giving greater impetus to  regeneration of the institutions. An issue which was broached  very superficially -- "it really was discussed very little" --  was terrorism, perhaps in order to avoid tensions in a  conversation which would have made clear the deep differences.  As Mayor Oreja explained, the People's Party is opposed to ETA  [Basque Homeland and Liberty] members' rehabilitation taking  place through a decision of the Basque parliament.    The unblocking of relations between the People's Party and  the PNV occurs against the backdrop of the holding of the next  Basque elections in the fall. In this connection, and since all  the parties seem to be open to any cooperation formula in order  to form a government, the People's Party is not ruling out  joining in that combination, and a PNV-People's Party government  could be conjectured, at least in theory. However, Mayor Oreja  emphasized that the People's Party's sole aim is to rise in this  community, and described any other kind of conjecture as  premature "until we know the results."    For his part, Basque premier Jose Antonio Ardanza described  the meeting as very positive, although he would say nothing  about possible future coalitions following the elections. He  stated that it is his party's duty, "because of the major  government responsibility which it has been exercising since the  transition," to maintain relations "at both ends of the  political spectrum."</p>

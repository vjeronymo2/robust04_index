			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia puts its oil industry on the back burner - The country could soon become Opec's first net importer Fifty years ago this week Japanese troops in the jungles of central Sumatra used abandoned American equipment to drill the only wildcat exploration oil well in Indonesia during the long Pacific war. The oil-soaked sand that the drill bit struck during the night of December 4 1944 turned out to be the Minas field, the largest oil accumulation east of Iran and east Asia's only 'super-giant' field. Its discovery came too late to change Japan's military fortunes. But in the 42 years since commercial production began Minas's low sulphur crude oil has helped to fuel Japan's economic transformation. It has also helped to pay for Indonesia's ambitious industrialisation plans. But just as south-east Asia has become the fastest growing international oil market, Indonesia is about to lose its status as a net oil exporter. Many western companies say the day could be staved off if the government eased the conditions under which they operate as contractors to Pertamina, the state oil company. But the government appears to be betting that it can be the first member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to switch its energy exports from oil to natural gas, the world's fastest growing fossil fuel market. A recent World Bank report predicted that the oil sector's share of gross domestic product would drop to about 6 per cent by the year 2010, compared with 18 per cent in 1990 and 28 per cent in 1980. Last month President Suharto told the Opec meeting in Bali that oil 'no longer plays an important role' in the Indonesian economy. But in spite of such statements there is considerable sensitivity about when the country will become a net oil importer. The government says Indonesia can maintain its current status well into the next decade. Oil industry executives say it is likely to become a net importer before 2000, in spite of some easing last year of exploration terms. 'The government is not seriously encouraging exploration,' said one US oil company executive in Jakarta. 'Even if they change their terms now they might find they have done so too late because the exploration cycle takes so long.' A British executive said: 'Pertamina understands the need to modify their exploration terms, but the government does not.' Some executives say Indonesia's success in diversifying its export base has had a big impact on the government's thinking about the importance of the oil industry. The World Bank predicts that the decline of oil export earnings means that non-oil exports will need to generate about 85 per cent of Indonesia's total export earnings in 2000. Textile and timber products, the two main non-oil exports, are not showing substantial growth. Textile exports are actually slowing down. But there are fast-growing sectors, among which the World Bank lists ceramics, non-ferrous metals and electronic goods, which are poised to take over from oil. Oil industry dissatisfaction with the government's current terms are reflected in the downturn in recent exploration activity. A report by Mackay Consultants of the UK says the number of offshore exploration and appraisal wells drilled this year has fallen to 45, compared with 48 in 1993. Other analysts, such as Mr Gavin Law of international oil consultants Wood Mackenzie, say the downward trend is likely to continue, even though Indonesia has attractive frontier acreage, especially in the eastern part of the country around Irian Jaya. He believes part of the problem is that Jakarta does not allow companies to offset high frontier exploration costs against their more mature production elsewhere in the country. A single exploration well in Irian Jaya can cost Dollars 20m or more because of the remote location and harsh conditions, compared with Dollars 2m or so in more developed areas. The lack of exploration success has caused some western companies to reduce their presence in the country, concentrating, in preference, on neighbouring Malaysia and Vietnam where they say terms are better. Other companies, however, are responding to the government's greater emphasis on gas. The signing last month of the Dollars 40bn contract with Exxon, the US energy group, to develop the giant Natuna gas field should help Indonesia to maintain its status as the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas. Other gas fields are being developed for power generation within Indonesia, although questions over future government policies on electricity pricing and regulation could still hamper plans for gas to increase its share of domestic primary energy consumption to 32 per cent by 2000, from the current level of 25 per cent.</p>

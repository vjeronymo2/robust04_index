			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / US stocks fall sharply amid fears of rate rise Shares on Wall Street fell sharply yesterday in response to worries that robust US economic growth reported on Friday would make interest rate rises more likely. However, fears of a Wall Street collapse proved unfounded. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 83 points to 3,552 in early trading but then rallied to close 42.61 points lower on the day at 3,593.35. Just before the close of trading, the White House sought to calm nervous investors. President Bill Clinton, speaking in Cleveland, Ohio, said he thought the reaction in the markets to Friday's jobs data was overdone and predicted interest rates would fall. 'I would encourage the American people not to overreact,' he said. US stock markets had been closed on Good Friday and yesterday was the first chance for share traders to react to Friday's announcement of a 456,000 increase in non-farm payrolls in March. The rise, the largest monthly increase since October 1987, indicated the US economy was growing strongly and raised fears the Federal Reserve Bank would find it necessary to push up interest rates again. The Fed has increased short-term rates from 3 to 3.5 per cent in two moves since early February. Since the first increase in short rates, on February 4, bond and share prices have fallen around the world. While share prices recovered late in the day, the bond market fell sharply amid heavy trading. The renewed fall, which pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year government bond up to 7.41 per cent, was prompted by technical factors and was not linked to any fresh economic news or the behaviour of the stock market. The 30-year government bond was down nearly 1 3/4 points on the day, having already fallen 1 1/2 points in thin holiday trading last Friday in reaction to the jobs data. Early today, the Tokyo market opened firmer, with the Nikkei 225 index rising more than 130 points to 19,257 within the first half hour of trading. However, yesterday's nervousness on Wall Street was expected to set the tone for stock markets in London, Paris and Frankfurt, which resume trading today after the Easter holiday. Traders expect further weakness in London shares. The FT-SE 100 index, which closed on Thursday at 3,086.4, is already 12.4 per cent down from its peak recorded on February 2. When the Dow fell 50 points at the start of yesterday's trading, restrictions on program trading were imposed, under New York Stock Exchange rules. However, there was no sense of panic and mutual fund management group Fidelity reported little sign of selling by private investors. Wall Street's weakness prompted heavy falls in several Latin American markets. Mexican stock prices ended more than 6 per cent down and Brazilian shares fell more than 10 per cent. Earlier, in anticipation of the fall on Wall Street, share prices in the rest of the world edged lower. Most European stock markets were closed for the day, although the Madrid general index fell 2.9 per cent to a low for the year. Asian stock markets mostly ended down, with traders nervous ahead of Wall Street's opening. Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand recorded falls of between 2 and 3.3 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------              WALL STREET'S NERVOUSNESS SETS THE TONE  ---------------------------------------------------------------- DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE  ----------------------------------------------------------------   1994 high (31/1)         3,987.36   Thursday (31/3)          3,635.96   Monday (4/4)             3,593.35  ---------------------------------------------------------------- NASDAQ COMPOSITE  ----------------------------------------------------------------   1994 high (18/3)           803.93   Thursday (31/3)            743.46   Monday (4/4)               727.41  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Japan (Nikkei 225 av)  ----------------------------------------------------------------   1994 high (16/3)        20,677.77   Friday (1/4)            19,277.16   Monday (4/4)            19,122.22  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Singapore (Straits Times)  ----------------------------------------------------------------   1994 high                 2,471.9   Friday (1/4)              2,080.9   Monday (4/4)              2,039.1  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Malaysia (KLSE composite)  ----------------------------------------------------------------   1994 high (5/1)          1,314.48   Friday (1/4)               959.94   Monday (4/4)               928.33  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Thailand (Bangkok SET)  ----------------------------------------------------------------   1994 high (4/1)          1,753.73   Thursday (31/3)          1,239.99   Monday (4/4)             1,196.54  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Brazil (Bovespa)  ----------------------------------------------------------------   1994 high (30/3)        15,156.00   Wednesday (30/3)        15,156.00   Monday (4/4)            13,550.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Mexico (IPC)  ----------------------------------------------------------------   1994 high (8/2)          2,881.17   Wednesday (30/3)         2,410.38   Monday (4/4)             2,265.49  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Editorial Comment Page 15 Lex Page 16 Global investor Page 21 World bonds Page 22 Equity markets Page 23 Emerging markets Page 24 Currency markets Page 24 World stocks Page 26</p>

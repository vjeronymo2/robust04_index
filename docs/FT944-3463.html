			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions behind 57% gain at Protean A first full contribution from acquisitions made at the end of last year helped Protean, the laboratory equipment and water purification company, to lift interim profits by 57 per cent. Pre-tax profits for the six months to end-September increased from Pounds 1.73m to Pounds 2.72m, while sales rose by 26 per cent to Pounds 23.8m (Pounds 18.9m). Excluding acquisitions, operating profits rose 19 per cent. Mr Geoff Spink, managing director, said the group was very pleased with its achievement over the past five years, during which earnings had doubled. Earnings per share in the first half rose from 4.21p to 5.52p, and the interim dividend is raised from 1.05p to 1.35p. The water purification side made operating profits of Pounds 984,000 on sales of Pounds 10.4m, compared with a previous Pounds 726,000 on sales of Pounds 11.6m. The group completed fewer industrial contracts, but was making better returns. Other scientific equipment and consumables lifted operating profits from Pounds 1.08m to Pounds 1.78m, with sales rising from Pounds 7.24m to Pounds 13.3m. The rise reflects the acquisition last December for Pounds 9m of Techne, which makes controlled temperature equipment, and LIP, a maker of medical and laboratory sample plastic bottles. The group has continued on the acquisition trail, paying Pounds 4.15m at the end of the first half for Jenway, a bench-top monitoring and analysis equipment manufacturer based in Essex. It wrote off Pounds 4m of goodwill with the purchase, reducing shareholders' funds to Pounds 8.8m against Pounds 11.3m at the March year end. Borrowings at end-September were Pounds 4.1m, giving gearing of 47 per cent. However, net interest paid was Pounds 48,000, down from Pounds 81,000.</p>

			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUSTRALIAN OPEN TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> GRAF LOOKS TOUGH, BUT LENDL MAY BE IN TOUGH  </P> <P> The $1.5-million Australian Open, where it all began for Steffi Graf and where  it has never happened for Ivan Lendl, begins Monday on the hard playing  surfaces at the National Tennis Center.  </P> <P> Graf should feel right at home. This is where she started banging her forehand  last year, on the way to winning the Grand Slam. When she got here, stepping  off the plane from West Germany after a 28-hour flight, Graf said she felt no  pressure to repeat.  </P> <P> "I have done and achieved everything I can," she said.  </P> <P> The same cannot be said for Lendl, who has never won the Australian and has  played in the final only once. Lendl lost to Mats Wilander in 1983, but that  was on another surface, the grass courts at Kooyong.  </P> <P> Last year, however, the Australian Open said so long to Kooyong and moved to  the National Tennis Center at Flinders Park, which features the Rebound Ace  hard-court surface. Wilander defeated Pat Cash in the final and went on to win  2 other Grand Slam events, the French Open and the U.S. Open, replacing Lendl  as No. 1 in the world rankings.  </P> <P> Across the international dateline, it may prove more difficult to know what day  it is for Wilander and Graf than to win in the early going. Think of it this  way: It's tomorrow right now Down Under but 5 hours earlier than it is in Los  Angeles. Thus, if it's noon Sunday in Los Angeles, it's 7 a.m. Monday here.  </P> <P> Sound simple? Consider the first-round opponents that Wilander and Graf drew.  Wilander, the top-seeded player, opens against Tobias Svantesson, who is ranked  95th in the world.  </P> <P> The top-seeded Graf plays Australian Kerry Anne Guse in the first round.  </P> <P> Lendl, ranked second in the world, plays a qualifier in the first round, and if  the seedings hold true, will face 10th-seeded Amos Mansdorf of Israel in the  fourth round, which is where the 2-week tournament really begins with its  toughest matches.  </P> <P> If the seedings hold up, Wilander will face his first serious test against  15th-seeded John Fitzgerald of Australia in the fourth round. Ninth-seeded  Miloslav Mecir should meet eighth-seeded Yannick Noah, third-seeded Boris  Becker should play 14th-seeded Jonas B. Svensson and 12-seeded Mikael Pernfors  should play sixth-seeded Henri Leconte.  </P> <P> Barring upsets, the fourth round also marks the beginning of difficulties for  players in the bottom half of the draw. Cash, 13th-seeded, would meet  fourth-seeded Stefan Edberg. Other fourth-round matches would include  fifth-seeded Jakob Hlasek against 11th-seeded Thomas Muster and seventh-seeded  John McEnroe against 10th-seeded Aaron Krickstein.  </P> <P> Martina Navratilova, seeded second behind Graf, plays Andrea Betzner of West  Germany in the first round and third-seeded Gabriela Sabatini plays Ceclia  Dahlman of Sweden. Graf figures to meet Sabatini in the semifinals. In the  bottom half of the draw, Navratilova should play fourth-seeded Pam Shriver in  the other semifinal.  </P></p>

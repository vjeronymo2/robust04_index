			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Differing impressions of European unity (1) Sir, Your leader, 'European union' (November 1), was timely and excellent. The UK government and much of the media are giving a false impression of the state of European union. If we are not careful, the UK will again miss the boat. Economic recovery needs the single market. A permanent European single market cannot be achieved without permanent monetary stability. The only feasible plan to achieve monetary stability is Emu, including, in due course, a single currency. Emu and a single currency will lead to further political integration. But it does not stop with the European union. A substantive increase in global multilateral trading needs both a successful Uruguay Round and monetary stability. Global monetary stability can only be achieved by a system being worked out between the US, Japan and the European Union. Stanley Crossick, chairman, Belmont European Policy Centre, 42 Boulevard Charlemagne, B4040 Brussels, Belgium</p>

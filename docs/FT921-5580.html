			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: BBL There seems no stopping the share price of Banque Bruxelles Lambert. Up by more than a quarter since bid gossip began in early December, the bank's paper was again in demand yesterday despite a firm denial of takeover interest from International Nederlanden Group. ING's statement, to be fair, does not rule out further purchases to add to its 9 per cent stake, but speculators are playing a dangerous game. While the assumption is that Groupe Bruxelles Lambert's Mr Albert Frere holds the ring with effective control over a 32 per cent stake in BBL, a lot depends on the still unknown intentions of his powerful allies at the French insurance group UAP. Creeping control by one side or the other still looks more likely than an all out fight.</p>

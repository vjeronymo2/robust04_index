			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Lopez shuns VW by staying at GM THE TUG-OF-WAR between General Motors and German rival Volkswagen over the services of Mr J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, the former head of worldwide purchasing at the US carmaker, appeared resolved yesterday when GM said Mr Lopez would not be leaving the company. A GM spokesman said: 'I can confirm that he will be staying at GM.' The announcement came just three days after Mr Lopez apparently delivered a blow to GM by unexpectedly resigning his position. At the time, it was reported that he was leaving to join the board of Volkswagen. Reflecting VW's dismay at the decision, the German carmaker yesterday blamed GM for putting pressure on Mr Lopez to stay. Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chief executive, said Lopez had come under 'persistent interventions' from GM colleagues and the pressure for him to stay had proved impossible to resist. Mr Lopez's decision to stay at GM will be a big boost to the US company. He had been the key figure in a drive by GM to cut its costs through a radical reorganisation in the way it buys parts in North America. VW said that at Mr Lopez's request his contract of employment with VW, which both sides had already signed, was to be set aside. Under the terms of the contract, which was to have been ratified at a meeting of VW's supervisory board tomorrow, Mr Lopez was to have started work at VW's Wolfsburg headquarters within a matter of weeks. 'What was originally on the agenda for (tomorrow's) board-meeting in relation to Mr Lopez is no longer on the agenda,' said Mr Ortwin Witzel, VW press spokesman yesterday. Mr Witzel said that both Mr Lopez and VW had agreed to talk about Mr Lopez's future with the European company later in the year. This may 'perhaps' lead to a decision to employ Mr Lopez later in the year, Mr Witzel said. It seems unlikely, however, that Mr Lopez would continue to work at GM while entertaining the possibility of moving to work for a competitor. Mr Lopez is credited with giving GM's European operations the most competitive cost structure of any European volume carmaker while VW labours under probably the worst cost structure.</p>

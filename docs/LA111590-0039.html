			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC AT LARGE: DAHR UNCAGED, COURTESY OF THE FEMINIST IBSEN  </P> <P> The struggle of women for recognition and equality seems as contemporary as the  ERA but is, in truth, as old as gender itself, and Sappho, Boadicea and Joan of  Arc. Down the decades the desires and the frustrations have been observed and  enunciated by men as well as women.  </P> <P> In modern times, Ingmar Bergman's "Scenes From a Marriage" caught poignantly  the tugs and pride of rising consciousness and the thrust to liberation. He had  a Scandinavian predecessor, Henrik Ibsen, who, in his 19th-Century day, created  a gallery of remarkable, vigorous women.  </P> <P> The Norwegian actress Juni (pronounced Yuni) Dahr was last in Los Angeles in  1988 doing a one-woman show called "Joan of Arc: Vision Through Fire." The  sense of her evening was to present Joan the real human being, with fears and  doubts, rather than the myth or the saint.  </P> <P> Now Dahr has returned to Los Angeles for a one-time-only showcase performance  (Monday night at the Westwood Playhouse) of a new show she has fashioned called  "Ibsen Women: Put an Eagle in a Cage." The subtitle is from Ibsen's "Vikings of  Helgeland," and what the character, Hjordis, says in full is, "Put an eagle in  a cage and it will bite the bars, whether they are of iron or gold."  </P> <P> Ibsen's women are frequently encaged, in some cases preferring death or flight  to the ongoing entrapments. Dahr portrays Hjordis as one of the five Ibsen  women in view. She is also Hilde in "The Master Builder," Hedda in "Hedda  Gabler," Mrs. Alving in "Ghosts" and Nora in "A Doll's House."  </P> <P> The idea for the Ibsen evening, Dahr says, arose while she was doing "Joan of  Arc" in Los Angeles. She developed it while in residence at NYU under a  Fulbright grant and another from the Norwegian government. It was first  performed in 1989 at an international Ibsen symposium at Yale and has since  been seen in New York, at Stratford-on-Avon in England, in Rome, throughout  Scandinavia and in San Francisco last week.  </P> <P> "Why is Ibsen so actual today?" Dahr asks in a kind of unabating wonder. "He  taught me what it is to be a woman today, what it is to be free. He writes  about what it is to be engaged not only with society but within yourself. He  sees what is freedom, even within relationships."  </P> <P> Dahr talks with audiences after the performances and says that men respond to  the material as well as women. "They want to talk to me about their marriages  and their relationships," she says.  </P> <P> "Ibsen once said that if you want to know him, you must know Norway. I change  it. I think if you want to know Norway you must know Ibsen. The Norwegian soul  has a dark side and a light side."  </P> <P> Dahr is from Oslo, and acting appealed to her early on. "The child inside you  wants to search, explore, to see rooms I don't know about, people I haven't  met." But she was also shy as a child and deferred the acting. She spent a year  in the mountains in the ecologically aware '70s, worrying about nature,  survival, our separation from our roots. But in the end she went to the  national dramatic school in Oslo, then spent a dozen years in repertory at the  National Theater in Bergen.  </P> <P> Norwegian television filmed her "Joan of Arc." "I'd only done it mostly in  churches and ruins, and I couldn't do it on a stage. So we took a crew and went  to an island in the far north, a tiny place with ruins, 4,000 people and 8  million birds. The people had never seen theater."  </P> <P> Earlier she had spent a year in Poland, studying at Grotowski's avant-garde  Theatre Laboratory, where she mastered enough of the language to be able to  act. She and her sister Eva have formed a film production company and made a  prize-winning short called "Dolce Vita," which was shown at the Women in Film  festival here. They now have in post-production a feature called "Troll," from  a story by the Norwegian writer Jonas Lie. It is not, she says, about the cute  figures of folklore but rather about the demons within us.  </P> <P> For information about Dahr's Monday night performance, call (213) 208-5454.  </P></p>

The press service of the prosecutor's office said that  Kazannik had adopted the decision after acquainting himself with  a medical statement which said that Barannikov "needs a special  medical examination in hospital to decide on the necessity of  surgical treatment which makes it impossible for him to remain  in an investigation prison".    Barannikov was released on conditions that he does not leave  Moscow.    Barannikov's lawyer had several times complained that his  client was suffering from heart problems.    In January Barannikov was transferred from prison to a  specially guarded hospital and his lawyer demanded that he be  placed under house arrest.</p>

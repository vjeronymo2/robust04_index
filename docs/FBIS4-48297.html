			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report] </F>   [Text] A strong political party outside Parliament is  capable of achieving more than a weak one inside Parliament.  This is the opinion of Conservative Party [CP] and Afrikaner  National Front leader Ferdi Hartzenberg.    Dr. Hartzenberg said in Pretoria that the role of the CP had  not come to an end. In fact, the real struggle for  self-determination has only just begun and the CP will have to  take the lead in this struggle. Today the Afrikaners are  standing where they stood on 31 May 1902, when they were also  not represented in Parliament. Within eight years they had  attained self-government as a result of work accomplished by  parties outside Parliament.    A party inside Parliament has only a certain power base,  which in some cases can be restrictive. A party's support is  measured by the number of votes during the last election. Its  power base can therefore not really be expanded since it is  pinned down to the representation which it has inside  Parliament. An extra-Parliamentary party, on the contrary, is  not subject to this limitation.    Dr. Hartzenberg added that once again the CP will strive for  Afrikaner unity and that it would resume contact with nations  that are striving for self-determination.    What is important, however, is that the structures of the  CP,  in view of its new, challenging role, should be brought to  preparedness within the shortest possible time. A campaign of  reorganization will be initiated, while the CP's Executive  Committee will have to discuss certain technical modifications.    In this context, Dr. Hartzenberg made a very serious appeal  to all CP members to throw in their support to make the party  structure more streamlined and effective than ever before.</p>

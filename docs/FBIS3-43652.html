			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Radio Pretoria has defied the Home Affairs  Department's refusal to grant the station a further broadcasting  license. The Afrikaans right-wing radio station went on the air  at 6 O'clock [0400 GMT] this morning. According to a source  close to the station, trenches and other defensive positions  which have been dug around the Donkerhoek broadcasting site east  of Pretoria have been manned by the station's supporters in  anticipation of a police raid. Radio Pretoria mainly broadcasts  traditional Afrikaans music, as well as talk shows, interviews  and news bulletins with a distinct right-wing anti-government  feeling.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic by </F> Robert Hochner; Silajdzic in Sarajevo, Hochner in Vienna --  live; Silajdzic statements in English with simultaneous German  translation]    [Text] [Hochner] In the studio in Sarajevo I now welcome  Haris Silajdzic, the prime minister of Bosnia. Good evening,  Mr. Prime Minister.    [Silajdzic] Yes, hello.    [Hochner] Mr. Prime Minister, over the past hours we have  heard reports that shooting has broken out in Sarajevo again.  Do you fear that the cease-fire, which is not even two months  old, may crumble in your capital?    [Silajdzic] Yes, for the first time in a month we have had  shooting again, 10 to 12 shells came into Sarajevo. Of course,  this is something that worries us very much, but we have  expected it after the weak, limited UN warning to the Serbs, the  aggressors, in Gorazde. In my view, they were encouraged by the  half-hearted UN mission in Gorazde, a mission that was also  delayed, because for 15 days people were being killed and  attacked there, and when the UN and NATO finally intervened,  this was too limited really to give them a clear message.    [Hochner] What is the situation like in Gorazde today, as  far as you know? Is the town in danger of being taken by the  Serbs?    [Silajdzic] Of course, there is always such a danger. As  you know, we do not have any weapons, we do not have any  ammunition, and the people in Gorazde.... [sentence incomplete  as heard] About 200 people have died since the beginning of the  attacks; 720 people have been injured, some of them are in  danger of losing their lives, of course. The situation is not  good at all. As I said, I think that the Serbs feel encouraged  by all that they have been able to achieve with the  international community. I do not think that this course of  action was productive for the peace process, because the warning  was not strong enough.    [Hochner] Russia's envoy to Bosnia, Churkin, said this  evening that the Serbs have promised him to agree to a  cease-fire. Do you know anything about this agreement, and do  you believe that such a cease-fire can be achieved in your  country through Russian mediation?    [Silajdzic] Permit me to say here that we are -- at least I  am -- greatly frustrated by this very late Russian initiative,  which is coming now toward the end to set a diplomatic sign.  Where were they 15 days ago, or seven days ago, or just three  days ago, when people were dying like flies and the Serbs were  shelling not only civilians but also attacking UN troops?    We say that it was a mistake to carry out these air raids.  [German sentence as heard] It was said that the Russians were  not consulted. I think it was a grave mistake to let them take  all these diplomatic steps whenever they want to. I think one  should adopt a clear position and those who committed this crime  should be punished. We are now practically the hostages of a  geopolitical situation, in which one has to consult the Russians  regarding all details. People are being killed -- and the  attackers should be punished for that. A withdrawal must take  place, and as long as such a withdrawal does not take place, we  will not hold talks. If they withdraw behind the line from  where the attack started, then the peace process may continue.    Let me add one thing, they are now holding 58 UNPROFOR  observers hostage. They have stopped all the humanitarian  convoys. That behavior belongs to the Stone Age. In the end,  we will probably have to talk to them, make concessions to them,  go to Geneva again or somewhere else, where speeches are made  then about how the Serbs became victims because of the UN and  NATO troops. I believe that this farce should stop. They are  fascist criminals and they must be punished.    [Hochner] Mr. Prime Minister, thank you very much for this  interview. Good evening to Sarajevo.</p>

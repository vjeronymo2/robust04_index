			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Survey of Computers and Communications (1): Paths to open systems clear - As telecommunications and computing converge, the drive towards seamless networked systems is speeding up and the large vendors are at last backing the introduction of an industry-wide set of rules THE SLOW but inevitable convergence of computing and telecommunications is providing the motive force for an implosion of new information processing practices and technologies. A lexicon of neologisms has emerged to label these concepts: enterprise-wide computing, co-operative computing, client-server architectures, plug-and-play environments, rightsizing. What they all amount to is new ways of describing a concept more than a quarter of a century old: distributed data processing or ddp, the idea that computer power can be spread throughout an organisation if it can be contained in small enough packets. For many companies it means substituting a large number of small computers connected in networks for a small number of larger machines. International Business Machines (IBM), the world's largest computer manufacturer and staunchest defender of data processing centred on mainframe computers, is joining in. Last month among a raft of new communications products it announced adaptors (special circuit boards) that allow portable computers unprecedented access to corporate information systems as well as announcing plans that could see CICS, its flagship transaction processing software, dominating the open - or vendor independent - systems environment. The range of issues now encompassed by distributed data processing is bewilderingly broad. At one end of the spectrum is the dilemma of how to manage very large data networks, now the biggest concern among information technology managers. At the other, the question of which operating system should prevail in the open data processing environment of the late 1990s. It is also providing the dynamo for the growth of a large number of entrepreneurial companies which were quick to recognise the possibilities of computer communications. These include Novell, the leader in software for personal computer networking and 3Com and Cisco which specialise in 'internetworking', providing the hardware and software which allows local and wide area networks to talk to one another. These developments are taking place against a background of the worst instability the computer industry has known. Prices are tumbling as improved technology cuts the cost of components. Distribution channels are being undermined as gross profit margins narrow. The global recession is forcing customers to put a cap on capital investment. The large telecommunications companies, meanwhile, are taking a new interest in computing services, the fastest growing area of the computer industry. BT has emerged as one of the largest systems integration companies in the UK. France Telecom is negotiating to take a stake in Sema Group, the large Anglo-French services company. Mercury Communications, BT's principal competition in the UK is moving into managed data communications, securing, among others, a Pounds 15m, five-year contract with TSB Retail Banking and Insurance. The purpose behind these activities, whether overt or not, is the creation of 'intelligent networks' which will give customers greater control of their telecommunications and cost savings from improved allocation of network resources. For the telecommunications companies intelligent networks will provide an integrated, managed, services environment. Competition is already developing between the big companies to provide managed voice and data networking services for international companies. The growth of computer communication is underpinned by a number of trends, including the evolution of open systems. Standards are at the heart of open systems. One of the most abused of industry terms, open systems simply imply computers that can easily be connected into communications networks and with the capacity to run software from any supplier obeying the open systems rules. Last month Mr Jim Manzi, chief executive of Lotus Development Corporation told the Etre conference of top computer industry executives that open systems were the only way customers could expect an uninterrupted return on their investment in computerisation. Many corporations share a common dilemma. Their operations, whether national or international, have grown in response to a business strategy in which information technology played little part. The result is all too often an electronic Tower of Babel of incompatible computers and software which denies senior management the chance to create enterprise-wide communications and has meant corporations have derived fewer benefits than expected from considerable investments in computers and communications. This dissatisfaction is driving the open systems movement. Large vendors, while paying lip service to open systems, have been less than enthusiastic about implementing them because of heavy investment in their own designs. Digital Equipment and IBM were networking pioneers - IBM through its mainframe networking protocol Systems Network Architecture and DEC through its VAX compatible computer line - but tardy in implementing open systems. Both are now changing rapidly. Earlier this month IBM announced early support for the latest version of an industry-wide set of rules that guarantee a product conforms to open systems standards. The rules are set by X/Open, a worldwide, independent open systems organisation which is dedicated to developing a multivendor Common Applications Environment, based on both formal industry standards and standards which have become accepted de facto. X/Open's new set of specifications, XPG4, comprises 22 separate components covering operating systems and languages, data management, user interfaces, general interworking, mainframe interworking, PC interworking and media. Products which meet the XPG4 specifications will pass the open systems interoperability test and can safely be connected together in corporate-wide networks. Advances in open systems are still confused by the arguments over operating systems. There are still those who see open systems as synonymous with Unix, a multi-tasking, multi-user operating system developed by AT&amp;T and now championed by Unix International, a non-profit organisation responsible for directing the evolution of Unix System V, an industry standard. Competition for Unix will be seen from Microsoft with Windows NT, IBM with OS/2 and Taligent, an IBM and Apple joint venture, with a operating system codenamed 'Pink'. Just as portable telephones have revolutionised conventional communications, so tiny portable 'digital communicators' capable of handling voice, data and image, are expected to revolutionise computer communications. Apple, AT&amp;T in co-operation with Matsushita, Marubeni and EO, have already announced product intentions. IBM is not expected to be far behind.</p>

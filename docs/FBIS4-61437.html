			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Arkadiy Pasechnik: "Dniester Breakthrough"] </F>   [Text] Chisinau -- Local and foreign observers described  the meeting which took place on the eve of the May Day  celebrations in Tiraspol as a most significant political step, a  kind of breakthrough, in resolving the very complex problem of  the Dniester Region. It resulted in a statement signed by  President of Moldavia [Moldova] Mircea Snegur and Dniester  Region leader Igor Smirnov.    The document notes that a new sociopolitical situation has  now developed, which is an important prerequisite for the  successful resolution of this protracted crisis, which has  inflicted colossal damage on the economy and claimed many lives.  The sides emphasized their exclusive commitment to peaceful  means of resolving the conflict based on the existing social,  economic, and political realities. A firm intention was  expressed to take into consideration the CSCE mission's  recommendations, the Russian Federation's views, and the  positive experience gained from securing peace settlements in  other regions.    At the meeting, in which a CSCE mission representative, R.S.  Semuel [name as transliterated], and the Russian president's  plenipotentiary, Ambassador V. Vasev, took the role of  mediators, the sides agreed to begin the process of negotiations  immediately and without any preconditions on a whole range of  issues of mutual interest. Among the most important of these  questions is, of course, that of determining the Dniester  Region's legal status as a state. Moreover, the statement noted  that it is necessary to remove all barriers preventing the  normal utilization of commercial and economic and social and  cultural ties, and to ensure their revival and development. The  sides agreed on the need for a step-by-step program to create  and implement legal state relations and in general to implement  mutual agreements.    It is hard to overestimate the importance of the document,  which has finally come into being after many years' bitter  confrontation and after the bloody armed conflict of the summer  of 1992. But it is, nevertheless, no accident that one Chisinau  newspaper immediately described it as a protocol of intent.  Certainly good intent. However, only goodwill, realism, and  persistence on the part of politicians can implement it, meeting  the keen expectations of people on both sides of the Dniester.</p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Survey of Corporate Finance (1): Small deals, fewer risks - Takeover activity is well below that in the late 1980s. Parts of the corporate finance market, such as advice on privatisations and cross-border deals, are buoyant, but small businesses are finding loans harder to get from risk- averse banks THE CORPORATE finance business has gone back to basics. The days of hostile mega-takeover bids or of radical innovations in financing techniques seem long past. Today's mergers tend to be motivated by industrial logic rather than driven by pure financial goals. Companies have become more conservative in a second sense - they take greater care to understand the risks associated with selling a complex financial instrument. Nonetheless, the volume of debt and equity issues by public companies has reached record levels in the UK and US over the past few months. These trends are a response to several factors: Worldwide recession, which has reduced companies' appetite for expansion and thus for big takeover bids; The huge level of indebtedness taken on by companies in the boom years of the 1980s, which now needs refinancing; Accounting changes, which have reduced the scope for the sort of financial engineering which encouraged big takeovers and also the issue of complex securities; The financial difficulties of companies which issued hybrid securities or dabbled in derivative markets without properly understanding the risks or the true costs. Published statistics show a stark picture of low takeover activity. In the UK, for example, Schroders came top of Acquisition Monthly's league table of financial advisers in the first six months of this year, having given advice on seven takeovers with an aggregate value of Pounds 491m. In the late 1980s, when individual bids were worth billions, a merchant bank would have just scraped into the top ten with that figure. There was an almost equally flat performance in 1992, when there were only two takeovers or mergers valued at over Pounds 1bn: HSBC Holdings' takeover of Midland Bank and Reed International's merger with Elsevier of the Netherlands. SG Warburg topped the 1992 takeover league table, having acted in just six deals. The pattern in the US is similar. The value of takeover deals in 1992 was Dollars 97.1bn, according to Merrill Lynch Business Brokerage and Valuation. This was the second lowest figure in nine years - though a third higher than in the previous year. However, the volume of deals in the US is picking up, even if the value of the individual deals is small. There are also some signs that those merchant banks and securities firms which have invested most heavily in building up international networks of offices are belatedly deriving a competitive advantage. According to Securities Data, the top three advisers on majority acquisitions of companies anywhere in the world in 1992 have all made huge efforts to establish operations across the globe: the US house, Goldman Sachs, in the leading position having advised on deals worth Dollars 54bn, the First Boston/Credit Suisse network as number two with a tally of Dollars 33.6bn, and SG Warburg of the UK as number three, with deals worth Dollars 33.1bn. However, one part of the corporate finance market which is booming is the giving of advice on privatisations. The new French government recently announced an extremely ambitious privatisation programme. The Italian government, in spite of the country's economic difficulties, is pressing ahead with the sale of state assets. The UK government is continuing to realise public assets - the sale of the third tranche of British Telecommunications shares being the biggest such transaction this year. Finally, there are substantial sales of state assets throughout eastern Europe and south America - while in China there are opportunities for joint ventures and licensing agreements. Another relatively buoyant part of the corporate finance market is cross-border deals. In the past 18 months, highlights have included the Reed-Elsevier merger, British Telecommunications' tie-up with MCI in the US, and Hanson's acquisition of US-based Quantum. Meanwhile, in the UK there has been a surge of equity issues, as public companies take advantage of buoyant stock market conditions to rebuild their balance sheets. According to a survey by IFR Securities Data, the amount of new equity capital raised in the first half of this year was 6.6 per cent more than that raised in the whole of last year. A total of Pounds 11.8bn has so far been raised this year, compared with Pounds 11bn in 1992. This year's first half total of 294 new issues is 72 per cent ahead of the figure at the same stage last year. The preferred method of money raising continues to be the traditional rights issue of shares to existing shareholders, with Pounds 7.48bn having been raised in this way. SG Warburg topped the league table of merchant bankers handling the new equity issues and Cazenove was the leading broker. In the US, new stocks and bonds worth Dollars 530bn were sold in the first six months of 1993, well above the previous record of Dollars 445bn set in the first half of 1992. The growth of debt offerings was caused in part by the lowest interest rates in three decades. These encouraged many companies to pay off expensive existing debt with new, cheaper debt. There was also strong demand for equity from companies. A record Dollars 47bn in new shares was sold between January and the end of June. However, more than half of this was in the form of initial public offerings or company flotations. The number of big companies careering towards bankruptcy has fallen, but this is not undiluted good news for corporate finance departments. It has led to a reduction in fee-earning opportunities from advising on financial reconstructions. Nonetheless, the negotiations on restructuring the debt of GPA, the world's biggest aircraft leasing company, have provided rich pickings for a pack of financial, legal and accounting advisers. But one type of company in several countries - notably the US and the UK - has become concerned that traditional sources of finance have become more difficult to tap. Small and medium-size companies complain that banks are increasingly reluctant to lend to them or only to make loans at penal rates of interest. Banks quibble with these complaints. They say that the recession has led to a shortage of demand for funds from 'bankable' companies. If the demand for loans was there, the banks say, they would provide them. What has happened is that banks have become more risk-averse in the past couple of years. Their biggest loan losses in recent years have come from lending to small companies, so they have become far more careful in analysing the quality of the potential borrower before making a commitment to lend. A second factor is reducing the supply of new loans to this sector. Regulators are forcing banks to adhere to tougher standards of capital adequacy - rules governing the amount of capital a bank must have in proportion to the loans it makes - than a few years ago. The less that a bank lends, relative to a given stock of capital, the better its capital ratio. So today when capital is in short supply, banks are lending at a slower rate than in the 1980s. However, small companies are particularly vulnerable to this slowdown in bank lending, because even bank regulators perceive them to be particularly risky customers. When calculating the risk asset ratio, the commonly agreed international standard of capital adequacy, a home loan or purchase of government bonds carries a lower risk weighting than a corporate loan. That means if a bank makes a loan to a small company of a given size, its capital ratio is reduced by a greater amount than if it makes a home loan of equivalent size  -so it will only make that corporate loan if it believes the profitability of doing so is greater than in making a home loan. In other areas of corporate finance, leading investment banks say their pipeline of potential mergers and acquisitions deals is far greater than a year ago. What no one is predicting is a return to the corporate finance boom conditions of the 1980s.</p>

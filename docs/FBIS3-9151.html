			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Konstantin Subchev commentary: "Officers and Clerks"] </F>   [Text] Despite the experiments that have been going on now  for five years, the situation of the Bulgarian Army is not  stabilizing but, on the contrary, is becoming tragic. At  present Albania is the only Balkan neighbor on whom we can rely,  although even this is doubtful.    There was no place from where the 37 billion leva requested  by the Rakovski Officer Legion could come. Subsequently, the  Defense Ministry will have to make do with what it has.    Cuts are inevitable in such a situation.    What is bad is that in such cases the proverb that while the  fish begins to stink at the head they are beginning to clean it  at the tail applies to Bulgaria.    If the current army payroll does not change, even the  Brazilians and Thais, who are proverbial for their "inflation"  of higher military ranks, will begin to laugh at us.    Today there are 22,000 officers, 27,000 sergeants, and  36,000  soldiers in the Bulgarian Army. In other words, for every  soldier there is one payroll officer or sergeant.    That is one aspect of the problem. The other is that the  cuts of officers and sergeants that have been carried out  created the suspicion that a political purge was under way, or  more precisely a process of settling personal accounts and  striving to survive on a political pretext. As a result there  are not enough platoon and company commanders for combat units,  while the headquarter offices are full.    Now they say that the army must be cut 50 percent if it is  to  be maintained within the framework of the current budget. This,  however, does not prevent new lists of high-ranking officers who  should be promoted from being presented.    At Slivnitsa the Bulgarian captains defeated the Serb  generals. This means that the number of stars on the shoulder  straps have nothing to do with the state of the army.    As Clausewitz said, "victory is a result of the number of  soldiers and the personal qualities of the officers."    We do not have enough soldiers. We cannot even dream of  having a professional army because of purely financial reasons.  At least let us make sure that after the next cut the army  manages to retain young and able officers rather than clerks and  bureaucrats in uniform.    Clerks are incapable of being in charge of defense, or God  forbid, waging a war.</p>

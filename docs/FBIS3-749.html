			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by E. H. Kemp] </F>   [Text] Pretoria March 11 SAPA -- The chairman of the  Independent Electoral Commission [IEC], Mr Justice Johann  Kriegler, flew to Mmabatho on Friday [11 March] night to ensure  that the Bophuthatswana government will co-operate fully with  the IEC. This follows two hours of talks between President F W  de Klerk and ANC President Nelson Mandela in Pretoria on the  Bophuthatswana crisis.    Mr Justice Kriegler will meet President Lucas Mangope to  obtain his assurance that free and fair elections will be  allowed in the territory. He will submit a report which will be  discussed by the management committee of the Transitional  Executive Council [TEC] on Saturday.    Mr Mandela, flanked by ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa  and SA Communist Party Chairman Joe Slovo, told journalists Mr  Mangope's statement on Friday in which he said he would  recommend to the Bophuthatswana parliament that the homeland  participate in the April election, was "inadequate". He said the  Transitional Executive Council had laid down four conditions  with which Bophuthatswana had to comply in order to normalise  the situation.    Besides committing itself to free and fair elections and  co-operating with the IEC, the TEC's resolution also demanded  that Mmabatho remove all restrictions on free political activity  and co-operate fully with the TEC regarding its reincorporation  into South Africa.    Asked whether Mr Mangope had effectively been restored to  power, the ANC president said information from both the South  African Defence Force [SADF] and the commander of the  Bophuthatswana Defence Force [BDF] indicated that Mr Mangope had  "lost the loyalty and control over the security forces.    "He has also lost control over the civil service and the  masses in Bophuthatswana. There is no government in  Bophuthatswana."    Both Mr Mandela and Mr de Klerk said it was essential that  there should be full co-operation between the South African  Government and the TEC on stabilising the situation in  Bophuthatswana.    Mr de Klerk said the security situation had been brought  under control by the SADF, with the full co-operation of the BDF.    He said members of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging  [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] had left the territory and a  group rallied by Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front]  leader Gen Constand Viljoen was also in the process of leaving.    Mr de Klerk said in terms of the TEC act, the governments of  each of the independent states would remain in office until the  election. referring to Bophuthatswana, he said: "In less than  two months, that government will stop governing. It will then be  replaced by a new negotiated system. This is the last chapter of  an old imperfect system."    He denied any agreement between himself and Mr Mandela that  Mr Mangope should be removed from office. Mr de Klerk said the  objective of Friday's negotiations was not to restore Mr Mangope  to power "on the same basis as he held power yesterday".    "His statement today has changed that. He is now committed  to  participating in the election."    Mr de Klerk said he believed Gen Viljoen had tried to "play  a  constructive role to prevent an escalation of the violence and  restore law and order".</p>

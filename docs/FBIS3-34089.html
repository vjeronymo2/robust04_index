Our correspondent in Washington Arye  Golan reports that, in all, eight meetings attended by only few  officials were held far from the media. Despite this format, no  substantial progress is reported on any of the tracks. The  talks will resume in Washington in about two weeks.    Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres hopes it will be possible to  finalize two or three clauses with Yasir 'Arafat in Cairo next  week in order to pave the road for implementing the autonomy  agreement in the territories. Minister Peres spoke with  correspondents in the White House before meeting U.S. Vice  President Al Gore. He emphasized that the two sides are trying  to adhere to the timetable, but it will not adversely affect the  negotiations if they continue another week or another month.    Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has rejected a proposal to send  Yo'el Singer, the Foreign Ministry's legal adviser, to talks  with the PLO representatives in Cairo this week. Mr. Rabin  decided that the talks will not be resumed before Foreign  Minister Peres returns from the United States. This is reported  by our political correspondent Shlomo Raz.    In the Davos talks it has transpired that the Palestinians  want to establish outposts manned by Palestinian policemen along  the traffic axes in the Gaza Strip. Israel is opposed to this.  Prime Minister Rabin is also opposed to the deployment of  Palestinian customs inspectors at the crossing points.</p>

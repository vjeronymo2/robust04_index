			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to provide for the safe navigation of commercial mariners and the recreational boating public as well as the safe operation of this helicopter sightseeing service, the Captain of the Port of New York deems a regulated navigation area to be necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Proposed Amendments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Coast Guard proposes to establish a regulated navigation area in Upper New York Bay for the operations of this helicopter sightseeing service. The regulated navigation area will prohibit all vessel traffic within defined boundaries during specified times except for the water taxis operating in conjunction with the heliport. The water taxis serving the heliport may enter and transit freely within the regulated navigation area at anytime except while a helicopter is landing on or taking off from the heliport. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The area proposed for designation as a regulated navigation area is located in the waters south southwest of Liberty Island and west of Federal Anchorage 20D in Upper New York Bay. This regulated navigation area will include all waters within a 150 yard radius measured from a point in the center of the heliport's anchoring zone at or near 40 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;10 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;52 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;N latitude and 074 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;03 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;29 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;W longitude. This 150 yard radius or regulated navigation area is located approximately 650 yards west of Federal Anchorage 20D and 1,450 yards south of the Statue of Liberty. Two channels, Pierhead and Terminal Channels, are located approximately 350 yards and 475 yards, respectively, south southwest of the proposed regulated navigation area. Vessel traffic in these channels consists primarily of tugs and tows. This proposed regulated navigation area is also in the vicinity of two foul areas; one located to the north and the other located to the east. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard deems this regulated navigation area necessary to ensure the safety of vessel traffic that may desire to transit the area. The regulated navigation area encompasses the 50 yard radius identified as the heliport's anchoring zone and an additional 100 yard radius around this anchoring zone. The 100 yard radius is the minimum distance deemed necessary to protect transiting vessel traffic in the event of an unforeseen mishap aboard or near the heliport. Helicopter flights are expected to occur frequently throughout each operating day; the exact number of flights will be determined by customer demand and the length of sightseeing tours chosen. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During a helicopter landing or takeoff from the heliport, the water taxis must remain outside a 200 foot radius measured around the heliport. This 200 foot radius is needed to ensure the safety of the water taxis during landing and takeoff operations. It allows for the helicopter pilot and heliport operator to concentrate solely on landing and takeoff operations without the distraction of an approaching vessel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Due to the fact that Heli-Carriers operates both the heliport and the water taxis, safety concerns for the water taxis are different than they are for other vessel traffic. Operators of the water taxis and the heliport can maintain a level of communication which will allow for the passing of maneuvering intentions, exchange of schedule and flight pattern changes, and the passing of any other information that may be necessary to ensure the safety of the water taxi and its passengers within the regulated navigation area. This level of communication cannot be maintained with other vessel traffic that may desire to transit the area. Therefore, while the 200 foot radius during the landing and takeoff of a helicopter is deemed sufficient for the safety of the water taxis, the 150 yard radius identified as the regulated navigation area is necessary for the safety of all other vessel traffic. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Restrictions on vessel movement and operation within this proposed regulated navigation area will be lifted during those hours that the helicopter sightseeing service is scheduled not to operate. During these hours, daily from sunset to 10 a.m., commercial and recreational vessels that can safely transit the waters within the regulated navigation area may do so without restriction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Heli-Carriers has indicated that their start up operations will not include aircraft re-fueling operations aboard the heliport. Heli-Carriers may, however, choose to exercise their option to conduct aircraft re-fueling operations aboard the heliport sometime in the future. Should Heli-Carriers opt to conduct re-fueling operations within this regulated navigation area, the Coast Guard will reevaluate their operations and the sufficiency of this regulated navigation area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing in this regulated navigation area relieves Heli-Carriers from complying with all Federal, State, and local regulations that pertain to this heliport operation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

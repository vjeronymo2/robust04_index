			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- Foreign public  demanded the release of An Hak-sop, a prisoner of war, who was a  soldier of the Korean People's Army during the Korean war.    The Amnesty International recently called on the world  people  and human rights organisations to launch a campaign for his  release.    The Central Committee of the Malian Red Cross in a statement  of March 25 noted that though An Hak-sop was arrested while  discharging his military duty, he was kept in South Korean  prison for more than 40 years on a "spy" charge. The statement  strongly urged the South Korean authorities to immediately  release An Hak-sop and other prisoners of war and political  prisoners.    The Senegalese organisation for friendship with the  fraternal  Korean people in a statement of April 6 branded the persecution  of An Hak-sop as a wanton violation of human rights and  affirmatively appraised the appeal of the Amnesty International  for his release.</p>

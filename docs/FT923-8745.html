			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Paper recycling undermined by cheap German imports THE UK's capacity to recycle waste paper is being severely eroded by German environmental initiatives, making it unlikely that the industry will ever meet government targets, according to senior industry figures. A glut of cheap recycled cardboard boxes from Germany, stemming from its massive national recycling initiative, has undercut UK prices by as much as 15 per cent, rendering many recycling programmes unprofitable and leading to the collapse of several waste collection companies. Recycling rates for UK paper are dropping from last year's high of 34 per cent. This year, recycling capacity for corrugated board has been cut by 157,000 tonnes, 10 per cent of the sector's total. The newsprint sector has also come under pressure as a result of cheap Canadian imports. Overall, the UK recycles 3m tonnes of waste paper a year. The British Paper and Board Industry Federation said: 'The increase in consumption of waste paper has been at a lower rate than the overall increase in paper and board consumption in the first two quarters of 1992. 'This is the first time that such a trend has occurred for many, many years. It is an alarming statistic.' Mr Peter Williams, chief executive of David S Smith, the UK's biggest waste paper collector and recycler, said the situation in the paper packaging sector had now reached 'crisis proportions'. He said that without government intervention the UK paper industry would never achieve the recycling targets in the 1990 environment white paper, let alone those in last month's European Commission directive on packaging waste. This said that 60 per cent of every class of packaging material should be recycled within 10 years of the directive's implementation. The UK government is studying a consultant's report into the most effective means of applying economic incentives to stimulate greater rates of recycling. But, unless such measures are introduced quickly, the paper industry fears it will become increasingly difficult to recover ground lost to other European countries.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Kawi Chongkittithawon: "Gains for Thailand </F> in Cambodian Peace Talks"]    [Text] There are good reasons for Thailand to host the  Round Table for Peace and National Reconciliation between Phnom  Penh and the Khmer Rouge.    The most important of these is the credibility of Prime  Minister Chuan Likphai, which remains intact despite the fact  that, almost without exception, his subordinates, including  Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri, have made comments harmful to  Thai-Cambodian relations.    Although beset with domestic problems, Chuan should not  remain idle over such an important foreign policy issue.    The prime minister, still respected to some degree by  Cambodian leaders, should take this opportunity to offer  Thailand, specifically Phatthaya or Hua Hin, as a neutral venue  for peace talks.    In July 1991, a similar feeling of despair over peace  prospects prevailed among Cambodian leaders. Then Thai Prime  Minister Anan Panyarachun, equally burdened with domestic issues  at the time, agreed to host the historic Phatthaya peace talks  which led to the signing of the Paris peace accords. For Anan,  it was a great risk, but it was one that paid off.    Last week, King Norodom Sihanouk suggested Paris or Jakarta  as possible venues for the roundtable. In principle, these two  locations are ideal as France and Indonesia were cochairmen of  the Paris International Conference on Cambodia, which brought an  end to the conflict in that country. However, in practice, it  is still very difficult to see how the proposed talks could take  place there. It would be too costly and too far away.    As Cambodia's next door neighbour, Thailand should take up  the challenge to host the meeting and help the Cambodian  factions achieve national reconciliation as soon as possible.  Otherwise, the ongoing fighting between the Cambodian and Khmer  Rouge troops would continue to affect the Thai villagers at the  border and worse, it could draw Thailand into the undesirable  war -- especially at a time when the Thai military leaders are  extremely frustrated with the border situation.    More than ever before, Thailand can play a useful role in  the  upcoming talks among the Cambodian faction. Since the  UN-sponsored election in May last year, which led to the  formulation of the current Cambodian government, Thailand has  been labelled as a pariah, primarily because of its relations  with the Khmer Rouge. The country has been repeatedly condemned  for its past links with the Marxist group. This trend will  continue as long as Thailand's lackadaisical attitude towards  the issue remains unchanged.    By hosting the peace talks, Thailand can demonstrate its  goodwill and neutrality, even though it will still be tough to  convince all the parties involved. If needs be, the Thai  authorities can take the opportunity to answer the allegations  levelled against the country.    Furthermore, Thai leaders would have the chance to exchange  views with all the Cambodian leaders on their own soil. They  can settle past misunderstandings, deliberate or not, and begin  a new dialogue to build up mutual trust and confidence.    In the past, Thailand frequently acted as an intermediary in  the Cambodian conflict, but that was when the country still had  the creditability. As Chuan is the only Thai leader with such  credentials, it is only an overture from him that will overcome  the Cambodians' recalcitrance and hold the roundtable in  Thailand.    Chuan should play a positive role in forging a  reconciliation  in Cambodia as it would greatly boost Thailand's wounded  international image. Helping Cambodia is to help Thailand. For  too long, the Cambodian situation has been handled by an  arrogant and myopic foreign minister, who has failed to  understand the sensitivities of the Cambodian issue or even  muster support from within the military. What the country needs  most now is a show of assertiveness from Chuan in foreign policy  because it is he who commands the respect of the military  leaders, and he who could make a difference in shaping  Thailand's Cambodian policy. Thailand has a high stake in the  future of a Cambodia which is at peace and friendly. Bangkok's  current problems with the Cambodian government have been the  accumulative result of developments that go back two decades.  More specifically, since 1979, Thailand has enjoyed all the  possible advantages from the war-shattered economy of Cambodia,  now it is the time to pay something back.    It is useless to continue this poisonous war of words. The  fate of these two countries are sealed together like a Siamese  twin. They have to learn how to coexist and coordinate with one  another, otherwise both of them will suffer a slow death.</p>

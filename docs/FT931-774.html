			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Arts: A Hammer of sorts - Radio HERE IS a novelty. Jonathan Holloway's The Hammer, Radio 3's Sunday play, was adapted by the author from Red Shift Theatre's stage play and at Radio 3's commission, produced independently by Essential Productions under the author/director. Red Shift has never before been in broadcasting, but Essential has done one earlier independent production for Radio 3. Broadly speaking, Holloway's story concerns the search for St Quentin's reliquaries in the priest-holes of an old house where they were hidden in the 16th century. An interesting story it is, where events overlap from century to century, the characters re-created as needed; but I confess I found the tale hard to follow. Scenes are dotted about in a pointilliste way over the years, and I found inadequate interest in character and insufficient forward movement. The playing was competent but the parts gave little chance for excitement. Perhaps none of these qualities would be seen in a live performance, but radio drama has rules of its own. File On Four is Radio 4's answer to Panorama. This week, The Whole Truth dealt with an increasingly important phenomenon, prosecution witnesses at trials threatened until they decide not to give their evidence. One girl agreed to appear and, after she did, was attacked by three other women. She was found a place in a hostel under an alias, but sure enough came phone calls asking for her by her real name. In the end, she withdrew. Some judges will allow witnesses like this to appear under false names, or behind screens, and the police will protect unwilling participants - not, however, for the rest of their lives, and many cases are lost by the withdrawal of promised evidence. I found this feature vital and alarming. Less urgently, Radio 4's The Making Of Christine on Thursday related the feelings of a man who had always felt himself to be a woman, and in his fifties had the courage to get surgeons to make him one. One would have liked some surgical detail, especially as he claimed to have a functional vagina; but we only had the reactions of his family (wife and two children), friends and of course himself. There were difficulties in choosing clothes and using public toilets, but most people were helpful. I reckon this too superficial a way to treat such a case. Gilbert and Sullivan are both interesting in their several ways, and I was happy that Radio 2's Sullivan Returns To Earth last Saturday was mostly D'Oyly Carte music with just enough biography, played as drama by Richard Baker (composer) and John Ayldon (librettist) to separate the numbers. I suppose the title celebrates Sullivan's devotion to light music rather than to rubbish like 'the long day closes'. And while we are on Radio 2 music, best thanks for Eddie Lang on Tuesday, memories of the great guitar-player we heard with bands such as Red Nickels's Five Pennies, the guitar still played as a musical instrument. Wilfred Owen, who had a double tribute on this page last week, was still with us from Monday to Friday when Kenneth Branagh read poems and letters on Radio 3. He read splendidly, but he read as an actor. Poems like 'The Century' should surely suggest the feelings of a young officer or NCO actually confronted by the appalling horror recorded. As Owen wrote, the poetry is in the pity. I must note two other good Owen programmes from last week, the World Service's Meridian and Radio 3's Strange Meeting on Friday with John Wain - both centred on the poet rather than the poetry. Too soon to enthuse over John Hurt's reading of Anatoly Pristavkin's The Inseparable Twins as Radio 4's Book At Bedtime. I have only heard three of the ten instalments so far.</p>

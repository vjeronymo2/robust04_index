			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA PAULA;  </P> <P> OFFICE RECYCLING PROGRAM ADOPTED  </P> <P> The Santa Paula City Council adopted a paper recycling program for city offices  and a new automated garbage collection system on Monday. It also considered a  citywide recycling plan.  </P> <P> The council approved a program to recycle paper from its city government  offices. High-quality paper, including that used in copy machines, computer  printers and fax machines, will be sold to a private hauler for about $25 per  ton.  </P> <P> The council also directed staff to form a committee to design a recycling  program for Santa Paula. Under consideration is a multibarrel system, with  separate containers for yard waste and mixed recyclables, such as glass, metal  and paper. Other waste destined for landfills would be deposited in a third  barrel.  </P> <P> A state law requires that cities adopt recycling programs by July 1, 1991, and  reduce their solid waste by 25% by January 1, 1995.  </P> <P> The council also passed a resolution establishing fees for a new automated  refuse collection program. Under the program, mechanized arms extending from  garbage trucks will replace sanitation workers.  </P> <P> However, no layoffs will be necessary because most of the positions have been  eliminated through attrition, said city Public Works Director Norm Wilkinson.  </P> <P> Automated refuse collection is expected to begin in some Santa Paula  neighborhoods by the end of the month. About 5,000 new plastic containers,  which will cost the city $300,000, will be distributed to residents.  </P> <P> Fees will remain the same for most households, Wilkinson said. Homeowners who  want a second trash barrel will be charged $2 per month.  </P> <P> Two new trucks, costing about $100,000 each, will be operated by the driver.  </P> <P> Wilkinson said the automated system will save the city money because of reduced  labor and health costs.

			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Cost cutting helps Misys rise MISYS, the computing services group, saw profits improve sharply in the half year to November 1991, the result of a sustained attack on costs over the past 12 months. Profits before tax expanded from Pounds 1.52m - after exceptional costs of Pounds 645,000 - to Pounds 3.59m, on turnover down just over 2 per cent at Pounds 32.3m. Earnings per share rose to 7p (3.1p) and the interim dividend is lifted from 2.16p to 2.27p. The group, which built a reputation for growth through acquisition in the 1980s, returned to the takeover trail with the announcement of three deals yesterday. Its largest purchase, worth Pounds 3.55m, is Innsite, a computing services company which provides software products for the hotel industry. The deal is being financed by the issue of 1.8m ordinary shares at 195p. It also spent Pounds 235,000 cash for the hardware maintenance business of Principality Systems and bought Computer Management Systems from the administrative receiver for Pounds 205,000 cash. Innsite was established in 1981 by ADP, a US computing services company, and bought out by its management and institutional investors in 1987. With more than 100 staff, it is now one of the largest suppliers of hotel computer systems in the UK. Last year it made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 662,000 on revenues of Pounds 8m. Poor strategy abroad, however, left it with a debt of Pounds 1.7m which Misys intends to assume from its own resources. Mr Kevin Lomax, chairman, said Innsite matched Misys' commercial profile perfectly. It was a leader in a niche sector, profitable and resilient to downturns in its main business, much of its revenues being derived from software support, maintenance and training. Misys comprises a diverse group of companies with computer services in common. Mr Lomax said that all were trading profitably with the exception of TIS Computing. Cash reserves were Pounds 6.9m at the year end and Mr Lomax said he was looking for further acquisition opportunities.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, March 24 (AFP) -- Radovan Karadzic urged  the Bosnian Serbs' self-styled parliament not to sign on to a  new Croat-Moslem federation agreement but refused to rule out  other kinds of ties with the entity.    Speaking in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale near  Sarajevo, the Bosnian Serb leader urged the lawmakers "to reject  out of hand all participation in the new Croat-Moslem  federation."    But he said he "did not rule out the possibility of  establishing various types of ties with the newly created state,  but not federal ties."    An agreement to create the federation was signed last Friday  in Washington by Bosnian Croat and Moslem leaders. It is  designed to put pressure on the Serbs, who control most of  Bosnia after nearly two years of war, to end the fighting.    Karadzic said the Bosnian Serbs wanted "a sovereign and  independent state" and would consider at some point in the  future their relations with the former Yugoslav republics.    He said he was willing to recognize the new federation "so  long as the Serbs obtain access to the sea." This was seen as  signaling willingness to give up conquered land.    The United States and Russia have been trying to get the  Bosnian Serbs to join up with the new federation as a way of  maintaining Bosnia as something resembling a unified state. The  federation is currently designed to cover half of Bosnia's land,  but the Serbs control around 70 percent of the republic's  territory.</p>

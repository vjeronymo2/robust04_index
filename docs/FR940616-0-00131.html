			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Kenneth R. Hollingshead, Office of Protected Resources, at the above NMFS address (telephone 301/713&hyph;2055), or Jamie Rappaport Clark, Chief, Division of Endangered Species, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, ARLSQ&hyph;452, Washington, D.C. 20240 (telephone 703/358&hyph;2171). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> ), is administered jointly by the Service and NMFS. NMFS has jurisdiction over most marine species, including whales, and makes determinations under section 4(a) of the Act as to whether a species should be listed as endangered or threatened. Reclassification of listed species from endangered to threatened and removal of species from the List require concurrence by the Service with the NMFS determination. The Service maintains and publishes the List, codified at 50 CFR 17.11 and 17.12, for all species determined by the Service or NMFS to be endangered or threatened.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On January 7, 1993 (58 FR 3121), NMFS published a final notice of determination that the eastern North Pacific (California) stock (population) of gray whale has recovered to near its estimated original population size and, while individual and cumulative impacts may have the potential to adversely affect the eastern population, that population is neither in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range, nor likely to again become endangered within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range. NMFS determined, therefore, that the eastern North Pacific population of the gray whale should be removed from the List under the Act. NMFS also determined that the western North Pacific gray whale stock, which is geographically isolated from the eastern population, has not recovered and should remain listed as endangered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the status of the species in terms of the factors contained in section 4(a)(1) of the Act for listing and delisting actions, and provided an extensive public comment period on its proposed determination (56 FR 58869; November 22, 1991). The Service has reviewed the complete administrative record regarding this action and finds that the determination is well based and concurs that the eastern North Pacific population should be removed from the List. Therefore, in accordance with section 4(a)(2) of the Act, the Service is amending the List by revising the entry for the gray whale to remove the eastern North Pacific (California) population, while retaining the western North Pacific (Korean) population as endangered. A list of endangered species under the jurisdiction of NMFS is contained in 50 CFR part 222. Therefore, concurrent with the Service's regulatory action, NMFS is amending &sect;222.23(a) to correspond with the amendment of &sect;17.11(h).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule is issued under 50 CFR parts 17 and 222 and is not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under E.O. 12866. Because this rule implements a determination previously subject to notice and comment and will relieve an existing restriction, the Service Director and the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, under section 553(b)(B) and (d) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .), for good cause, find that it is unnecessary to provide additional notice and public comment on this rule or to delay for 30 days its effective date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> National Environmental Policy Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment, as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Act, as amended. A notice outlining the reasons for this determination was published by the Service in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As amended in 1982 (Public Law 97&hyph;304), the Act, in section 4(b)(1)(A), restricts the information that may be considered when assessing species for listing. Based on this limitation of criteria for a listing decision and the opinion in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pacific Legal Foundation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Andrus, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  657 F.2d 829 (6th Cir., 1981), NMFS has categorically excluded all endangered species listings from environmental assessment requirements of NEPA (48 FR 4413, February 6, 1984).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

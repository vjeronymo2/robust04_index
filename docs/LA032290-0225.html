			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> AT THE MARKET;  </P> <P> FILLMORE'S NAVEL ORANGES SWEET ENOUGH TO SQUEEZE  </P> <P> Few things are more refreshing than a glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice.  Most people mistakenly assume that Valencia oranges, not in season until May,  are the only kind of oranges that can be juiced, often neglecting the very  sweet and delicious navels currently in season, said Jan Finfrock, who grows  navel oranges at Sespe Creek in Fillmore.  </P> <P> "They are falling off the trees, they're so sweet," she said. People usually  assume that the navel orange is only for eating because it's seedless and  larger than the Valencia.  </P> <P> According to Finfrock, the navel is so sweet that many people grate the orange  peels and use them for cakes and icing. She also recommends using the juice for  marinades for all kinds of meat and fish dishes.  </P> <P> The best time to eat the oranges depends on where they are grown and how cold  it is, said Pam Warren of Big Oak Ranch in Fillmore. This is the best time of  year to stock up on navel oranges grown in the Fillmore area, she said, where  the weather has been warmer.  </P> <P> Navel oranges can also make excellent room deodorizers, Warren said. She uses  them to make potpourri balls that last several weeks by taking a fresh navel  orange, poking a hole in the skin, putting a clove in it, rolling it in  cinnamon and letting it sit out for a few weeks.  </P> <P> Other local citrus fruits that are looking particularly good this week are  tangerines, according to Tony Thatcher, manager of Friend's Ranch in Ojai. "The  season here is longer than most areas. The weather's better here in Ojai than  on the coast, for tangerines," he said.  </P> <P> Area food enthusiasts looking for something different and exotic that's grown  locally should try bananas, said Paul Turner, co-owner of Seaside Banana  Gardens in Ventura.  </P> <P> "Ladyfingers" which originated from southern India, and are grown at the  Ventura farm, taste like raspberries, according to Turner.  </P> <P> And gourmets who favor imported foods should try the fresh Medjool dates that  have just come in from the Bard Valley in Yuma, said Nancy Krast, assistant  manager at Trader Joe's in Ventura.  </P> <P> From the Washington coast this week are mini-salmon that are mild, delicate,  boneless and easy to cook, said Bob Nazarian of Gelson's in Westlake Village.  </P> <P> Local seafood this week can be found at Brandon King Seafood in Oxnard, where  they buy live and spot prawns that are caught near Port Hueneme, said general  manager Hipolito Marin.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LOCALLY GROWN  </P> <P> * Brandon King Seafood -- Local spot prawns caught from Port Hueneme, Dungeness  crab from Alaska and Oxnard spiny lobsters, all live. 3920 W.

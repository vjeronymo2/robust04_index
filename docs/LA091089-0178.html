			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOONERS WIN, 33-7, LOSE QUARTERBACK  </P> <P> First probation.  </P> <P> Then Barry Switzer quitting.  </P> <P> Now injuries.  </P> <P> It hasn't been a great year for Oklahoma football.  </P> <P> The Sooners lost starting quarterback Steve Collins after he broke the pinky on  his right hand on the first play of the game Saturday against Baylor.  </P> <P> It didn't really matter much against the Tigers, though, as backup Chris Melson  scored once and directed two other first-half touchdowns as the eighth-ranked  Sooners won, 33-7.  </P> <P> Collins returned on the Sooners' second possession and led Oklahoma to a  touchdown in 11 plays but then left the game. He is expected to miss between  four and six weeks.  </P> <P> "Steve's situation puts us in a big bind," Oklahoma Coach Gary Gibbs said. "It  shows how thin we are."  </P> <P> Oklahoma (2-0) gained 338 yards, all rushing.  </P> <P> The Sooners defense held Baylor (0-1) to 206 yards, only 56 on the ground.  </P> <P> The Bears made only three first downs in the first half as Oklahoma played  penalty-free and went ahead, 28-0.  </P> <P> Melson, a third-year sophomore, led Oklahoma to a score on his first full  series, which was capped by a 19-yard run by Mike Gaddis.  </P> <P> Gaddis also scored the Sooners' first touchdown on a one-yard dive.  </P> <P> Midway through the second quarter, Melson took the Sooners 56 yards for a score  and made the big play himself, going 44 yards on an option to the Bears' five.  </P> <P> Two plays later, Leon Perry scored from the one.  </P> <P> Melson's one-yard dive on the next possession made it 28-0.  </P> <P> "I didn't believe he was hurt that bad," Melson said of Collins. "I definitely  was not ready to go in at that time, but after a few snaps I was OK."  </P> <P> Baylor Coach Grant Teaff took solace that the Bears played a little better in  the second half.  </P> <P> "If all we'd had was the first half, I think I'd have jumped off the  Tallahatchie Bridge," he said.  </P> <P> Baylor's only touchdown came in the third quarter on a two-yard pass from Brad  Goebel to Alonzo Pierce. Melson then fumbled on his 12, but Goebel was  intercepted in the end zone on third down.  </P> <P> "I was very disturbed at halftime and told the players so," Teaff said. "But we  looked like a football team in the second half. We played them toe-to-toe."  </P> <P> Oklahoma didn't make a third down in the third quarter and lost two fumbles.  </P></p>

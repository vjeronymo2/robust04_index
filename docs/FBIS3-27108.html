With the arrival of the Spring Festival, the flow of workers  from rural areas has come to an upsurge. According to reports  from various localities, after the Spring Festival, more than 1  million rural workers will leave home for the first time to join  the ranks of workers working away from their hometowns.    The flow of rural workers during this period has coincided  with the busy "Spring Festival travel." As many as 10 million  workers from rural areas are returning home for the Spring  Festival, and then they will join the streams of people  returning to cities after visiting their families, thus putting  huge pressure on the transportation sector.    In the early 1980's, the saying that "to make a fortune,  people from the east, west, south, north, and middle should go  to Guangdong" began to spread. In mid-1980's, several million  peasants in the hinterland came down to the Zhujiang Delta to  work, thus creating a fairly big impact on local development.  After this area was saturated with rural workers from other  parts of China, job seekers from the hinterland went to Fujian,  Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and other coastal provinces and  cities.    While tens of thousands of peasants from Sichuan, Hunan,  Anhui, Henan, Guangxi, and Hubei have moved to the south or east  to work, several million skilled craftsmen from coastal rural  areas have moved to the north and west. The scale and the scope  of the tides of rural workers continued to broaden, causing  positive effects for urban economic and social development in  addition to having some impact on society.    What worries people most is those roving peasants who cannot  find jobs after experiencing many frustrations. In recent  years, there invariably have been many peasants who have had to  linger at train stations, ports, or other public places after  the Spring Festival, thus having a negative impact on normal  social life. This reporter has interviewed some jobless  peasants at the Guangzhou Train Station. They did not have any  idea about who would need them or where to go after they left  home. Their experiences are really sad. Last spring, over  200,000 peasants in Sichuan alone became vagrants.  <H5>  II. </H5>   The "tides of rural workers" are not accidental.    China has a huge population, little farmland, and a poor  foundation to start with. The goal of 900 million peasants is  to develop the economy and have better lives.    The implementation of the household contract responsibility  system with remuneration linked to output has greatly liberated  the productive forces in rural society and has pushed  agriculture to higher levels. At the same time, the problem of  surplus laborers caused by insufficient farmland -- a problem  that was formerly addressed by the system of "eating from the  same big pot" -- was exposed right away. This problem became  more acute because of higher labor efficiency. According to  some people's estimates, more than 100 million surplus laborers  emerged in China's rural areas in the early 1980's.    Reform and opening up broke the old, state-planned economic  pattern and changed the situation in which urban and rural areas  were separated. Many peasants changed their old thinking of  "growing old and dying where they were born and brought up."  The space for developing production was also expanded from 1.5  mu acreage per capita to the entire village, thus creating a new  situation in which "agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry,  sideline production, and fisheries are launched at the same time  and all businesses -- industrial, construction, transportation,  services, and commercial undertakings -- thrive together."    Peasants widened and extended farmland by developing barren  mountains, unused bodies of water, deserted beaches, and  wasteland. They developed "blue farmland" in the sea and  promoted farming, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries in  an all-around way. The comprehensive development of  agricultural resources has created both wealth and new job  opportunities for numerous workers in the agricultural sector.    The appearance of township and town enterprises has provided  hundreds of millions of peasants with a new area of development  besides agricultural production. At present, country folks are  active in all sectors of the national economy. In 1993, total  sales of the nation's township and town enterprises reached  2,600 billion yuan, their net profits reached 160 billion yuan,  the taxes they delivered to the state totaled 95 billion yuan,  the total value of goods they delivered for export reached 190  billion yuan, the value of new fixed assets reached 150 billion  yuan, the amount of funds they contributed for supporting rural  construction projects reached 29 billion yuan, the amounts of  funds they contributed for subsidizing agricultural production  and construction reached 13 million yuan, and at least 60  percent of the increase in peasants' net per capita income came  from township and town enterprises. What merits mention is that  more than 3 million urban residents are applying their skills in  enterprises in rural areas.    The development of industrial production and commodity  circulation in rural areas has given rise to the appearance of  some 10,000 small towns along with the vigorous development of  tertiary industry in rural areas. In rural areas there are now  more than 12 million tertiary industrial enterprises providing  all forms of services relevant to people's needs in terms of  clothing, food, housing, transportation, cultural activities,  and recreation, as well as services needed before, during, and  after production, and these enterprises employ more than 40  million workers. The number of people in rural areas working  part time in tertiary industrial enterprises is even higher.    While some 100 million rural laborers have changed jobs and  work in factories without leaving their hometowns in rural  China, over 10 million peasants in the country have moved into  cities to live and work. Each year the number of peasants  coming to cities to work and do business exceeds 20 million. In  doing the kinds of jobs that city people are unwilling to do or  for which the latter consider the pay to be unattractive, these  laborers are providing urban residents with inexpensive and fast  services. Today rural workers can be seen working hard in  places where large developmental projects are being constructed.    During the course of reform and opening up, Chinese peasants  are exploring new job opportunities for rural laborers. By the  end of 1993, the total number of workers working for township  and town enterprises in the country had reached 112 million.  These workers, as well as the 40 million rural laborers who  spent most of their time in the distribution sector and service  trade even though they did not work for township and town  enterprises, show that at least 110 million farmers have "washed  their feet" and moved into nonagricultural sectors in the last  decade, thus causing a massive transfer of the labor force from  rural areas unprecedented in world history.    The development of township and town enterprises and the  establishment of new towns are Chinese peasants' innovations,  because of which China does not have to force large numbers of  bankrupt persons to flow into the cities, which is not the case  in some countries; and the state does not have finance all by  itself the investment needed for industrial development and  turning peasants into workers. According to estimates,  approximately 80 million surplus laborers in rural areas have  found jobs in township and town enterprises since 1980, and if  the state had to build factories to place many of these people,  1.6 trillion yuan would be needed. This is tantamount to  several years of the nation's revenues, and if surplus laborers  in rural China have to be placed in cities by the end of this  century, the scale of newly built cities must be at least double  that of the total number of cities today [as received]. This is  simply impossible, no matter how we look at this issue.    China has a very large population, anyway, and regional  development is uneven. For various reasons, the level of  economic development in rural areas in central and western China  and some underdeveloped areas along the coast is low, the  increase in peasants' income has been slow, and problems of  surplus laborers are conspicuous. This is why many peasants  have left home to look for opportunities to become rich in  coastal areas, cities, and economically developed areas.  Nevertheless, job opportunities are not limitless in certain  periods, even in coastal and economically developed urban areas.  As a result, the rural workers who move from place to place to  find jobs have caused this widespread "tide of rural workers."  <H5>  III. </H5>   Of the 1.1 billion people in China, 900 million are  peasants.  All the people of the nation cannot lead a fairly comfortable  life unless peasants are able to live comfortably. Whether we  can attain a relatively comfortable standard of living in rural  areas depends on whether we can successfully transfer hundreds  of millions of surplus rural workers to other fields by the end  of the century. Therefore, to understand and solve the issue of  "flows of rural workers," we should take developing productive  forces, optimizing the allocation of resources, and maintaining  social stability into full consideration.    Rural workers moving from place to place are faced with the  need to improve their lives, and some regions and enterprises do  need rural workers for their own development. Therefore, we  need to provide correct guidance to flowing rural workers  instead of simply imposing restrictions on them. On the other  hand, current conditions such as transportation can hardly  accommodate large-scale flows of rural workers. The need for  rural workers is limited in coastal and economically developed  urban areas. In addition, our big cities and super-big cities  are already "too big." If we do nothing to persuade the rural  workers pouring into big cities to do otherwise, the existing  urban problems are bound to worsen and will shake our society.  Therefore, only by transferring surplus rural workers through  multiple levels and channels and guiding the flows of rural  workers in an orderly way can we ease the "tide of rural  workers" fundamentally.    By making an objective analysis of the characteristics and  pattern of the flows of rural workers, we will find out that  existing channels for transferring rural labor are very broad.    First, the flow of rural workers from central and western  regions to the east is a general pattern at present because of  the disparity existing between different regional economic  levels. In 1992, the total output value of village and town  enterprises nationwide reached 1,758.4 billion yuan, two-thirds  of which were from 10 provinces in the east and only one-third  from 20 provinces in the western and central regions. In that  year, the proportion of output of village and town enterprises  in the gross social product in rural areas accounted for 76.91  percent in the eastern region, 63.48 percent in the central  region, and 38.2 percent in the western region. The huge  disparity between the central and western regions, and the  eastern region is the motive force compelling peasants in the  central and western regions to leave home and also where the  huge potential for solving the issue of transferring surplus  labor from rural areas lies. If the central and western regions  and underdeveloped areas -- where the tides of rural workers  originate -- are able to quicken the development of village and  town enterprises in light of actual conditions by beginning with  projects that require less input, yield greater economic  results, and promise quick returns, they can improve local  economies and create tens of millions of job opportunities.  Bashan, which was a poor and backward mountain village in  central Shandong only a dozen years ago, has struggled hard to  develop secondary and tertiary industries and has become a very  rich "star village." The collective assets owned by the entire  village are as great as "1 million yuan" for each family.  Zhangjin village, of Qianjiang city on the Jianghan Plain,  started with the garment industry and established the "Xingfu  Group," whose annual output value exceeds more than 100 million  yuan. They changed the name of their rundown village to "Xingfu  [Happy] village." Dongzhou village, of Sanyuan County on the  dry land north of Weihe, became an "industrial village" on the  loess plain after developing village and town enterprises.....  Villages like these have emerged in batches across the country.  The thing they have in common is that they not only solve the  problem of the local surplus of labor but also absorb tens of  thousands of laborers from surrounding areas and other provinces  by developing their own economies. In those eastern coastal and  economically developed regions to which the tides of rural  worker flow, we can promote cooperation between the east and the  west to transfer labor-intensive industries to underdeveloped  regions, thus enabling surplus rural laborers in underdeveloped  regions to find jobs without having to go far away from home.    Second, another special feature of the flows of rural  workers at present is that they flow to nonagricultural areas  from rural areas. One reason is that peasants in rural areas  seem to feel that it is hard to lead a comfortable life by  working in the fields. In fact, if we lead peasants to broaden  their outlook, steer them toward the market, and comprehensively  develop agricultural resources in breadth and in depth by  relying on agrotechnology to promote farming, forestry, animal  husbandry, and fisheries in an all-around way, while at the same  time combining the planting, breeding, and processing of  agricultural products into a coordinated process in production  and operations, we can increase agricultural efficiency by a  large margin and create several million job opportunities. In  addition, rural areas also have conditions for developing  village and town enterprises. Many examples of developing  industry and agriculture side by side have come up in many  traditional rural areas.    Third, one more pattern of the flows of rural workers is  that  they all want to swarm into cities and towns of economically  developed areas. This shows that the industrialization and  construction of small towns in the central and western regions  lag behind those of the eastern region. If the central and  western regions can connect the development of village and town  enterprises with the development of farm and sideline products  markets and the construction of small towns, as well as  encourage and support local peasants and businessmen from other  regions in investing, setting up factories, and opening shops in  their regions, a great number of rural workers who leave home  and look for jobs in other cities will be able to find jobs near  their homes. In recent years, a group of towns and villages  rejuvenated by developing secondary and tertiary industries have  appeared in central, western, and underdeveloped areas, thus  becoming the "sparks" for developing local economies.    Fourth, at present, the flows of rural workers are unchecked  and are without order. An important reason for this is that  they lack information about the supply of and demand for  laborers. Moreover, because of the lack of intermediate service  agencies in the labor market, some peasants just go out blindly  and try their luck without possessing any information.  Therefore, the key to making rural workers' flows orderly lies  in accelerating the cultivation and perfection of the labor  market system in urban and rural areas. In recent years, on the  one hand, Guangdong Province established regular ties with the  other provinces concerned and developed comparatively permanent  labor import bases; on the other hand, Guangdong avoided  importing labor during "Spring Festival travel" to gradually  make the flows of rural workers into this province stable and  orderly. This experience merits attention.    Fifth, it will take some time before the state of  development of various trades and professions permits them to  employ more surplus rural workers. A certain number of surplus  rural workers will continue to exist in rural areas for quite a  long time. Furthermore, the transfer of surplus rural workers  and the flows of rural workers from place to place involve all  sectors of society, including rural and urban areas,  labor-export and labor-import areas, as well as employment  departments, transportation departments, and other service  organizations. Joint efforts by various departments and areas  are objectively necessary. Therefore, governments in all  localities at all levels must strengthen their overall planning,  management, regulation, and control to do a good job of  developing labor markets and relevant services, in giving advice  to rural workers, and in promoting the development, utilization,  and rational allocation of rural labor resources. Under the  premise of ensuring agricultural development, localities should  guide surplus rural workers to flow gradually and in an orderly  manner to nonagricultural enterprises and areas to thus maintain  a fine social and economic order.    To encourage and guide surplus rural workers to flow  gradually and in an orderly manner to nonagricultural  enterprises and areas are important events vital to the overall  state of national economic development. We should adopt the  appropriate policies and measures to promote the quality of  agriculture, the development of village and town enterprises,  and the construction of small towns in an effort to transfer  more surplus rural workers to or near their homes. At the same  time, we must keep abreast of the information about the supply  of and demand for labor and the flows of rural workers,  vigorously and smoothly develop cooperation in labor affairs  according to the demands of areas, and promptly sum up and  popularize successful experiences in this field. With the  development of the economy, all trades need more workers and  also require a higher quality of labor. After we analyzed the  rural workers who have found that finding jobs is difficult, we  learned that most of them are peasants who do not possess any  skills and who have a low level of education. If we train  surplus rural workers in various ways to improve their quality  and certain of their skills, we will broaden their job  flexibility, improve their money-earning skills, raise society's  spiritual level, and promote social stability.    Hundreds of millions of surplus rural workers are an asset  of  our society. The development of the entire national economy  will provide broader and wider job opportunities for surplus  rural workers. As long as we continue to follow the existing  road in transferring rural workers, promote the transfer of  surplus rural workers through multiple levels and channels, and  rationalize and optimize the allocation of rural labor resources  by cultivating labor markets, we will be able to bring order to  the transfer and flows of surplus rural workers.</p>

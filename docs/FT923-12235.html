			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Observer: All the Prezza's men Don't write off board of trade president Michael Heseltine's plans to revitalise his domain. Although Norman Lamont scrapped the National Economic Development Office rather than hand it over to Hezza the Prezza, close onlookers dismiss Westminster gossip that he has had his wings clipped. Instead, Heseltine's authority in cabinet has been reinforced by a request from John Major that he join Douglas Hurd in an autumn drive to rally Tory waverers on Maastricht. Moreover, back at his department, Hezza is assembling a phalanx of loyal officials and high-calibre imports to show he doesn't need Treasury money to expand his power base. The choice of Walter Eltis as his chief economic adviser should not put people off the scent. It is one of the less exciting of a string of appointments designed to beef up the department's Whitehall clout. Geoff Robinson, former IBM senior adviser, has been chosen as chief adviser on science and technology at the head of a specialist team. Sir Peter Levene, a chum from Hezza's defence days and an aide to Major on the Citizen's Charter, has returned to give general - albeit unpaid - advice. Alistair MacDonald is back from defence procurement as chief of the new sectoral working groups. The industrial competitiveness division - also central to the department's strategy to become industry's voice in Whitehall  -is to be run by Bob Dobbie, returning to Whitehall after a spell on another project close to Heseltine's heart - the Liverpool Task Force. A further muscular mandarin is being brought back from the US to reinvigorate the trade promotions office, and if Eltis still has any mates left at NEDO some of them may still be offered jobs. Diverse though the appointments are, the inside buzz is that the new recruits have two things in common. First, they are 'doers' with direct experience of their clients' interests. Second, and more important, they're all the president's men.</p>

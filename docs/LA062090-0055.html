			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVE DISTEL: THE PRESSURE? CARTER PUTS IT ON PITCHERS  </P> <P> Let's see now, baseball's best hitters are successful an average of maybe three  times in 10 at-bats, and baseball's best pitchers are successful maybe eight  times for every 10 batters faced.  </P> <P> Carry that reality forward into a situation in which a runner or runners are on  base.  </P> <P> Obviously, the pressure has to be on the hitter.  </P> <P> Right?  </P> <P> Wrong.  </P> <P> That is the opinion of one Joseph Chris Carter, who may be the best the Padres  have had at clearing runners off the base paths and sending them back to the  dugout, to high-fives and smiling faces.  </P> <P> "The pressure's on the pitchers," he insisted, "not on the hitters."  </P> <P> This is a theory that flies in the face of common sense. It's almost as radical  as saying the caddy is under more pressure than the golfer at the U.S. Open.  </P> <P> Regardless, Carter believes this . . . and that just might be a key to his  success.  </P> <P> When runners are on base, he is in his element. A pitcher facing Carter with  men on base is like a guy going into the water after a shark or into the jungle  after a leopard. In those situations, Carter is as comfortable as Johnny Carson  with a microphone or William Perry with a fork.  </P> <P> "Look," he said, "pitchers pitch totally different with men on base. For one  thing, you get a lot more fastballs. For another thing, they're always trying  to make the perfect pitch. And they make mistakes because they're trying so  hard not to. You take a situation with runners on first and third, and the  pitcher doesn't want to concede the one run, so he makes a mistake and gives up  two or three. There's a lot more pressure on them."  </P> <P> With Joe Carter at bat, maybe the pressure is on the pitcher. During the  Padres' last home stand, he collected his 50th run batted in earlier in the  season than anyone in the club's history, in Game 58. Four more over the  weekend boosted him to 54 in his battle with Matt Williams and Will Clark for  the National League lead.  </P> <P> "I've never had this good a start," said Carter, who had 121 RBI with Cleveland  in 1986. "I think that year I had in the mid 60s around the All-Star break."  </P> <P> At the rate Carter has been going, he will drive in 143 runs over the full  season. The old Padre record, 118 by Dave Winfield in 1979, would rate only  small type next to a number such as that. No one has driven in so many runs in  the National League since George Foster had 149 in 1977.  </P> <P> And the notion is not exactly far-fetched.  </P> <P> "The job's a lot easier when the three guys ahead of you are hitting .300,"  Carter said. "That's any four-hole hitter's dream."  </P> <P> Leadoff man Bip Roberts has been around .300 much of the year, and Roberto  Alomar and Tony Gwynn are both above .300. They set the table, and Carter  dines.  </P> <P> However, Carter realizes a batting average in the neighborhood of .240, about  30 points under his career average, has kept him from getting off to an even  faster start in terms of driving in runs.  </P> <P> "I should have a lot more RBIs," he said. "I get paid a lot of money to drive  in runs, and I feel I should be doing a lot better."  </P> <P> Carter's thought that he could or should be doing more goes hand in hand with  the reality that this team should be doing more. This is unsettling to a man  who might otherwise be celebrating his early-season success rather than  worrying about improving.  </P> <P> "The main thing," he said, "is that we've gotta win some ballgames. I'm at the  point in my career where I don't have to put up stats for financial reasons. I  don't have to put up numbers for a good contract. I've played through that part  of my career, and I don't have any financial worries now. I have to elevate my  game, and we have to elevate our game to a different level now and win  ballgames."  </P> <P> Joe Carter, in essence, wants to do what the Padres acquired him to do, which  is to lift the offense to a different level. And the Padres paid quite a price  for him, giving up catcher Sandy Alomar Jr., infielder Carlos Baerga and  outfielder Chris James to the Cleveland Indians. A few years ago, you could  have bought Mission Valley for less.  </P> <P> In truth, he has done what he came to do. He has also played a rather elegant  center field, filling another position of need. With his long legs and speed,  the man could probably cover Kern County in six strides. Color defense another  plus.  </P> <P> However, offense is his forte . . . and driving in runs is his specialty.  </P> <P> Just wake him up when there are runners on base. Never mind. Don't bother  awakening him. Those are the situations in which he is the most relaxed.  </P></p>

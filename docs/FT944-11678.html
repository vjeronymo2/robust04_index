			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: AmWest Air steady at Dollars 33.9m America West Airlines, the US airline that emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August, yesterday said it made operating profits of Dollars 33.9m in the third quarter to September, little changed from the Dollars 33m it made in the same period last year. However, the company said it had been been constrained by the bankruptcy process from expanding its fleet of 85 aircraft during both periods, and the latest quarter had included Dollars 5.1m of operating expense adjustments relating mainly to additional reserves for bad debts and inventories. Figures for net income were not comparable with the previous period's Dollars 14.4m because fresh start reporting was adopted when America West emerged from bankruptcy on August 25. From July 1 to August 25 it made Dollars 19.1m, and from August 26 to September 30 - described by the airline as a season-ally weak period - it made Dollars 1.2m. Mr A. Maurice Myers, chief operating officer, said America West had increased capacity by about 7 per cent year-on-year by making more efficient use of its aircraft. The extra seat capacity had been filled, keeping the average load factor at 69.5 per cent. Mr Myers said America West planned to consolidate its position in existing markets by increasing frequencies and by expanding cautiously where opportunities arose - as in its recent decision to initiate services to Mazatlan and Los Cabos in western Mexico. He said America West would differentiate itself from other carriers by offering full service to passengers at low cost.</p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Pakistan and France sign power deal FRANCE and Pakistan have signed two financial protocols, to a total value of FFr1bn (Pounds 103.2m) for French companies to build two conventional power stations in Pakistan, writes Ian Davidson from Paris. But a French offer to supply Pakistan with a 900MW nuclear power station has been put on hold, because France now insists all civil nuclear exports must be subject to inspection under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The protocols were agreed during the visit to Paris of Mr Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistani prime minister. The two sides also agreed the sale of three French minesweepers to Pakistan, valued at FFr1.3bn.</p>

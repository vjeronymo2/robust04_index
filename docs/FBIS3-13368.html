In an exclusive statement to MENA, the archbishop said the  incident will have no effect on the relations between Muslims  and Christians but will make them more determined to adhere to  national unity.    On the circumstances of the incident, he said that at  approximately 1800 yesterday, a citizen accompanied by his  relatives arrived in a car to visit the monastery. The head of  the monastery apologized to them because they could not enter  the monastery during the period of fasting. He added that while  the car's passengers were standing outside the monastery,  unknown people opened fire at the car and its passengers. He  added that 27 empty cartridges fired from an automatic weapon  were found at the scene of the incident.</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / RAF fleet contract may go to Lockheed Britain will ask Lockheed, the US aerospace group, to bid for a contract to replace part of the RAF's tactical transport fleet, dealing a blow to a multi-billion pound European project known as the Future Large Aircraft. Officials said the UK might still purchase the FLA at a later stage but they made clear that it would be an off-the-shelf deal, and ruled out any UK financial backing for development of the aircraft. British Aerospace has been pressing the government to rejoin the FLA programme. The UK took part in the initial eight-nation plan in the mid-1980s but withdrew its funding four years ago. BAe, part of an industrial consortium engaged on feasibility studies for the aircraft, said yesterday that it would be forced to leave the project if the government stayed on the sidelines. France, Germany and other partner nations have been trying to incorporate Britain into the venture, which they regard as a military counterpart to Airbus. They fear that if Britain buys a new version of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules transport other European countries will follow. They are hoping for a market of at least 300 aircraft. BAe's partners in the industrial consortium are Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Aerospace, CASA of Spain and Alenia of Italy, as well as associated Belgian, Portuguese and Turkish companies. The decision to invite a tender from Lockheed was announced by Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, yesterday. Meanwhile, Marshall of Cambridge is undertaking a study on refurbishment. Officials told the Commons defence committee that the RAF needed to replace or refurbish about half its fleet by the year 2000.</p>

			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / EU rules curtail Bank's investigation powers Severe restrictions to the Bank of England's powers to intervene in cases of alleged misconduct at London branches of banks with headquarters in other parts of the European Union are disclosed in a letter from the Bank to a British businessman. The letter, written by Mr Brian Quinn, the Bank's director in charge of banking supervision, was sent a few days ago to Mr Andre Levy, who is suing ABN Amro, the big Dutch bank, for negligence. Mr Quinn says in his letter that the implementation last year of the EU's Second Banking Co-ordination Directive means that: 'The Bank's powers to intervene in ABN Amro Bank's affairs have been considerably reduced . . . and do not extend to questions of the fitness and properness of the managers. 'It follows that your concerns about ABN Amro Bank's conduct and management should in future be directed to the de Nederlandsche Bank (the Dutch central bank) as the relevant home supervisory authority.' Before the Bank passed responsibility for the case to the Dutch central bank last year, it felt that the dispute between Mr Levy and ABN Amro was a commercial one and did not raise issues of relevance to it as a supervisor. However, the Bank has continued to receive information on the case since it handed over responsibility for it. The Bank refused to comment yesterday on whether it now took a harsher view of ABN Amro's conduct. The Bank has received evidence from Mr Levy and two other companies, Chieftain and Scanfisheries, that in late 1990 and 1991, Amro managers advised them to raise money through complex borrowing schemes arranged by Mr Bruce Picken of PMC Financial Services. In all three cases, Mr Picken asked for advance fees totalling several hundred thousand dollars. The three companies say Mr Picken's failure to produce the funds led to significant costs and disruption - although they all say that they refused to pay the advance fees. Mr Picken was declared a bankrupt in May 1991 and is believed to have left the country. Mr Quinn's letter is the most blunt admission to date that one effect of the directive is to curtail the powers of supervisors to assess the fitness of bank branches whose head office is elsewhere in the EU. The directive's central aim was to improve the supervision of banks by forcing each EU member's supervisory authority to take responsibility for verifying that banks headquartered in its country are fit to take deposits. Mr Alex Crighton, a director of Chieftain - which tried to raise almost Pounds 100m through Amro and Mr Picken - said he was very disturbed by the implications of the directive. 'Amro was operating in London and we dealt with them as though they were a British bank', said Mr Crichton, who submitted his evidence to the Bank last week. Mr Levy is suing ABN Amro's London branch for negligence and breach of contract in respect of attempts by his company, Columbus Tobacco, to raise Dollars 4m between October 1990 and March 1991 for the exploitation of a cigarette brand called Route 66. The writ alleges that the bank failed to investigate adequately either the viability of the funding scheme or the standing of Mr Picken. Mr Levy first brought the affair to the attention of the Bank of England more than two years ago. The Bank said yesterday that 100 hours of a senior manager's time had been spent examining papers relating to the case. Mr Levy says Amro ignored warnings about Mr Picken. Mr Charalambos Katsamas, of the shipping company Internav, said yesterday he informed Amro towards the end of 1990 that he felt the bank should not be dealing with Mr Picken. Mr Katsamas had been trying to raise substantial finance from Mr Picken, but became alarmed when he was asked to transfer Dollars 6m to Switzerland to purchase securities as collateral for a loan and also to pay a Dollars 250,000 advance fee. He refused. Amro continued to work with Mr Picken on deals for Scanfisheries, Mr Levy and Chieftain. Even after Mr Levy made a formal complaint to Amro in April 1991 about his experiences with Mr Picken, the bank continued to work on the Chieftain and Scanfisheries transactions. ABN Amro yesterday refused to make any comment.</p>

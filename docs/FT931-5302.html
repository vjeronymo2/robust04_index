			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Schroder tops expectations with new trust Schroder has exceeded expectations in raising Pounds 100m for its new split capital investment trust, called the Split Fund. However, the demand was so unbalanced in favour of the income shares, which yield 8 per cent tax-free if held in a Personal Equity Plan, that applications for those shares have had to be scaled back. Meanwhile, BZW and Schroders have been forced to buy around Pounds 27m of the other two classes of shares, capital and zero dividend, in order to create the right structure. Between them, the two groups will own around 68 per cent of the zero dividend shares and 35 per cent of the capital shares. Mr John Govett, chairman of the Split Fund, said the shares were good investments. In all 56.8m income shares, 37.7m zero dividend shares and 5.7m capital shares have been allocated. Those who applied for under Pounds 25,000 of income shares will receive all their allocation; applications above that level will receive between 50 and 85 per cent.</p>

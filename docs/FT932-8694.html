			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government firm on rail privatisation MINISTERS insisted yesterday that they would press ahead with the government's rail privatisation plans, despite calls from some Tory backbenchers for a change in approach to allow British Rail to bid in open competition for the franchises. Along with that proposal, Tory MPs also intend to table today amendments to the bill which are designed to ensure the survival of pensioners' railcards and of London Travelcards for commuters; and to prevent excessive fare increases, line closures and cuts to services. Sir Keith Speed, Tory MP for Ashford and one of the leading rebels, said he believed up to 10 Conservatives would put their names to the amendments, and that a further 20 to 30 were sympathetic. The government's overall Commons majority is just 18. Although only a handful of Tories abstained when the bill first came before the Commons in February, the rebels say unease in Conservative ranks has intensified, particularly since this month's disastrous local election results. Mr David Nicholson, the MP for Taunton, and Mr Peter Bottomley, a former transport minister, are among the Tories expressing anxiety about the future of railway services and levels of investment. Ministers are still confident that they can answer backbenchers' concerns before MPs debate the details of the bill at the beginning of next week. Towards the end of the week, Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, will publish a detailed response to the report from the cross-party transport committee last month, and will also announce their conclusions on arrangements for BR pensioners and current employees. A group of backbenchers is expected to meet Mr MacGregor and Mr Roger Freeman, the transport minister, later this week, and Sir Keith is optimistic that the government will move some way on their points. The rebels say that their proposals would not wreck the bill but would make it more workable, consumer-friendly, and politically popular. Mr MacGregor, however, was clear that the government would not accept the suggested amendment to allow BR to compete for the franchises. He said yesterday that there had been 30 expressions of interest from teams of BR employees, which meant that there would be 'a very substantial opportunity for people in the railways to bid'. The prime minister's office underlined that the government would make every effort to assist management teams. The government is making Pounds 100,000 available to each team to help prepare bids. While it is clear that ministers do not want to accept the other amendments either, they are less central to the structure of the privatisation, and there may be a little more room for manoeuvre.</p>

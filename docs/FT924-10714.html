			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Puerto Rico governor poll set to be dead heat THE TWO leading candidates in the gubernatorial election in Puerto Rico next week are locked in a very close race, with opinion polls suggesting a dead heat. Mr Pedro Rosello of the New Progressive Party has 43 per cent of popular support, according to the most recent polls, against 41 per cent for his main rival, Mrs Victoria Munoz Mendoza of the Popular Democratic Party. The polls claim a 3.5 per cent margin of error. The winner will be new to the governor's office on the Caribbean island, which is a US possession. Mr Rafael Hernandez Colon, the incumbent, is not standing for another term. The third candidate, Mr Fernando Martn of the Puerto Rican Independence Party, has the support of 5 per cent of the electorate, according to the polls. The outcome of the election will affect Puerto Rican attitudes in a continuing debate on the island's political status. The 3m people of the island are considering whether they want to remain a Commonwealth of the US, become a state of the US, or seek political independence.</p>

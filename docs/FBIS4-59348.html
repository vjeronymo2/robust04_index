			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamabad, May 11 -- A Foreign Office spokesman  while talking to THE MUSLIM Wednesday [11 May] night  categorically denied that Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto held a  meeting with Israeli President Weizman in South Africa.    Asked to comment on Israeli Radio's Persian language news  about Benazir-Weizman meeting on May 10, the spokesman described  it a fabrication. He said that it was part of the  disinformation campaign of Israeli Radio to malign Pakistan by  spreading lies. He said that in the past also, Israeli Radio  had been spreading false news about such contacts.    Israeli Radio in its Persian language news broadcast at 7 pm  on May 10, had stated that Israeli President Weizman held a  meeting with Pakistan Prime Minister Ms Bhutto in South Africa.  It said the experts were of the view that this unprecedented  meeting was an indication that Pakistan was moving towards  establishment of full-fledged diplomatic relations with Israel.</p>

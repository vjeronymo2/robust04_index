			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / US, Russia in N-talks progress Senior US and Russian military officials have revealed unprecedented details of each other's nuclear forces and strategies - and have laid plans for further disclosures and co-operation. Mr Ashton Carter, assistant US defence secretary for international security policy, said last night that in two days of talks in Moscow covering issues from Bosnia to making inventories of each other's missile materials, the two military establishments had talked freely about systems, procedures and strategies which have hitherto been reserved for the attention of spies. These included: the operational procedures for deploying strategic nuclear forces; the steps taken by both sides to implement the Start I and Start II nuclear treaties; the weaponry and strategies of short-range nuclear missile defence systems - the area in which both sides are now concentrating because of the shared perception that this constitutes a larger threat than strategic missiles.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Personal View: Europe's 'nervous system' out of kilter Telecommunications has become the nervous system of modern society; business and industry today are increasingly dependent on the instantaneous transmission of information in all forms. Social life and family life also rely heavily on the telephone; new technical developments will make these services even more important for Britain's industrial competitiveness and quality of life. Many advanced economies of the world have recognised the need for efficient technical and service innovation in telecommunications. They see the need for an environment in which new ideas can be brought to market without interference from state bureaucracy, public financing policies or defensive monopoly thinking. But in most of Europe, similar progress has not been made. The European Commission has made valiant efforts, culminating in its Telecommunications Services Directive in 1990, which set out to open up the market for all services, except public voice telephony. But competition, in practice, is still rare. No member state, except the UK and, to some degree, France, has effectively implemented the directive. This is in stark contrast to the countries which have opted to expose telecommunications operators to competition and open up their markets to private sector investment. Britain, the US and Japan have led the way, followed by Australia, New Zealand and Sweden. The results have been startlingly successful. Services have proliferated; new market entrants have multiplied; customers have learned to provide services for themselves and sell them to others; prices have fallen while the market has grown. Quality has improved out of all recognition. In Europe, meanwhile, current Community policy is still that public voice services (overwhelmingly the most important) and the ownership and running of network infrastructure are 'reserved' for state-controlled national monopolies. Ordinary customers, many ill-served by the local monopolies, have yet to grasp fully what they are missing. Member states have recognised the needs of Europe by calling, in the Maastricht treaty, for trans-European networks, transcending national boundaries and providing Europe with the needed seamless networks and services. But they are reluctant to face up to the implications - that private capital and private enterprise, competing right across the Community, are needed to achieve this end. Last autumn the European Commission issued a consultative document suggesting four possible ways forward: to do nothing; to regulate monopolies far more intensively at the European level, to force them to improve their performance; opening up of all markets; or, more modestly, opening up just cross-frontier networks and services. Many still pray fervently for the first option. No one seriously advocates the second. The fourth is better than nothing, but it would have widely differing effects on the markets in member states according to their size and location and it presents formidable problems of definition and enforcement. In fact, the Treaty of Rome has recognised, since 1958, the presumption that commercial activities should be carried on in a free and open market and the third course is the obvious way forward. There is one possible objection: existing operators are required to provide universal service and incur substantial losses in doing so. Competitors would exploit the higher prices inevitably required in the unsubsidised part of the market. But experience in the UK and elsewhere shows that it is quite possible to deal with this by financial means. The subsidy should be reduced as far as possible by progressively aligning tariffs to costs. For any residual subsidy either government should foot the bill or, perhaps more realistically, new competitors should bear their fair share of the burden. This is clearly possible; indeed, it has been done (imperfectly, but quite successfully) both in the UK and in the other liberalised countries of the world. In BT's view, the commission should legislate, now, to open up the markets across the board. The world is moving quickly and action to build on the new laws will be difficult and take time. Europe is falling behind in its 'nervous system'. Indeed, it may well already be too late. The author is chairman of BT</p>

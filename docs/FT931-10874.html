			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Vaudeville days are here Whew] That was close. The government got through Thursday with its trousers on. When we woke up, sterling seemed to be in free fall. It looked as if the pound was about to descend to Mr Norman Lamont's ankles by lunchtime. This would have diverted attention from Mr John Major's big speech of the night before. I will come to that speech, but first let us return to the foreign exchange rooms. When they opened, nobody could think of anything the government might do to avoid a disaster. Sack the chancellor? Tempting, but six weeks ahead of the Budget such a move might suggest that the prime minister was not wholly confident of the truth of his supportive words of only two days previously. Raise interest rates? Technically correct, but implausible just a week after lowering them. Make a speech affirming the soundness of the government's economic policy? Be serious. In the event, the Bundesbank came to the rescue. By reducing German interest rates just a fraction, it fractionally strengthened demand for the British currency. The chancellor's dignity was saved. With a sigh, ministers returned to their everyday task of appeasing Conservative backbenchers. Mr Michael Heseltine, the industry secretary, went on calculating the optimum subsidy for the coalmines. He is already up to his waist in crumpled-up envelopes. Some, I fancy, bear drawings of Mr Winston Churchill  -Mr Arthur Scargill's representative on earth - that fail to flatter the Conservative MP for Davyhulme. The defence secretary, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, reversed a few minor cuts in the size of the army and claimed, with straight face, that his U-turn would cost nothing. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the secretary for health, lay tied to the rails by the British Medical Association, her face creased with alarm as the prospect of a capitulation over the closure of London hospitals steamed ever closer. If you ask how long this vaudeville can continue the answer is 'indefinitely'. The government is hamstrung. Fate, that exquisite torturer, has placed Mr Major into Number 10 Downing Street on the strength of a small yet unreliable majority. He can never be sure of getting anything through the Commons. He must always be ready to grovel before one of its committees. He cannot do much more to hasten the end of the recession. He is afraid of raising taxes to tackle the growing public sector deficit. Until the recovery is safely under way, the whispers about his and his chancellor's fitness for the offices they hold will persist. Yet there is no challenger for the Conservative leadership, and no sign that the Labour party is transforming itself into an alternative party of government. It is against this background that we must evaluate Mr Major's address to the Carlton Club. It set out, plainly enough, the principles that make Conservatives stand up and salute: choice, ownership, responsibility and opportunity. 'The modern Conservative party,' he said, 'is heir to both the great 19th-century political traditions: to the Whigs, in our free-market radicalism; to the Tories, in our belief in community and tradition.' As in all set-piece speeches, he then put it better: 'We will carry forward the pursuit of economic liberalism, and the reinforcement of the social cement that binds us together.' Mr Major also listed existing government policies: 'the Citizen's Charter, deregulation, privatisation, private finance, market-testing, openness'. He affirmed his belief in the continuity of existing institutions, such as the monarchy, Parliament, the unity of the United Kingdom, and 'our churches and voluntary organisations'. He initiated a fresh debate on the merits of asking people to work in return for unemployment benefits. The latter has already caused quite a flurry. There is nothing wrong with this declaration by the prime minister to a receptive Carlton Club audience. If you consider its bits and pieces, his domestic agenda is seen to be a conventional mix of the beneficial, the harmless, and the dam-aging. To take just three examples, the government's education reforms are excellent, the Citizen's Charter is neutral, and the continued assault on local democracy is scandalous. In some areas, such as his proud allusion to 'people from ethnic minorities entering public life', Mr Major is ahead of many in his party. On this point he is exercising true leadership. In others, such as the kite-flying on 'workfare', he is showing a degree of courage that Lady Thatcher could not muster when she was in charge. What is missing is glue. The invocation of Disraeli and Burke is not a sufficient means of binding together a package of disparate policies, most of whose origins can be traced back to the Thatcher years. Talk of blending continuity and change is not in itself enough. 'Our political strength,' said Mr Major, 'has always rested on our ability to keep a finger on the pulse of the British people.' This is true, but the pulse beat of the 1990s is different from that of the 1980s. Some of the reasons for that difference are evident. There is a growing fear of unemployment, which talk of workfare cannot by itself alleviate. The seemingly unstoppable advance of the welfare state cannot be indefinitely sustained by the working population. A growing proportion is ageing. Government by Whitehall and quango is no proper substitute for accountability to local elected authorities; London alone is in a state of disrepair that may one day soon be seen to constitute a crisis. Britain's century-long decline relative to other leading trading nations continues; political leaders must tell us whether they propose merely to manage a shrinking economy or whether they have found ways of reversing the trend. Such topics would be fit subjects for a discourse by a prime minister who had time to spare. The luxury of a stable majority would also help. Neither advantage is available to the present occupant of Number 10 Downing Street. The Carlton Club speech is therefore the best available exposition of what Mr Major thinks he can get through the Commons. It set out a political programme. Some Conservatives hoped for more - for a 'vision'. For that they must wait until the vaudeville days are over.</p>

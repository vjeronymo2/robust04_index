			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Complaints of sex bias at work up 40% COMPLAINTS about sex discrimination in the workplace increased by 40 per cent last year, the Equal Opportunities Commission said yesterday. Releasing its annual report, the commission said the increase had been caused by the continued rise in the number of women going out to work, increased expectations among younger women and the higher profile of the commission. Ms Joanna Foster, who chairs the commission, said the recession had also played a part in the rise in complaints. 'Organisations are getting leaner and some are getting meaner,' she said. There were more than 9,000 complaints about employment issues last year compared with 6,500 in 1990. The main areas of complaint involved recruitment, pregnancy-related matters and unfavourable terms and conditions of employment. Sexual harassment complaints were up 35 per cent from 317 to 427. Some complaints about sexual harassment in service delivery, rather than employment, had also been received. There is no case law on whether the Sex Discrimination Act covers services and the commission is backing a test case involving a woman learner driver who alleges sexual harassment by her driving instructor. Ms Foster said the figures showed that sex discrimination was still a big problem in the workplace. 'Yet while expectations of fair treatment are higher than ever before, redress is more difficult to obtain because of the complexity and cost of taking legal action,' she said. Ms Foster said that if the government was serious about its Citizen's Charter it needed to consider amendments put forward by the commission aimed at strengthening and simplifying the equality laws.

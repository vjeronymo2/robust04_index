			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DANCE / EILEEN SONDAK;  </P> <P> GERMANI HOPES CONCERT WILL END IDENTITY CRISIS  </P> <P> Although Al Germani Dance Company has made the rounds of low-tech venues over  the past year, it has yet to make an official debut on the concert scene. That  will change when the San Diego-based troupe performs its "Premiere Concert" at  Westminster Church tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m.  </P> <P> Germani, who described the company as a "postmodern contemporary jazz dance  troupe," said he founded the group as a proving ground for his own  choreographic voice. The transplanted Easterner, with seven years of experience  teaching, dancing and choreographing in San Diego, said his approach to dance  making emphasizes "the development of expressionistic choreography which  reflects as well as affects the social conscience of its viewing audience."  </P> <P> Sound pretentious? Perhaps, but, as Germani noted, his message is emotional,  not political.  </P> <P> "My goal is to make people experience feelings," he said. "The dances don't  necessarily tell a literal story. I just want the audience to put their own  meaning on what they see."  </P> <P> This pair of concerts will feature five dances -- some still termed works in  progress -- and an all-female cast, because, as its creator noted, "it's a  tough town to get men."  </P> <P> Germani hopes this coming-out concert will solve his "identity crisis" in San  Diego. "Since I teach jazz, people expect my work to look like commercial  jazz," he said. "But it's really semi-modern -- everything after the masters."  </P> <P> "You can't take eight ballets out of 50 and expect to see everything," Eliot  Feld acknowledged by phone from his New York studio. "But on this visit to San  Diego, we're bringing a sampling that is really representative of the body of  my work."  </P> <P> The dances will speak for themselves beginning tonight, when the Feld Ballet  kicks off a two-weekend residency that includes four public concerts and as  many lecture demonstrations for local schoolchildren, all at Symphony Hall.  Feld fans will have a field day with repertory works culled from two decades of  dance making by the internationally acclaimed choreographer.  </P> <P> "All the pieces, with the exception of one (Feld's jaunty crowd pleaser, 'The  Jig Is Up') are new to San Diego," he said. "Two are this year's."  </P> <P> Critics have observed changes in Feld's oeuvre in recent years, most notably a  more balletic slant, but the busy iconoclast dismisses questions about the  evolutionary development of his dances.  </P> <P> "I don't look at an overview of what I've done. I'm only concerned about what  interests me now -- the next work. I feel my juices getting going to start  something new as soon as I get back."  </P> <P> Expect to see "The Consort," a dance of manners that harks back to 1970;  "Petipa Notwithstanding," Feld's fusion of modern and Petipa-style classical  ballet, and the recent "Love Song Waltzes," which traces the bumpy road of  romantic love through complex motional patterns juxtaposed against a Brahms  score.  </P> <P> Feld's marathon 10-day sojourn in San Diego is unprecedented for an imported  dance troupe. But Suzanne Townsend of San Diego Performances says it's only the  beginning.  </P> <P> "Our vision of a presenter goes beyond being an intermediary to book  attractions," she said. "These artists are valuable resources to the community,  and we want to facilitate their interaction with the public as much as possible  -- with student performances and master classes.  </P> <P> "We can't do it with every company, but it's our intention to have a minimum of  two companies a year for extended residencies," she said. "And we'd eventually  like to commission works to be performed here, like Orange County did with  (American Ballet Theatre's) 'Swan Lake.' It's all part of our artistic mission  for this community."  </P> <P> Jazz Unlimited's return to Sherwood Auditorium in La Jolla this weekend will  give dance enthusiasts another choice for its already-burgeoning dance card.  The San Diego-based jazz ensemble will feature something old and something new  on the program when it dances its two-concert series tonight and tomorrow  night.  </P> <P> "We're doing two premieres and one adaptation as part of our six-piece  program," director Patricia Rincon said. "All of us (Jazz Unlimited veterans)  are getting up there in age, so we have added a young man, Terry Lindley, to  the ranks. He's never worked on a concert stage and his technique is not that  developed, but he's a natural. Today, most of the jazz dancers think L.A. punk  is all there is to jazz dance. They're only trained in the trendy styles, but  our background is more general."  </P> <P> That's why eclectic Kelley Grant, who chalked up a bevy of credits on Broadway  and in the modern dance arena, is still a hot number at Jazz Unlimited after  eight years in the fold.  </P> <P> "It's so nice to have a mature dancer with savvy on stage," Rincon said. "And  Kelley is so versatile."  </P> <P> Local dance buffs will see this unique combination of old and new when Grant  and Lindley team up for the debut of a duet by Margaret Marshall. Barry Bernal,  fresh from his appearance at the Academy Awards show, will hog the limelight  twice this weekend, once as lead dancer in "Za Za" and again for "Pictures  Without Words."  </P> <P> North County dancers will get into the act this weekend as well. The Palomar  College Dance Ensemble is due to perform four concerts at the college between  Friday and Sunday. As usual, Palomar will present a potpourri of styles for its  spring concert, from ballet to tap and show dance. Featured on this program is  an original modern dance based on the plight of the homeless.  </P></p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coconut output 'to fall' WORLD COCONUT production will decline this year and next leading to sharp falls in exports of coconut products, according to the Asian and Pacific Coconut Community. Coconut production will reach 8.524m tonnes, copra equivalent, this year, down 3.2 per cent on 1991, and will drop to 8.452m tonnes in 1993. However, the decline in exportable supplies of coconut products will be larger because of a prolonged drought in the Philippines, the world's leading exporter. The drought has 'thwarted the prospects of a recovery in the Philippines coconut production later this year and early 1993', the association says in the latest edition of Cocomunity, its official publication. The APCC forecast 1993 production in the Philippines' at 1.7m tonnes copra equivalent, continuing a steady decline from a high of 2.8m tonnes in 1990. The Philippines' exports of coconut oil are likely to fall 30 per cent this year to 620,000 tonnes, with world exports down 19 per cent to 1.1m tonnes. World exports of copra meal are forecast to fall by 9 per cent in 1992 to 980,000 tonnes and further to 949,500 next year. The APCC expects world exports of desiccated coconut to reach 185,500 tonnes this year, down 3.6 per cent on 1991, and to drop slightly to 181,500 in 1993.</p>

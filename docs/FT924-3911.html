			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts surge on sterling strength and firmer markets UK GOVERNMENT bonds rallied strongly yesterday, gaining over a point at the long end on the combination of sterling strength and a firmer tone to the other European government bond markets. Dealers expressed some surprise as gilt prices surged ahead, following Wednesday's disappointing gilt auction, and pointed out that volume in the Liffe gilt future was average, with around 27,000 contracts traded. The Bank of England auctioned Pounds 2.5bn of 8 per cent gilts due 2003 on Wednesday, but the auction failed to attract foreign investors and dealers said some of the stock had been left with marketmakers. However, dealers said yesterday that worries about the disappointing auction had faded, and the market recovered over a point mainly on the strength of sterling. The pound ended at DM2.468/2.471, compared with DM2.434/2.436 on Wednesday. The 10 1/2 per cent gilt due 1997 rose from 110 3/16 to 110 23/32 , while the 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 2017 rallied from 97 13/32 to 98 25/32 by late afternoon. GERMAN government bonds gained nearly half a point helped by the combination of a favourable wage settlement and the latest German economic data. Bund prices rose across the yield curve with short-dated paper out-performing longer-dated issues. The Liffe bund futures contract rose from 90.85 at the opening to a high of 91.22 by late afternoon. The announcement yesterday morning that the IG Metall union had agreed a 3.3 per cent 18-month wage deal for its 125,000 German steelworkers sparked buying interest early in the day. The settlement is below the 3.7 per cent annual inflation rate and was viewed positively by the market. The market rallied further on the release of weak German economic data. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) fell for the second quarter in a row, dropping 0.5 per cent in the third quarter. West German industrial production fell 2.2 per cent in October and unemployment rose to 6.9 per cent in November from 6.7 per cent in October. PROFIT-taking wiped out early gains in the Japanese government bond market, and bond prices ended slightly lower on the day. The market closed before the announcement of the Gross National Product figures for the third quarter, which showed that real GNP fell 0.4 per cent. Japan's economy contracted at an annualised rate of 1.6 per cent. Dealers pointed out that the figures are positive for the bond market. The yield on the benchmark No 145 moved between 4.575-4.605 per cent and ended at 4.59 per cent. In the futures market, the contract opened at 107.89 and moved as high as 107.97, but dealers noted the 108 level is likely to prove a strong resistance point. The Bank of Japan allowed open money market rates to edge lower, with the unsecured overnight call money rate slipping  1/32 to 3 7/8 per cent. US TREASURY prices traded in a narrow range yesterday as dealers and investors cautiously awaited today's important jobs report. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/32 at 100 23/32 , yielding 7.558 per cent. There was also little movement at the short end of the market, where the two-year note was down  1/32 at 99 21/32 , yielding 4.791 per cent. Prices eased slightly in early trading on more economically bullish news. The latest data was a 12,000 decline in initial claims for unemployment insurance during the third week of November. The drop was bigger than expected and suggested that today's keenly awaited employment report for November will show a small improvement in labour market conditions. Treasuries recovered later, however, as dealers covered their short positions and other participants prepared their books for the jobs figures.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / International Company News: Currency side boosts J P Morgan JP MORGAN, the New York banking group, yesterday reported a 7 per cent increase in third-quarter profits to Dollars 400m, thanks to strong corporate finance fees, net interest income and trading revenues, which helped offset further losses on mortgage-backed securities (MBS). The bank would not reveal the scale of the MBS losses, created by high levels of mortgage refinancings and accelerated prepayments, but they are believed to have contributed to the 16 per cent decline in Morgan's overall securities trading revenues to Dollars 313m. The bank lost Dollars 50m on its MBS business in the first quarter of this year. Strong profits from foreign exchange and derivatives trading, however, helped make up for the MBS losses in the third quarter. Like many big international banks and securities firms, Morgan earned a lot of money from exploiting the volatile movements in world interest rates and currency markets during September. Corporate finance earnings were especially healthy during the third quarter, rising 60 per cent to Dollars 123m, primarily because of an increase in cross-border advisory business, particularly in Latin America. Net interest income remained the biggest earner for Morgan, rising 14 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 448m as the bank restructured parts of its investment portfolio to boost the volume of average interest-earnings assets. Sales of certain US and foreign government securities and other investments, part of the portfolio restructuring, resulted in net gains of Dollars 91m. Increased activity in the securities lending business lifted credit-related fees 49 per cent to Dollars 58m, and a rise in assets under management pushed investment management fees up 21 per cent to Dollars 97m. Morgan's operating expenses climbed 16 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 754m, a result of higher salary expenses related to increased hiring, higher compensation payouts linked to the company's performance, and increased technology and communications costs. Morgan's figures were well received by the stock market, and the bank's shares closed up  5/8 at Dollars 61 7/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

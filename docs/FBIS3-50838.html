Independently of last year's energy deficit, 80 percent of  electrical power was generated by using Cuban oil. However, the  production plan was based on the fuel available and in  consideration of the deficits of other generating plants. [as  heard] Although a great part of the electricity available is due  to the use of Cuban oil, this oil needs various additives to  counter corrosion and partially neutralize the effects of its  high viscosity and sulfur content which obstruct its flow  through the pipes and damage the steel plates.    Add to these difficulties the maintenance limitations which  are dependent not only on material shortages but also on the  labor force deficit. Agustin Jimenez Saranda pointed out,  without raising false hopes, that proper maintenance might  result in long term improvements and the energy situation will  be less unnerving in '94 and succeeding years: a pleasing bit of  news for the beginning of 1994.</p>

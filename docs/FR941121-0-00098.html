			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The goals of the Budget Act serve as the Commission's guidepost for this task: (1) To create a level regulatory playing field for CMRS; (2) to establish an appropriate level of regulation for the administration of CMRS; (3) to resolve ``substantial similarity'' issues with a view toward ensuring that unwarranted regulatory burdens are not imposed on reclassified CMRS providers; and (4) to promote the economic goals discussed in the CMRS Second Report and Order, including fostering economic growth, promoting investment in mobile telecommunications infrastructure, and enabling access to the national information superhighway.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on these goals, the Order concludes that the appropriate analytical framework for determining whether services are substantially similar is to assess whether licensees in those services actually or potentially compete to meet the needs and demands of consumers. The Order concludes that all reclassified private mobile radio services actually compete, or have the potential to compete within a reasonable time period, with existing commercial mobile radio services. In other words, the Commission concludes that all CMRS_including one-way messaging and data, and two-way voice, messaging, and data_are competing services or have the reasonable potential to become competing services in the CMRS marketplace. Thus, on the basis of this competitive analysis, the Order finds that all reclassified private services are substantially similar to existing commercial services, for purposes of section 332 of the Communications Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This broad reading of the term ``substantially similar'' furthers the statutory purposes of promoting uniformity in CMRS regulation and, thereby, minimizes the potentially distorting effects of asymmetrical regulation. This reasoning also comports with the Commission's analysis of current and likely future competition in the CMRS marketplace. Actual competition among certain CMRS services exists already and, more importantly, the potential for competition among all CMRS services appears likely to increase over time due to expanding consumer demand and technological innovation. Such conditions argue for defining the class of ``substantially similar'' services expansively, at least for the limited purpose of establishing baseline technical and operational rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is worth emphasizing the determinative relationship between the forward-looking policy goals embodied in the rule comparability requirement of the Budget Act and the Commission's assessment of competitive trends in the CMRS marketplace. Thus, this Order begins with the conclusion that mobile services will be treated as substantially similar if they compete against each other. Next, the Commission has chosen to take an expansive view of the present condition of competition among services in the CMRS marketplace, and of the potential for competition among these services in the future, because such a view maximizes the range of services that can be considered to be substantially similar. This in turn leads the Commission to conclude that, to the extent practical, technical and operational rules should be comparable for virtually all existing and reclassified CMRS services. This conclusion furthers the Commission's policy objective of ensuring a level regulatory playing field for CMRS. The Order notes, however, that an analysis performed in the context of a different set of policy goals, or application of the same policy goals to different circumstances, may result in different conclusions regarding the extent of competition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Comparable Technical and Operational Rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The determination that actual and potential competition among CMRS services makes them ``substantially similar'' for purposes of Budget Act analysis carries over into the assessment of technical and operational rules. The Order concludes that differences between rules governing actually or potentially competitive services should be conformed if the Commission determines that the differences distort competition by placing unequal regulatory burdens on different classes of CMRS providers. Such conformity between rules will not be imposed, however, if the Commission determines that, although the relative burdens imposed by the rules may not be identical, the cost of conforming the rules outweighs the benefit that might be gained thereby. Pursuant to this analytical framework, the principal determinations are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> a. Service Area and Channel Assignment Rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 800 MHz SMR: The Order adopts the principle that 800 MHz SMR systems should be licensed on a Major Trading Area (MTA) basis to the extent feasible, but defers for further comment the specifics of licensing such systems to ensure that the interests of both existing licensees and potential entrants are taken into account. The Commission will shortly issue a further notice of proposed rule making in our 800 MHz docket (PR Docket No. 93&hyph;144) regarding: (1) Designating 200 contiguous SMR channels for MTA licensing based on 50-channel blocks; (2) continuing to license the remaining 80 SMR channels under existing rules; and (3) allowing incumbents to continue operating on existing channels. The Order declines to adopt a proposal by Nextel that certain 800 MHz incumbents be subject to mandatory returning to new frequencies, but the Commission will seek further comment on this issue. The Order further concludes that both existing SMR licensees and new entrants will be eligible for MTA licenses, with licensees to be selected by auction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the event of mutually exclusive applications. Finally, the Order concludes that in light of the fundamental changes to be implemented in 800 MHz licensing, the Commission is suspending the acceptance of all new 800 MHz SMR applications, as of August 9, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 900 MHz SMR: The Order adopts MTA-based licensing of all 200 channels in blocks of 10 channels. The Order concludes that eligibility for MTA licenses will be open to existing licensees and new entrants, with competitive bidding to be used in the event of mutually exclusive applications. Incumbent licensees who do not obtain MTA licenses will be entitled to continue operating under existing authorizations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 220 MHz Commercial Service: The Order concludes that service area definitions and channel assignment rules applicable to licensing of 220 MHz systems should not be changed at this time. The Commission will address such issues in a separate, future rule making proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Private Carrier Paging: The Order adopts no conformance changes to existing part 90 and part 22 paging rules in this docket. The Commission will defer further action until it examines the question of wide-area licensing and whether further conforming of Commission rules is feasible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Housebuilding helps Crest Nicholson Crest Nicholson, the Surrey-based housebuilder, recorded a strong recovery in profits for the six months to April 30, writes Simon Davies. However, the continuing impact of recession on its construction division resulted in 120 lay-offs, at a cost of Pounds 450,000. Group pre-tax profits were Pounds 3.01m (Pounds 3.94m losses), on house sales up from 652 to 926 and residential operating margins improved from 4 to 9.5 per cent, as the company benefited from the depletion of its more expensive pre-1991 land bank. Residential housing, concentrated in the south-east and south-west of England, contributed pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.91m (Pounds 1.45m). Losses in the commercial property division fell to Pounds 477,000 (Pounds 3.9m). Construction division pre-tax losses rose to Pounds 1.98m (Pounds 255,000). The bulk of its redundancy costs will be carried in the second half. The company is declaring its first interim dividend since 1990 with a payment of 0.6p. Earnings per share amounted to 1.32p (losses of 4.59p).</p>

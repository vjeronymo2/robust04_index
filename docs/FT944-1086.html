			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / People: Brian Wallace slips away from Geest Ladbroke, the gaming, hotels, retail and property group, has appointed Brian Wallace as group finance director. He is currently group finance director of Geest, the fresh produce and prepared foods company, and will take up his new post by April 1. The appointment ends months of uncertainty over the replacement for Jerry O'Mahony, who died in June. Until Wallace arrives, the position will continue to be occupied by David Wilson, who was seconded from Ernst &amp; Young in February to cover for O'Mahony and appointed acting finance director in August. Wilson is then expected to be appointed to another senior mangement position. Wallace, 40, a St Andrews economics graduate, was appointed to his current position in 1990. He had previously worked for Schlumberger, and as group financial controller at APV, the producer of food processing equipment, after qualifying as a chartered accountant with Price Waterhouse. This appointment adds to the list of changes at Ladbroke after Cyril Stein retired as chairman last January. The group has since moved back into casinos after a 15-year absence.</p>

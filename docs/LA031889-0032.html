			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ABBOTT TO BUY PANCRETEC FOR $54 MILLION  </P> <P> Pancretec, a San Diego County-based medical equipment manufacturer that staged  a remarkable comeback from the brink of financial ruin, will be acquired by  Abbott Laboratories for $54 million, according to a tentative agreement  announced by the companies Friday.  </P> <P> Abbott, a diversified health-care firm based in North Chicago, Ill., will pay  $15 a share pending approval by Pancretec shareholders at a meeting scheduled  tentatively for July. The $54 million includes Abbott's purchase of outstanding  preferred shares and assumes the exercise of Pancretec stock options and stock  purchase warrants.  </P> <P> The merger is also contingent on a definitive agreement, a favorable vote by  Abbott's and Pancretec's boards of directors and receipt by Pancretec of a  favorable outside opinion as to the financial fairness of Abbott's offer.  </P> <P> Rancho Bernardo-based Pancretec makes portable drug-infusion pumps used for  outpatients' medication. Buoyed by growth in the home health-care industry,  Pancretec is agreeing to be acquired at a time when profits are climbing and  its sales are growing at a nearly 100% annual rate.  </P> <P> For the fiscal year ended June 30, the company reported a $302,000 profit on  sales of $6 million, up from a loss of $932,000 on sales of $2.9 million in  1987.  </P> <P> Abbott spokeswoman Cathy Babington said Pancretec's advanced technology and  strong market position are what attracted Abbott to the relatively small San  Diego company.  </P> <P> "We also sell drug-infusion pumps, and, once the merger is complete, this will  enhance our position," she said, declining to specify how much of Abbott's $4.9  billion in annual sales are derived from pump sales.  </P> <P> Pancretec's strong sales and earnings growth have continued so far this year,  with net income reaching $688,000 on sales of $4.5 million for the two quarters  ended Dec. 31, up from a loss of $89,000 on sales of $2.4 million for the  corresponding six months in 1987.  </P> <P> Pancretec's performance was not always so sparkling. When the company hired Jim  Yarter, a former C. R. Bard executive, as president in August, 1986, it was  virtually out of cash and had a shareholder equity of negative $1 million. Its  executive offices had become a revolving door: Yarter was the company's third  chief executive in seven months.  </P> <P> By increasing Pancretec's sales staff, improving technology and focusing on the  market for drug pumps supplied to AIDS victims, Yarter turned Pancretec around.  The profits have boosted Pancretec's stock price over the past 18 months from a  low of $1.50 to Friday's close of $13.625.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Largest Shareholder  </P> <P> Pancretec's largest shareholder is Ventana Growth Fund, a San Diego venture  capital firm headed by Duwaine Townsen, which held 14.5% of Pancretec's common  stock as of August. Ventana's initial investment of $700,000 in 1986 is now  worth more than $5 million if its holdings have not changed. Townsen was  unavailable for comment Friday.  </P> <P> Yarter owned 91,040 shares of Pancretec as of August, a stake that would be  worth more than $1.3 million at the per-share price offered by Abbott.  </P> <P> Pancretec employs 81 at its plant, none of whom will be laid off because of the  merger, chief financial officer Joel Graff said Friday. Abbott employs 39,000.  </P></p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Mowat goes into receivership as banks refuse further funding MOWAT, the USM-quoted leisure and property group, was last night placed in receivership after a consortium of 13 banks, led by Lloyds, refused to provide it with further funding. The group's shares had yesterday morning been suspended at 2 1/2 p at its own request. Touche Ross, the accountants, have been appointed receivers with effect from this morning. Mowat, whose activities include UK-based holiday parks and cruises on the Norfolk Broads, said receivers were called in after the company had failed to raise Pounds 6.5m in new working capital, as demanded by the banks. Mr Ian Birch, regional director of Lloyds Bank Commercial Services, said last night that problems over the group's property business and its high level of debt had proved insurmountable. He added: 'The first priority will be to reassure those customers who have booked and paid for holidays in September that those holidays will be honoured. The receivers will be urgently looking at the situation and a helpline will be set up.' Mr Brian Dunlop, Mowat's chairman, said it had 20,000 holidays booked for September and 43,000 for October. The company was not a member of the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) and the holidays were not protected by a bond. Mr Dunlop expressed disappointment that the banks had decided to place the company in receivership after what he described as a successful attempt to resolve some of its problems. He said that of Mowat's Pounds 54m of debt, Pounds 30m was secured against property. This was owed to 10 of the banks, which had agreed in principle to take ownership of the property concerned. He said the remaining Pounds 24m was owed to the three remaining banks, led by Lloyds. They had demanded that the company come up with Pounds 6.5m in working capital, of which it had obtained Pounds 2.5m with the promise of Pounds 1m more. Lloyds said, however, that Mowat had not managed to obtain the level of funding it had required. The downturn in the UK property market led to Mowat announcing a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.97m for the 15 months to the end of September 1991. Its property interests included commercial property development and housebuilding. Following the announcement of the loss, the company said it planned to withdraw from property development and housebuilding and concentrate on the holiday business. Last July, Mowat said it was selling its Potter Heigham boatyard and more than 200 cruisers and pleasure boats to Broads Tours, a private company, for Pounds 1.9m cash and Pounds 2m worth of property. The first cash instalment of Pounds 1m is due at the end of October. Mr Len Funnell, Broads Tours' chairman, said yesterday he still expected the deal to go ahead.</p>

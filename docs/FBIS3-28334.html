Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa ordered Finance Minister  Hirohisa Fujii to revise a previous tax plan announced by the  premier last week, after leaders of the coalition parties asked  the government on Monday to come up with a new plan, the  official at the ministry's tax bureau said. But the ministry,  he said, will "not change its policy to include tax cuts and  hike in a single program."    The official declined to comment on whether the new plan  would call for a tax which limits revenue use to special  purposes.    Hosokawa told Fujii to draft a plan "as soon as possible,"  the official said. Hosokawa last week announced a "national  welfare tax" similar to the consumption tax to offset income and  corporate tax cuts, but the ruling coalition rejected the  proposal.    The ministry official later corrected his comments, saying  the Prime Minister's Office contacted Fujii again to explain  that Hosokawa told the coalition leaders he would have the  Finance and Home Affairs Ministries "help" the coalition form a  new tax plan.    Hosokawa told Sakigake representative Hiroyuki Sonoda to  reach a final decision on the tax plan at the coalition meeting,  according to the Finance Ministry official.</p>

			<p>941216 FT  16 DEC 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): New look at brain abnormalities Toshiba, the Japanese electronics company, has developed an imaging technique which could make it easier for doctors to examine brain function abnormalities, such as epilepsy. The technique is a form of magnetic resonance imaging, which monitors the electromagnetic radiation given off by excited nuclei in a magnetic field. The 'double echo' MRI method produces separate images of the neurons and adjacent blood flows by relying on differences in the fall-off characteristics of their wave signals. Toshiba believes the accuracy and speed of the technique will assist doctors with diagnosis, presurgical mapping and the exploration of complex brain functions.

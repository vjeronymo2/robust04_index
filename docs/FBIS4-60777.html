			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius Apr 29, BNS -- The president of Lithuania,  Algirdas Brazauskas, on Friday [29 April] received the Russian  ambassador to Lithuania, Nikolai Obiortyshev, who presented a  letter from Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Yeltsin's letter  came as answer to a letter sent by Brazauskas earlier this month.    Brazauskas told reporters after the meeting that the Russian  president links the implementation of economic treaties with the  problem of Russian transit to the Kaliningrad region through  Lithuania.    Russian transit through Lithuanian territory remains the  main  stumbling block hindering economic and trade relations between  the two countries. The Lithuanian leadership raised the issue  on numerous occasions on the international level. Lithuania and  other European nations need to know whether such positions  reflect the working style of Moscow functionaries or Russia's  political line, Brazauskas said in his speech at the Council of  Europe Parliamentary Assembly April 14.    After his meeting with Obiortyshev, the Lithuanian president  emphasized that Lithuania cannot assent to such a policy. He  said the Lithuanian-Russian economic treaties signed last  November were a result of only one stage of talks, but transit  to Kaliningrad and visa requirements are matters of further  negotiation.    But Brazauskas called "acceptable" Yeltsin's proposal to  continue talks because "the interests and tendencies" of both  countries coincide.    Brazauskas said the Russian ambassador told him that the  official Moscow values his initiative to exchange letters  between presidents. Obiortyshev said the process would be "a  good impulse" to bilateral talks.    The Russian diplomat said relations between Lithuania and  Russia are not bad, but neither of the sides is satisfied with  their "tempo." Obiortyshev noted, however, that Russia's  relations with Lithuania have progressed much further than  relations with Estonia and Latvia, as well as other former  Soviet republics.</p>

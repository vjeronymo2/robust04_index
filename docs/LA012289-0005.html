			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIG  </P> <P> I was amazed by Joan Franco's ability to meet the challenges of her daily life  ("Big," by Cathryn Jakobson, Nov. 27). I was, however, struck by something  Franco said: " 'I think we were better off before the women's movement. Now  we're stuck with two full-time jobs: raising a family, and working outside the  home.' "  </P> <P> The women's movement is focused on giving women their full range of choices as  human beings -- whether that choice is to be a full-time parent, work full time  in the work force, or some combination. Franco herself has expresses the need  of all women when she notes that she works as a nurse not only for the money  but also for the stimulation. Women are whole people. No woman should be forced  to sacrifice one or the other in order to satisfy society's stereotypes.  Without the movement, no woman, including Franco, would even have the option of  making a choice.  </P> <P> ABBY J. LEIBMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

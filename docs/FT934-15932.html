			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Silver takes the lead in precious metals market SILVER continued to outshine other precious metals at the London bullion market yesterday as prices responded to overnight, options-related buying at the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex). The London price ended at 435 US cents a troy ounce, up 15.5 cents, after Wednesday's 16-cent advance. Many investors see the outlook for the silver market as bullish, based on the present supply deficit, variously estimated at between 350 and 500 tonnes a year. But Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Bain and Company, said stocks in Comex warehouses amounted to about 275m ounces, equivalent to about six months' supply of the metal. And he suggested that before continuing deficits ate into this total significantly, rallies in the prices of lead and zinc might have brought brought mothballed lead/zinc mines back into production - and with them extra silver by-product.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unatrributed article: "One Maghrebian Out of Five Lives in </F> Poverty"]    [Text] Not everyone has benefited from the food policies  established in the Maghreb 30 years ago. A sizable minority of  the population sometimes goes hungry...    Nearly one of five Maghrebians is living under the poverty  line and suffering nutritional deficiencies. This is the  situation for 20 percent of Algerians, 17 percent of Tunisians,  and 30 percent of Moroccans, according to figures presented at a  workshop held recently in Alexandria (Egypt) on food problems in  the Maghreb region.    "We are seeing an increasingly visible movement of the poor  into urban milieus, a consequence of rural exodus by the most  impoverished peasants," reported Martine Padilla, economist at  the Mediterranean Agronomy Institute (IMA), one of the workshop  leaders.    Although significant progress has been registered since the  1960's, when an estimated two-thirds of all Tunisians were  living under the poverty line, a sizable minority of these  countries' inhabitants still suffers from malnutrition. In  Algeria, "15 percent of the women have a significant deficit in  protein calories," the economist said.    This despite large annual appropriations to support national  food policies (2.6 percent of GDP in Morocco and Algeria, and  3.5 percent in Tunisia).    The food planning policies pursued over the last 30 years  have raised the average standard of living: There has been a  measurable increase in life expectancy, with most nutritional  needs being met; but this progress has left behind a not  insignificant minority of the population. Martine Padilla notes  paradoxically that while "some people are suffering from  deficiencies, others show signs of dietary excess. Many cases of  obesity, especially among women, are found in Morocco and  Tunisia."    Countrywide distribution of staple foods (cereals, vegetable  oils, milk, and sugar in all three countries, plus eggs in  Tunisia and coffee in Algeria) has also had the perverse effect  of depressing local agricultural productivity. Augmented  consumption, fostered by easy access to products, has forced  governments to allocate more and more foreign exchange for food.    Between 1970 and 1992, Algeria's external food dependency  increased fourfold. Currently, 80 percent of staples consumed  there are imported. In Tunisia, the imported share is 60  percent. Only Morocco, a traditional exporter of agricultural  products, has managed to keep food imports and exports in some  kind of balance.  <H5>  End of Subsidies </H5>   Morocco has kept dependency down to 20 percent, but only by  curtailing consumption of certain foods (e.g., milk, mutton)  that are not produced locally in sufficient quantity.    Declining export earnings (oil for Algeria and phosphates  for  Morocco) exacerbated budgetary imbalances and increased  indebtedness, leading governments to revise their food security  policies. Especially after imposition of Structural Adjustment  Programs by the IMF. Since the inauguration of these programs  (1985-90), Tunisia and Morocco have initiated a truth in pricing  policy.    This year they must categorically eliminate all subsidies.  Algeria, now in the midst of a debt renegotiation round, has  already ended subsidies on all products except bread and  semolina.    The myth of food self-sufficiency has had its hour. Gone are  the days when whole populations could be inundated with food  staples made available at prices totally disconnected from the  market: Interventions today must be selective.    "What governments need now is to identify the people who are  being hit hardest by malnutrition, who present the risk of a  social explosion," says Martine Padilla. Already Morocco is  getting aid from an American NGO [nongovernmental organization],  Catholic Relief Services, which distributes food to the  neediest, as well as generous alimentary assistance from the  United States ($15 million this year). In 1991 Algeria  instituted a "social safety net" policy that affects half of its  population but remains notoriously ineffective.    In fact, it costs as much as countrywide subsidies while  doing nothing to solve the country's serious budgetary problem.  For all these reasons, the Algerians would like to modify their  strategy.    There are also purely technical problems. What kind of  targeting: by product, by geographic zone, by both together--or  perhaps distribution of "food tickets" giving access to certain  stores?    Aid channeled to society's neediest also poses the question  of how to mobilize the funds to purchase vast quantities of food  products on the market, store them, and distribute them at sites  accessible to a diffuse public, including many inhabitants  disinclined to accept the stigma of the "poverty" label.    Maghrebian rulers must consider all possible solutions to  the  dilemma of how to reduce undernourishment in an international  environment of recession and budgetary restrictions.</p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Cost of some calls abroad set to fall CHARGES FOR phone calls from the UK to Australia, Canada and Sweden are expected to fall following the government's announcement yesterday of more competition on these routes. A new form of competition, known as simple resale, will allow operators to lease international circuits in bulk from British Telecommunications and Mercury Communications and resell services. Customers will be able to access the resellers' services via the public telephone network - that has not been permitted under the more restricted form of resale allowed since last year. Simple resale is expected to be an economic proposition because prices of international calls are considered to be well above costs in spite of pressure from regulators which has resulted in significant cuts. Large business users are expected to be the main beneficiaries. But there could be a knock-on benefit for domestic customers if BT and Mercury cut their charges in response to competition. The Department of Trade and Industry has so far authorised only Australia, Canada and Sweden for simple resale competition because it believes that no other country has a sufficiently open regulatory regime for international communications. But Mr Edward Leigh, the trade and technology minister, said he hoped he would be able to open up more routes to competition. Industry analysts believe the DTI will authorise resale to the US - the busiest destination for international traffic from the UK - after a meeting to be held next month by the US regulatory authorities at which relaxed regulation on international competition is likely to be agreed. Australia and Canada each account for 3 per cent of the UK's outgoing international traffic while Sweden accounts for 2 per cent, according to the London-based International Institute of Communication. The US accounts for 19 per cent. The DTI said it had awarded the first licence for international simple resale to ACC Long Distance, a US company which plans to start a service to Canada in the first quarter of next year. Four other companies which plan to provide international resale as well as domestic services - Ionica, WorldCom International, National Network and Millicom - are also having licences to resell services processed. Expectations of increased competition in international telephone traffic affected the share price of Cable and Wireless, the telecommunications group, which has substantial international business. The shares dropped 5 per cent to close at 582p.</p>

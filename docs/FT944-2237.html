			<p>941216 FT  16 DEC 94 / Karadzic peace plan gets cool response from west Western governments reacted coolly yesterday to the six-point peace plan proposed by Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, and his invitation to Mr Jimmy Carter, the former US president, to act as a mediator. Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, speaking in Brussels at a meeting of Nato defence ministers, said the plan 'could be a positive step forward in the humanitarian direction' but 'history indicates the need for some scepticism'. Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, was more hostile: 'There is a provocative aspect to the plan which is unacceptable.' In London, senior officials said they would welcome any attempt by Mr Carter to promote peace in the region but admitted they were 'sceptical rather than cynical' about what such an intervention could achieve. In Sarajevo, the Moslem-led Bosnian government dismissed the initiative as a 'ploy to buy time'. In an interview with Cable News Network television on Wednesday night, Mr Karadzic asked Mr Carter to mediate and proposed a plan for Bosnian Serb forces to give up some territory, agree an immediate ceasefire around Sarajevo and the reopening of the city airport, release detained United Nations officers and Moslem prisoners of war younger than 19, and allow free passage of relief convoys. Mr Carter was yesterday awaiting evidence of a cessation of hostilities in Sarajevo before deciding whether to leave on a private mediation mission. A White House official said early reports were that Mr Karadzic was living up to his commitment to stop firing on the Bosnian capital and to end interference with UN humanitarian deliveries. If the lull continued, Mr Carter could be 'on his way in 24 hours', the White House said. Bearing in mind Mr Carter's successful diplomatic efforts this year in North Korea and Haiti, President Bill Clinton has clearly found it difficult to reject out of hand the offer of mediation by the former president. However, the White House stressed that any mission would be private. It said that while any action to reduce tensions was welcome, 'it remains our view that a solution to this conflict will only be found at the negotiating table' on the basis of the settlement already proposed by the contact group comprising the US, Russia, Britain, France and Germany. Mr Perry said Mr Carter had promised not to deviate from the existing peace plan as the basis for a long-term settlement. France and US raise stakes, Page 2</p>

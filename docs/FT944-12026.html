			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Personal View: Europe - the spectre of budget deficits Over the last few months the majority of economic forecasters have been forced to raise their predictions for Europe's growth in 1994. It would seem natural to assume that there is a common factor behind this 'surprising' growth, but this appears not to be the case. The German economic recovery has been brought about by a combination of buoyant corporate sector spending and a fall in the personal sector's savings rate. Both factors can be attributed to an accumulation of money balances in each sector, which has led both individuals and companies to spend more. It is no coincidence that the recovery has followed a period of above-trend monetary growth. Most of the hallmarks of monetary expansion are present: the current account balance has deteriorated as the national savings rate has fallen, equity prices have risen, and the yield curve has steepened. This German monetary expansion is partly due to the Bundesbank's action in adding liquidity to the economy when defending the exchange rate mechanism last year. It is also the product of rapid growth in domestic credit, mainly in lending to the public sector to fund Germany's budget deficit. Over the last three years, bank lending to the public sector has accounted for between a third and half of the growth in broad money. The banking system has effectively been creating money to finance the budget deficit and this has been spent in the domestic economy, stimulating recovery. Outside Germany, budget deficits have also played a part in economic recovery. According to OECD figures, the French budget deficit grew by the equivalent of 2 per cent of gross domestic product last year. This year, it is expected that aggregate GDP will rise by a similar amount. Similarly, Sweden raised its budget deficit by more than 5 per cent of GDP last year but seems likely to generate economic growth of only 3 per cent this year. While these countries have seen economic recovery, the price appears to have been large budget deficit increases. Over the past decade, many have become blase about budget deficits. In this world of freely flowing capital, few would claim that any given budget deficit could not be financed. Unfortunately, when it requires real interest rates of more than 5 per cent, the stock of debt is compounding at twice the rate the economies themselves are capable of growing. It seems surprising that this arithmetic attracts such scant attention given its implications for tax rates, inflation and interest rates in the future. Public indebtedness is now growing so fast that one is left wondering where the income will eventually come from to service it. Furthermore, if one were to add the problem of Europe's frequently unfunded public pensions, the debt arithmetic becomes quite impossible. Present fiscal trends leave many European states effectively no hope of fulfilling their public pension commitments in the future. Perhaps more worrying for this generation of Europeans is the effect current budget deficits are having on Europe's economic structure. Many countries in the exchange rate mechanism cannot allow their budget deficits to be funded by the banking system as in Germany. Such de facto easing of monetary conditions would clearly be incompatible with maintaining their exchange rates in the ERM. Instead, the budget deficits of France and other countries have to be funded by borrowing from the other sectors of the economy, especially since foreigners have started to sell European bonds in significant quantities. Given the high real interest rates on offer, it is not surprising that French investors should find current bond rates attractive. But there is evidence that French companies are foregoing capital spending and employment creation to invest in bonds. This surely cannot be a sustainable state of affairs. High real interest rates and low domestic rates of return on private investment are allowing the budget deficits to crowd out more productive forms of fund raising. If this continues, Europe could undergo a further loss of competitiveness and a consequent decline in its long-run growth prospects. Europe must address its budget deficits quickly. In Germany, the persistently high monetary growth rate will eventually force the Bundesbank to raise interest rates to cool the economy. In other EU countries, large budget deficits are not only generating an unfortunate legacy for our heirs, they are distorting the economies and will make Europe less able to compete internationally.

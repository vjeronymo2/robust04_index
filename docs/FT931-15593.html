			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / KIO's Grupo Torras puts 36% holding in Ebro up for sale GRUPO TORRAS, the Kuwait Investment Office's troubled Spanish investment arm, has put its controlling 36 per cent stake in Ebro, the profitable domestic food company, up for sale. Ebro was a successful part of the KIO's Spanish portfolio, which includes holdings in chemicals, paper, property and financial services. The sale forms part of the KIO's plan to reduce involvement drastically in Spain. It last month put Torras into receivership with losses of Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn). 'Each and every one of the top European sugar companies is going to be interested in the Ebro memorandum,' said a senior US investment banker in Madrid. The company, which closed its financial year in September with estimated net profits of Dollars 54m and a Dollars 96m positive cash flow, has 54 per cent of the domestic sugar market and is Europe's biggest rice producer. Government officials confirmed yesterday that Torras had awarded Credit Suisse First Boston the mandate to sell the holding in Ebro, which could raise more than Dollars 340m. Much of Torras's stake in Ebro is pledged to creditor banks. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, the big Spanish bank, has outstanding loans of Dollars 22m to Torras guaranteed by about 5 per cent of Ebro stock, Bank of America's Ebro-pledged loans to the holding company are believed to total more than Dollars 86m and Chase Manhattan and Sumitomo also hold Ebro equity as loan collateral to the holding company. A spokeswoman at Spain's economy ministry, which is supervising Torras' receivership application, said the government had requested Torras to make a bloc sale of its Ebro holding. She denied market rumours in Madrid that the government would prod Tabacalera, the government-controlled tobacco monopoly that already owns just under 5 per cent of Ebro, into bidding for the Torras stake. Analysts said Tabacalera, which is part-owner with Italy's Ferruzzi group of Elosua, the domestic edible oil group, is the sole Spanish group close to the agribusiness sector that could approach a deal as big as the one offered by Torras' disposal of Ebro. Without a bid by Tabacalera, Ebro is likely to fall to one of the big European groups. Ferruzzi is viewed as a front-runner among potential buyers, although analysts speculated it might be ruled out by the EC Commission because it already has large sugar interests across Europe. Sudzucker, the German sugar group, is thought to be too busy in eastern Germany and Belgium to want to take on the Ebro stake. Tate &amp; Lyle, the UK company with a 6.4 per cent stake in Azucarera, Spain's other main sugar producer, is rumoured to have decided against involvement.</p>

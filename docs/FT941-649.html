			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Higher cigarette taxes peg T&amp;S rise Increased taxes on cigarettes held back the advance at T&amp;S Stores, the newsagent and convenience store retailer, which yesterday announced a marginal increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 12.53m to Pounds 12.56m for the year to January 1. The increase was achieved on a 2 per cent advance in sales to Pounds 352m. Mr Kevin Threlfall, chairman, was bullish about the current year, saying like-for-like sales were running 7 per cent ahead of last year. Further improvement would come from the Pounds 5.95m cash acquisition announced yesterday of 27 convenience stores trading under the Macs name. This is T&amp;S's second acquisition this year, after the Pounds 6.7m cash purchase of 74 Gibbs newsagents shops. The two purchases are expected to contribute sales of more than Pounds 40m in the current year. Supercigs, the discount tobacco and confectionery chain, suffered an 11 per cent decline in operating profits to Pounds 2.54m, on sales 3 per cent lower at Pounds 170.6m. Mr Threlfall said a shift in focus towards discounting a wider range of products at the Supercigs chain, including magazines and cards, had helped to offset the effects of an overall decline in the cigarette market. Dillons newsagents reported a 4 per cent advance at the operating level to Pounds 5.8m, on sales 1 per cent ahead at Pounds 102.8m. Mr Threlfall said the increase was due to tight cost controls, with the average branch profit up by 9 per cent to Pounds 21,740. Dillons convenience stores increased operating profits by 8 per cent to Pounds 4.39m on sales 16 per cent ahead at Pounds 78.7m. Like-for-like sales were 5 per cent ahead, in spite of increased Sunday opening from supermarkets. Mr Threlfall said T&amp;S intended to open 30 new stores across the businesses this year. The final dividend was increased by 3 per cent to 3.6p, for a total pay-out of 6.1p (5.9p). Earnings per share fell from 15.17p to 13.44p. COMMENT These were disappointing results, but the market was half expecting to be disappointed. The best news was the latest acquisition which, added to that in January, gives hope that T&amp;S may end two years of stagnation in 1994. Forecasts are for pre-tax profits of Pounds 13.8m this year. After the 9p rise to 194p in the shares, the forward multiple of 13 times may not look too demanding.</p>

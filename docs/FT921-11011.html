			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Observer: Desert song In true coals-to-Newcastle spirit, Tyneside businessman Michael Reay is off to this week's International Camel Symposium in Dubai to sing the praises of his company's feed products to Arab racing-camel owners. Reay's Newcastle-based Equine Products, founded 10 years ago and now exporting a quarter of its Pounds 750,000 annual turnover, has hitherto catered primarily for horses, from Derby winners to Shetland ponies. But with help from the department of trade and industry's export information service, Reay is now cultivating the racing-camel market, where he sees big sales growth potential. At the invitation of the Dubai royal family he will address the symposium on camels' training and dietary requirements, giving his audience the benefit of his seven years behind-the-scenes observation of camel races, a popular Middle East sport, and his discussions with vets, trainers and dieticians. Trials of the company's products are already under way in the desert to see how food additives could improve racing camels' performance, if not their tempers.</p>

Recently some American and European media carried reports on  the likelihood of Pyongyang's selling long-range Scud missiles  to Tehran as well as testing of the Nodong-1 missiles in Iran.    The Iranian source reiterated that Tehran and Pyongyang have  signed no contract either on testing or purchase of long-range  missiles.    Experts believe that bringing up of such issues aims at  intriguing the regional states, the rich Arab states in  particular, to purchase more Western arms. He further added  that launching of the so-called joint maneuvers of the Persian  gulf littoral states with Western countries are also in this  direction.    He made it clear that manufacture and purchase of  conventional weapons for defending the territorial integrity of  the Islamic Republic of Iran is very natural.    He said the West by raising such fabricated news aims at  intriguing an arms race in the region.    President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani in his recent  interview with Egyptian journalist, Hassanain Haykal, said that  Iran enjoys a powerful missile technology.</p>

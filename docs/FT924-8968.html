			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / FT Pink Snow (4): What if the snow fails to fall? THESE straitened times, large numbers of Britons will give up dining out, or other things, to pay for holidays abroad, according to a survey commissioned by Lunn Poly, the UK's biggest chain of travel agents. Among the types of holiday benefitting in this way are skiing trips, with sales for this winter up 4 per cent on last year. Given the alternative pleasures foregone, skiers will be even less happy than usual if the snows fail to fall. All the more reason, then, to book with a company that guarantees transport to alternative resorts or pays compensation if the lifts are shut down, says Owners Abroad, the UK's second biggest tour operator. Unsurprisingly, Owners Abroad offers such guarantees, and this week attacked its rivals for surrounding their no-snow compensation with restrictions. Owners Abroad alleges that some companies only provide transport to other resorts or pay compensation if skiers have bought the operators' own travel insurance or paid a premium. Privately, the other operators say Owners Abroad must be desperate for business. Publicly, they say skiers are well-protected by their insurance policies or premiums. The compensation they pay is also twice as high as that offered by Owners Abroad. Some point out that offers to transport skiers to other resorts are often worth little as they only apply if all lifts at the original site are closed. Alternative resorts with snow are often crowded. Good snow over the past two years has meant that skiers have tended to be less concerned about guarantees and compensation. In the late 1980s, however, when there was a run of poor snow, offers of compensation and transport to alternative resorts became important marketing ploys, says David Hearns, a spokesman for the Ski Club of Great Britain. Should snowfalls be poor this year, Owners Abroad says that all its customers will be protected regardless of whether they have bought the company's own travel insurance. If insufficient snow causes the closure of all ski lifts, or of the ski school, the company says it will do its best to arrange coach travel to a resort with snow. If this is impossible, skiers will receive compensation of Pounds 15 for each day they were unable to ski, up to the cost of their holiday. Thomson, the biggest UK operator, agreed that it only provided guarantees to purchasers of its own insurance policy, issued through General Accident. It said it had offered automatic guarantees in the past but these had proved unworkable. 'People were not taking out any insurance,' the company said. 'It was leaving us liable for the extra cost incurred.' Thomson said it hoped to announce a new scheme next week providing guarantees to holders of other insurance policies as well. Inghams Travel said it only covered holders of its own travel insurance policy. Skiers could insure against closure of resorts through lack of snow at a cost of Pounds 4 a person. Both Thomson and Inghams said that if transport to alternative resorts were not possible, they would pay Pounds 30 compensation for each complete day lost, double that offered by Owners Abroad. Hearns defends the charging of premiums, particularly by smaller ski companies. 'It's generally the bigger boys who have beds in other resorts,' he says. 'If you don't have beds in other resorts you have to buy them. The smaller operators can't do that, which is why they charge a premium.'</p>

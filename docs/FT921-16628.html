			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Managers urge education boost MR NORMAN Lamont, the chancellor, should plan for more spending on education, training and transport in his March Budget rather than cut taxes, the British Institute of Management says. In its pre-Budget submission to the Treasury the institute has asked Mr Lamont to delay tax cuts until Britain's investment in these areas equals that of its European competitors. In particular, it urged the chancellor to extend tax relief to more people attending training courses on their own initiative. The institute also urged more spending on the railways and public transport. It called for simplification of the tax system with measures including the amalgamation of national insurance and income tax contributions. The suggestions were based on the responses of 730 managers to a questionnaire.</p>

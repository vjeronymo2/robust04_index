			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / A better class of corruption: Britain has a notable record of sleaze A century of hypocrisy in high places This country has an international reputation for the integrity and honour of its public institutions.  - John Major in the House of Commons on Tuesday. Britain, whose government has been seen as pristine in a murky world for the best part of a century and a half, has three senior ministers up to their eyes in sleaze. The chancellor of the exchequer, the attorney general and the government chief whip have been trading in the shares of a US group with cross-holdings in a British company which has just gained a huge government telecommunications contract. They bought the shares at a discount, courtesy of the attorney general's brother; a third brother is manager of the British company. The chief whip has also invested party funds in the shares. That was the position in October 1912, when the House of Commons first debated the Marconi scandal. David Lloyd George and his colleagues covered their traces with disingenuous speeches, but prime minister Asquith felt obliged to set up a select committee investigation. The truth only started to emerge after revelations in the French press. Yet the majority report of the government-dominated committee exonerated the ministers, and a party vote on the floor of the Commons did the same. Asquith not only failed to call for any resignations: within months he had appointed Rufus Isaacs, the Attorney General, as Lord Chief Justice. Lloyd George ousted Asquith in the depths of the first world war. During his six years in Downing Street, he turned trafficking of honours into an art form, leaving office with a personal fund estimated at Pounds 1.5m - Pounds 40m in today's money. Contrary to popular myth, Lloyd George was not the only prime ministerial honours salesman. The saintly Gladstone substantially cleaned up British politics in the 1870s and 1880s, introducing the secret ballot and laws limiting local electoral spending and curbing corrupt electoral practices. But Gladstone continued to sell honours to fill the Liberal war chest. After him the late-Victorian and Edwardian Tory governments of Lord Salisbury and Arthur Balfour dished out peerages, baronetcies and knighthoods at an unprecedented rate in return for contributions to party funds. Salisbury treated the process with patrician disdain: 'No more tobacconists I entreat you,' he wrote to his colleague the Duke of Devonshire after a dodgy baronetcy raised eyebrows. The trafficking was hidden from public view. As Dr Michael Pinto-Duschinsky of Brunel University, an expert on party corruption, puts it: 'Over the past century British politics has been far from sleaze free: but compared to other countries the British are adept at dealing with corruption quietly.' The comparison with France is instructive. In the 1880s and 1890s the French political establishment was shaken by a succession of public corruption scandals, including the Wilson affair which involved president Grevy's son-in-law selling the Legion of Honour from the Elysee Palace. In Britain such scandals rarely reached the press; still more rarely were they taken up by opposition parties, who were themselves part of the honours trade. Even Maundy Gregory - the celebrated honours tout, who operated a network of agents for both the Liberals and Tories - was spirited abroad to France, at the expense of Tory donors, when official investigations started to close in. Lloyd George's crime in the eyes of the Establishment was that his excesses brought the system into public disrepute and embarrassed King George V. The scandal started to boil when a convicted wartime food hoarder received a baronetcy, and became uncontainable after a peerage was offered to a South African diamond merchant who had been convicted for serious fraud. Greater discretion reigned after Lloyd George's resignation, but the sleaze continued. In the late 1920s Warden Chilcott, one of Gregory's associates, persuaded several Indian princes to part with Pounds 100,000 (nearly Pounds 3m today) for a fund to promote their interests in London, believing that the India Secretary, the flamboyant FE Smith (Lord Birkenhead), was in Chilcott's pocket. Even those determined to cleanse the Augean stables were dragged in. In 1934, the socialist Ramsay MacDonald, prime minister of a mainly Tory government, was forced to give a baronetcy to Julien Cahn, who had paid Pounds 30,000 to finance Gregory's overseas sojourn. Stanley Baldwin, the Tory leader, warned MacDonald that all three parties were implicated - including three past or future Tory leaders (Churchill, Bonar Law and Sir Austen Chamberlain) - and that otherwise Gregory would 'stir up such a filthy sewer as would poison public life'. Not a word reached press or Parliament. France again offers a parallel. In 1934 the Stavisky affair - prompted by the suicide of a shady financier, whose affairs the government tried to hush up to protect ministers - led to a storm instigated by the extreme right. Riots and shootings took place outside the National Assembly in Paris, and two governments were forced to resign before the crisis abated. Since the 1940s there have been no indications of systematic honours trading, although the correlation between the honoured and individual or corporate donations to party funds has at times been marked. As for MPs and ministers, only a handful have fallen in recent decades for shady dealings. On the Tory side sex, not money, has been the grim reaper: the only prominent national politician tainted by a corruption scandal was Reginald Maudling, who resigned as Home Secretary in 1972 after disclosure of a business association with the notorious John Poulson. However, the Poulson affair showed that corruption flourished in parts of local government, which had become a mighty spender and regulator. For 20 years Poulson's architecture and construction empire manipulated officials in local government, the police and the health service, including T. Dan Smith, Labour leader on Newcastle council, who received Pounds 155,000 from Poulson to establish public relations companies. Poulson was not an isolated case. Other corruption cases involved councils in Birmingham, south Wales and Dundee; and a series of cases involving the police also surfaced. A 1976 royal commission report on standards in public life decided to treat them as isolated incidents, but noted that the local planning regime put 'greater strain than has been generally realised' on councils, whose members 'may find themselves handling matters on a financial scale quite beyond their experience of private life'. Tighter rules on declarations of interests, and curbs on local authority powers imposed by the Thatcher and Major governments, have restricted the scope for local corruption, although recent cases in Westminster and Wiltshire show that it has not vanished. However, a new form of sleaze has emerged in the 1980s and 1990s: malpractice in the growing number of quangos  -appointed government agencies, notably in the health and education sectors, which now handle nearly a quarter of public expenditure, many subject to lax regulation. A snapshot of quango sleaze was provided this January by the Commons public accounts committee, which published a report citing a string of cases involving 'serious failures in administrative and financial systems and controls'. The Welsh Development Agency was censured; other cases of misuse of funds included Pounds 20m by Wessex Regional Health Authority, Pounds 10m by West Midlands Regional Health Authority, and Pounds 1m by the National Rivers Authority. 'Whenever you hear this sort of thing mentioned in Italy, Africa or South America we just smile and say it could not happen here,' said Robert Sheldon, the committee's chairman. Yet 'this sort of thing' ought perhaps properly to be seen as but the latest incident in a British tradition of sleaze. Another concern is the current reformation in public administration, as the 'career for life' is undermined and officials are encouraged to move to the private sector. 'Once you have the revolving door, there is always the question of when the official negotiates for a future outside job, and how strongly it is on his mind when carrying out public duties,' says Pinto-Duschinsky. Three themes emerge from a study of British sleaze over the past century. First, all political parties have been involved - either (as in the sale of honours) through a process of tacit agreement in shady but not illegal practice, or (as in Poulson) through straightforward misuse of office. Secondly, sleaze has not been limited to parties - witness the trail of police corruption and the doings of quangos. Thirdly, sleaze has resulted at least in part from an absence of definite standards of public conduct. A recent survey of British MPs by Maureen Mancuso shows that many have no idea where to look for guidance. Mancuso asked 100 MPs for their views on, for instance, claiming first-class but travelling economy and pocketing the difference, or getting parliamentary passes for assistants who were paid by lobbyists. She found 'a multiplicity of competing ethical standards' with no consensus. She divided the MPs into groups which straddled parties: 'puritans', 'muddlers' and 'entrepreneurs'. A third of the MPs were 'entrepreneurs', willing to condone 'almost any activity as long as it does not contravene a written statute or formal rule'. In one respect, Britain's international reputation for non-corruption is deserved: its elections are cheap, and the pressure on parties and candidates to raise large sums is correspondingly low. The credit belongs to Gladstone and a decision taken at the launch of the BBC. The limits imposed by Gladstone in 1883 on local electoral spending have remained in force, while the ban on television advertising by parties removed one of the main objects of party spending in other democracies. Constituency spending allowed per candidate in a UK general election is barely Pounds 6,000. Little more than Pounds 20m was spent by the main parties combined at national level in the 1992 election. In the US, more than Dollars 750m is likely to be spent by candidates in the current congressional elections. More than Dollars 400m was spent by the three candidates in the 1992 presidential election. In spite of what Dr Tim Hames of Nuffield College, Oxford, calls 'an orgy of self-deperking' in response to recent scandals, the pressure on US congressmen to raise money from corporate interests for elections is all-consuming. Or it is for those who are not super-rich. Two-thirds of senators are dollar millionaires. Ross Perot spent Dollars 65m of his own money in 1992. Nonetheless, Britain boasts a notable sleaze tradition of its own. The first words of Lord Nolan after his appointment this week to chair Major's commission on standards in public life might have caused Gregory and Poulson to smile: 'As the prime minister said, this country has the highest standards of integrity in public life: it is of the greatest importance that those standards be maintained.'</p>

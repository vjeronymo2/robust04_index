			<p>BFN     [Text] Eyewitnesses report that large fires, the cause of  which is still unknown, broke out today in the quarter where the  house of Shaykh Abdullah Bin Husayn al-Ahmar, chairman of the  Chamber of Deputies, chairman of the Yemeni Alliance for Reform,  and principal paramount Shaykh of the Hashid clan, is situated  in the Interior Ministry building in the (Hasabah) quarter in  the capital, Sanaa. Foreign correspondents reported on 10 May  that the atmosphere in Sanaa was extremely tense. They noticed  military patrols in the streets of Sanaa investigating citizens  to establish their identities.    Other reports from Sanaa indicate splits in the military  leadership as a result of the battles currently being fought in  the country, while many military leaders were dominated by  restlessness when the promise made by the president that the  fighting would end within three days proved to be wrong.  Military sources in Sanaa have referred to the recent irregular  military appointments made by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  such as that of 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur Hadi as defense minister.  This angered the president's paternal cousin, Colonel 'Ali  Muhsin al-Ahmar, who regards himself as the de facto commander  of the Army and feels that he enjoys the confidence of the  family, while there are yet others regarded by the military  command as being more competent and more closely connected with  the family.</p>

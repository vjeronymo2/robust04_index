			<p><P> March 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEYER'S 'KINGFISH' TO HAVE NEW YORK PRODUCTION  </P> <P> Marlane Meyer's "Kingfish," which received its much-applauded world premiere as  part of the 1987-88 season of the Los Angeles Theatre Center, will receive a  production at New York's Public Theatre in December. The news was confirmed  Thursday by the Public's Barbara Carroll who said rehearsals will begin in  November under the direction of David Schweizer, who staged the play at LATC.  </P> <P> Meyer recently moved to New York but retains her Southern California  connection. Her latest play, "The Geography of Luck," was given a staged  reading at LATC last weekend as part of the center's annual Festival of  Premieres, with Schweizer directing.  </P> <P> In May, "Luck" will be staged at South Coast Repertory by Roberta Levitow. It  was the winning play of that theater's California Play Festival or CalFest.  "Luck" then returns to LATC where it will be mounted as a regular season  production, with Schweizer directing for an Aug. 26 opening. SYLVIE DRAKE  </P></p>

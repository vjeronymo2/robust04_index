			<p>BFN     [Text] Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas received  Russian Ambassador Nikolay Obertyshev who handed him a message  from Russian President Boris Yeltsin.    Following the meeting, Brazauskas told journalists that he  had received a response from Yeltsin to his letter of early  April saying that some of the Lithuanian-Russian agreements  signed by the two men in November 1993 had not been observed.    Brazauskas said that Yeltsin's letter called for activating  bilateral talks. He thought that both countries wanted that.    He added that even before the letter was received the  Lithuanian leaders had discussed steps to be taken in the near  future. In particular, it was desirable that a Russian team  come to Lithuania to discuss Russian transit across that  country, visa matters and other urgent matters that had not been  covered by agreements between the two governments.    Brazauskas said that Virgilijus Bulovas, head of the  Lithuanian working group handling talks with CIS member states,  would complete shortly the study of a Russian draft agreement on  transit.    Dainius Trinkunas, Lithuanian president's foreign policy  adviser, told Interfax that Yeltsin expressed his gratitude for  an invitation to visit Lithuania. The date of his visit will be  agreed on later.</p>

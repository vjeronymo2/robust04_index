			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO CHANGE IN AILING MARCOS' CONDITION  </P> <P> Deposed Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos, clinging to life after  suffering kidney, cardiac and pulmonary failure, continued to rally Sunday in a  Honolulu hospital but was still listed in extremely critical condition,  hospital officials said.  </P> <P> Marcos, 71 -- exiled here with his family since February, 1986 -- is more alert  and communicative, said a hospital spokesman, but the prognosis is still poor  because of his weakened condition.  </P> <P> Marcos, hospitalized since January, remains attached to a respirator, a  hemodialysis blood-cleansing machine and monitors.  </P></p>

"These businesses should be aware that dealing in infringing  software is a serious crime in the Philippines and no effort  will be spared in tracking down firms that sell our members'  products without authorization," BSA Vice President Ron Eckstrom  told reporters yesterday. BSA investigators along with the  Philippine National Police began the raids last year. Their  first casualties were four retail outlets of Brochiere, a  leading computer and software retailer in the country. Seized  were some 4,000 floppy diskettes and 25 hard disks containing  suspected illegal software published by BSA members Lotus and  Microsoft. Eckstrom pointed out that Brochiere was merely one of  the many retail firms in the country that openly disregard the  law.    He added that the BSA will urge the courts to impose the  most  severe penalties available under the law against any firm found  guilty of software piracy.</p>

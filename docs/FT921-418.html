			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / German minister calls off visit to Turkey in protest A German minister has called off a visit to Turkey in protest against the treatment of the Kurdish minority, according to the Sunday newspaper Bild am Sonntag, Reuter reports from Bonn. It said Mr Norbert Blum, labour minister, had written to his Turkish counterpart, Mr Mehmet Mogultay, cancelling a visit scheduled for May. Bild quoted Mr Blum as saying in his letter no state ruled by law should punish civilians for the activities of terrorists, a reference to clashes between security forces and Kurdish separatists. No comment was immediately available from Mr Blum's ministry.</p>

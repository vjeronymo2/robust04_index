			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Names to fight EGM restrictions CAMPAIGNERS acting on behalf of loss-making Lloyd's Names are seeking to overturn a rule change imposing new restrictions on the ability of Names - individuals whose assets support the market - to call extraordinary general meetings. Mr Richard Astor, a lawyer campaigning on behalf of Names, has said he will seek to overturn a rule change at Lloyd's under section 6(4a) of the 1982 Lloyd's Act. The act says that the market must submit a byelaw, amendment or revocation to a general meeting of the society if requested to do so by 500 Names. Mr Astor's goal of calling an extraordinary general meeting to liquidate Lloyd's was made more difficult this week when Lloyd's raised the minimum number of Names' signatures needed for an extraordinary general meeting from 100 to 1,500. Meanwhile, it has emerged that managers of a number of syndicates at the Lloyd's insurance market are taking issue with proposals in the Lloyd's business plan to limit the commission income paid by Names to their managing agents. The plan, published by Lloyd's in April, ordered an immediate cut in managing agency fees to a maximum of 0.5 per cent of capacity (the amount of premium income syndicates are allowed to underwrite) in 1994 and 0.4 per cent of capacity in 1995. The business plan also said that managing agencies would not be allowed to distribute any profits earned on fees, but would be obliged to retain them within the agency. Charman Underwriting Agency, which manages marine syndicate 488, and the managers of several other syndicates which have charged higher fees, have 'given notice' to members' agencies that they are reviewing their fee structure. It is understood that some of the managing agencies are unhappy about the the new rules and may even leave the market unless changes are made. Some agencies face a drop in income of as much as 70 per cent because of the change. One agent protested that the business plan was too proscriptive and that there had been insufficient consultation with businesses at Lloyd's. Members' agencies yesterday played down the importance of the moves. 'We regard it as purely precautionary,' said the chairman of one of the largest Lloyd's members' agencies. 'We believe these syndicates will continue underwriting next year.'</p>

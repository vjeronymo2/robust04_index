			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOVE AFFAIR WITH A VIRTUOSO  </P> <P> Sometimes, she would forget the words. Nobody cared as long as Sarah Vaughan  just kept on singing. Summer evenings under the stars at the Hollywood Bowl  won't be the same this year without the incomparable Vaughan, the jazz vocal  virtuoso who died this week of lung cancer at age 66 in her Los Angeles home.  </P> <P> What a musical treasure was Sarah -- the sound of her silky, rich and versatile  vocal instrument was instantly identifiable. She and her contemporaries, Ella  Fitzgerald and Carmen McRae, define for most music lovers the very essence of  great jazz singing. During nearly a half-century of performing for appreciative  audiences all over the world, she never stopped challenging her considerable  talent -- from "jamming" Brazilian style to collaborating with conductor  Michael Tilson Thomas to scatting recently in the studio for Quincy Jones.  </P> <P> Even now we can still hear her singing such standards such as "Send in the  Clowns," using that phrasing that made the listener hear the familiar anew.  That song often served in recent years as her closing concert number. But  thanks to CDs, cassettes and albums, the world's musical love affair with Sarah  Vaughan need never end.  </P></p>

As the Kazakh minister Sagan Nurmukhametov told newsmen  after  the session, the sides signed a protocol on mutual assistance  and on republican resources for their armies' logistic supplies.    He stressed that the meeting least of all meant secession  from the CIS Collective Security Treaty. On the contrary, he  said, its results will contribute to broader cooperation between  the collective security pact members.    As Uzbek Defense Minister Rustam Akhmedov remarked, the  consultations pave the way for closer ties between the three  Central Asian states in anti-aircraft defense and in other  fields. He voiced hope that Russia would join the alliance,  since it was interested in reinforcing its southern borders more  than any other state.    The Uzbek and Kyrgyz ministers also signed a bilateral  cooperation accord for 1994.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Azertadzh report: "Protecting the Interests of the People </F> and the Interests of the State. President's Apparatus  Conference"]    [Text] On 29 April in the president's apparatus, under the  chairmanship of President of the Republic Geydar Aliyev, there  was an expanded conference with the participation of management  workers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.    The conference opened with an introduction by Geydar Aliyev.    A report was heard from Minister of Internal Affairs of  Azerbaijan Vagif Novruzov.    Speaking of the activity in recent years of the ministry,  which occupied an important position in the system of state  structures, the speaker noted that, while implementing a number  of measures, the Ministry of Internal Affairs had still been  unable to handle the duties assigned to it. Serious mistakes had  been made in the area of providing for collegial leadership and  in the selection and placement of personnel.    The speaker was disturbed about the negative public opinion  that had developed concerning the workers of the Ministry of  Internal Affairs and local police organs, who were called upon  to wage a battle against crime, bribery, and corruption. The  speaker emphasized that we must not put up with the fact that  confidence in the police organs is decreasing each day. The  fight against crime has slackened and cases of traffic safety  violations are becoming more frequent.    Analyzing the activity of the Ministry of Internal Affairs,  the speaker noted that, having at one time been subjected to  pressure from certain political groupings, the central apparatus  of the Ministry of Internal Affairs has ended up incapable of  performing the difficult tasks facing it in this difficult  period for the republic. Although many devoted professionals  work here, people who honestly serve the interests of the  people, the leadership of the Ministry of Internal Affairs  cannot organize their work correctly. The lack of unity in the  central apparatus and among members of the collegium has led to  serious shortcomings in the ministry's work. The atmosphere  created in the collective has not been benevolent and  possibilities of improving its work are not being taken  advantage of. Serious shortcomings have been allowed in the  organization of the activity of local internal affairs organs.    Having discussed problems of selection and placement of  personnel, the speakers noted the shortcomings in this sphere.  Sometimes new appointments were made without the knowledge of  members of the collegium and there was a negligent attitude  toward suggestions to regulate personnel policy. The speakers  spoke with alarm about the fact that cases of bribery and  corruption are encountered in the very organization that is  called upon to fight such phenomena.    It was noted that the main reason for the serious mistakes  and shortcomings in the system of the Ministry of Internal  Affairs lies in the lack of the corresponding republic  legislation. Police organs are still working with obsolete laws  and regulations, which has a negative impact on the  effectiveness of the measures taken. At the conference the idea  was expressed that workers of the police force, which was  previously called upon to defend the interests of the people and  the interests of the state, should not join any political group.  There was also discussion of the need to strengthen the  material and technical base of the Ministry of Internal Affairs,  the use of advanced practice for stepping up its activity, and  the adoption of measures to reinforce social protection of  police workers and improve the conditions for their work.    The results of the conference were summed up by the  President  of the Republic Geydar Aliyev, who discussed in detail the tasks  facing organs of the Ministry of Internal Affairs today.    First Deputy Prime Minister Fuad Guliyev, state advisers  Arif  Ragimzade and Gabil Guseynli, and other officials participated  in the work of the conference.</p>

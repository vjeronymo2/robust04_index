			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Officials of Region Five [Ethiopian Somali  region] have noted that with the exception of the prevailing  natural and man-made drought in the area, peace is prevailing in  the whole area and the people are leading their lives  peacefully. The officials, when briefing Prime Minister Tamirat  Layne who is currently visiting the region, said that what some  (?newspapers) had related about the region is baseless. Mr.  Tamirat who met the officials of the Region in Jijiga said that  a joint effort by the people, their representatives and the  government was required in order to combat the prevailing  drought in the region. Teferi Legese has the details.    [Begin Teferi recording] During the meeting, the officials  of  the region briefed Mr. Tamirat about the prevailing problems in  the region. [passage omitted] The officials noted that the  Ethiopian Somalis are trying their best to maintain peace and  stability in their areas and that in fact, they are at present  leading their lives peacefully and maintaining peace in the  region in collaboration with the transitional government's Army.  What some private newspapers have been saying about the region  is therefore baseless. [passage omitted]    Mr. Tamirat, on his part, said that joint efforts have to be  made by the government, the region's officials, people and  various nongovernmental organizations in order to combat the  prevailing problems. [passage omitted]    Regarding the security of the region, the prime minister  said  that those who are saying there is no peace in the region can  say whatever they want, but you [the officials] should strive to  solve people's problems.

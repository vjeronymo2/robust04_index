			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Recovery leaves BSG at Pounds 8.28m midway BSG International, the West Midlands group with interests in motor and aviation components, childcare products and vehicle distribution, staged a 1994 first half recovery after a worrying 1993 second half when trading conditions deteriorated sharply. Pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 were Pounds 8.28m, compared with Pounds 8.53m and Pounds 8.95m, excluding exceptional items, for the whole of last year. Mr Astley Whittall, soon to retire as chairman, was 'confident that the second half will show further evidence of the group's recovery'. BSG is maintaining its interim dividend at 0.7p, being paid on earnings per share down from 2.07p to 1.97p. Turnover rose from Pounds 291.8m to Pounds 324.8m with operating profits static at Pounds 11.1m. During the current half, Britax plans to consolidate its childcare product manufacture at Andover at a cost of 217 redundancies and exceptional charges of Pounds 2m. Elsewhere in Britax, motor component manufacture for European markets is recovering although pressure on margins is severe, while in the US and Australia, the problem is finding capacity to meet demand. Losses have been reduced in the aircraft interior business and profits should return next year. Bristol Street pushed up new and used car sales by 36 and 15 per cent respectively. It completed the acquisition of Jessups, another distribution business, on July 1, but the impact on profits is likely to be neutral this year. The shares gained 2p to close at 67p.</p>

			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Yugoslav peace talks to resume Yugoslav peace talks are scheduled to resume at the United Nations today provided all the main participants show up, Reuter reports from the UN. They are to focus on a plan and map drafted by the co-chairmen of the international conference on the former Yugoslavia, Mr Cyrus Vance, representing the UN, and Lord Owen, on behalf of the European Community. The plan would divide embattled Bosnia-Herzegovina into 10 provinces - three with Moslems majorities, three Serb, two Croat and two mixed. Bosnian Serb chief Radovan Karadzic was due to arrive in New York yesterday apparently satisfied he would not be impeded by a private lawsuit brought against him during his previous stay by organisations acting on behalf of two victims of alleged atrocities by Serb forces in Bosnia.</p>

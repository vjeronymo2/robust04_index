			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Caroline Faraj and P.V. Vivekanand] </F>   [Text] Amman--Jordan and the Palestine Liberation  Organisation (PLO) on Tuesday [10 May] began talks seen crucial  to the fate of the economic agreement they signed in January  outlining a framework of ties between the Kingdom and the  Palestine self-rule authority expected to take over the Gaza  Strip and Jericho.    Jordanian comments after the five-hour session at the Prime  Ministry were non-committal, reflecting the Kingdom's quest to  learn firsthand about the PLO's intentions after the  organisation signed an economic agreement with Israel in Paris  last month.    The Paris agreement contains many provisions which have  brought to question many elements in the Jordan-PLO accord  signed in Amman on Jan. 7. Officials said Monday the Kingdom  would be seeking clarifications on these points and answers to  questions on key issues related to banking and monetary affairs,  trade and customs etc.    Sources said the Jordanian delegation to the talks, headed  by  Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs and Information Jawad  al-'Anani, presented to the PLO side a paper containing the  points of the clarifications that the Kingdom was seeking.    No definite details were available, but the sources  indicated  that these questions dealt with the implications of the Paris  agreement on the Jordan-PLO accord and how the PLO intended to  go about tackling some of the obvious "contradictions" and  "overlappings" between the two documents.    PLO officials appeared anxious to reaffirm that they were  not  seeking to "renegotiate" the Jan. 7 agreement and that the talks  were aimed at detailing the modalities of implementing the  accord in terms of mechanisms and guidelines.    In general, the Jan. 7 agreement was seen as a general  framework for Jordanian-Palestinian economic relations without  going into specifics. However, it was widely assumed then that  the principles in the accord, as and when implemented, would  have cemented the relationship.    According to the sources, Jordan and the PLO had agreed in  earlier meetings on economic relations that the specifics could  not be worked out as long as it was not known how far the  Israelis were willing to go in giving economic freedom to the  Palestinians in the occupied territories.    However, the Paris agreement, which detailed the specifics  of  economic relations between Israel and the Palestinian autonomous  territories, was seen here as severely curtailing the scope of  Jordanian-Palestinian economic relations.    The meeting, which was supposed to have begun early Tuesday,  did not get off until after the Jordanian Cabinet held its  regular weekly session during which the Kingdom's strategy in  the talks with the PLO was expected to be discussed and  finalised.    Speaking after the meeting, Dr. al-'Anani would only say  that  "all economic issues of common concern were discussed" during  the session with the PLO and that the discussions would continue  on Wednesday.    Ahmad Quray', head of the economic department of the PLO,  who  led the Palestinian side to the talks, said the meeting was  "comprehensive and extensive" and covered "all aspects of the  Jordanian-Palestinian economic relationship."    "The Jordanian-Palestinian accord (of Jan. 7) is the basis  of  the relationship," he told AL-RA'Y and the JORDAN TIMES.    Asked whether the PLO was seeking any changes in the  agreement in view of the Israel-PLO accord, Mr. Quray' said:  "Changes if any will be in favour of the Jordanian-Palestinian  accord." He did not elaborate.    However, he stressed, any possible changes in the accord  "will mean detailing the agreement's provisions. There will be  no changes in the basis and principles of the agreement."    "Certain joint committees will be activated," he added.    "We discussed all issues such as banking currency, trade,  and  customs," he said. "These are issues that should be clarified  to sustain the unique, brotherly relation between Jordan and  Palestine."    Asked whether the Israel-PLO accord had narrowed the scope  for Jordanian-Palestinian cooperation, Mr. Quray' said: "On the  contrary, I believe that the agreement with Israel has helped  implement the Jordanian-Palestinian accord."    "It is true that the (Israel-PLO) accord did not give us all  that we were seeking, but it gave us some of what we sought,"  said mr. Quray'.    "The door is not closed for the rest of our rights, which  will be restored gradually..."    Mr. Quray' said: "We will soon witness Palestinian-Arab  agreements. We are part of the Arab World and a permanent  member of the Arab League and we have a strategic Arab depth  which supports our position."    Attending the meetings on the Jordanian side were planning  Minister Ziyad Fariz, Minister of industry and Trade Rima  Khalaf, minister of State 'Adil Irshayd, Central Bank of Jordan  Deputy Governor Michel Martu and Foreign Ministry advisors  Ibrahim Badran and Ahmad Qatanani.    The PLO side to the meeting included Jawad Naji, head of the  Economic Department of the PLO in Amman, Amin Haddad, 'Atif  'Alawinah, 'Awn al-Shawwa, Midhat Kan'an, Palestinan Ambassador  al-Tayyib 'Abd al-Rahim and Samir Hulaylah.</p>

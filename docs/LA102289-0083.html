			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHEN THE CENTER WOULDN'T HOLD;  </P> <P> EMERGING WHOLE, FEELING UNSETTLED  </P> <P> Since the earthquake hit, our phone has been continuously busy with friends  ringing from Europe or Japan, wanting to be reassured that we are all right,  but we are so unharmed that I found myself a little apologetic, not able to  repel their anxiety with a single story of personal peril. They've seen on  television the horrendous collapsing bridge, the smashed cars, the fiery  Victorian apartments, bodies, sobbing bystanders. We have seen neither the  reality nor even the television -- our electricity was still out Thursday. In a  sense, we are farther away from the disaster than they. Our situation at the  center (luckily not the epicenter) is one of curious calm. It is odd having to  infer peril from the agitative voices elsewhere, and hard to feel scared.  </P> <P> Here on Telegraph Hill, halfway between the financial district and the Marina,  which were both heavily damaged, nothing much happened, perhaps because  Telegraph Hill is a rock. We were sitting companionably in the kitchen. There  was a shaking. My husband and son, trained Californians, got up to stand in a  doorway (leaving no room for me, as I afterward admonished). Nothing fell, but  the cat vanished like lightning to secret cat caves. The lights went out. We  found a battery-powered radio, and tried to hear what we had just been through.  We opened a bottle of wine.  </P> <P> I hadn't realized before that disasters don't strike, they develop. You have to  piece them together from the fragmented reports before you know how to respond.  There is no immediate occasion for panic, so you stand by, prepared to panic  later, and in the meantime, feel the curious elation that an unexpected event  seems to give everyone. Anyone who has ever been caught up in events that are  reported in the media will have been struck by the discrepancy between being in  them, and reading about them later. The details of the disaster, concentrated  into words and pictures, do not communicate the feeling of boredom and  cheerfulness that most San Franciscans seem to be feeling now.  </P> <P> The earthquake came just past 5 o'clock. For a time, we marveled at the plume  of smoke rising into the sunset sky from the flaming Marina a half-mile away.  Some resourceful neighbors started a gasoline generator, and their lights went  on while the rest of the city lay under gathering darkness. We opened another  bottle of wine and decided to risk using our gas stove. We had veal scaloppine.  When it got too dark to read by candlelight, we went to bed early like  pioneers. By bedtime, we hadn't heard how many people had died. The big effect  of tragedy was lost in momentary imperatives: fix dinner, check on the  children, reassure the cat. The next day our cat, Walter, refused to come out  from under his tablecloth cave. We wondered if he knew something we didn't.  Outside things seemed so normal one almost resented it.  </P> <P> I took a walk. Most stores were closed except in Chinatown, where an everyday  throb of commerce reassured the dazed-looking tourists who wandered with a  homeless air among the fruit stands and curio shops. About half the people on  the street were Chinese, imperturbably going about their business; the rest  were dog-walkers. The high proportion of dogs on the street lent a sense of  feral menace, for the real significance is, of course, that no matter what  happens, dogs must be walked. The drone of helicopters overhead recalled war,  but the pizza place was open; it must have gas-fired ovens. No newspapers to be  had, but people who got up early and had gone as far as the downtown bus  station, found a little thin Chronicle with its late-breaking horror photos.  </P> <P> The radio last night spoke of "bands of roving toughs," but everyone looked to  be full of neighborly love. In the mom-and- pop grocery, a line of people  prepared to hoard. I hoarded two cans of corned beef hash but forgot to buy  bottled water; in any case, water still flowed freely from our tap. My Italian  neighbor warned that the heat still portended "earthquake weather." There was a  pleasant silence and a freedom from traffic and a cheery camaraderie among the  people I met. Like me, all were unable to bring themselves to a sense of the  occasion. We are in a disaster. This is a disaster area. The President is  coming. But what on earth was he going to see? By now most of the glass had  been swept up, windows were neatly boarded, nothing appeared out of the  ordinary.  </P> <P> I imagine this must be the experience of people in, say, Belfast or Beirut.  From afar you wonder how anyone could live there; if you are there it must seem  normal, like this, until the real horror comes right to your door. A column of  smoke rises somewhere else. Distant sirens wail but nearby a pleasant air of  good will. The festivity of disaster, a phenomenon often remarked upon.  </P> <P> What good is going through a devastating earthquake if you can't quite feel it?  On the street people stop to ask for everyone else's story, because no one has  one of his own. But everyone knows someone who was seconds or minutes away from  the big crack in the Bay Bridge. By midweek I have talked to four different  friends who were on the bridge at various places and they are really  frightened.  </P> <P> But the rest of us can't shake off a bemused sense of fraudulence. We haven't  done our share of suffering. It's more than sensation-seeking that impels us  out here on the street talking to others. I think it's right that people want  to share in the disaster that so narrowly missed them, as a way of making it up  to the people who have really suffered or died, and as a gesture to fortune, in  order to appear to her calculating eye not as a lucky person, ripe for a blow,  but as someone who has already been through something and who should be spared  next time.  </P> <P> </P> <P> San Francisco, 1906  </P> <P>  Remarkable as it may seem, Wednesday night, while the whole city crashed and  roared into ruin, was a quiet night. There were no crowds. There was no  shouting and yelling. There was no hysteria, no disorder. . . . In all those  terrible hours I saw not one woman who wept, not one man who was excited, not  one person who was in the slightest degree panic-stricken.  </P> <P>  Before the flames, throughout the night, fled tens of thousands of homeless  ones. Some were wrapped in blankets. Others carried bundles of bedding and dear  household treasures. Sometimes a whole family was harnessed to a carriage or  delivery wagon that was weighted down with their possessions. Baby buggies, toy  wagons, and go-carts were used as trucks, while every other person was dragging  a trunk. Yet everybody was gracious. The most perfect courtesy obtained. Never  in all San Francisco's history were her people so kind and courteous as on this  night of terror.  </P> <P>  -- Jack London, Collier's Weekly, May 5, 1906  </P></p>

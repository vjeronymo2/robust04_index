			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Saharan President Mohamed Abdelaziz in </F> Algiers, date not given--recorded]    [Text] After his participation in the seminar on the  Western Sahara organized in Madrid, Saharan President Mohamed  Abdelaziz, on his way back to his country has stopped over at  Algiers airport, where he made a press statement at the VIP  hall:    [Abdelaziz] Now there are three months, a three months that  we consider decisive, given by the Security Council as a period  to try to implement the peace plan. In our view we must not  miss this opportunity, Morocco must not miss this opportunity,  and the international community must not miss this opportunity.  We must exert whatever effort possible to provide the  opportunity for the implementation of the original peace plan,  which aims at organizing a free, democratic, and impartial  referendum to decide the fate of the Saharan people.    In our view, an international seminar could be held with the  participation of neighboring countries -- Algeria, Mauritania,  the state that was occupying the Western Sahara, Spain, the  United States, and France in their capacity as members of the  Security Council and as super powers concerned with security and  peace in the region of north-west Africa, the two international  organizations responsible for the implementation of the peace  plan, in addition to the two parties to the conflict -- Morocco  and the Polisario [Popular Front for the Liberation of Saquia El  Hamra and Rio de Oro] Front.    In our view, such a seminar can actually contribute to the  overcoming of difficulties that obstruct the implementation of  the peace plan. Because it is not enough to refer the problem  to the identity committee, which is a technical committee. The  existing problems are political, and in order to help the  identity committee, which we will cooperate with, we should  create the right political conditions and hammer out the  political difficulties that face it so that it can carry out a  successful technical work.</p>

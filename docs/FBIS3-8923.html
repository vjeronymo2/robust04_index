According to reports from Skopje, the law  contains discriminating articles and restrains the Albanians  from full access to education. One of the articles states that  only translated text books will be used in those schools where  classes are taught in Albanian. Most of the draft's articles  run counter to statements by Macedonian authorities for equality  among all the citizens in Macedonia.    Sources from Skopje say that Albanians will not have the  right to prepare original text books with a content to be  outlined by they themselves in case the draft law is approved as  proposed. According to the draft law, one of the requirements  for a professor to teach in these schools is that he should be a  Macedonian citizen and should have a full command of the  Macedonian standard language.</p>

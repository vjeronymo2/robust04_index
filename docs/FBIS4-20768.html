			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ilyas Masuh: "'Ali Nasir Says to AL-QABAS: `Yes, </F> They Offered To Let Me Form the Yemeni Government, But I  Declined'"]    [Text] The former Yemeni president, 'Ali Nasir Muhammad,  told AL-QABAS that Yemeni officials who met two weeks ago in  Amman offered to let him form a Yemeni government which would  take over the job of implementing the Document of Pledge and  Accord. However, he declined the offer, saying: "I felt that  taking on the job under these circumstances would result in an  escalation of the explosive situation."    'Ali Nasir added: "I stressed the importance of having  existing bodies assume the job of implementing the document,  rather than being content to merely sign it." He indicated that  it would have been possible for him to take on the job if the  offer had been the result of a meeting of the Presidential  Councils, the ministers, and Parliament. However, he said that  "these councils did not take this initiative, and this prompted  me to focus on the importance of these parties' taking the  initiative to implement the document."    'Ali Nasir then said: "I participated in the signing  ceremony, but I did not sign the document, and I stressed, both  before and after Amman, the importance of good intentions and an  initiative in the direction of implementation being taken by the  bodies concerned in the Presidential Councils, by the ministers,  and by the Parliament, and that all parties, one after the  other, commit themselves to implementation, including the  security organizations. I proposed that the meetings be held in  Aden or Sanaa, as an indication of the fact that all parties  desire to create and implement the solutions and be committed to  them. The document in itself is very important, it has the  objective of having the country emerge from its crisis, it  contains a national program, and it is the result of a  collective national effort made by all parties and leaders in  the Yemeni arena. Also, it has the support of the Arabs and  international support. However, the implementation,  unfortunately, has coincided with military events in some areas,  whereas what is needed is to seek a solution by means of a  dialogue, not by means of shots fired by artillery, tanks, and  airplanes."    The former Yemeni president called for a search to be made  for other alternatives in order that national Yemeni unity be  preserved and in order to avoid bloodshed. He called upon the  leaders to seek a solution via the Document of Pledge and  Accord, which expresses the aspirations of the Yemeni people who  have suffered from so many problems and hardships, and said that  this situation is one which necessitates the creation of rapid  solutions.</p>

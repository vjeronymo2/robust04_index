			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Travel: Old Plovdiv - an outcrop of history / James Henderson visited Bulgaria's second city and found it ancient and charming ALL travellers have their indulgences, little things to keep them happy when they are on their own in a strange land, hearing a language they do not understand, in a fix, half-way up a mountain, wondering where on earth they are going to spend the night. One thing that I enjoy is taking place-names out of context, or simply repeating them until they sound ridiculous. Dazed after four days of ferries, buses and trains shared with Albanians, gipsies and backpackers, I happened on Plovdiv. It ranks among my favourite silly-sounding names, up there with Sixpenny Handley and Tit. Repeated by a tired man, Plovdiv begins to sound absurd. I travelled to Bulgaria via the capital, Sofia. No absurdity there - the name has almost a sublime quality about it. It sounds alluring and gentle. Certainly there is no hint of a hard-line communist capital to it: Sofia hints at years of accumulated beauty, and of course it speaks of wisdom. Yet the city itself is relatively modern and not that attractive. The few remnants of the medieval town have been swallowed by grander and larger buildings. And the last 40 years have left the place with an over-abundant acreage of concrete, now liberally used by skate-boarders and graffiti artists. Plovdiv sounds like an ugly, tortured mouthful of a town, probably in the worst communist tradition, a tangle of factories and faceless tenements. It is Bulgaria's second city. But, again, the name belies the fact. The centre of Plovdiv is ancient and charming. For no better reason than another traveller's indulgence, I decided to go and have a look at it. Old Plovdiv is perched on an outcrop of rock that has given it protection from passing armies for the last 3,000 years: Thracians, Romans, barbarians, Ottoman Turks. It has also had its peaceful moments. The Romans stopped long enough to build an amphitheatre, which was unearthed in a landslide in 1972. But Plovdiv's ramparts are coming under threat again, this time from marauding bus-borne tourists. (Until a few years ago the communist trades unions had the run of the place). From now on it seems that Old Plovdiv is destined to be a hill-top redoubt of restaurants and galleries, though for the moment, at least, people will still let you into their houses to have a look round. The streets are cobbled and overhung with dark wooden eaves; it is easy to feel an ancient air. Standing among the trees are heavy brick and wooden villas, built in Bulgarian National Revival style during Plovdiv's prosperous period in the last century. One of the art galleries in this area is devoted to a favourite son of Plovdiv, Zlatyu Boyadiev. His was a remarkable story. At the age of 40, after half a lifetime of painting, he suffered a stroke and was paralysed down his right side, so he learned to paint with his left hand. From an ordinary painter he turned into one of Bulgaria's best. Intriguingly, his style changed completely in the process. A breathlessly enthusiastic guide latched on to me as I pondered the first room, the only one in the house that exhibits paintings of Boyadiev's early period (most of them are in the National Gallery of Art in Sofia). At this stage the artist consciously adopted the style of the Old Masters. The colours are solid, dark and realistic, the subjects formal. Then the guide raced me through the rest of the house - an explosion of colour and unexpected shapes. The artist's technique had loosened up and resembled more Breughel and Egon Schiele than the great masters. The change was weird. It was as though he were delving into new areas of his mind. His personality might have undergone changes in learning to gain control of his left hand, but it is mind-boggling to speculate how the re-routing of ideas in his brain might have affected his art. As a man of no political conviction, life could have been difficult for Boyadiev in post-war Bulgaria. Unorthodox art such as his was unpopular with the authorities, and he certainly did not honour the regime in his paintings. However, he won their respect in his struggle to overcome his disability and he received the accolade of People's Artist. Boyadiev would often paint a mountain in his pictures, and my guide sent me off, past the streetside icon salesmen, to a favourite area of his. Outside Asenovgrad, to the south of Plovdiv, you will find the old monastery of Bachkovo, one of Bulgaria's best known. It could be a retreat of quiet and contemplation, but the bus-borne hordes penetrate here, too. Bachkovo is set in a cool mountain gorge. Surrounded by arched colonnades, the courtyards of the monastery are laid with irregular cobbles and planted here and there with trees. Vines clamber up the walls. In the centre of each courtyard stands a chapel. Through an open-air ante-chamber painted with murals I descended into the semi-obscurity of the church itself. The flagstones were blackened and covered with ancient carpets, the panelling stained by centuries of smoke from two or three forests of candles, permanently aglow. There were tiny windows high up but little light gets in. On the wall facing me as I entered was a screen of icons; around the walls were murals. Visitors were milling. Wandering among them were local women in scarves, lighting new candles in the iron chandeliers. Occasionally a door would open in the screen of icons and a priest in black robes would emerge and re-arrange the tables. I sidled into one of the standing pews with elbow rests around the outside walls and admired the scene. A shaft of sunlight penetrated the darkness from on high; lazy swirls of smoke and incense played in the light. Suddenly I realised that I was in the middle of a wedding. A small group had clustered around a table in the centre of the nave. Facing each other were the priest and the marrying couple: she in a white dress, with a green handbag over her shoulder to match her high-heeled shoes, he in a grey suit. Behind them were the best man and the maid of honour, each holding a candle. Two crowns were blessed, kissed by the bride and groom in turn and then placed on their heads. They drank from a glass of wine, three quick sips, and then joined hands and circled the altar, bowing to the points of the compass in turn, three times. The priest took the candles and the couple blew them out. They all left as quickly as they had arrived. The women in scarves continued their vigil with the candles, shuffling from one chandelier to the next. As I stood, the priest offered me a sip from the glass of wine which had been blessed for the wedding. So much for Plovdiv. Silly-sounding, but charming.</p>

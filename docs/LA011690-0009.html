			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN DOES THE EXPECTED -- LOSES TO USC IN VOLLEYBALL  </P> <P> In sports, inexperience often leads to unpredictability. Volleyball, however,  is an exception. Cal State Northridge learned that lesson Monday night.  </P> <P> Playing without setter Matt Unger -- who is temporarily ineligible -- against a  powerful team from USC, the Matadors were all too predictable in a  nonconference match at CSUN that served as the season opener for both teams.  </P> <P> As a result, the Trojans took only 1 hour 40 minutes to dispatch Northridge,  15-5, 15-12, 15-9.  </P> <P> Unger, a redshirt sophomore, is attending interim classes and will not regain  his eligibility until the middle of next week at the earliest, Coach John Price  said.  </P> <P> Starting in Unger's place was Gary Reznick, a freshman from Taft High, who was  a bit skittish in his collegiate debut.  </P> <P> How much of a loss was Unger?  </P> <P> "Huge," Price said without hesitation.  </P> <P> So, too, was USC's margin of victory. The Trojans trailed only once, 3-2, in  the match's final game.  </P> <P> "We've been practicing and playing better than this," Price said. "We're  capable of playing much better.  </P> <P> "Our passing was poor and we were very predictable. We were struggling with who  to give the ball to. Our hitters were going against two (blockers) all night  long."  </P> <P> Bryan Ivie, a member of the U. S. national team, was a mainstay in the middle  for the Trojans. He had match-highs with seven blocks and 24 kills. USC hit  .343 as a team to Northridge's .216.  </P> <P> Raphael Tulino, a junior middle-blocker, was a bright spot for the Matadors. He  had a team-high 19 kills (on a .531 attack percentage) and five blocks.  Freshman Coley Kyman had 16 kills, but only a .067 attack percentage.  </P></p>

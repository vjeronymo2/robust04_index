			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: Knock-out equity warrant offers make a comeback HIGHLY structured equity-linked transactions seem to be making a comeback in the Eurobond markets, with obvious advantages to issuers and some quirky appeal to investors. Most recently, Swiss Bank Corporation launched a L200bn bond and 'knock-out' equity warrants deal for Benetton, the Italian clothing manufacturer and retailer. The issue, which has characteristics similar to the warrants offering the bank put together in March for Roche, the Swiss drug company, gives investors the fixed-income return of a bond and limited equity exposure to Benetton's share price. The issue allowed Benetton to borrow at better rates than conventional bonds, and the warrants dilute the equity to a lesser extent than a regular convertible bond. Investors liked the deal because the cash flows from the bonds can be readily swapped, and the warrants could be either purchased separately or stripped from the bond. The deal offered money managers high-quality exposure to the Italian stock market, since the warrants acted like synthetic shares. However, because the cap feature of the warrants limits their potential returns, most investors would prefer to buy Benetton shares outright. The warrants are aimed squarely at Swiss and German buyers, who find the after-tax returns from the warrants are higher than for a straight bond. The Benetton warrants were priced at 96 per cent of the share price, at L17,983. Investors will participate in share price appreciation up to, but no higher than, L29,873. On the downside, investors are guaranteed a maturity price of no less than L21,543. However, the downside 'put' is conditional. If the share price rallies above the L24,353 'knock-out' price during the three-year life of the warrants, put protection disappears. Warrant exercise is possible only on the maturity date. If the Roche deal is any indication, Benetton's warrant purchasers had better prepare for a knock-out. Roche shares hit their knock-out level of SFr5,000 two weeks ago, forcing investors to either trade out of the warrants, buy their own puts on Roche shares, or accept unlimited downside share price risk. Traders estimate that Benetton's borrowing costs in the deal will amount to 5 to 6 per cent, while investors will harvest a 10 to 12 per cent annual return in lira terms, modest compared to a flat Libor yield of about 10.5 per cent. Mr Andrea Mandel-Mantello of SBC said future knock-out warrant deals will be limited. 'Only companies that are extremely confident of their potential share performance will venture into these vehicles,' he said. Also, successful issuers must be well-known internationally and have high-quality credit.</p>

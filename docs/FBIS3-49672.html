The director of the first IMF European department said in a  letter that the organization was aware of the grave economic  situation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and especially  of the need to focus on the settling of the serious economic  problems but that the circumstances did not allow it to help  Yugoslavia in its efforts. On December 28, Kontic asked the IMF  to help draw up a new Yugoslav stablization programme.    The Yugoslav Government has in the meantime completed its  own  economic programme whose essence has not yet been explained to  the public. A stabilization programme is urgently needed  because Yugoslavia is currently under a complete economic  blockade while its rampant inflation reached the official figure  of one million percent in December.    In May 1992, the United Nations Security Council imposed  tough economic sanctions against Yugoslavia accusing it of being  involved in the civil war among Moslems, Serbs and Croats in the  neighbouring former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. As  part of the economic sanctions, Yugoslavia's membership to the  imf has been frozen. In conclusion, the IMF expressed hope in  the letter that the circumstances would in the future allow the  organization to open talks on support to Yugoslavia's  stabilization programme.</p>

			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Dish sales increase sharply: FT Satellite Monitor CUT-PRICE offers, extensive advertising and improved deliveries from manufacturers boosted sales and rentals of satellite television dishes to 102,000 last month, Continental Research said. The figure is comparable with pre-Christmas sales last year after several months when sales ranged between 60,000 and 70,000. Installations increased from 21,500 in the first week of November to 30,000 in the last week. The independent research is based on interviews with more than 4,000 adults and is integrated with retail figures. To avoid double counting, more than 20,000 dish installations were excluded last month because they represented a transfer of subscribers from the defunct British Satellite Broadcasting to BSkyB. Almost 250,000 homes said they had definite plans to install satellite television and a further 1.69m said they probably would. The satellite channels range from BSkyB, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake, to Eurosport, MTV and UK Gold. Together they have 30 per cent of viewing in satellite homes - the same as the two BBC channels. ITV and Channel 4 together have a 40 per cent share. More than 3.14m homes can now receive satellite channels in the UK through individual dishes, cable networks and communal aerials.</p>

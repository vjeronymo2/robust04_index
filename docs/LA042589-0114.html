			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> INDIA DOCKERS WORK AGAIN  </P> <P> About 300,000 dockworkers returned to work Monday at India's 10 major ports  after a successful six-day strike for higher wages, union leaders said. The  strike had cut India's imports to a trickle and virtually paralyzed exports. A  five-year wage accord between five dockworkers' unions and the government  provides for increases ranging from $20 to $53 a month, effective next Jan. 1.  </P></p>

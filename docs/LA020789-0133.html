			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FRAGILE, POWERFUL SYMBOL;  </P> <P> MURAL DEAR TO UCI MINORITIES, FOREIGN STUDENTS COULD BE DESTROYED IN MOVE  </P> <P> The mural fills an entire wall in the trailer that houses the Cross-Cultural  Center, a student union of sorts for minority and foreign students at UC  Irvine.  </P> <P> Anywhere else, this 17-foot-long montage of folk figures and prominent black,  American Indian and Latino leaders would be powerful. In these cramped  quarters, at a university struggling to recruit and retain minority students  and staff, it has become an important symbol.  </P> <P> "When I first came to the Cross-Cultural Center, I felt an affinity that made  this building more like a home," said Luis Chavez, president of MECHA, a Latino  student group. "I identified with this mural because it traces my historical  roots."  </P> <P> The fragile work is now threatened because the Cross-Cultural Center will move  later this month, and no one realized until recently that the wood-framed  canvas won't fit through the doors at either end.  </P> <P> "If it were destroyed," said Chavez, "I would almost feel like a part of me  would be destroyed, too."  </P> <P> The "Cross," as the center is called on campus, will move from the trailer that  has been its temporary home since 1972 to its own building, a 3,400-square-foot  headquarters prominently placed across from Administration Hall. The new Cross  is to be the centerpiece of UCI's outreach to minorities, a visible response to  criticism about black, Latino and American Indian enrollment that totaled just  1,422 of 13,032 undergraduates last fall.  </P> <P> The mural, likewise, is to be the centerpiece of the new headquarters. The  foyer wall, where it is supposed to be mounted, was designed to match the mural  measurements.  </P> <P> To relocate the artwork, which was painted inside the trailer, students and  university officials have concluded that it must be removed from its wood frame  and rolled like a carpet. But the paint has become brittle, and art consultants  who have examined the piece predict that it will crumble where it has been  attached to crossbars on the frame.  </P> <P> Despite the warnings, student board members of the Cross voted Monday to  attempt to move the mural rather than to reproduce it at the new headquarters  or commission another work.  </P> <P> "Every effort should be made to save it," said LaQuetta Bush, a Cross member  and officer of the Black Student Union. "We need something to remind us where  we came from and the energy it took to get us here. It means a lot to all of  us."  </P> <P> Horace Mitchell, vice chancellor for student affairs, said he will support the  students' decision. "The mural is very significant -- it has been important to  the students for a long time," he said. "The issue is whether it can survive."  </P> <P> Its value is mostly sentimental, but the possibility that the artwork might be  lost has united minority students in what Mitchell called "a referendum on the  university's commitment (to minorities)."  </P> <P> The mural, painted in 1980-81 by student artist Al Vasquez and several  volunteers, was the product of brainstorming sessions between black, Latino,  Asian and Indian students. It depicts United Farm Workers President Caesar  Chavez shoulder-to-shoulder with slain black leader Malcolm X and Sitting Bull,  the Sioux chief. Folk figures of Indians planting maize and Chinese workers  laying railroad track lead viewers to the center, where four arms in black,  white, brown and yellow are clasped together.  </P> <P> Ron Wilson, campus ombudsman, traces its importance to the tenuous foothold  that blacks, Latinos and other minorities feel at UCI.  </P> <P> "The Cross and the mural have become intertwined with what students feel is  their identity," Wilson said. "Just as minority enrollment is an issue on  campus now, this was an effort of the time to put forth in bold, bright colors  (minorities') love for their cultural ancestry and heritage.  </P> <P> "They may feel a lack of control . . . here on campus," he said. "One way they  can have control is in the way they wish to be represented."  </P> <P> No moving day has been set for the mural, which will be one of the last items  transported to the new center. University staff members will help to take it  down, but Cross members will be responsible for remounting the work, said Marc  Tuchman, director of the University Center. Tuchman and Cross staff director  Laurie White will coordinate the move.  </P> <P> The students accept the risk that the mural might be ruined in the effort,  Felicia Lee, chairman of the Cross student board, said.  </P> <P> "If it falls apart, then we will save the pieces that can be saved," Lee said.  "We'll mount the pieces in the new Cross."  </P></p>

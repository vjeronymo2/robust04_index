			<p>BFN     [Text] Matthew Nimetz, the U.S. presidential envoy on the  issue of Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM], arrived in Athens a short while ago for talks  with the Greek Government. He will meet Foreign Minister  Karolos Papoulias at 1930 today.    Nimetz said he is not bringing any specific new proposals on  the issue of Skopje, but he appeared optimistic about the  mediation to smooth Greek-Skopjean relations. He left open the  possibility of meeting Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, adding  that such a meeting would depend on his talks with the foreign  minister this afternoon.    In a major article yesterday, THE WASHINGTON POST predicted  a  Greek-Skopjean compromise, stressing that Skopje had wrongly  exceeded beyond its authority in adopting historical and  nationalistic symbols. The article says that with its relaxed  diplomacy, the United States allowed the fire to spread, thus  forcing Athens to harden its stance in the dispute with Skopje.  According to the report, Washington's role is considered  strained due to the stationing of 600 peacekeepers in Skopje,  who could be the cause of confrontations throughout the Balkans.</p>

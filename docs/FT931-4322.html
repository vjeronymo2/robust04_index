			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / International Company News: Lafarge Copee holds profits at FFr1.23bn LAFARGE COPEE, the French company which is the world's largest building materials group, yesterday announced that it had maintained net profits at FFr1.23bn (Dollars 217.5m) last year, but warned that it faced tough trading conditions in the current year. Mr Bertrand Collomb, chairman, said Lafarge had held profits in spite of the fragile state of the construction market in parts of Europe and North America. The group's 1992 performance was rather better than the stock market had expected. Analysts had forecast a slight decline in net profits in what would have been a repetition of its 1991 results, when net profits fell for the first time in eight years. Mr Collomb described the outlook for 1993 as uncertain, but hoped that fledgling recovery in the US would counter the slowdown in Europe. He expected problems in France during the first half, but hoped the economy would recover in the second half. Lafarge, like other construction companies, was badly affected last year by the sluggish state of its markets in France and Spain. However, it benefited from an improvement in its US activities, the chief cause of the decline in profits during 1991. Turnover fell to FFr30.45bn in 1992 from FFr31.65bn in 1991, and operating profits slipped to FFr3.14bn from FFr3.22bn over the same period. Net debt rose to FFr9.7bn last year from FFr9.1bn in 1991. Mr Collomb has already announced that Lafarge, which has expanded rapidly through acquisition in recent years, will concentrate on consolidating its existing interests and on reducing debt. The group is also attempting to cut costs and improve productivity. It reduced its workforce by 1,500, or 5 per cent, last year to the present level of 30,000.</p>

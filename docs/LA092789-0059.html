			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WHEELCHAIR PROTESTERS GET SUPPORT BUT NOT BUS LIFTS  </P> <P> Handicapped protesters who occupied a federal building for two days won a  pledge of government support Tuesday but failed to win an order requiring  wheelchair lifts on all new public buses bought with federal funds.  </P> <P> The Transportation Department "cannot issue a summary order commanding  immediate access including wheelchair access for all transit," said Steven  Diaz, chief counsel for the Urban Mass Transportation Administration, who met  with the protest leaders. "We would if we could."  </P> <P> But Diaz said department officials and the protesters had agreed on three  points:  </P> <P>  -- Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner will be urged to meet promptly  with disabled activists to ensure a "principle of accessibility" until Congress  passes the Americans with Disabilities Act.  </P> <P>  -- The protesters will be allowed to continue a "symbolic presence" at the  Richard B. Russell building in downtown Atlanta.  </P> <P>  -- Officials will relay to Skinner the protesters' concern that new rules for  handicapped accessibility to air travel are not being drafted quickly enough.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Problem Not Solved  </P> <P> "This agreement by no means resolves the problem of access; it just brings us a  step closer," said Mark Johnson, 38, of Alpharetta, one of the protest leaders  who met with Diaz and other department officials.  </P> <P> He said he did not know if the protesters would leave the building, where they  blocked elevators and entrance doors earlier Tuesday.  </P> <P> "We may stay here through Thursday or we may just leave a sticker on the wall.  There could be a constant vigil at the building or we could all leave," he  said.  </P> <P> The protest by members of ADAPT, or American Disabled for Accessible Public  Transportation, began Monday when Skinner was in Atlanta to address the  convention of the American Public Transportation Assn. At least two dozen  protesters chained themselves to doors or blocked exits with their wheelchairs  Monday.  </P> <P> Authorities attempted to eject several protesters from the building Monday  evening but President Bush intervened and let them spend the night inside  rather than send them out into the rain.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Entrances Blocked  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the protesters made good on a threat to block entrances to the  building's main level at noon if their demands were not met by then.  </P> <P> About two hours later, while federal officials met with protest leaders outside  the building, about 160 chanting, singing activists kept federal employees and  visitors from using 12 of the 14 main-floor elevators by blocking them with  wheelchairs.  </P> <P> Security officers were able to keep two elevators open by using plant stands to  keep wheelchairs away from them.  </P> <P> About 100 protesters spent Monday night in the building, eating takeout food  and sleeping under blankets provided by attendants. Early Tuesday, a group of  Atlanta bartenders brought them coffee and doughnuts.  </P> <P> "It was an uncomfortable night," said Rick James, 39, of Salt Lake City. "The  misery that we're going through is worth it if we get what we want. All we are  asking for is a lift on every bus so that we can be more independent. We're not  asking for a million dollars."  </P> <P> But government officials have estimated that putting wheelchair lifts on all  new public buses would cost $90 million a year.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 7/6/1994 -- "Though they follow  different objectives, Suleyman Demirel [president of Turkey] and  Mircea Snegur realized that they can attain them at the same  chess table," states the newspaper of the Moldovan Christian  Democratic People's Front (FPCD) TARA (THE COUNTRY). "The  Chisinau authorities, which work hard to ruin our national  prospect on this territory, would like someone to pay for their  debts. They take advantage of Turkey's interests in this  segment of the East European political space. At the same time,  Turkey's intentions to use in its interests the situation, which  was created by the process of creating the second Romanian  state, are more than obvious. Turkey at last will set a strong  control over this area." The strongest move the Turkish  president has made in this political chess game is the use of  the Gagauz problem, says the newspaper, adding that Suleyman  Demirel considers Gagauzians "the representatives of a distinct  branch of Turkish peoples," which "were the first to settle on  this land." Thus, declaring that "Gagauzians will respect the  territorial integrity of Moldova and welcoming the elaboration  of the special juridical status for the southern Moldova,  Suleyman Demirel is contributing to the annihilation of  separatism, requesting in his turn the official recognition of  Gagauzians as a native people of Bessarabia." Referring to the  policy promoted by the present leadership, considered by the  FPCD antinational, the article concludes: "Today this territory  is mined with controversial geopolitical interests. We can soon  live the frightening forecast of Mrs. Catherine Lalumiere,  ex-secretary of the Council of Europe, who declared that  Bessarabia, belonging a little to Russia, a little to the  Ukraine and a little to Turkey, could be an area of interference  of spheres of influence of these three states."</p>

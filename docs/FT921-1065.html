			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Book Review: A better class of reader THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UNACCEPTABLE By Raymond Snoddy Faber &amp; Faber, Pounds 14.99 The debate over the freedom of the press in Britain is full of those apparently unresolvable contradictions that brilliantly illuminate society's continuing divisions. It might dismay those who would have us believe in the arrival of a classless society but it is undeniable that the central split is one of class. For this is one nation with two distinct presses appealing to different audiences, with different concerns, applying different criteria to achieve different ends. On one side is the growing minority, mainly the upper and middle class but including an educated section of the working class, forming an articulate, literate elite which reads the serious broadsheet newspapers. On the other is the vast majority, the working class, which buys millions of tabloid papers every day. While broadsheets publish what they believe to be in the public interest, tabloids, to survive, must publish what interests the public. Experience has shown that the public tends to be very interested in the salacious and sensational. Newspaper articles from past centuries, as noted by Ray Snoddy in his book, The Good, the Bad and the Unacceptable, prove that there has long been a public appetite for crime, sex and gossip about celebrities, especially royalty. In the past 50 years there have been frequent demands for a clean-up and, inevitably, popular papers have sought to defend themselves by asserting that any interference by parliament is a threat to freedom. In these battles, broadsheets have been forced to defend their rude tabloid cousins. They realise thatany diminution of freedom for the tabloid press would threaten what they regard as legitimate journalistic investigations. The outcome of these conflicts between press and government has been self-regulation; in return for good - well, goodish - behaviour by newspapers the government agreed not to enact laws to restrict press freedom. The latest manifestation of self-regulation, the much-vaunted Last Chance Saloon, is the Press Complaints Commission backed up by a code of behaviour agreed jointly by tabloid and broadsheet editors. As one of the people who helped draft the code I was aware of the strains between the two branches of the press, not to mention the third branch of regional papers. Nevertheless, although there were some imperfections, we agreed a written code and there has been a discernible rise in standards among the tabloids in the past year. I doubt that it will last if the threat of legislation recedes and tabloid circulations continue to plunge as they have done in the past 12 months. A couple of years ago I interviewed, for a BBC film, tabloid readers as they were buying the paper of their choice. I asked three questions: Why do you buy it? Does it worry you that many stories might be untrue or sensationalised? If you found out that the paper was regularly publishing untrue stories would you stop buying it? There was an unsurprising unanimity. The papers were bought because they were entertaining or presented news in an easy-to-read way; buyers were relatively untroubled by whether stories were true, often claiming they could tell where facts ended and fiction started; therefore, they could not imagine why lack of veracity should make them give up their daily habit. Readers are notorious for their hypocrisy, though. Snoddy quotes a survey in which people were largely against the reporting of adultery involving those outside the public eye and against press intrusion into the lives of the royal family. That may be what they say but it is what they do that counts; it is well-known that stories of illicit sex and royal tittle-tattle continue to be big sellers. If readers cannot help, what about proprietors? Snoddy, who has managed to get most of them talking at some length, places a lot of faith in owners as sensible guardians of standards. But declining profits, or changing ownerships, can erode the best of intentions. Snoddy therefore argues for the formation of a Council of the Press, embracing owners, editors and journalists from every kind of newspaper, to act as self-regulator on standards and campaigner for greater press freedom. This is not the kind of suggestion to oppose but I remain sceptical about its having any chance of success, since it appears to attack the problem from the wrong direction. If the central contradiction is embedded in class-based culture, and we can see how education is having a slow but positive effect in changing newspaper reading habits, then the real effort must be in improving educational standards. My fear is that falling tabloid circulations are due not only to people graduating to the broadsheets but to people failing even to reach a measure of literacy to read popular papers. That should worry us more than whether the royal family is upset at papers peeping over the wall of Buckingham Palace. The reviewer was editor of the Daily Mirror 1990-91. His biography of Robert Maxwell will be published on April 27</p>

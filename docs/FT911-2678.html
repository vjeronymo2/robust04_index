			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / US envoys meet Mengistu in bid to save Addis SENIOR US envoys met the embattled President Mengistu Haile Mariam of Ethiopia at the weekend in an initiative aimed at preventing the country's civil war engulfing the capital Addis Ababa. Mr Rudy Boschwitz, an envoy of President George Bush, and three other officials had extensive talks with Mr Mengistu and his government on an Ethiopian parliamentary proposal for unlimited, open talks with all rebel groups and a transitional government followed by a ceasefire. The meetings followed a week of heavy fighting between government troops and rebels who have advanced to within 65 miles of the capital. One US official said the Ethiopian government had embarked on 'a major, sincere undertaking. All the elements have come to the real fundamental judgment that profound political concessions must be made, and that a military solution is impossible. There are no limitations. Everything is up for negotiation, even the formation of multi parties.' A US official left Addis Ababa yesterday for Khartoum to meet the two leaders of the main rebel groups, Mr Issayas Aferwerki of the secessionist Eritrean People's Liberation Front and Mr Meless Zenawi of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front. The official will brief them on the government's position and try to facilitate dialogue. However, despite the backing of Washington and Moscow for the proposal and the optimism of US officials, doubts remain over whether the rebels, lifted by recent victories, can be made amenable. EPRDF statements last week criticised the parliament for calling a national mobilisation, and threatened to fight Mr Mengistu to the finish. Even so, the rebels are anxious to avoid the huge civilian casualties and destruction of infrastructure which would accompany a battle for the capital. 'It is in our interest to minimise the bloodshed and come to a peaceful resolution,' Mr Asefa Mamo, EPRDF spokesman in London, said yesterday. Mr Mengistu's apparent determination to remain in power, rather than allowing a transitional government to be formed, continues to obstruct peace. Rebel groups have built up much hostility to, and suspicion of, Mr Mengistu and the clique which surrounds him.</p>

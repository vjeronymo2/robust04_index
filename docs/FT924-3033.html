			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Rowland to sell half his Lonrho stake at premium: German financier buys 7 1/2 % holding and underwrites share issue MR TINY ROWLAND yesterday signalled his intention to retire in three years from Lonrho, the international trading conglomerate he has effectively run - sometimes amid great controversy - for the past 31 years. The 75-year-old chief executive said he would sell half his 15 per cent stake in Lonrho to Mr Dieter Bock, a German financier, at 115p a share for a total of Pounds 50m. The company will also be issuing shares to Mr Bock at 85p. The price of 115p is a substantial premium to Lonrho's closing price last night of 79p and is likely to raise the concern of the other shareholders who are not offered such terms. Mr Bock has the option to buy the other half after three years when Mr Rowland is expected to have retired from the Lonrho board. Ms Anne Simpson, joint managing director of Pension Investment Research Consultants, which provides a corporate governance service to fund managers handling more than Pounds 40bn of pension funds, criticised the deal. 'If Mr Rowland's shares are worth 115p then so are the shares held by all the other shareholders,' she said. 'It is a flagrant disregard of the understanding that all shareholders are treated equally.' In a wide-ranging series of deals to bolster Lonrho's heavily debt laden balance sheet, Mr Bock will partially underwrite a Lonrho rights issue and buy further shares from the company at 85p a share. These two actions will raise about Pounds 180m. Lonrho will also sell to Volkswagen for Pounds 124m VAG, the UK importer of Volkswagen and Audi cars. Mr Bock will end up owning between 9 per cent and 25 per cent of the enlarged group, depending on the rights issue take-up of other shareholders. Mr Bock will underwrite half the 200m shares in the 3 for 10 rights issue at 85p a share, take up Mr Rowland's rights and buy his existing shares. Mr Rowland, in a letter to shareholders, acknowledges that there is 'bound to be comment on the premium paid for the shares' which he is selling. He said: 'I do not believe that there is any unfair advantage since neither my company nor I has ever dealt in Lonrho shares, other than to buy them.' Mr Rowland went on to tell shareholders that Lonrho had discussions with Gencor, South Africa's second biggest mining house, but decided it was not in Lonrho's interests to be South African controlled. Lonrho's need to raise cash from its first rights issue in 12 years is underlined by the fall in profit which it forecasts for the year ending September 30. Pre-tax profits have dropped from Pounds 205m to Pounds 79m and profits attributable to shareholders before extraordinary items were Pounds 6m compared with Pounds 90m. The final dividend is to be cut to 2p, making a total of 4p compared with 13p. Net debt has risen to Pounds 947m. Mr Bock is investing as a private shareholder although his main vehicle is Advanta, a Dutch-based company with extensive property and construction interests in Germany. Speaking after signing the deal in London yesterday, Mr Bock indicated he would take an active role at Lonrho to push through changes. It is understood he might accept Lonrho's invitation to join the board if he was to become joint chief executive with Mr Rowland. To raise the money to buy his Lonrho stake, Mr Bock said he had recently made a number of property disposals and he would sell 10 per cent to 20 per cent of his shareholding in Advanta group to German institutions. He is underwriting the deal through his privately owned company, Laerstate, registered in the Netherlands. He said that he had approached Lonrho about taking a stake because he believed the shares were undervalued. Lonrho's trading performance has been hurt in recent years by a number of factors including weak prices for the output of its southern African mines and farms. Shareholders have also been deeply concerned about the group's rising debts and the unresolved question of who would succeed Mr Rowland. Mr Rene Leclezio, Lonrho's chairman, said: 'The combination of all these proposals represents an important milestone in the history of Lonrho. The group has experienced two difficult years and there is need for decisive action to be taken.'

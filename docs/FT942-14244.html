			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Breaking into outer Mongolia - Norbrook Laboratories The break-up of the former Soviet Union has helped Norbrook Laboratories break into its furthest - flung market. The veterinary pharmaceuticals company, based in Newry, Northern Ireland, now has a good line selling animal antibiotics to Mongolia. Mr Alan Patterson, deputy managing director, said: 'Mongolia was left in the lurch by its former Soviet suppliers and we now do significant business with our range of antibiotics for goats and cattle.' Such successes have now gained Norbrook its third Queen's Award for Export. It previously won the award in 1987 and 1990. Since 1991 Norbrook's export sales have risen by 86 per cent and account for nearly 85 per cent of turnover. 'Since the last time we won the award in 1990 we have started selling in 22 new countries taking the total number to 95. There are now not many more countries left,' said Mr Patterson. Founded in 1969 by Mr Edward Haughey, chairman and managing director, Norbrook now has 350 staff in Newry, making it the town's largest private sector employer. It has a further 50 employees in its overseas offices in the US, Holland and Kenya. Mr Patterson said that the company could not survive without exports. 'Research and development is very important and very expensive so we have to develop products for the global market,' he says. The company has 44 staff in research and development on which it spends around 10 per cent of its sales. Mr Patterson said that recent export growth was based largely on a series of new products, including Alamycin LA 300, the world's first antibiotic to give animals cover for six days.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky by Igor </F> Uranic in Budapest; date not given: "The Bosnian Croats Are Now  Victims"]    [Text] Dr. Geza Jeszenszky is one of the people who in the  past four years has lead the young Hungarian democracy toward  Europe, from which this country was divided by an "iron curtain"  after World War II. Always pleasant to talk to, rationally  interpreting political events, he shook my hand at the door to  his office, saying "Good afternoon" in Croatian. I replied in  Hungarian. This was the first long interview with him, and I  felt that I should start from what has already become history.  However, I skipped the first nine centuries of  Croatian-Hungarian history.    [Uranic] Minister Jeszenszky, how would you assess the  relations between Croatia and Hungary from the fall of communism  to the present day?    [Jeszenszky] I think that every Croat and every Hungarian  realize that these two nations and two countries have for  centuries lived within one state and that this life together was  not at all bad. It was only in the 19th century that there were  serious controversies and tensions between the two nations. The  relations were good -- whether we discuss the present, the time  of the former Yugoslavia, or the time of the Croato-Hungarian  Compromise of 1868, which was also not bad. Naturally, we could  discuss its implementation. However, if I am to talk about how  relations between the two countries have developed since 1990,  then I would like to say with the utmost sincerity that I am  very happy that another "compromise" has been made between  Croatia and Hungary. This one was much easier to make, since we  are living in two states.    Hungary never wanted to meddle in the relations among the  peoples of Yugoslavia, but it also respected the will of the  Croatian people when we realized that the Croats saw their  future in an independent state. After Croatia established peace  following a very difficult war, which peace is, unfortunately,  still very fragile, political relations were established between  Hungary and Croatia at all levels. Much has been done in the  areas of economy and culture.    Unfortunately, economic cooperation is not as strong and  intensive as we would like it to be, which the war is largely  responsible for. For instance, you see that Hungarian tourists  have understood this unusual situation of the war being waged in  certain parts of Croatia, while it is possible to swim in the  Adriatic in peace, so there have been many on holiday in Croatia  in the past two years. I think that, generally speaking,  permanent and solid foundations have been laid for good  relations between the two countries and two nations in this  period.    [Uranic] In your opinion, how does the war in the Balkans  influence Hungary, and how does it influence the political  situation in this part of Europe? Do you agree with those who  say that "Europe is dying in the Balkans"?    [Jeszenszky] The war in the Balkans is undoubtedly a burden  to primarily the Balkan peoples, the peoples of the former  Yugoslavia. The neighboring countries also feel the consequences  of the war -- naturally not the way the people of Vukovar or  Sarajevo have felt it, but Hungary does indeed feel the  consequences of the war. We do not see this war as an American  who sees it all on TV and thinks: "This is far away. What is  happening there is terrible, but the main thing is that it is  not here." This war is close to us, and the Hungarian people  have shown their solidarity with those who suffer by accepting  refugees and through the significant aid offered by the members  of the Maltese order and many others. Unfortunately, the war in  the Balkans does indeed have a very bad influence on the entire  region.    I am not only talking about these direct consequences.  Looking from a distance, the war is here, several hundred  kilometers away, in this part of Europe. More tourists and more  investors from the United States would have come to Hungary if  this war had been over. I will not say that this war could  stimulate others to fight wars, but, unfortunately, it indicates  that the use of force and occupation of territory have so far  yielded results. It is, therefore, a very bad example to the  entire world, particularly Central and Eastern Europe. I  personally think that the events that have occurred there are a  hard blow to the civilization of Christian Europe.    We know that war conventions have been in power since the  last century and that they were mostly observed even then. Let  me quote from a work of a great Hungarian writer Sandor Maroy,  who said: "To be European means to believe that reason and  solidarity are stronger than the tyranny of low passions."  Unforfunately, we have seen that this basic principle of  Europeanism was not actualized here. Moreover, I think that it  should be in the interest of all Europeans, especially those who  have been inflicted by the war, to stop the conflict and that it  is their obligation.    [Uranic] Do you think that the UN action, which has so far  been unsuccessful, indicates the international community's  weakness? Should the keeping of peace be replaced by the  imposing of peace or, more precisely, military intervention?    [Jeszenszky] Unfortunately, we can conclude that the  international community has not been able to deal not only with  the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but the entire Balkan crisis. It  soon threw the ball in the European Union's court. After the  mediation of the three failed, as did the very reasonable  Carrington plan, the issue fell into the hands of the United  Nations, and since then, I have seen much willingness to deal  with the issue.    The UN countries are providing considerable amounts of aid  for the people who are suffering. The fact is that hundreds of  thousands of people have been killed in the war, but it should  also be said that several dozen Europeans from the countries  participating in UN missions have also lost their lives. Thus,  they became a part of the suffering, too. I would, therefore,  not say that either Europe or the international community have  completely failed in the Balkans. We could have said there was  a true failure if no efforts had been made to achieve peace.  Unfortunately, there were no appropriate means; there was not  enough political willingness to impose peace. The issue is that  it is not enough to keep the peace because that would come into  power when peace or at least some cease-fire has been achieved.    The United Nations has so far only been prepared to keep  peace. The member countries were not prepared to take the risk  for which military experts established would take an army of at  least 100 soldiers to impose peace, but with the uncertainty as  to how long such peace would last. We may conclude that the  United Nations has learned from all this that, in fighting  similar crises in the future, preventive diplomacy should be  instituted on time.    [Uranic] There have been many accusations recently  concerning Croatia's alleged military involvement in the Bosnian  war. How do you think the existence of the Croat people in  Bosnia-Herzegovina could be secured, knowing they are a  minority, both in relation to the Serbs and the Muslims?    [Jeszenszky] The world's reaction to the events during the  entire war have always been strong but somewhat late. The world  did not pay any attention to the destruction of Vukovar and  Dubrovnik or to the fact that hospitals and churches were being  shot. Only later did everyone realize that the Muslims and the  Croats were the victims in the beginning of the Bosnian war.  However, when the truth did emerge, it took quite some time  before the public started to apply pressure and stimulate  activity.    It seems to me that the Bosnian Croats are really the  victims  at the moment. It is they who are threatened. I can understand  that the Croatian Government and the Croat people are very  worried about it. However, I also hope that we neighboring  countries and the international community will find a way to  prevent the threat of their extinction or exile and that not  only Croatia will have to protect them. The question is whether  Croatia has the power to protect them alone, and what the  reaction of the international community to such attempt would be.    I do not know how much truth there is in the news according  to which there are regular Croatian troops in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Even if it is undoubtedly aimed at  protecting the Bosnian Croats, it could cause the imposing of  sanctions against Croatia, which should be avoided at all costs.  However, the Bosnian Croats becoming victims of ethnic  cleansing or being forced to flee to Croatia should also be  avoided. The world should not only watch what the Croats are  doing; it should pay equal attention to all the peoples in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Uranic] To what extent does the delicate issue of  Hungarians in Vojvodina influence the Hungarian policies toward  Belgrade?    [Jeszenszky] It is clear that Hungary would like the  entire crisis to be resolved, but it has paid particular  attention to keeping up with the position of the Hungarians, as  well as the Croats, Slovaks, and Ruthenians in Vojvodina. When  ethnic cleansing was in full swing, so to speak, we were worried  that the Hungarians in Vojvodina would not only flee because of  poverty and forced mobilization, but also because of the  possibility that some paramilitary formations could expel them  and other non-Serb people from Vojvodina. A large number of  Hungarians fled from there -- almost 15 percent of the total  number. I hope that this is temporary and that the situation  will improve. This direct danger has subsided in the past  several weeks, which is perhaps because the radicals there have  lost a certain amount of power -- this was shown in the election  results.    Naturally, the economic situation has not changed at all.  All we can do to mitigate it is to send as much humanitarian  aid as we can. However, Hungary has not considered giving up  certain principles to try to buy peace for the Hungarians in  Vojvodina or their rights. I think that we have abided by a  principled policy during the entire crisis and that we have  worked on trying to retain good relations with all the peoples  who are part of it, which we succeeded in with Slovenia and  Croatia. On the other hand, the Serbs were condemned by the  international community but, in that case as well, we keep in  mind that they are our neighbors and that they will continue to  be so. Bearing in mind not only the future of the Hungarians in  Vojvodina, but also the long-term Serbian-Hungarian relations,  we wanted to keep good relations with them, too. We did not  introduce compulsory visas; we enabled the regular flow of the  local traffic and so on.    However, at the same time, we believe that the concept of  autonomy, which the Democratic Union of the Hungarians in  Vojvodina, is their right. In that we do not believe that this  is some special right of the Hungarians, but that this model of  local self- management is one of the possible ways of democracy  and coexistence in the Balkans and even further. As Croatia is,  to my knowledge, prepared to provide minority rights for the  Serbs, Serbia should provide a special status to the Croats in  Serbia.    All in all, it seems to me that in the past few weeks, as  recent events have indicated, the government in Belgrade has  realized that what the Hungarians are asking for is not all that  impossible. They have realized that it does not endanger the  territorial integrity of Yugoslavia and that with that move,  they could win some positive points with the international  community and maybe even come closer to a solution for Kosovo.  I do not want to be too optimistic, but there have been serious  suggestions lately, primarily from Serbian President Milosevic.  Andras Agoston was invited to negotiate. This is a sign, and  the days and weeks to follow will answer the question if it was  a tactical move or a political decision that could have positive  consequences in the long run.    I sincerely hope that this will be actualized, and I would  like to point out that during my stay in Belgrade, I felt that  the government there was seriously prepared to make certain  steps toward peace and that they will start serious negotiations  with the Hungarians. The Serb-Croat agreement, which happened  several days before, had to me been a good sign of "breaking the  ice" and more than that. It showed that Serb-Croat relations  had moved from a standstill, which is extremely important for  us, because it means that there is no danger of another conflict  in our neighborhood, which may open the possibility of the  return of the refugees, the opening of the Adriatic pipeline....    [Uranic] Hungary has achieved remarkable success in European  political integration. However, many believe that this is not  accompanied by a corresponding level of economic prosperity.    [Jeszenszky] It would be difficult to summarize the  condition of the Hungarian economy in a few sentences. However,  I think that the achieved level of transformation of the  Hungarian economy is not at all bad. I would like to point out  that our inflation has never reached the proportions that most  of our neighbors have experienced; it is currently kept at  approximately 20 percent a year, and it will be even lower. We  have made a significant part of state property private and half  of the capital intended for this part of Europe still flows into  Hungary. I would not like to embark upon a rivalry concerning  who is in a better situation -- us, the Czechs, or the Polish.  The most important thing is that a lot of capital is arriving  here. As far as I am concerned, let there be talk that other  countries are better off, as long as the greater part of the  capital comes here. Capital does not read the papers and does  not listen to propaganda, but simply goes where it pays to  invest. That is why I think that the success of the Hungarian  economy is at a far more serious level than is commonly thought.    I recently visited Ukraine, and I went to the foot of the  Carpathians. The Hungarians there are surprised at the people  in Hungary complaining about the situation so much. Not only  because things are much worse there, but also because they see  how much is being built here, and not only concerning  infrastructure. There is a large number of new companies, new  technology is being implemented, apartments built. All in all,  I think that we have achieved relatively good economic growth in  Hungary. We have not achieved everything we wanted, precisely  because of the general international crisis and the war.  Nevertheless, we did protect the people from the economic  crisis that has struck all our neighbors.    [Uranic] Hungary has accepted the "Partnership for Peace"  plan. Do you think this was the most the West could have  offered to the Central and Eastern European countries,  considering the situation in Russia?    [Jeszenszky] Many say that this is less than we expected  and that the West has given in to Russia, or at least shown too  much consideration toward Russia. I do not think this is true.  Hungary and other East European countries clearly want to be  full members of NATO, and they would not mind this coming into  power immediately. However, a long transition period would  follow. The conditions in the Hungarian Army, in the economy,  and the education of the officers would certainly not enable us  to become part of this integrated military structure  immediately. However, I do not claim that we could not have  done more.    The United States bears a historical responsibility, not  only  concerning Russian-U.S. relations, but also for what course  Russian politics will take. It was, therefore, motivated to  make Russia its partner and thus encourage those who are  positively disposed toward the West, the democratic forces.  Hungary, Poland, and other countries therefore accepted this --  I would not say sacrifice, but waiting patiently. It is also  best for us not to have to fear Russia forever and to have  Russia not only stop being a military threat, but also start on  the way of economic development, to continue being the source of  raw materials and all its other potentials. We have a special  interest in Russia becoming a large eastern market and in Russia  and the Baltic countries becoming the center of Europe, as now  they are its outskirts.    Therefore, if Russia and Ukraine stabilize and start going  the way of democracy and market economy, we will be the first to  profit from that. Hungary supported the "Partnership" under  those terms. This is why we are not complaining. We believe  that this is an achievement that was unthinkable a year ago. We  have come closer to NATO membership and we have been given  promises that this plan would lead to it. This depends  primarily on us, on our handling of the situation, our progress,  and our readiness to cooperate.  <H5>  [Box p 15] </H5> <H5>  Lifting the Sanctions Against Belgrade </H5>   [Uranic] According to some sources, Hungary is prepared to  support the lifting of the sanctions against the FRY. Could you  comment on that?    [Jeszenszky] I think we can establish that over a year ago,  the international community decided to achieve the desired aim  -- the end to the war -- by imposing economic sanctions instead  of carrying out military intervention. The sanctions have  undoubtedly been effective. Serbia's economy has collapsed. I  was there myself and I saw the direct consequences. Naturally,  this is still a lesser price than having a city or people  destroyed. However, it was no one's intention to make the  innocent suffer the sanctions -- for instance, the Serbian  opposition or the non-Serb population, which certainly did not  support the policies that were to be punished by these  sanctions. The aim of sanctions is not to destroy a nation and  a state but to force them to change policies. The European  Union has, therefore, recently made a proposal that mentions the  suspension or lifting of the sanctions -- not unconditional, but  in case those whom these measures relate to, that is, the  government in Belgrade as well as the Bosnian Serbs, make the  moves they are expected to make. Hungary supports this way of  thinking. It should be seen if the Serbs, Croats, and Bosnian  Muslims accept this within the framework of the peace plan.    The Bosnian Muslims have suffered a lot. I can understand  their bitterness. They presently think that they have grown  militarily stronger. However, I think it is clear that a  military solution really does not exist. The Muslims may  perhaps occupy several villages or maybe towns, but they can  certainly not win against the Serbs. They will certainly not  make it to Belgrade. Therefore, a peaceful solution is still  the only solution there.    I talked to international mediator Stoltenberg and Romanian  Foreign Minister Melesceu today. We have arranged to suggest  that the neighboring countries of the former Yugoslavia hold a  special session at the level of foreign ministers, at which we  would discuss how we, the closest neighbors, can contribute to a  peaceful resolution of the entire crisis. On the basis of the  plan of the European Union and the peace envoys, we would seek  the ways of putting an end to this war, and then, naturally, the  lifting of the sanctions could follow.</p>

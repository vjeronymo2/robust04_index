			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT&amp;T SAYS MONDAY WAS BUSIEST CALLING DAY IN ITS HISTORY  </P> <P> Americans set a long-distance calling record this week that broke the one set  the day after last year's San Francisco earthquake, AT&amp;T said Tuesday.  </P> <P> American Telephone &amp; Telegraph has only theories to explain why 148.4  million long-distance calls were made on its lines Monday.  </P> <P> On Oct. 18, 1989, the day after the San Francisco earthquake, AT&amp;T handled  about 144.7 million long-distance calls, said spokesman Herb Linnen. On an  average day, the company handles 115 million to 120 million calls.  </P> <P> "Traditionally, the Monday after the Thanksgiving weekend is busy, although  there has never been one like this," Linnen said. "It was the busiest calling  day in the history of AT&amp;T."  </P> <P> Linnen speculated that people were trying to catch up on business or perhaps  discussing the possibility of war with Iraq.  </P> <P> But then there were a lot of calls to toll-free "800" numbers, and that could  mean people were doing more Christmas shopping by phone, he said.  </P> <P> AT&amp;T handles 70% or more of the nation's long-distance calls. There was no  similar announcement from the other two major long-distance companies, US  Sprint and MCI.  </P></p>

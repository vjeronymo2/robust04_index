			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Personal alcohol imports up to Pounds 400m Cross-channel shoppers are spending about Pounds 400m a year on personal imports of beer, wine and spirits. A report yesterday by Verdict, the retail consultancy, says that increased allowances of personal imports of duty-paid drinks this year have had 'a dramatic impact'. Although the chancellor did not increase the duty on beer or spirits in the Budget, the outlook for UK off-licences is not bright, Verdict says. Price competition has intensified in the Pounds 6.5bn take-home market and profit margins of specialist shops are wafer thin. Supermarkets have benefited most from growth in the take-home trade and now claim 56 per cent of sales. Off-licences are attempting to match prices but only the biggest chains, Thresher and Victoria Wine, have the power to compete on price for a prolonged period, the report says. Verdict on Off-Licences 1993. Verdict Research, 112 High Holborn, London WC1V 6JS. Pounds 725.</p>

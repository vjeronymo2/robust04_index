			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Visa tightens card security BANKS may be required within three years to print holographic patterns on all new Visa credit cards' magnetic stripes in an effort to combat fraud, it emerged yesterday. Large numbers of card issuers around the world will also introduce micro-chips and other security measures under plans unveiled by Visa International, the largest global credit card network. The details emerged as Visa announced a 13 per cent fall in fraud losses to Pounds 19.8m for the first four months of this year, compared with the same period in 1992. Visa said credit card fraud was now 0.15 per cent of expenditure on its cards, the lowest proportion since it introduced cards in 1969. Mr John Hutchinson, managing director of Visa UK, said: 'We are not complacent but we have a feeling we are getting on top of fraud.' He said the reduction was caused by factors including greater education of card users, more secure deliveries of cards, improved systems to detect fraud by retailers, and the 'card verification value' - a secret code in the magnetic stripe on cards. The decline came in spite of a 7 per cent increase in Visa card numbers and a 14 per cent increase in expenditure. Visa has 54 per cent of the world market for credit cards, supporting 109m cards incurring Dollars 470m (Pounds 300m) in expenditure each year. Cardholders in the UK with 28m cards spent Pounds 10bn in the last year. The two magnetic-stripe designs being considered are a magnetically readable number or 'watermark' which cannot be erased or copied, or a 'holomagnetic' pattern and code printed on top of the strip. Many credit cards are now equipped with a micro-chip. Mr Hutchinson said these would be introduced far more widely in the next few years.</p>

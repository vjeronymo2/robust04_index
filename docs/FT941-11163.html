			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses meander ahead of Fed funds move Bourses mostly meandered to a relatively quiet close yesterday and will respond on Monday to the late afternoon rise in the Fed funds rate, writes Our Markets Staff. In the meantime, Mr Albert Edwards, global strategist at Kleinwort Benson, said last night that many market professionals had not expected the Fed to tighten until the middle of this year, or later. Mr Edwards reckons that the tightening process could lift the Fed Funds rate to 5 per cent by the year-end; that this will arrest the US liquidity flow into equity-oriented mutual funds; and that emerging markets and European bourses, the beneficiaries of last year's transatlantic flow of funds, will face selling pressure as the 'weight of money' argument dries up. PARIS had already closed when the news from the US Federal Reserve was announced but, earlier, it had shown a slight improvement on good US jobs data. The CAC-40 index added 7.18 to 2,329.17, a rise of 0.7 per cent over the week. On the downside, Paribas slipped FFr21 to FFr560 as investors took profits following the group's results which came out of hours on Thursday. The results were much in line with expectations and, as James Capel noted, much of the good news was already built into the share price, the group having outperformed the market since the beginning of the year. Synthelabo, the pharmaceutical company, advanced FFr6.50 to FFr235.50, as it made positive comments about the prospects for a new product in the US. FRANKFURT continued to nurse its domestic concerns, the Dax index falling to 2,121.84 at one point before it closed the session 13.47 lower at 2,138.25; it recovered slightly to an Ibis-indicated 2,143.90 in the post bourse. Turnover fell from DM11.8bnbn to DM9.1bn. Disappointment remained that the Bundesbank did not cut its key rates on Thursday but falls in the Bavarian banks, Bayernverein and Bayernhpyo, of DM10 to DM533 and DM12 to DM467 were ascribed to technical reasons rather than their interest-rate sensitivity; Mr Adrian Hopkinson, at Smith New Court, said Bayernverein was in the middle of a rights issue and Bayernhpyo at the end of a warrants exercise. AMSTERDAM took a fresh look at KLM and decided that the time was right to buy, following the airline's announcement on Thursday that it was seeking to reduce its debt burden by a global offering of 20m ordinary shares. The issue closed at a four-year high, rising Fl 3.80 to Fl 52.00, with some brokers commenting that the rise was partly a result of short covering. Analysts felt that the airline was well positioned to benefit from any upturn in the industry. The AEX index gained 1.77 to 437.10, up 1.8 per cent on the week. The day's performances were not all one way: Royal Dutch slipped Fl 1.60 to Fl 209.30 and Wolters Kluwer dipped a further Fl 1.80 to Fl 124.40. MILAN's banking sector was again in the spotlight, while profit-taking in the broader market left the Comit index 1.15 lower at 671.70, but still 4.7 per cent up on the week. Credito Italiano rose L91 or 4.7 per cent to L2,565 and BCI was L125 or 2.6 per cent ahead at L5,240, benefiting from a change in legislation which is likely to lead to a boost in their credit business. The sector also continued to draw support from the success of this week's privatisation of IMI, which begins trading in Milan on Wednesday; IMI was being quoted on the grey market at L12,600-L12,900, compared with the L10,900 offer price. Alitalia A shares surged L213 or 19.8 per cent to L1,286 in response to recent management changes and comments by Mr Roberto Schisano, managing director designate, that the airline would have to be restructured to make it attractive ahead of its planned privatisation. Montedison finished a week of huge volume with a L14 rise to L1,204, with 66.7m shares traded, the stock now seen as a recovery candidate. ZURICH continued higher, the SMI index adding 14.7 to 3,166.6, for a 0.8 per cent rise over the week. Banks remained firm ahead of results which begin later in the month. CS Holding added SFr9 to SFr760 and UBS bearers rose SFr8 to SFr1,513. A SFr15 rise to SFr279 by Adia was attributed to strong demand from London. Nestle, strong for much of the week, dipped SFr1 to SFr1,389 amid reports that investors were swapping into Unilever which was seen as relatively cheap. Ciba registered shares added SFr10 to SFr924 as Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock. Ascom shed SFr60 to SFr1,300 after saying that it expected losses of SFr150-SFr350 for 1993. STOCKHOLM saw a busy day's trading which left the Affarsvarlden index 2.8 higher at 1,594.0, up 1.3 per cent on the week. Timber stocks put in a strong performance after news of rises in pulp and paper prices. HELSINKI was supported by the positive outlook for the economy. The Hex index added 9.87 to 1,971.96, up 5.9 per cent on the week. ISTANBUL fell another 3.2 per cent, the 592.9 drop in the composite index leaving it with a three-day drop of 14.7 per cent at 17,894.8, but only 6.8 per cent lower on another volatile week. Mr Stuart Harley of Schroders commented that some favourable signs were appearing with overnight rates beginning to tick down, and expectations that the market would find support at the 17,500-18,000 level.

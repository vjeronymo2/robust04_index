			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TOXIC SHOCK IN CHILDREN RE-EMERGING, OFFICIALS SAY;  </P> <P> HEALTH: MANY CIVIL WAR SOLDIERS DIED FROM THE COMPLICATIONS OF SEVERE  INFECTIONS. STILL RARE IN CHILDREN, CASES HAVE BECOME MORE COMMON IN THE LAST  FIVE YEARS, WITH A SECOND REPORTED IN SAN DIEGO.  </P> <P> The streptococcus bacterium that invaded the body of a young girl with  chickenpox, provoking a toxic-shock reaction that led to the amputation of her  arms and legs, has been found recently in other children, medical officials  said Friday.  </P> <P> Dr. Benjamin Schwartz, with the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, said  cases in which "strep" has triggered toxic shock in children have occurred  elsewhere in the country recently, although none have been reported in medical  literature.  </P> <P> "Obviously, something like this can cause a lot of panic," Schwartz said.  "Toxic-shock syndrome from streptococcus infections does occur in children, and  has, although it's very, very rare. They're often related to wounds or other  skin infections and occasionally occur following pneumonia."  </P> <P> Doctors at Children's Hospital said this week that the strain of streptococcus  bacteria found in 6-year-old Jessica Lynn Esquivel had never been seen in a  child in San Diego or in any documented case in the country.  </P> <P> Jessica, who was admitted April 1 with what was first believed to be a routine  case of chickenpox, experienced full cardiac arrest, in addition to kidney,  liver and respiratory failure. On April 18, her legs were amputated at the  knee, and her arms at the elbow.  </P> <P> A kindergarten student from Imperial Beach, Jessica remains in critical  condition in the intensive care unit of Children's Hospital. However, Dr. Brad  Peterson, the physician supervising her care, said he expects her to have full  liver, kidney and respiratory recovery.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, another instance of a San Diego child incurring toxic-shock syndrome  in conjunction with a case of chickenpox was reported to The Times and verified  by Children's Hospital on Friday.  </P> <P> Last fall, 3-year-old Lauren Arnsdorff had to have the tip of her index finger  amputated and she suffered lung damage.  </P> <P> Dr. Marian Melish, professor of pediatrics at the University of Hawaii School  of Medicine, said cases in which strep infections in children have led to  serious and sometimes fatal consequences have occurred with greater regularity  in the last five years.  </P> <P> Melish characterized their re-emergence as having a " 'Back to the Future'-like  effect," not unlike cases that were widely reported during the Civil War and in  the 1910s and 1940s.  </P> <P> "Complications resulting from chickenpox -- in which the child incurs a  secondary bacterial infection -- range from the trivial to the severe to the  fatal," said Melish, who once taught in the pediatrics department of the UC San  Diego School of Medicine. "Streptococcus and staphylococcus bacteria are  considered ubiquitous, meaning they're everywhere and can enter a person's body  any time the skin is broken.  </P> <P> "If you're one of the unlucky few to incur such an infection, the results can  be devastating and often carry a grim inevitability. In other words, it's very  hard to rescue people from these things, especially when they lead to toxic  shock."  </P> <P> Melish said severe streptococcus infections were common during the Civil War,  killing hundreds of soldiers, and later in history, especially the early part  of the century.  </P> <P> For whatever reason, she said they're beginning to re-emerge, particularly in  cases of toxic shock. The lesions caused by chickenpox are just one way the  bacteria can enter the body. She said any cut can serve as a gateway.  </P> <P> "We have a real 'Back to the Future'-type link here," Melish said. "We're  seeing a return to the type of strep as dangerous as those in the '40s, the  1910s, and earlier."  </P> <P> The good news for parents, Melish said, is that a chickenpox vaccine is now in  the hands of the Food and Drug Administration and may be licensed within a few  years.  </P> <P> "Nobody knows how far away it is, but they (FDA researchers) seem convinced  that it can be safe and effective," she said. "I'd say it's only a matter of  time."  </P> <P> Dr. Anne Schuchat, with the Centers for Disease Control, said toxic-shock  syndrome, regardless of the cause, is "an uncommon occurrence," having been  reported, as an annual average, in "five cases per 1 million population."  </P> <P> "Fifty-five to 60% of all toxic shock is menstrual toxic shock, the classic  kind associated with tampons during a menstrual period," Schuchat said. "The  rest is associated with a number of conditions. These can occur in any time of  skin lesion -- boils, abscesses or pox-like sores.  </P> <P> "Toxic shock is quite rare, and having it associated with a single condition  like chickenpox is extremely rare. We've had very few reports of pediatric  toxic-shock syndrome."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Lynn Arnsdorff, a San Diego mother, said her 3-year-old daughter,  Lauren, incurred toxic shock syndrome following chickenpox last fall.  </P> <P> Arnsdorff said Lauren, a patient at Children's Hospital, ended up having the  tip of her index finger amputated and incurred minor lung damage, mainly from  prolonged exposure to the respirator needed to help her breathe during her  stay.  </P> <P> Children's Hospital officials confirmed this week that Lauren Arnsdorff was a  patient and a victim of toxic shock.  </P> <P> "But the organism that caused the syndrome was different from that of  Jessica's," said Mark Morelli, a hospital spokesman. "Lauren's was a  staphylococcus bacteria, rather than the streptococcus bacteria Jessica had.  While the shock syndromes were somewhat the same, the organism that affected  Jessica was far more virulent."  </P> <P> Arnsdorff said her daughter, who had a high fever and was having seizures, was  taken to Children's on Sept. 8. Two nights later, the symptoms got worse.  </P> <P> "They told us she would not survive the day," Arnsdorff said. "She had heart  failure, swelling, she was totally puffed up. They put her on massive doses of  heart medication, but her kidneys failed.  </P> <P> "Although she had the chickenpox, they think she might have gotten toxic shock  as a result of a tiny little scrape on her toe -- not a pox scrape, but one she  had before," although doctors aren't certain of the cause.  </P> <P> "We shuddered when we heard about Jessica," Arnsdorff said. "It was like this  grim deja vu. We were told that it was so rare, in Lauren's case; it might  never happen again. But, of course, it did, and with this poor child (Jessica),  it was much, much worse."  </P></p>

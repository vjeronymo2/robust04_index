			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S. Pautova, under rubric "Economic Survey": "Cut </F> Your Coat According to the Cloth..."]    [Text] Today we are publishing the latest in a series  of articles based on data provided in the "Memorandum Concerning  the Basic Results of the Economic and Social Development of the  City of Novokuznetsk in 1993," which was prepared by T. B.  Balakirev, chief of the Department of Forecasts For the  Development of the City, of the Novokuznetsk city  administration's Committee for the Economy.    The results of the work performed by enterprises in the  services sphere largely formed the components of the concept  "cost of life" in our city. The volume of personal services in  comparable prices constituted 35-40 percent of the 1992 level.    The increase in the prices of thermal and electrical power  and the rental of spaces, and the high taxes and credit rates,  led to a situation in which, out of 41 enterprises in the  personal services sphere, almost one-third operated at a loss.  In order to survive, they engaged in commercial activity and  rented out their spaces.    The cost of paid services in our city during the past year  rose considerably. This is how the dynamics of the increase in  the payment for services looked for various types of them: the  cost of repairing a television set rose, as compared with 1992,  by a factor of 8; a refrigerator, a factor of 14; a watch, a  factor of 11; and furniture, also by a factor of 11. The  services involved in making custom-made clothing became  definitely inaccessible for many people. Whereas the cost of  making a woman's dress in January 1993 in our city was 4100  rubles, in December that cost was 39,778 rubles, and the cost of  making an overcoat was, respectively, 11,596 and 87,600 rubles.    The section "Foreign-Economic Activity" evokes interest.  Five  percent of the output produced by the city's enterprises was  used by the administration to satisfy citywide needs. This is  how the currency proceeds were distributed during the year that  elapsed. The city, jointly with the coal workers, purchased  medicines with a total value of $100,000. An additional $5000  was spent to purchase seven motor buses in Hamburg (West  Germany).    The city spent some of the funds on communications  equipment:  telex equipment, an information network for law-enforcement  agencies, and for equipment for a new telephone system with  20,000 numbers (a contract dealing with its construction has  been signed with the Italian Italtel company). A total of  $417,000 and 580,000 marks were spent for these purposes.    A machine to remove the asphalt surface of roads cost  $342,000. A $200,000 contract will make it possible to open at  the Novokuznetsk Bread Products Combine a shop for producing  vegetable oil.    We shall end this article with information about social  policy, with figures and facts pertaining to this section of the  work that was carried out in 1993.    The administration's Committee on Social Policy worked in  such basic areas as the execution of measures in the program  entitled "The Social Protection of the Population of the City of  Novokuznetsk in 1993"; the decentralization of pensions and  grants in aid in the city; and the creation of a system of  social assistance centers and structures carrying out the social  support of the population.    The committee expended a total of 915.2 million rubles  during  the year to execute the program entitled "The Social Protection  of the Population of the City of Kuznetsk in 1993." On what  items was this money spent? It was spent on the work performed  by the center for social assistance to the public; the  decentralization of the payment of pensions; meals for  schoolchildren; additional payments to children up to the age of  one year for food (milk kitchens); additional payments for  municipal services, radio, the payment of preferential trip  tickets to rest homes; the conducting of holiday celebrations;  the maintenance of the nursing care home and the social  hospital; and the maintenance of the orphanage.    More than 18,000 city dwellers received material assistance  last year: from retirees to children in single-parent homes. In  addition to direct material assistance, the system of welfare  payments is widespread: welfare payments for apartment rent and  services, for medical treatment and rest, to purchase fuel in  the private sector, and to pay for radio services.    In 1993 the city opened institutions for the rendering of  emergency social assistance. Those institutions include a social  shelter for children from 3 to 14 years of age who need shelter  before being returned to their family or being admitted at  children's institutions for permanent residence. Throughout the  year, more than 200 children were taken in at the shelter.    There appeared a social hotel for women, single mothers with  children, and refugees with children. The hotel accepted more  than 50 persons.    Social assistance centers appeared in the city's rayons  (effective 1 August 1993, they were put into a separate  structure). The "Telephone of Trust" social-psychological  telephone hot line was in operation. The need for that hot line  is attested to by the number of calls: more than 200 a month.    Only one item in the city's social program remained  unfulfilled: because of a lack of nonbudgetary funds, retirees  from budget-financed and eliminated organizations did not  receive their lump-sum grant in aid.</p>

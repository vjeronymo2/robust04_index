			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Schlesinger sceptical of Bonn deal on finances THE solidarity pact agreed last weekend between the German government and opposition parties was a helpful but less than ideal compromise, according to Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank. The deal had removed uncertainties from financial markets and would help correct imbalances in the lop-sided mix of monetary and finance policies, he said in Berlin yesterday. It would reduce budget deficits to around 2 per cent of gross national product by 1996, compared with more than 4 per cent this year, and 0.5 per cent before unification. But the reduction would be achieved mostly though increased taxes and welfare contributions, he told the American Chamber of Commerce. At the same time new public borrowing demands implied in the pact were only 'temporarily tolerable', he warned. The Bundesbank repeatedly urged during the negotiations that deficits should be controlled through spending cuts and not via the easy route of tax rises. Mr Schlesinger chose his words carefully to avoid any danger of damaging the hard-won political compromise - and charges of political interference - but he did not try to conceal his scepticism. All in all, it was to be hoped that the advantages of the budget consolidation plan outweighed the possible disadvantageous effects of the tax increases, he said. Local authority spending had to be reined in, especially since firm spending cuts had not yet been identified. Mr Schlesinger, who had been unable to make his feelings known before for fear of disturbing markets in advance of the bank's council meeting on Thursday, said the package was not the ideal way to encourage growth. 'Public sector demands on financial markets of the size proposed are tolerable only temporarily if monetary policy is not to be over-burdened and private productive investment is not to be hampered,' he said. Postponement of the key element in the solidarity pact until 1995 was 'not exactly ideal'. He was referring to the introduction of a 7.5 per cent income tax surcharge which will take effect in January 1995. He made plain that the deal had little influence on the decision on Thursday to lower the official discount rate from 8 to 7.5 per cent. This had been made on the basis of flattening money supply growth, moderate wage increases and prospects of slackening inflation, he said.</p>

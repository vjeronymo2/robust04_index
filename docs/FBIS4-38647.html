			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondent Aleksey Trotsenko -- TASS] </F>   [Text] Kiev June 1 TASS -- A news conference of presidents  Leonid Kravchuk and Suleyman Demirel focused today on important  aspects of Ukrainian-Turkish relations and some preliminary  results of the Ukrainian official visit of the Turkish president.    Kravchuk told the news conference they consider the official  Ukrainian visit of the Turkish president to be an important step  in the development of bilateral relations and a significant  event with a positive influence on the whole Black Sea region.    Ukraine attaches great importance to its relations with the  Turkish Republic and is striving to build bilateral relations on  the basis of principles of mutual respect, equality and  good-neighbourliness. The political guideline for the two  states is the treaty on friendship and cooperation signed at a  summit meeting in 1992, said the Ukrainian president.    The recent meetings and negotiations held with participation  of Ukrainian and Turkish high-ranking officials focused on  deepening of the bilateral relations, primarily in the economic  sphere. Both sides noted that the goods turnover has  considerably increased over the past years. At the same time,  it does not correspond to the Ukrainian and Turkish abilities  and needs.    Cooperation with the Turkish Republic is a Ukrainian  priority, said Kravchuk. Ukraine is interested in the Turkish  experience of democratic transformations and building of a  market economy.    The Ukrainian president stressed that the meetings discussed  a broad range of international issues, including the state and  prospects for Black Sea economic cooperation and ways to settle  conflicts in the Balkans and the Transcaucasia. The sides noted  that consolidation of stability and security in the Black Sea  region corresponds to their national interests, regional and  European interests, and agreed to coordinate efforts in creation  of an atmosphere of confidence and cooperation in the region.    Mutual striving for expanded cooperation is registered in  the  joint communique and other documents signed during the official  Ukrainian visit of the Turkish president. Kravchuk expressed  the assurance the visit will give a fresh impetus to the  relations of Ukraine and Turkey.    In his turn, the Turkish president said that the republic  attaches major importance to its relations with Ukraine, bearing  in mind the two states are the largest ones in the region. They  feel responsible for peace and friendship in the region, he said.    Turkey also attaches great importance to the preservation of  Ukrainian territorial integrity and peace within the framework  of the United Nations and CSCE. Proclamation of Ukrainian  independence has boosted the development of Ukrainian-Turkish  relations, he said.    The president is sure that his visit will boost cooperation.  The Ukrainian-Turkish goods turnover exceeds 500 million U.S.  dollars, and they hope to make it one billion. Ukrainian and  Turkish businessmen are forming a cooperation union and have  started to look for new ways in economy and trade.    The president is convinced that new possibilities for the  expansion of mutually beneficial relations will be created.    The presidents answered numerous questions of  correspondents.</p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Not the way to do it: Military intervention in civil wars is unlikely to procure peace It is beginning to look as though the war in Bosnia will go on for a considerable while, and there is not much the outside world can do about it. The Bosnian Serbs have turned down the latest international peace plan, even though it would give them a disproportionate share of the territory of Bosnia. But evidently they think they are in a position to keep, by military force, much more than they are being offered at the negotiating table; and it seems unlikely that they will be deterred by the threats of the outside world to tighten sanctions on Serbia. Three weeks ago, the members of the Contact Group (the US, UK, France, Germany and Russia) apparently hoped they could shove through the new peace plan, which would divide Bosnia in almost equal halves between the Serbs and their Moslem and Croat adversaries. But any bravado quickly evaporated when the plan was turned down by the Bosnian Serbs, and Saturday's meeting of the Contact Group was a pretty limp affair. At American insistence, the final communique included a half-hearted threat that the international community might lift the arms embargo on the Moslems. But everybody knows that the UK, France and Russia are deeply opposed to such a move; the UK and France because it would aggravate the war, without necessarily bringing peace closer, Russia because of its historic links with the Serbs. Britain and France warn that a wider war would force the withdrawal of their troops from the UN force, and thus the abandonment of their vital humanitarian and peacekeeping mission. The trouble is that the credibility of the UN peacekeeping role in Bosnia already looks to be in jeopardy. The legitimacy of the UK and French military presence in Bosnia received a sharp and unexpected blow from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, when he openly called for the withdrawal of the UN troops, on the grounds that they were insufficient for the task. His remark was quickly followed by a Serb attack on a British UN convoy, killing one soldier and wounding another; evidently the Serbs have been encouraged to think they may be able to drive the UN out, so that they can get on with their conquest of Bosnia without interference from the outside world. All in all, we have come a long way from the intoxicating optimism of five years ago, that the fall of the Berlin wall would lead to the establishment of a new international order. The Gulf war looked like a spectacular harbinger of a new era of international governance under the auspices of a revitalised UN; and it spawned a new self-confident doctrine that the international community had a 'right of intervention' in countries that were behaving badly. But though the UN has indeed expanded its peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts, the balance sheet between success and failure is so far pretty dismal, and those early hopes have shrivelled. Civil wars have been erupting on a far bigger scale than the capability of the UN and the international community to deal with them. There seems no end to the scenes of carnage and brutality which we see daily on our TV screens, from Somalia, Bosnia, Cambodia, Haiti and Rwanda. Conscience cries out to denounce the UN, or the Americans, or the European Union, or the UK government, for not putting a stop to the suffering and the wickedness. But it is not rational to give way to the temptation to be indignant with the great powers for failing to bring in the brave new post-cold-war world. The nightly television images show us with heart-rending immediacy the irresistible need for us to help; but the TV bulletins do not tell us what to do to stop the killing. The mere invocation of the doctrine of the 'right of intervention' does not provide any method, let alone an easy or reliable one, of stopping a civil war before the warring parties are ready to make peace. There has been a peaceful transfer of power in South Africa, because the whites finally saw this was their least bad option; the Israelis have done a deal with the Palestine Liberation Organisation, because they finally saw this was their least bad option. Outside pressure and persuasion may help, but peace is made inside. The second hard reality is that, while television images may generate enormous emotional and moral demands that 'something must be done', it is not necessarily in the interest of any national government, or even of the international community as a whole, to do it. Humanitarian aid justifies itself, and many governments can be bounced into supplying it. But sending a military intervention to stop the violence, in which the risk of our soldiers being killed is much higher than the probability of stopping the fighting, is an entirely different thing. Many people criticise the EU for failing to stop the war in former Yugoslavia; and some even identify a precise moment two years ago when they believe the war could probably have been stopped with minimal use of military force. The problem arises with the word 'probably'. For if minimal force had failed to bring off a quick and easy miracle, should governments have accepted an open-ended commitment to impose a 'settlement' with unlimited forces for an indeterminate period? The question answers itself. The heart of the matter is that only those at war can make peace; only they can know the terms that will make a durable peace, and even they may be deeply mistaken; and there is no logical reason to suppose that large-scale military intervention from outside will provide the key to that peace, unless that intervention is intended to be permanent.</p>

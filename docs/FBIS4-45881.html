			<p>BFN     [Text] The Agriculture Ministry has declared the entire  north contaminated with hoof-and-mouth disease after cattle were  affected in the Lower Galilee as well. All the cattle herds in  the region will now be inoculated, and restrictions will be  imposed on moving herds. The northern settlements are called  upon not to allow entry of unsupervised farming vehicles.    Our correspondent Shulamit Schmerling reports that the  disease broke out in Judaea and Samaria, and spread from there  to Arab settlements in the north. Dozens of cattle have died so  far.</p>

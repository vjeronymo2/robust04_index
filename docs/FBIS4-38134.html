			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article By Salah al-'Abd and Nabil al-Wadi] </F>   [Excerpt] The Doctors Union has issued new instructions  fixing the charges of medical examinations in private clinics.  These instructions urge all doctors to comply with the new  charges, which range from 50 to 100 dinars for a specialized  doctor and from 25 to 50 dinars for a practitioner.    Dr. Nayif al-Hassuni, head of the Doctors Union, said that  these measures by the union came at the instructions of the  Council of Ministers to ease the burdens of the citizens.    The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH has followed the issue of  charges  for medical examinations in private clinics and noticed that  these charges rose in conflict with the citizens' standard of  living, especially for employees with low incomes. In a number  of cases, these charges exceeded 500 dinars, when it used to be  only 10 dinars. The paper also noticed that the rise in the  charges is due to imposing additional charges, including charges  for testing blood pressure, diabetes, and cardiography.  [passage omitted]</p>

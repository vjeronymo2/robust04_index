			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> MARYLAND IS LETTING WADE TWIST IN THE WIND  </P> <P> It's not heaven, hell or purgatory. The status is limbo, which is where  Maryland basketball coach Bob Wade is right now.  </P> <P> It doesn't make for a pretty picture. He's left swinging in the breeze. When is  all the torment going to end? The unfortunate thing is it didn't have to be  handled this way. After all, the discussion is about a basketball coach at the  University of Maryland and not a common criminal.  </P> <P> Are Wade's days numbered? If so, Athletic Director Lew Perkins doesn't want to  be the one to fire him because then the university would be obligated to pay  the two remaining years on his contract.  </P> <P> Wade may not have been thrown to the wolves, but certainly there's no evidence  of anyone in an official capacity running to his rescue to drive the hungry  pack away.  </P> <P> There has yet to be even a mild vote of confidence from those in command.  Perkins hasn't come to Wade's defense. The current investigation by the  National Collegiate Athletic Association, if any wrongdoing is found, will give  the university just reason to terminate his services and tell Wade to clean out  his desk.  </P> <P> If it happens that way, Maryland gets off the hook for any unfulfilled salary  obligation because Wade will have violated the basic rules of his employment.  So the NCAA, a responsible organization that does a commendable job under  difficult circumstances, would ostensibly be doing the dirty work for Perkins.  </P> <P> Perkins could step aside and say he had nothing to do with firing Wade and be  literally correct, but the record also would show he never came to his aid. He  just let him dangle.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the new university president, Dr. William Kirwan, hasn't done  anything to clarify the matter. This is terribly disappointing. Kirwan ought to  be exerting more leadership, unless he's trying to act the part of a wimp. What  he is doing, inadvertently, is helping Perkins turn Wade into a martyr.  </P> <P> The day he got the job, Kirwan should have moved to the fore, and as one of his  first official acts of business, he should have told Wade and Perkins he wanted  to see them. It was urgent, a top priority. He could have informed them in  graphic terms that what's happening isn't in the best interests of the school.  </P> <P> He could have said that Perkins and Wade should immediately resolve any  personal problems, if indeed any existed between them, and either admit, or  deny, publicly that rules had been broken in regard to recruiting. But Kirwan  has been mute. Is this the way for the chief executive officer of a state's  most important educational institution to operate? He ought to be out front  clearing the issues.  </P> <P> There are worse things than firing the basketball coach, even if his name is  Bob Wade. Kirwan was in lock step formation with chancellor John Slaughter when  Wade was hired from Dunbar High School in Baltimore.  </P> <P> Some members of Maryland's faculty, the black membership, came out with a  statement in support of Wade. That was most unusual. It sounded as if it were  becoming a black-white issue. Kirwan is the one who should have asserted  himself, but he elected not to get involved.  </P> <P> Around the country, sportswriters are telling each other they hear Wade is  going to get the gate. It wouldn't be surprising if the coach has heard similar  conjecture himself. Maryland said two months ago it was initiating its own  investigation of reports that assistant coaches, serving under Wade, had  transported former player Rudy Archer to classes at a junior college. Because  Archer, sitting out the year for failing to meet academic requirements, still  has eligibility remaining, he is considered a recruitable athlete by NCAA  rules. Therefore, providing free transportation for him violates NCAA rules.  </P> <P> That was on Feb. 20. By now, you would expect Wade to be either indicted or  acquitted. But no verdict has been handed down. Then on March 13, another  announcement was made that an NCAA investigating team was looking into any  possible improprieties. More cloak and dagger.  </P> <P> Steve Hood, who transferred from Maryland to James Madison University, was  quoted as saying he had been interviewed by NCAA investigators and said he  believed, from his own assessment of how certain questions were asked, that the  NCAA may have found more than expected. That leaves open the question of  whether the investigation is broadening.  </P></p>

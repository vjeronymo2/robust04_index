			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Smoothing a bumpy journey Anyone used to driving along bumpy country roads could be grateful for an infra-red device which monitors steering and vibration and adjusts the car's suspension to compensate. Developed by the independent design consultancy Sira for Renault, the French car maker, the device measures the distance the wheel is turned and the speed. It then instructs the car's management system to adjust the suspension accordingly. Because the mechanism uses light it should last longer than mechanical measuring devices.

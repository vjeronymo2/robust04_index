Meanwhile, the National Assembly adopted a constitutional  reform measure creating a Senate and canceling the law  preventing a candidate who lost an election from entering the  government for a period of 18 months after the election, it was  learned from a parliamentary source.    In a brief televised statement, Mr. Oye-Mba described the  government's resignation as "natural" because "we are entering a  new political era," referring to the results of the 5 December  presidential elections which saw the victory of the head of  state.    Under the Constitution, the government must resign after the  swearing-in of the head of state.    Also today, President Bongo made known "his intention to  form  a new government very quickly and to call on all qualified  people without any political considerations."    In an appeal to both the majority party and the opposition,  read by his spokesman, Jean Ovono-Essano, the head of state  urged political leaders to come together and draw up a one-year  "priority action program."    At the same time, the National Assembly, which has been  meeting in extraordinary session for one month now, passed a  constitutional reform bill presented by the government "to  reflect the evolution in the political situation.'    Out of 120 deputies, 117 took part in the voting, with 80  voting in favor, 36 against, and one abstaining. According to  an opposition parliamentarian, seven opposition deputies voted  in favor of the bill despite their parties' opposition to this  reform.    In addition to creating the Senate, the reform cancels the  measure disqualifying candidates defeated in an election from  entering government for 18 months after the election. This  measure particularly applied to opposition candidates in the  December presidential elections, which resulted in the  reelection of President Bongo and were contested by the  opposition.</p>

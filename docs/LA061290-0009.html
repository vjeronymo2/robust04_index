			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> OIL RECYCLING BILL CALLS FOR DEPOSIT OF 5 CENTS A QUART  </P> <P> California motorists who change their own oil will have more legal places to  dump the used black goo if legislation approved Monday in the Assembly becomes  law.  </P> <P> The measure, by Assemblyman Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto), would slap a  nickel-a-quart surcharge on the sale of new motor oil and use the proceeds to  entice service stations and oil-change specialists to accept used oil from the  general public.  </P> <P> "People want to do the right thing," Sher said. "But they don't have a way to  conveniently or even feasibly dispose of their oil."  </P> <P> The state's motorists generated 137 million gallons of used oil in 1988. But  only 46% of that was recycled, according to a state study.  </P> <P> The problem, Sher said, is that the study shows 60% of car owners change their  own oil and only 5% of them properly dispose of the used oil.  </P> <P> The rest dump it into storm drains, stick it in their back yard, leave it  alongside country roads or throw it in the household trash, which goes to a  landfill.  </P> <P> Attempts to require every business that sells motor oil to accept used oil have  failed because of opposition from retailers unwilling to handle used oil from  the public. Sher's bill is different because it relies on a financial incentive  rather than a government mandate to get the service station and oil-change  shops into the oil-collection business.  </P> <P> Here's how it would work:  </P> <P> Oil manufacturers would have to pay five cents a quart, or 20 cents a gallon,  into a state fund as a deposit on lubricating or industrial oil sold to dealers  for resale in California.  </P> <P> The surcharge is expected to be passed along to retail customers.  Do-it-yourselfers who change their own oil could get their money back by taking  their used oil to a state-certified oil-collection center.  </P> <P> Motorists who took their car to a service station or oil-change center would  not get the refund. Instead, the company that changed the oil would get the  money in return for agreeing to accept used oil from the public. The refunds  are expected to generate several hundred dollars a month for the businesses.  </P> <P> "People aren't going to recycle their oil for the nickel, but the nickel is  needed to provide the incentive to these companies to act as a collection point  not only for their customers but for the general public," Sher said. "Some of  these companies have to pay to have the oil hauled away."  </P> <P> Any money paid into the state fund through deposits but not refunded to  customers or the companies that change oil would be used to promote recycling.  </P> <P> The bill would allow big industrial users, including trucking companies that  service their own vehicles, to recoup the deposit without opening their oil  storage facilities to the public.  </P> <P> Still, the trucking industry opposes the bill, which passed the Assembly and  was sent to the Senate on a bipartisan 50-18 vote. The measure is supported by  Pennzoil, the giant oil company that recently purchased controlling interest in  Jiffy Lube International, the franchiser of auto service stores.  </P> <P> Many Republicans who usually oppose government intervention in business and  industry voted for the bill.  </P> <P> "The government has created the need to dispose of oil in special ways, yet  we've made no provision to make disposal spots available to the people," said  Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale). "We've made criminals out of normal people  who are trying to maintain their cars. I want to make it as easy as possible  for them to dispose of this stuff."  </P></p>

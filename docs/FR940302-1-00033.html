			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following proposed modification of the Charlotte Class B airspace area reflects public comments and user group inputs: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Area A. That airspace extending upward from the surface to and including 10,000 feet MSL within a 7-mile radius of the Charlotte VOR/DME. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airspace is necessary to contain large turbine-powered aircraft within the Class B airspace area, while operating to and from the primary airport, and allow for ingress/egress to secondary airports. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Area B. That airspace extending upward from 1,800 feet MSL to and including 10,000 feet MSL between the 7- and 11-mile radius of the Charlotte VOR/DME, excluding that airspace within a 2-mile radius of the Gastonia Airport. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airspace is required for vectoring aircraft arriving at, and departing from, the primary airport. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Area C. That airspace extending upward from 3,600 feet MSL to and including 10,000 feet MSL between the 11- and 25-mile radius of the Charlotte VOR/DME, including that airspace within a 2-mile radius of the Gastonia Airport, excluding that airspace within and below Areas D, E, and F hereinafter described. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airspace configuration would provide an area to contain aircraft during climb and descent transition maneuvers between the terminal and enroute structures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Area D. That airspace extending upward from 4,600 feet MSL to and including 10,000 feet MSL between the 20- and 25-mile radius northwest of the Charlotte VOR/DME, bounded on the west by U.S. Highway 321, and bounded on the east by the Marshall Steam Plant Rail Spur; and that airspace between the 20- and 25-mile radius southwest of the Charlotte VOR/DME, bounded on the east by U.S. Highway 21, and bounded on the west by a line due south from the Charlotte VOR/DME 218 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; radial 20-mile fix to the intersection of the 25-mile arc. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airspace is required to provide an area to contain aircraft using Charlotte/Douglas International Airport during profile descent. The proposed floor would allow sufficient airspace for VFR operations underneath the Class B airspace area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Area E. That airspace extending upward from 6,000 feet MSL to and including 10,000 feet MSL beginning at lat. 35 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;36 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;30 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; N., long. 80 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;57 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;45 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; W., extending counterclockwise on the 25-mile arc of the Charlotte VOR/DME to U.S. Highway 321, thence south on U.S. Highway 321 until intercepting the 20-mile arc southwest of the Charlotte VOR/DME, thence counterclockwise on the 20-mile arc to the 218 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; radial of the Charlotte VOR/DME, thence due south to the intersection of the 25-mile arc of the Charlotte VOR/DME, thence due west until intercepting the 218 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; radial of the Charlotte VOR/DME, thence southwest on the 218 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; radial to the 30-mile fix, thence clockwise on the 30-mile arc to the 328 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; radial of the Charlotte VOR/DME, thence direct to the point of beginning, excluding that airspace between the 20- and 30-mile radius of the Charlotte VOR/DME between the 242 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; radial of the Charlotte VOR/DME clockwise to the 293 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; radial; and that airspace beginning at lat. 35 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;36 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;30 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; N., long. 80 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;57 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;45 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; W., extending clockwise on the 25-mile arc of the Charlotte VOR/DME to long. 80 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;46 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;00 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; W., thence due south to the 20-mile arc northeast of the Charlotte VOR/DME, thence clockwise on the 20-mile arc to the 081 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; radial of the Charlotte VOR/DME, thence west along the 081 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; radial to the 11-mile fix from the Charlotte VOR/DME, thence direct to the Charlotte VOR/DME 147 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; radial 25-mile fix, thence clockwise on the 25-mile arc to the intersection of U.S. Highway 21, thence direct to the Charlotte VOR/DME 147 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; radial 30-mile fix, thence counterclockwise on the 30-mile arc to the Charlotte VOR/DME 025 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; radial, thence direct to the point of beginning, excluding that airspace east of U.S. Highway 601 between the Charlotte VOR/DME 062 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; radial clockwise to the 120 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; radial. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airspace is required to provide an area to contain aircraft descending into the Charlotte/Douglas International Airport. The proposed boundaries would allow sufficient airspace for VFR aircraft operations outside the Class B airspace area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Area F. That airspace extending upward from 8,000 feet MSL to and including 10,000 feet MSL between the 20- and 25-mile radius of the Charlotte VOR/DME from the 242 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; radial clockwise to the 293 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; radial of the Charlotte VOR/DME; and that airspace between the 20- and 25-mile radius from the Charlotte VOR/DME between the 062 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; radial of the Charlotte VOR/DME clockwise to the 120 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; radial and east of U.S. Highway 601. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airspace is necessary to provide descent profile for aircraft en route to Charlotte/Douglas International Airport and to allow sufficient airspace to VFR operations at area airports. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

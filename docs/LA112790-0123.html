			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN GIANTS GET MORE SAY OVER ENTERTAINMENT;  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS  </P> <P> The acquisitions by Sony Corp. and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of two of  Hollywood's crown jewels, Columbia Pictures and MCA, are likely to strengthen  Japan's hand in directing debates over key issues in entertainment.  </P> <P> While Sony and Matsushita are fierce competitors, they have a history of  working closely together when they have interests in common. Sony Chairman Akio  Morita and Matsushita founder Konosuke Matsushita, for example, jointly  authored a book in 1976 about the need for reform in Japan.  </P> <P> The two companies were key participants in a television export cartel organized  by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry in the 1960s. The cartel  enabled Japan to price its televisions high in Japan while undercutting U.S.  manufacturers.  </P> <P> And both companies worked together on a largely successful fight against the  unitary tax, which assured American states stable revenues from foreign  manufacturers but which Japanese companies considered unfair.  </P> <P> When Sony President Norio Ohga had dinner recently with Matsushita's president,  the two companies gave little importance to the meeting. "It is not unusual for  the two to meet," says Akira Nagano, a spokesman for Matsushita.  </P> <P> Further cooperation in the future should be expected. Take the introduction of  digital audio tape: U.S. recording artists and songwriters have opposed the  introduction of DAT recorders because they say the machines' ability to make  identical copies poses a potential threat to their copyrights.  </P> <P> While U.S. record companies have fought the trend by refusing to issue DAT  tapes, Sony is already using part of its CBS Records library to put out such  tapes in Japan to support sales of its recorders. A similar move by Matsushita  would put weight behind the Sony move.  </P> <P> While both companies want to dominate the market for extra-clear,  high-definition televisions, they are both in favor of speeding up the  introduction of HDTV standards in the United States. Japan regards HDTV as  critical to maintaining growth in the consumer electronics sector. The United  States has delayed the introduction of standards partly in an effort to give  U.S. companies an important role in the new market.  </P> <P> The consumer electronics giants could also influence trends in the  entertainment industry. Sony has already set up a lot at Columbia to  demonstrate its high-definition broadcast equipment and hopes eventually to  persuade producers to make use of the technology. Matsushita, while a  competitor to Sony in the broadcast equipment business, has a common interest  in seeing video technology take over from film.  </P> <P> But the greatest fear of those familiar with Japan is that the two companies,  both acutely conscious of the importance of maintaining a good image of Japan,  will use their power to suppress unfavorable footage. Matsushita officials have  denied that they intend to influence the content of MCA films and television  programs.  </P> <P> However, if a Matsushita-owned studio were shooting "The Last Emperor" and  wanted to show footage of the Rape of Nanking, says John Stern, senior  representative of the Japan office of the American Electronics Assn., the scene  might be toned down to assuage domestic criticism.  </P> <P> Japanese distributors of that film did try to edit out the section when they  first introduced the film to their Japanese audiences. Only strenuous  objections from the director prevented them from doing so. "It's naive to  assume there won't be some form of self-censorship," says Stern. "There is a  Japanese saying, 'If it smells, cover it up.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> 10 LARGEST JAPANESE ACQUISITIONS  </P> <P> The proposed $6.13-billion purchase of MCA by Matsushita is the biggest  takeover ever of a U.S. company by a Japanese group. The following are the 10  previous largest Japanese acquisitions and investments in U.S. companies since  1987:  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.87IN:4.20IN:2.22IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Price  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Acquirer  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Target  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> (billions)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Sony Corp.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Columbia Pictures  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $3.4  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Bridgestone Corp.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $2.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Seibu/Saison Group  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Intercontinental Hotel Corp.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $2.15  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Sony Corp.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> CBS Records  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $2.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Aoki Corp., Bass Group  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Westin Hotels &amp; Resorts  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $1.53  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> CIT Group*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $1.28  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Nippon Mining Co.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Gould Inc.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $1.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Mitsubishi Corp.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Aristech Chemical Corp.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $0.873  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Paloma Co.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Rheem Manufacturing**  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $0.850  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Mitsubishi Estate Co.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Rockefeller Group Inc.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $0.846  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> *Parent company of CIT was Manufacturers Hanover  </P> <P> **Parent company of Rheem was Pace Industries Inc.  </P> <P> Source: Assoicated Press  </P></p>

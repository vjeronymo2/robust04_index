			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> A New 'Today': With little hoopla, lots of smiles and Willard Scott joking  about the bald pate of Joe Garagiola, NBC's "Today" show on Monday began what  it hopes will prove a fresh start after nearly a year of woe.  </P> <P> Although heavily promoted by NBC during the weekend, the new-look "Today" was  oddly low-key as Bryant Gumbel and co-anchor Deborah Norville welcomed  Garagiola, the show's co-host from 1969 to 1973 and now its second co-anchor.  There were no speeches, no recap by anchor Gumbel of the problems that led to  Jane Pauley's departure in December, no on-air hugging by Norville. Last  December, Norville embraced Pauley after Pauley wished her well when Pauley  left the show. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

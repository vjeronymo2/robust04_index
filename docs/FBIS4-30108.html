			<p>BFN     [Text] Filipino farmers are asking the Philippine Senate  not to ratify the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or  GATT, which government representatives signed in Marrakech,  Morocco recently. The farmers said the agreement would deepen  rural poverty, hunger, and joblessness. The farmers spoke  during a hearing yesterday at the Senate on GATT.    Senator Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, chairperson of the  committees on trade and commerce, said her committees will hold  judgment on GATT until all sectors are heard. She said the  Senate set October as the deadline for acting on GATT to enable  the Philippines to catch up with the implementation of the  accord.</p>

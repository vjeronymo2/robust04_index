			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OUTLOOK DIM FOR SUPERFUND LISTING OF LAB  </P> <P> A U.S. Environmental Protection official said Friday that Rockwell  International's Santa Susana Field Laboratory is unlikely to get Superfund  status because risks at the site are too minor for it to qualify for the  federal toxic cleanup list.  </P> <P> A 1987 assessment by an EPA contractor found that the laboratory west of  Chatsworth did not rank high enough in terms of environmental hazards to  qualify for the Superfund list, which includes about 900 sites nationwide.  </P> <P> EPA inspectors toured the site Thursday in response to pressure from Rep. Elton  Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) and allegations that the initial assessment did not  take into account all pollutants at the site, including radioactive  contamination.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inclusion Doubtful  </P> <P> But at a news conference in Burbank late Friday, Richard Vaille, assistant  chief of waste programs for the EPA's San Francisco regional office, said he  doubts that the site will qualify for Superfund listing.  </P> <P> He characterized chemical and radioactive contamination at Santa Susana as "low  residues" and said there is little chance of public exposure.  </P> <P> Vaille said, however, that the EPA established a working group of several  health and environmental agencies to coordinate monitoring and cleanup of the  site. The agencies include the state Department of Health Services, the Los  Angeles office of the Regional Water Quality Board and the U.S. Department of  Energy, which contracts with Rockwell for nuclear and other energy work on a  290-acre swath of the 2,668-acre Santa Susana site.  </P> <P> Vaille made his remarks after a nearly daylong organizational meeting of the  group at the Department of Health Services' office in Burbank. He said the  group will hold a public meeting soon to answer questions from concerned  citizens.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Pollution  </P> <P> Santa Susana has long been on the state Superfund cleanup list, but not due to  the contamination that has recently been the subject of wide public concern.  The state Superfund listing is due to chemical-solvent contamination of ground  water beneath an area of the site where rocket engines are tested. Levels of  trichloroethylene (TCE) in ground water there are up to 11,000 parts per  billion, a far higher pollution reading than any found on the Department of  Energy portion of the site.  </P> <P> Over more than three decades, Rockwell's work on the site for the Department of  Energy and its predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission, has included work  with 16 nuclear reactors -- none operating now -- and the recycling of nuclear  fuel.  </P> <P> A recent Department of Energy report indicated that generally low-level  chemical and radioactive contamination exists in several areas of the  Department of Energy portion of the site, but said the pollution poses no  immediate health threat. The department called for better ground-water  monitoring at the site, and Rockwell has said it will drill 18 more monitoring  wells.  </P></p>

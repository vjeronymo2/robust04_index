			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / US machine tool makers stage revival: The industry is making a resolute attempt to turn itself round On either side of the Atlantic, investing in machine tool producers is not what it used to be. In both the US and the UK, the ravages of Japanese and continental European competition have left fewer companies to choose from. Yet, after having been written off five years ago as a sector sinking without trace, the US machine tool industry is making a determined attempt to turn itself round. The turnround has been led by two companies with totally different product strategies, the NYSE-quoted Cincinnati Milacron and the over-the-counter stock, Giddings &amp; Lewis. Milacron, which also has a successful plastics machinery business, has restored its reputation as a world class producer of standard machine tools, while G &amp; L, helped by the 1991 acquisition of Cross &amp; Trecker, has been transformed into the industry's most broadly based machine tool and factory automation group. Mr Eli Lustgarten at PaineWebber says: 'There has been a lot of action in these stocks in the past year. Both have been terrific stocks.' Milacron's shares rose from about Dollars 9 at the end of 1991 to a high of Dollars 29 5/8 this year, before slipping recently to close at Dollars 24 on Tuesday. G &amp; L had seen its stock climb from about Dollars 11 to a high of nearly Dollars 30 this year before it dropped sharply to Dollars 20 1/2 in late April after the shock resignation of Mr William Fife, the chairman and chief executive who masterminded its turnround strategy. The shares have since recovered to close at Dollars 23 on Tuesday, but their setback spoilt an upturn which has seen both companies, and especially Milacron, outperforming the Dow Industrial Average so far this year. Mr Lustgarten points out that industrial stocks have been rising in the past six months. There has been strong interest in cyclical companies which can benefit from industrial recovery, but there is also a sectoral argument for investing in machine tool companies. 'There is no doubt that the outlook for the US machine tool industry is much more favourable now. The products are much more competitive, there has been restructuring and consolidation, and the currency situation is favourable,' he says. But is the optimism misplaced, or at any rate premature? In May last year, Value Line forecast that net profits for the six companies which then formed its machine tool industry sector would be Dollars 65m in 1992, and Dollars 95m this year. In the event, profits last year were just Dollars 24.2m and the forecast for this year is Dollars 85m. The latest figures exclude Brown &amp; Sharpe, which is no longer in the machine tool business. But two of the smaller prod-ucers, Gleason and Monarch, made losses last year after restructuring and closure charges. Even last May, machine tool companies were trading on price/earnings ratios of 20 to 30 at a time when the US industrial recovery was patchy at best. Mr Thomas Burns at County Natwest USA believes that the upturn in machine tool shares has not been premature. If you believe that the macro-economic situation will allow machine tool orders to recover, you invest to anticipate rather than wait for it to happen, he says. Mr Lustgarten, however, thinks the recent downturn in machine tool shares brings them 'back to reality' after rises based on judgments about profits that turned out to be excessive. PaineWebber downgraded Milacron from 'attractive' to 'neutral' on April 26 because of the price, while the fall at G &amp; L was 'a catalyst for something that was long overdue', he says. It looks as if both Milacron and, particularly, G &amp; L will have to work hard over the next two years to meet the more optimistic earnings forecasts. The recession in Europe and in the aerospace market are particular problems. The overall outlook, however, looks reasonably bright, especially at home. US machine tool orders were up 16 per cent in the first quarter of 1993, year-on-year, but producers are not sharing equally in the rise. Value Line thinks that most machine tool companies will report stronger earnings this year, and says that several stocks have significant recovery potential to 1996-98. Few would have thought that possible five years ago.</p>

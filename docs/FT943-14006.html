			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Spices Despite the holiday season, activity in the pepper market have been picking up lately, reports Man Producten. White pepper prices rose considerably during the week, mainly in the forward positions, because of the delayed harvest in Indonesia and a very tight spot position in Europe and the US. The spot price went to about USDollars 3,150 a tonne and July-August shipment was quoted at Dollars 3,050 cif. The more distant positions were somewhat discounted. Black pepper prices also developed a much firmer trend as soon as fresh buying interest appeared. All origins are now extremely reluctant to sell, as if the real statistical picture has become a lot clearer. Spot black pepper grade 1 was quoted at Dollars 1,900 a tonne and fair average quality at about Dollars 1,825, with very little supply available in Europe.</p>

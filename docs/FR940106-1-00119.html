			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Suisun Bay is the best known nursery habitat for reproduction and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> larval survival of splittail, but the habitat has been deleteriously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> altered by higher salinities in the spring. These higher salinities are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> caused by a large number of freshwater diversions that allow seawater to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intrude farther upstream. At present, there are relatively few periods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when freshwater outflow volumes through the Delta and Suisun Bay of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significance are mandated for wildlife or fisheries. State and Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies had planned to increase 1991 and 1992 water supplies for out-of-stream uses at the expense of environmental protection of estuarine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fish and wildlife resources in the fifth and potentially sixth years of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drought (Morat 1991). Because of significantly higher than normal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> precipitation and subsequent higher instream flows after March 1991, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agency request for relaxation of Delta water quality standards was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> withdrawn. Should a California drought return, water quality relaxation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action likely will be requested again to favor out-of-stream water use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over the need to protect aquatic habitats for fish and wildlife.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Present regulatory processes do not ensure that water inflows to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Suisun Bay and the western Estuary will be adequate to maintain the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entrapment zone near or in Suisun Bay to benefit splittail. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California State Water Resources Control Board (Board) has the authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to condition or require changes in the amount of water inflow and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of water exported or diverted from the Delta. In testimony given  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before the Board's Water Quality/Water Rights Hearings in 1987, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service biologist expressed concern for several Delta species including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> splittail (Lorentzen 1987). The Board did not take regulatory or legal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action to protect this fish or its habitat during the four following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years. On May 1, 1991, the Board adopted the Water Quality Control Plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for Salinity for the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Estuary (1991 Bay/Delta Plan). On September 3, 1991, under provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Clean Water Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disapproved certain water quality standards for the Board's failure to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopt criteria to protect estuarine habitat. In 1993, EPA began the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process of formulating replacement standards for those portions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1991 Bay/Delta Plan that were disapproved. In January 1992, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Governor of California announced a new water policy that included a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directive to the Board to establish ``interim measures'' to reverse the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decline of fishes in the Bay and Delta. Accordingly, the Board released  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an interim water quality plan (Draft Decision 1630) in December 1992  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that immediately was suspended by the Governor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's proposed rule to promulgate Water Quality Standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Surface Waters of the Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, and San  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Francisco Bay and Delta is published in this same  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separate part; however, enforcement of these standards may be difficult. The Service is aware that the salinity standards currently in effect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Water Right Decision 1485) are inconsistently implemented and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequently violated. Institutional guarantees of compliance have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lacking in the past and are needed in the future before existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mechanisms can contribute to the protection of this species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service currently is analyzing the potential effects on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> splittail and other fish and wildlife resources in California as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of recent enactment of the Central Valley Project Improvement Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Pub. L. 102&hyph;575). Two of the stated purposes of this act are to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Protect, restore, and enhance fish, wildlife, and associated habitats  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Central Valley and Trinity River basins of California'' and ``to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contribute to the State of California's interim and long-term efforts to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protect the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3406(b)(2) dedicates 800,000 acre-feet of Central Valley Project  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water annually for various purposes, including the benefit of federally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed species. Although the Service is reasonably certain that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> splittail will realize some benefit from implementation of the Central  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Valley Project Improvement Act, the magnitude and timeliness of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protections may be inadequate to prevent further decline of splittail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Protective measures currently being implemented to benefit the delta  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smelt will beneficially affect the splittail by restricting pumping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under certain conditions. However, the ecological requirements of each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species differ, especially with respect to timing of important  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developmental stages and habitat use. Splittail need flooded lowland  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat for spawning and are particularly vulnerable to disturbance or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destruction of marshy habitat. Therefore, the protections afforded the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delta smelt, listed as threatened in 1993 under the Endangered Species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act, will not be sufficient to prevent further decline of the splittail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons stated above, the Service considers the existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory mechanisms inadequate to ensure the long-term existence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Sacramento splittail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

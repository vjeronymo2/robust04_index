			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Central Executive Bureau of the Social  Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR] held a meeting yesterday,  which was also attended by the PDSR parliamentary groups, during  which it adopted a declaration expressing the stance of that  party regarding the open letter addressed to President Ion  Iliescu by the leadership of the Greater Romania Party [PRM].    After answering in detail all the issues raised in the  letter, the declaration emphasizes that the PDSR has no other  choice but take note of the fact that the PRM decided to suspend  negotiations with the government party, a decision that was made  by the PRM leadership, and therefore the responsibility for this  act, as well as its consequences, lies exclusively with the nine  members of the PRM Steering Committee. The declaration then  says, quote, as a matter of fact, given the tone of the PRM  leadership's letter, it is unlikely that we should find a basis  for further dialogue, unquote.    The declaration concludes by expressing the hope that the  members of the PRM will understand the stance of the PDSR as, in  the past, PDSR and PRM deputies and senators had identical or  similar positions regarding a number of draft bills. The  declaration reassures those parliamentarians, as well as the  other members of the PRM that the PDSR remains open to dialogue,  but solely if the leaders of the PRM will show proof of their  responsibility, of the fact that they are prepared to adopt  sensible stances, and that they are really preoccupied by the  real problems of the country in the current transition period.</p>

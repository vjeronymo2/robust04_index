			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAN AM COMES TO RESCUE OF ZOO'S EGGS;  </P> <P> AIRLINE STRIKE CLIPS CONDOR PROJECT'S WINGS  </P> <P> Bird curators depending on Eastern Airlines to fly rare Andean condor eggs to  Los Angeles had to scramble for alternatives because of the machinists' strike.  </P> <P> Eastern had been giving Miami's Metrozoo free tickets for an incubator and a  zookeeper since the start of a project a year ago to save the related  California condor from extinction. Only 28 of the huge California birds  survive, all in captivity.  </P> <P> Three eggs were sent. But when a fourth egg was laid on Monday, Eastern was not  flying to California, and other flights to the West Coast were heavily booked.  </P> <P> "It was a mess. We needed to get it out fast, the earlier the better," said  bird curator Ron Johnson. "As the embryo grows, there is more chance of damage  from movement."  </P> <P> Metrozoo's Ellen Unger spent most of Monday trying to get an airline to fly a  keeper with the one foot-high, cube-shaped incubator.  </P> <P> Only Pan Am would even discuss the zoo's plight, Unger said. The airline agreed  to give Metrozoo first-class tickets on an early morning flight today.  </P> <P> The 6.6-ounce egg should hatch in about six weeks. If the bird is a female, it  will be released on the cliffs in the Los Padres National Forest in about nine  months and monitored by radio transmitters.  </P> <P> "The idea is to find out about how Andean condors live before risking the  California birds," Johnson said. After several years, some of the California  condors will be released in areas the study indicated were safe.  </P></p>

			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls 1.2% as Hong Kong finishes lower Last minute selling by companies looking to boost profits depressed the Nikkei index, which fell 1.2 per cent, its third consecutive decline, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 index lost 242.15 to 19,554.11, having opened at a high of 19,794.36 and falling to a low of 19,543.41 just before the close. Arbitrage selling also weighed on prices while broad based corporate selling increased the bearishness. Fears of over-supply lingered in spite of weekend reports that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was likely to postpone its large-lot convertible bond issue scheduled for next month. Worries over the yen's further appreciation also prevailed and many investors fear that a breakdown of the bilateral trade talks between the US and Japan could create renewed turmoil on the currency markets. Volume remained almost flat at 258m shares against 250m. The Topix index of all first section stocks declined 14.53 to 1,561.68 and the Nikkei 300 lost 2.68 to 285.27. Declines led advances by 787 to 194, with 181 issues remaining unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index index rose 1.05 to 1,275.44. Toyota Motor, the day's most active issue, fell Y50 to Y1,960 on profit-taking by corporate investors and foreigners. Some electronics stocks were also sold on profit taking by companies - Oki Electric lost Y15 to Y750 while Toshiba declined Y7 to Y737. Seiyu, the supermarket chain, fell Y40 to Y1,350. Investors were discouraged by reports that the retailer's pre-tax profits were likely to decline by 59 per cent to Y3.1bn for the first six months to September. All sectors declined except for pharmaceutical companies. Takeda Chemical added Y20 to Y1,220 and Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical rose Y10 to Y1,930. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries gained Y6 to Y749 on reports of its likely delay in its convertible bond flotation. However, traders said that Matsushita Electric Industrial was still likely to issue some Y20bn in CBs next month. Speculators bought Hanwa, the steel trader, which gained Y16 to Y450. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 185.04 to 21,815.53 in volume of 66m shares. Nintendo, the video game company, fell Y310 to Y5,910. Roundup The region's markets saw a mostly depressed performance. Seoul and Taipei were closed for public holidays. HONG KONG finished 1.7 per cent lower on a round of late selling but trading was very quiet ahead of tomorrow's mid-autumn holiday. The Hang Seng Index fell 167.09 to 9,801.43 after hovering near 9,850 for most of the day, amid worries of further falls on Wall Street. Turnover was HKDollars 3.0bn against HKDollars 4.1bn on Friday. HSBC Holdings fell HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 89 and Hongkong Telecom eased 35 cents to HKDollars 15.65. Jardine Matheson closed HKDollars 2.50 lower at HKDollars 72 before announcing a 24.2 per cent jump on its interim profit, shortly after the market closed. Other shares of the Jardine group also fell, mainly on news of an imminent delisting from the Hong Kong market. Hongkong Land slipped 90 cents to HKDollars 19.85, Dairy Farm eased 35 to HKDollars 11.30 and Mandarin Oriental fell 50 to HKDollars 10.70. The H share index of mainland China stocks eased 43.34 or 2.9 per cent to 1,444.94. MANILA was weighed by profit-taking that left the composite index 6.17 lower at 2,936.21. Volume dropped to 2.4bn shares from 3.24bn. Megaworld Properties and Holdings was the top gainer, climbing 11 per cent to 12.75 pesos ahead of the announcement of a huge low-cost housing project that is expected to further strengthen earnings. The newly-listed Mondragon International Philippines fell 4.4 per cent to 6.50 pesos on profit-taking. SINGAPORE was worried about inflation and the future direction of US interest rates and the Straits Times Industrials index fell 25.33 or 1.1 per cent to 2,271.85. SHANGHAI's A share index fell 5.4 per cent at the close, mainly on news that the stock exchange authorities will crack down on brokerages which fail to settle their transactions, three times a month. The A index fell 55.22 points to 959.24, dropping below the key support level of 1,000 points on shrinking turnover of Yn3.8bn. Brokerages on the exchange are said to have run up Yn500m in deficits since August 1 when the market began surging. Shanghai's B share index edged up on a technical rebound after losses in the past three trading days. The index gained 0.61 to 82.94.

North Borneo Timber surged MDollars 1.10 to MDollars 14.40 before its suspension at mid-morning amid speculation that a Sabah state timber concession will be injected into it. SYDNEY was lower in listless trading, following on from Friday's fall on Wall Street, but buying support for some industrial and oil and gas stocks restricted the decline. The All Ordinaries Index closed 9.9 lower at 2,049.1. WELLINGTON staged a comeback though the day to wipe out most of its early losses and the NZSE-40 capital index closed 6.20 lower at 2,105.67, after an intraday low of 2,083.66. The leaders were mixed, with most interest in Fletcher, which finished up 1 cent at NZDollars 4.42. BOMBAY dipped in response to hectic profit booking, in both specified and cash group shares, by financial institutions. The BSE 30 share index fell 63.82 or 1.4 per cent to 4,553.79. KARACHI was clouded by uncertainty about a general strike called by the opposition for today and the KSE 100-share index fell 12.01 to 2,204.61.</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Lawyers report fees upturn The recession in the legal profession seems to have bottomed out, a survey of the top 100 solicitors' firms indicates. The survey by Legal Business magazine shows gross revenues rose to Pounds 2.8bn in 1993-94 from Pounds 2.7bn the previous year. Many partners said the first half of the year had proved as disappointing as 1992-3 but there had been a marked upturn in activity in the second half. 'There is an air of tentative optimism,' the survey says. The most reliable indicator of firms' financial health is fees earned per fee-earner, the magazine says. Linklaters &amp; Paines top this league table with Pounds 209,000 per fee-earner followed by Ashurst Morris Crisp and Freshfields (both Pounds 207,000), Allen &amp; Overy (Pounds 197,000) and Slaughter and May (Pounds 195,000). The table of profits per partner is topped by Allen &amp; Overy (Pounds 382,000), Slaughter &amp; May (Pounds 371,000), Linklaters (Pounds 350,000), Ashurst Morris Crisp (Pounds 298,000) and Freshfields (Pounds 295,000). The main factors affecting the financial health of firms were the type of clients, cuts made in the recent past and the extent of any disproportionate property costs. There were more partners on the job market last year than ever before. This was a product of some being 'shown the door' during the recession and successful partners being lured elsewhere.</p>

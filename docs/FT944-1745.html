			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Management: Pioneers and Prophets - Nicolo Machiavelli Amid the grey-suited pantheon of management greats, Nicolo Machiavelli (1469-1527) holds an unlikely, but undeniable, place. A Florentine diplomat and writer, his career was colourful - punctuated by interludes of indulgence in 'petty dissipations'. His abiding relevance to the world of management rests on a slim volume, The Prince. The Prince is the 16th-century equivalent of Dale Carnegie's How to Make Friends and Influence People. Embedded beneath details of Alexander VI's tribulations, lies a ready supply of aphorisms and insights which are as appropriate to many of today's managers and organisations as they were nearly 500 years ago. 'It is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good qualities I have enumerated, but it is very necessary to appear to have them,' Machiavelli advises, adding the suggestion that it is useful 'to be a great pretender and dissembler'. But The Prince goes beyond such helpful presentational hints. Like all the great books, it offers something for everyone. Take Machiavelli on managing change: 'There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things.' Or on sustaining motivation: 'He ought, above all things, to keep his men well-organised and drilled, to follow incessantly the chase.' Above all, Machiavelli is the champion of leadership through cunning and intrigue, the triumph of force over reason. An admirer of Borgia, Machiavelli had a dismal view of human nature. Empowerment was not in his vocabulary. Unfortunately history has repeatedly proved that a combination of being armed to the teeth and devious is more likely to allow you to achieve your objectives. It is all very well being good, says Machiavelli, but the leader 'should know how to enter into evil when necessity commands'. According to psychologist Robert Sharrock of consultants YSC: 'Like the leaders Machiavelli sought to defend, some executives tend to see themselves as the natural rulers in whose hands organisations can be entrusted. Theories abound on their motivation. Is it a defensive reaction against failure or a need for predictability through control? The effect of the power-driven Machiavellian manager is usually plain to see.' In companies addicted to internal politics, Machiavelli remains the stuff of day-to-day reality. But, warns Sharrock, Machiavellian management may have had its day. 'The gentle art of persuasion is finding fashion with managers. The ends no longer justify the means. There is a return to the age of reason against which Machiavelli rebelled.' For many the age of reason has yet to dawn. Managers may not have read The Prince but will be able to identify with Machiavelli's observation that 'a prince ought to have no other aim or thought, nor select anything else for his study, than war and its rules and discipline'. In the corporate trenches, Machiavelli remains useful Christmas reading.</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: The world after O&amp;Y Doubtless Olympia &amp; York will provoke more than a passing shudder in the banking and property sectors by seeking protection from its creditors. But, in practice, its situation will be no worse than it was before. It might even be better, since protection would clear the way for an orderly work-out. Otherwise the process could become dangerously bogged down in sniping between groups of lenders to one or other arm of the Reichmann empire. If creditors are now wondering what their security was ever really worth, at least they can be reasonably assured of equal pain. If bank lenders have tacitly agreed to the plan, it also seems safe to assume that they have decided the pain will be bearable. There is certainly no systemic risk. Mexico had eight times as much debt as O&amp;Y when it defaulted in 1982, even before inflating the figure to today's values. O&amp;Y also has assets, which must be worth more than a Mexican promise to repay appeared to its shocked bankers 10 years ago. Still, O&amp;Y's banks face a protracted and complex restructuring with heavy bills for write-downs and unpaid interest. That much is probably already reflected in bank share prices. The main danger now is that the O&amp;Y debacle could worsen the troubles confronting the rest of the property market. In this broader context, the protection that O&amp;Y is seeking from its creditors may afford the latter some protection too.</p>

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Survey: FT Traveller, Dubai (13) - Travellers almost spoiled for choice / Hotels / Vying for custom in an already highly competitive sector produces some innovative marketing and bizarre promotions Dubai is in the middle of a hotel construction boom. Five luxury hotels, bringing a further 2,000 rooms on stream, are under construction with scheduled openings from next month to the end of 1993. This is quite apart from plans for 37 two-star hotels and a proposal to build two extensive tourist villages, each with full recreational facilities. Travellers are already almost spoiled for choice with more than 8,500 existing rooms in four- and five-star hotels, and a present total of 173 hotels. Standards are generally very high and the service is excellent. Vying for custom in an already highly competitive sector produces some innovative marketing. Promotions occasionally verge on the bizarre - such as the Sheraton's plan to stage speed-boat racing up and down the Creek in central Dubai. In addition to a non-stop round of specialty food promotions, theatrical productions, international bands, entertainers and exhibitions, the hotels are also active in sponsoring and staging a host of sporting events. They also serve as 'community centres' and are meeting-places for business, evenings out, or just a coffee between friends, fulfilling a role rarely played to the same extent in other societies. Architectural students may also find the lobbies useful for a study of building design and interpretation. The foyers, encompassing every imaginable style from baroque, through Arabesque to art deco, or a pastiche of several unlikely combinations, can be both awesome and entertaining. Even allowing for widely divergent tastes, visitors cannot but admire the ingenuity and often audacity of the architects who have been given free rein with their creative talents. The Sheraton has clearly set out to impress. Triangular in shape to afford views over the Creek, its futuristic atrium is seven storeys high - the levels cordoned off with railings, in changing colours to break the starkness. Mainly open plan, there is no cosiness or privacy. A fountain arrangement is cleverly executed. It starts with a gentle trickle and descends through three floors and two waterfalls to end in a torrent. The Ramada hotel makes a bold statement with its balconied foyer. One wall of the atrium is composed of a 13-storey stained glass window - the tallest such feature in the world at 135 feet high. In the Mogul style it incorporates 28 species of flowers and shrubs in graduated colours and requires 300 fluorescent tubes for illumination. On the opposite wall are external cable-car lifts which descend into the coffee shop and ascend at speed to afford a view of the glass mural. Oozing opulence, the Royal Abjar Hotel is preparing its lobby for opening in October. The pink marble floor uses geometric shapes, repeated throughout the hotel, and is overlooked by a series of walkways and hanging gardens to balance the sheer size of the foyer. External lifts with glass doors descend into the lobby from where the floor-to-ceiling aquarium can be seen. All the five-star hotels provide spacious and comfortable bedrooms with all the trimmings. Each hotel offers its own little extras - such as the Tiara Club for female executives at the Royal Abjar - but in essence they are all excellent, with every useful facility. Catering largely for business travellers, all the five-star hotels provide a range of fax, computer, typing and secretarial services, although the services may not be 24-hour unless requested in advance. Standard rooms do not usually have plugs for modems but the business centres can transmit any documents or material using their IBM-compatible computers. Executive suites are typically provided with a personal fax but the telephone bills can be expensive. Oddly it is less expensive to call the US and England (Dh6 to Dh7.5 for three minutes) than France, Germany or Hong Kong (Dh10 to Dh13). Dubai is small and all areas are easily accessible, so hotel locations are more a matter of preference than necessity. All the main establishments have their own swimming pools, health clubs and tennis courts and offer a range of leisure and other sports facilities. Many hotels provide courtesy buses to their own beach clubs or one of the resorts. A list of hotels appears in the guide. The 'holiday' hotels include the Chicago beach hotel, the Dubai Marine, Metropolitan and Hilton hotels which all have their own beach clubs, and the Jebel Ali Hotel. The peak season for winter-sun seekers is October to April but even then the expansive, clean sands are uncrowded. The Chicago Beach is predominantly a self-contained tourist resort, especially popular with Scandinavians and Germans for its watersport facilities. The other hotels cater for a more mixed clientele of business visitors, conference delegates and tourists. The Hatta Fort hotel, popular for weekend breaks and out-of-the-way conferences, nestles in the mountains some 100km from Dubai. Surrounded by landscaped lawns, the hotel accommodation is in the form of Swiss-style chalets, which are somehow not totally incongruous after a stay in the city. Its lobby is modest by Dubai standards and the hotel features stone-faced walls built from local rock. Hotel tariffs start at about Dh580 per night for a five-star hotel and Dh400 for four-star. Prices vary quite considerably and do not usually include breakfast. It is worth bearing in mind that a 15 per cent service charge and 5 per cent municipality tax are added to all hotel bills for any facility, including meals and telephone calls.</p>

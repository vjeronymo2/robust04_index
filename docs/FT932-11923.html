			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Schlesinger damps rate cut hope: Bundesbank president warns fight against inflation continues THE BUNDESBANK president yesterday damped hopes for a rapid decline in European interest rates, warning that Germany was 'still not over the hump' in its attempts to control inflation. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the central bank's president, warned that this week's sharp reduction in German money market rates did not signal the start of aggressive interest rate cuts by the Bundesbank. Speaking at a press conference before yesterday's meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers, he said there would be negative consequences for the D-Mark and German capital markets if the country cut rates aggressively. In spite of Mr Schlesinger's remarks, the level of German interest rates was discussed at the G7 meeting. Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, welcomed the German interest rate cuts but said he thought they could have come sooner. According to UK officials, Mr Lamont said he feared that recession would continue in continental Europe. He believed, however, that the recovery in Britain was sustainable. Underlining his cautious approach, Mr Schlesinger said Germany had the highest inflation rate of the leading industrialised countries and that only four members of the 24-nation Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development had higher inflation. It was true, he said, that inflation was a lagging indicator that reflected past events. However, it also influenced people's expectations and had to be taken seriously. The Bundesbank president said Germany had used its available manoeuvring room to cut rates. Germany's short-term interest rates had fallen by about 2 percentage points since September. Long-term rates at about 6.5 per cent were among the lowest in the world and should foster investment. He also rebuffed criticism that Germany's short-term rates were keeping borrowing costs too high on the European continent. The recent fall in French interest rates showed that the credibility of countries' policies was the key factor determining interest rates. Inside the European exchange rate mechanism, Belgium and the Netherlands had lower rates than Germany, he noted. Germany had been able to cut rates because its money supply growth had moved into line with the Bundesbank's target. But inflationary pressures had not weakened in the first months of this year, Mr Schlesinger said. He appeared less hopeful about inflationary trends in Germany than Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister. Mr Waigel acknowledged that consumer prices were rising too strongly but prospects were not bad for a deceleration in the inflation rate. In his comments to the G7, Mr Lamont rejected suggestions that the UK's economic recovery was the result of sterling's departure from the ERM last September. Activity had picked up because of interest rate cuts when Britain was still in the ERM, he said. The chancellor was also critical of barriers in Europe to imports from the new market economies of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. He warned of a 'new iron curtain' caused by protectionism against goods from the former communist countries.

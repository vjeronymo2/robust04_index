			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / International Company News: Borden signs merger agreement with KKR Borden, the beleaguered US food group, formally gave up its independence yesterday by signing a definitive merger agreement with buy-out specialists Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR). KKR's Dollars 2bn bid for Borden, announced two weeks ago, had been criticised by some shareholders as inadequate. Mr Frank Tasco, Borden chairman, said 'while the restructuring plan Borden has pursued since January was progressing, it is clear that Borden requires substantial further restructuring which would significantly increase the risks and financial burdens on the company'. An alternative takeover plan for Borden had been put forward by the investor Mr Paul Kazarian. The plan involved cash, whereas KKR will pay for Borden with shares in the food and tobacco group RJR Nabisco. A Borden spokesman said yesterday Mr Kazarian was free to pursue his offer. Mr Kazarian, whose ability to raise the money has been doubted in some quarters, was unavailable for comment. Mr Tasco said: 'We concluded the benefits of this transaction with KKR - providing an immediate premium and the opportunity to participate in the future of RJR Nabisco - represent the clear, best outcome for Borden shareholders.' KKR expects to gain control of Borden by the year-end.</p>

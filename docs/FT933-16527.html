			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Target date set for South African poll THE SOUTH African government and the African National Congress last night forced through agreement on a date for the country's first multiracial election, over-ruling the objections of rightwing parties who walked out of negotiations in protest. The 26-party negotiating forum also agreed in principle to establish a Transitional Executive Council to oversee government in the run-up to the election, on April 27 next year, but avoided difficult debate on the powers it would exercise. The Inkatha Freedom Party and its white rightwing allies, known as the Concerned South Africans Group, rejected this as well. However, officials of the right made clear that they would return to the talks when negotiations resume after a two-week break. Yesterday's deal, which is of little more than symbolic importance, was clearly timed to coincide with the visit to the US of Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC leader, and President FW de Klerk. Yesterday the two separately met President Bill Clinton, and were obviously keen to present him with evidence of progress in democracy talks. Mr de Klerk said he was confident the remaining US economic sanctions against South Africa would be lifted soon. 'We will make the necessary breakthroughs. It is just a matter of time,' he said after a meeting with Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state. Mr Mandela had planned to use his US visit to call for the lifting of remaining sanctions, but Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary general, said ANC preconditions for lifting sanctions had not been met by yesterday's agreement. Mr Ramaphosa still lauded yesterday's deal, saying 'the democracy train is on track'. Despite the fanfare, little concrete progress towards democracy was made yesterday. Decisions on the toughest constitutional issues, including whether South Africa should be a unitary or a federal state, how power should be shared in the first elected government and how the country should be governed in the run-up to the first election, were largely deferred. The forum simply finalised an earlier agreement in principle on the date, which must remain merely a target until a new constitution has been agreed.</p>

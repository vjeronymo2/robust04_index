			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Santiago, 8 June (EFE) -- After hearing the  allegations of the parties involved, the Chilean Military Court  today decided to postpone its ruling on whether to indict  Carabineros Director General Rodolfo Stange on charges of  nonfulfillment of military duties.    The charges are based on a ruling issued by Judge Milton  Juica. Juica established that Stange and five other Carabineros  officers failed to help clear up the slaying of three Communist  leaders in 1985, better known as the decapitations case.    On 31 March Judge Juica sentenced three former Carabineros  members to life imprisonment for the triple killing. He also  sentenced to up to 18 years in prison 12 other former  Carabineros members and one civilian. All of them were members  of the now defunct Carabineros Intelligence Directorate  (Dicomcar), a kind of secret police. [passage omitted]</p>

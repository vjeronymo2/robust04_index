			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / UK set to sign new pact on boat people AN ACCORD is due to be signed next week to repatriate tens of thousands of Vietnamese boat people from Hong Kong, the UK Foreign Office said last night, PA reports. 'We are on the verge of signing an agreement to return to Vietnam all Vietnamese who arrived in Hong Kong before October 29, 1991, who, after careful screening, are judged not to be refugees,' an FO spokesman said. The accord covers over 20,432 people, and the operation could take three years. An agreement already exists between Britain, Vietnam and Hong Kong for repatriation of boat people - not deemed political refugees - who have arrived since October 29. The Hong Kong government yesterday disclosed that its budget surplus for last year was HKDollars 6bn (Pounds 437m) higher than its provisional figure, revealed in March, writes Simon Davies in Hong Kong. This brings the budget surplus for 1991-1992 to over Dollars HK20bn. Financial secretary Hamish MacLeod's statement on the windfall surplus was accompanied by a concession on his budget: property rates would not rise half a point to 6 per cent, as announced in the budget speech. The revenue fall was 'roughly equivalent' to the windfall surplus.</p>

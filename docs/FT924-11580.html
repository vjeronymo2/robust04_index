			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Insider dealing The new Criminal Justice Bill is a wasted opportunity to clean up the UK's muddled laws on insider dealing. Not before time, the offence is extended to cover the gilts market. The Treasury has withdrawn some earlier proposals that would compromise the legitimate working of the equity market. Its claim that the new law is no different in substance from existing legislation may mean a reprieve for those infamous but less and less liquid brokers' lunches. Yet, apart from placing the onus firmly on the defendant to prove there is no criminal intent, the new law offers nothing to help prosecute genuine cases of insider dealing. Some elements of the bill are, if anything, more confusing than before. To accommodate Brussels, information must be 'specific or precise' to count as inside information. This would cover dealing in gilts on the basis of inside knowledge of a cut in interest rates. But prior knowledge of the contents of inflation statistics or balance of payments data would not count because the information is too general. The uncertainty is so great that lawyers must already be totting up their fees. In other respects, the definition of inside information is also still worryingly broad, covering any price-sensitive information which relates to a company. This could include knowledge of a distant competitor or supplier. Brokers' analysts may still need to consult the promised guidance notes before they go to lunch. One can only hope the Treasury makes a better fist of drafting them.</p>

			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> N.Y. HAS EYE ON YANKEES, AIDE TO CUOMO SAYS  </P> <P> Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's chief economic development adviser said today that New  York state will probably go ahead with an attempt to buy the New York Yankees,  if team owner George Steinbrenner decides to sell.  </P> <P> Cuomo aide Vincent Tese said he doesn't think that any such sale is imminent  but that New York will be ready to move if conditions change.  </P> <P> Tese said that while he agrees with Cuomo that major league owners would  probably refuse to let the state buy the team, "that doesn't stop us from at  least trying, and I think we would try."  </P> <P> "If we get shot down, we get shot down," said Cuomo's director of economic  development, "but we'll make an attempt."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Tese said, he doesn't think the Steinbrenner family has any  intention of putting the team up for sale.  </P></p>

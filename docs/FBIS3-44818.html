The Vietnamese boat with 24 men, women, and children  on board have been drifting on the sea for three months before  it forced its way into a fishing port in Hsinchu at 0630 a.m.  Thursday. The boat has tried to enter the port on Wednesday  night but was refused by the military who detected it from the  radar screen. The Vietnamese captain requested that he and his  passengers be allowed to stay in Taiwan for a few days before  the weather became stable. But the military employees turned  down the appeal. Instead, local authorities supplied the vessel  with fresh water, food, and fuel to continue its trip.</p>

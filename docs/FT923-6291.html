			<p>920825 FT  25 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar defies more intervention THE DOLLAR fell below DM1.40 against the D-Mark in European trading yesterday, in spite of concerted central bank intervention in both European and North American trading, writes James Blitz. There was no firm underpinning to the US currency at the end of an intense day of trading on the foreign exchange markets. Fifteen central banks carried out five rounds of intervention in roughly the same volumes that have been seen in recent weeks. But the dollar fell victim to heavy selling, even though it had lost more than 7 pfennigs in a week. By the European close, the dollar was at DM1.4035. more than 3 pfennigs down on the day. A measure of its weakness was that sterling rose above the Dollars 2 level against the US currency for the first time since February 1991, in spite of the pound's intrinsic weakness. Sterling finished at Dollars 1.9945, up nearly 5 cents. In New York the dollar ended at DM1.4015 and the pound was at Dollars 1.9940. Dealers had different views as to where the dollar/D-Mark rate is heading now. Mr Aki Karayannis, a senior dealer at Lehman Bros in London, thinks the selling has been overdone and the currency will bottom out soon. 'It is a mistake to get caught up with the selling now,' he said. Some dealers said the dollar could easily test lower levels in forthcoming days. Mr David Kern, chief economist at NatWest Bank, commented: 'Short of changing interest rates, there is little the central banks can now do to help the dollar.' European central banks and the US Federal Reserve started to intervene in the London morning yesterday, buying dollars at DM1.4215, but that level could not be held. One reason for the lack of success is that they were intervening in very small volumes of around Dollars 1bn a day. By contrast, the spot desk in dollar/D-Mark business at a large London bank might expect to see a Dollars 3bn turnover each day. Mr Avinash Persaud, chief currency economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London, suggested that the central banks believe they cannot really turn the dollar, and are only making a token gesture. 'Central banks will want to ensure that there is an orderly fall that does not excessively disrupt world stock markets.' In the European Monetary System, sterling and the Italian lira remained under intense pressure, but looked at times as though they might have decoupled themselves from the dollar's fall. The pound closed firmer on the day at DM2.80, even though the Bank of England did not support sterling through intervention or an interest rate rise. The lira ended in London at L762.1, holding close to a record low against the D-Mark. In later New York trading, it was touching L764, dangerously near its L765 ERM floor.</p>

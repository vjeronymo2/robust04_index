			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rosa Icela Rodriguez] </F>   [Excerpt] In an effort to make the voter lists for the 21  August elections more trustworthy, the General Council of the  Federal Electoral Institute [IFE] has unanimously agreed to  extend the deadline for reviewing the names of citizens on the  lists until 30 April. It also agreed to change -- with only two  votes against -- the conditions for bidding by Mexican and  foreign firms for the right to conduct an independent audit of  the lists.    After promising that the definitive lists of names will be  turned over to the parties before the scheduled date, Government  Secretary Jorge Carpizo McGregor said the Mexican Government "is  determined to provide all instruments that can yield trustworthy  results so that everyone can overcome this air of distrust."    IFE members unanimously approved the PRI presidential  candidate's replacement. Jorge Carpizo, president of the  General Council of the IFE, submitted candidate Ernesto  Zedillo's legal registration to Humberto Lira Mora, electoral  action secretary of the PRI. Those present at the session, at  Carpizo's request, marked a moment of silence in memory of Luis  Donaldo Colosio.    After voting against an independent audit, Party of the  Democratic Revolution [PRD] Deputy Roberto Robles Garnica,  minority representative in the Senate, said such an audit will  prove "useless" because "it is designed to be more of a  justification than an improvement in the credibility of the  electoral lists." He added that by the time the audit is  completed, "we will not have time to use it" to make corrections.    PRI adviser Salvador Rocha Diaz denied that the "electoral  lists are incorrect," and he accused the PRD of having assumed a  "dubious position." He said "it is a serious thing" for the  party "to already be preparing to reject the election results."    Following a long debate in which an independent audit of the  electoral lists was approved, Carpizo thanked the members of the  Independent Audit Technical Council for their work and added:  "The work done by the 11 scientists contrasts the work conducted  by other Mexicans whose cooperation was requested and who have  haggled about their time." He did not go into any details about  who he was referring to.    Carpizo also announced that starting today the electronic  media will broadcast messages from the nine presidents of the  political parties in which they will invite their supporters to  verify the electoral lists in their respective centers. As of  yesterday, six party presidents had already recorded their  messages.    The official later said that, following demands from the  parties -- "which, in my opinion, are correct" -- they will be  given definite party member lists before the scheduled date to  give them enough time to review the lists. He explained that  this decision will require a reform of the Cofipe [Federal Code  of Institutions and Electoral Procedures], for which there is a  consensus. Nevertheless, he said this would require reducing by  approximately one month the deadline to deliver credentials with  a photograph.    He explained it will also be necessary to launch a  large-scale effort to enable the people to immediately pick up  their voting credentials, and he calculated the first voter  lists could be delivered by 1 August.    The agreement approved by the parties indicates an external  audit will review and evaluate the voter lists, the credentials  with a photograph, and the receipt of credentials and party  member lists.    Carpizo admitted that the external audit may reveal  "mistakes  in the voter lists involving dead people and changes of  address," but, he said, "I thought about this before accepting  this post because, if this was going to be one of the daring  adventures of my life, I would not work with voter lists that  did not allow me personally to be confident."    The debate between Carpizo and the PRD representatives  became  difficult at times, although the tone was more conciliatory in  later sessions. This session was not attended by PRD leader  Porfirio Munoz Ledo. Senator Robles Garnica, coordinator  general of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas' campaign, attended in his place.  [passage omitted]</p>

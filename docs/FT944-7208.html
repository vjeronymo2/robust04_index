			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: RPC edges ahead to Pounds 4.4m Despite an increase in the cost of raw materials of up to 60 per cent, interim pre-tax profits at RPC Group, the rigid plastic packaging manufacturer, edged ahead from Pounds 4.24m to Pounds 4.4m. Turnover from continuing operations slipped to Pounds 35.9m (Pounds 36.5m) for the half-year to September 30. However, acquisitions took total sales to Pounds 37m. The accounting period was one week longer in the previous half-year. Shares in RPC, which came to the market in May last year, firmed 5p to close at 144p. Mr Ron Marsh, chief executive, said trading for the period had 'gathered pace after a slow start'. Demand for paint containers was depressed at first, but activity had picked up well in the second quarter. Operating margins rose from 12 per cent to 12.6 per cent despite rising costs for plastic polymers of between 30 and 60 per cent. Mr Marsh said the group had been able to pass on those costs to customers. Operating profits on continuing operations rose 5 per cent to Pounds 4.6m (Pounds 4.39m). Interest payable rose to Pounds 261,000 (Pounds 154,000), following the acquisition of the industrial containers business of Lawson Mardon and McKechnie's UK packaging business. Gearing increased from 14 per cent to 42 per cent. RPC had negotiated a number of long-term contracts, including Heinz, Colman and ICI. Some had 'secured the group's supply position well into the second half of the decade', Mr Marsh said. Earnings per share slipped 0.1p to 5.3p. The interim dividend is 1.1p (1p).</p>

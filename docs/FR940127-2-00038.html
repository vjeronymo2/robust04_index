The intent of the proposed flow modification is to help protect fishery resources (primarily the chinook salmon) in the Tuolumne River. Staff's initial evaluation was issued on December 22, 1993, in a draft environmental assessment (DEA). In the DEA, staff determined that because some of the proposed alternatives could, under certain circumstances, reduce the amount of water available to users of the Hetch Hetchy water supply, some of the proposed alternatives may constitute a major federal action affecting the human environment and recommended preparation of an environmental impact statement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A draft EIS will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EIS will be analyzed by staff and considered in the final EIS. Staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be presented for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scoping Meeting <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A scoping meeting will be held on Thursday, February 10, 1994, at 9 a.m. at the Best Western Mallard's Inn in Modesto, California.

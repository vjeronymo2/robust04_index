			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, June 10 (XINHUA) -- The International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) passed a resolution here today to  suspend its technical aid to the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea (DPRK).    The resolution, adopted at a meeting of the IAEA Board of  Governors, said that the DPRK, as a party to the treaty on non-  proliferation of nuclear weapons, failed to carry out the main  part of the IAEA's safeguards agreement and prevented the IAEA  from inspecting its nuclear facilities.    The resolution called on the DPRK to cooperate fully with  the  IAEA secretariat and guarantee the IAEA access to all the  documents and places concerned.    The resolution said the IAEA decided to stop its non-medical  aid to DPRK. This means that the country will lose about a  quarter of a million U.S. dollars' worth of technical aid and  support for its civil nuclear program each year.    A Chinese representative pointed out at the meeting that  losing one opportunity to conduct technical inspection did not  mean that all the hopes to settle the nuclear issue have been  lost.    He said the key point at present is that all parties  concerned should calm down, make specific efforts and leave some  leeway for solving problems.    "To go to the extreme and resort to confrontation, pressure  and embargo will never achieve good results," he declared.    The Chinese representative said that it was difficult for  China to support the resolution and expressed his deep concerns  over possible consequences.    Twenty-eight countries voted for the resolution sponsored by  18 countries including the United States, Japan, France and  Russia and one against while two countries, including China,  abstained and two others did not participate in voting.    The meeting, participated by 35 member countries of the  Board  of Governors, opened on June 6 with the nuclear issue in the  DPRK being its main topic.</p>

The conversion of a project from rental to cooperative is not a ``change in use'' as that term is employed in the mortgage since the property will continue to have a residential use both before and after conversion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Hazard insurance.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The mortgage must contain a covenant, acceptable to the HFA, that binds the mortgagor to keep the property insured by one or more standard policies for fire and other hazards stipulated by the HFA. A standard mortgagee clause making loss payable to the HFA must be included in the mortgage. The HFA is responsible for assuring that insurance is maintained in force and in the amount required by this paragraph and the mortgage. The HFA must ensure that the insurance coverage is in an amount that will comply with the coinsurance clause applicable to the location and character of the property, but not less than 80 percent of the actual cash value of the insurable improvements and equipment. If the mortgagor does not obtain the required insurance, the HFA must do so and assess the mortgagor for such costs. These insurance requirements apply as long as the HFA retains an interest in the project and final claim settlement has not been completed or the contract of insurance has not been otherwise terminated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Modification of terms.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The mortgage must contain a covenant requiring that, in the event that the HFA and owner agree to a modification of the terms of the mortgage ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> to reflect a reduction of the interest rate if reductions are realized in the underlying bond rates for the project), Section 8 rents would be reduced in accordance with HUD guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Regulatory Agreement.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The mortgage must contain a provision incorporating the Regulatory Agreement by reference. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;266.415  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Mortgage lien and other obligations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Liens.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the initial and final closing of the loan, the mortgagor and the HFA must certify, and the HFA must determine, that the property covered by the mortgage is free from all liens other than the lien of the insured mortgage, except that the property may be subject to such inferior lien or liens as approved by the HFA as long as the insured mortgage has first priority for payment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Contractual obligations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the final closing of the loan, the mortgagor and the HFA must certify, and the HFA must determine, that all contractual obligations in connection with the mortgage transaction, including the purchase of the property and the improvements to the property, are paid. An exception is made for obligations that are approved by the HFA and determined by the HFA to be of a lesser priority for payment than the obligation of the insured mortgage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

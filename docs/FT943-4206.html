			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei retreats as Seoul rises 1.9% to five-year high Share prices declined on selling by arbitrageurs and overseas investors, and the Nikkei 225 average fell below the 20,000 level for the first time in four months, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index closed 106.02 off at the day's low of 19,917.78, ending below 20,000 for the first time since May 10. It peaked in the afternoon at 20,108.42 on buying by public pension and insurance funds, but weak investor confidence, triggered by over-supply ahead of next month's Japan Tobacco listing, depressed shares later. Arbitrageurs adjusted positions ahead of today's settlement of futures and options contracts for September, while overseas investors were also selling around the 20,000 mark. However, in spite of previous speculation, the telecommunications sector held firm. Japan Telecom, which dragged the wider market lower on Wednesday, rallied along with other telecom stocks. Volume totalled 304m shares, against 312m. The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 3.75 to 1,582.31 and the Nikkei 300 eased 1.06 to 288.09. Losers led gainers by 526 to 441, with 228 issues unchanged. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 4.20 to 1,288.85. Japan Telecom, on the second section, finished Y30,000 better at Y4.46m. The stock's rebound boosted other telecom shares, with DDI firming Y9,000 to Y912,000 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Y3,000 to Y886,000. East Japan Railway, a leading shareholder of JT, rose Y2,000 to Y507,000. Nitsuko, a telephone equipment manufacturer, attracted speculative buying in the morning session but later retreated on profit-taking, closing Y10 down at Y1,470. High-technology shares were sold by foreigners. Sony declined Y50 to Y5,800 and Matsushita Electric Industrial dipped Y50 to Y1,650. Brokers were lower on active selling, with Nomura Securities off Y30 at Y2,120 and Nikko Securities slipping Y20 to Y1,120. Some banks firmed after falling heavily on arbitrage selling on Wednesday. Industrial Bank of Japan picked up Y20 to Y2,830 and Sakura Bank Y10 to Y1,360. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 84.10 to 22,215.52 in volume of 97.5m shares. Roundup The region was mixed, with strong performances in some markets. SEOUL climbed 1.9 per cent to a five-year high in active trading as gains by blue chips and large-capitalisation issues far outweighed steady sales of shares with sluggish earnings prospects. The composite index closed 18.76 ahead at 991.44 in heavy turnover of 39.5m shares. Samsung Electronics and Posco were the day's limit up, rising Won3,000 and Won2,500 respectively to Won139,000 and Won89,600. BOMBAY saw heavy buying by financial institutions on the final day of the account which took the BSE 30-share index ahead 25.99 to 4,556.32. Associated Cement advanced Rs70 to a year's high of Rs5,020 ahead of its rights issue, details of which are to be given tomorrow. KUALA LUMPUR rose to its best level for eight months in response to the government's decision to lift the seven-month ban on government contracts for British business. The composite index added 18.02, or 1.6 per cent, at 1,181.17 as the market shrugged off rumours about another rise in the statutory reserve requirement of banks, which dragged share prices into negative territory from earlier gains on Wednesday. Telekom Malaysia, which shed 80 cents the previous day, recouped 70 cents at MDollars 22.30. MANILA lost 1.7 per cent as blue chips were led down by PLDT, which fell sharply on Wall Street overnight. The composite index finished 52.69 lower at 2,987.63 and PLDT dropped 3.9 per cent to 1,590 pesos. PNB lost 10 pesos at 437.50 pesos and Meralco 'B', which is open to foreign investors, also receded 10 pesos to 367.50 pesos. Petron, which made a strong debut on Wednesday, defied the slide and closed slightly higher at 22 pesos. HONG KONG finished slightly lower after selective buying trimmed most early losses, and the Hang Seng index was off a net 14.89 at 10,150.98. The weakness was attributed to a lack of participation from major overseas institutions which had led recent rallies. Conversely, H shares of locally listed mainland Chinese companies surged on buying by overseas funds, particularly in Japan, and the Hang Seng H-share index soared 66.12, or 4.6 per cent, to 1,516.61. Among the blue chip losers, Hong Kong Telecom gave up 35 cents to HKDollars 16.25, while Wharf Holdings dipped 30 cents to HKDollars 34.50. But Sun Hung Kai Properties, expected to post strong results next month, surged HKDollars 1.75 to HKDollars 60.50. SINGAPORE experienced further weakness in index-linked stocks as investors continued to focus on Malaysian shares traded over the counter, and the Straits Times Industrial index fell 22.78 to 2,304.23. Golden Plus put on 75 cents at SDollars 8.10 on talk of a Malaysian construction deal. Dunlop Estate gained 60 cents on expectations that it would participate in Sarawak's large dam project in Bakun through its acquisition of Sarawak Electricity Supply. SYDNEY's mood was soured by a late sell-off in BTR Nylex, the industrial group, after results. The All Ordinaries index retreated 15.2 to 2,089.1 as BTR fell 30 cents to ADollars 2.08. WELLINGTON edged lower in the face of a weak bond market and domestic political worries. The NZSE 40 Capital index gave up 4.27 at 2,159.48. Continuing strong demand took Fletcher Challenge 9 cents higher to NZDollars 4.37, but Brierley Investments eased 2 cents to NZDollars 1.33 in spite of record annual profits.</p>

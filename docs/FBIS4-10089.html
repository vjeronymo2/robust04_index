			<p>BFN     [Text] Quito, 5 Apr (EFE) -- The Ecuadoran Government  announced today that it has decided to end the 20-month delay in  the payment of its foreign debt service because it believes that  its renegotiations with private creditor banks are "in their  final phase." At a news conference, Finance Minister Cesar  Robalino said, "I have authorized the payment of $5 million in  interest as a symbolic show of the good faith and seriousness of  the governnment, which wants to close a chapter that has  considerably limited the country's development."    Ecuador had not paid its foreign debt service since May  1992,  during the government of President Rodrigo Borja (1988-92), who  managed to include approximately $1 billion for that purpose in  the total renegotiation package with the credit banks'  Administrative Committee. Ecuador's debt with the private banks  is close to $6.5 billion, half of the country's total debt.    Some government officials have pointed out that Ecuador is  trying to reduce its debt with the private banks by at least 50  percent, but Robalino did not confirm that percentage today "to  avoid hindering the negotiations," he said. Robalino added that  a few hours ago, the IMF directors received the so-called  "letter of intention" that outlines the government's economic  policy, which is expected to be approved by the full directorate  during its 11 May session. Along with the presentation of this  document, the Ecuadoran authorities asked the IMF for a loan of  $180 million. Robalino announced that the government will later  request "additional aid for a debt reduction program," but he  declined to disclose further details.    At the end of May or in June, Robalino will present the same  economic program to the Paris Club and request a refinancing  loan of $400 million, which is approximately the amount of the  debt Ecuador has with that organization. In sum, the Ecuadoran  Government expects to receive, following passage of its economic  program, approximately $1 billion in "fresh loans" from the IMF,  World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and other  international organizations.    The program outlined in the "letter of intention"  anticipates  "the country's economic growth, in real terms, by three percent  up to December," which is below the expectations recently  announced, Robalino added. "This implies that economic  reactivation will surpass the population's growth and that the  Ecuadoran people's standard of living will improve," he added.    The other goals of the 1994 program are to reduce annual  inflation by 20 percent after dropping it from 60.2 percent in  1992 to 31 percent in 1993; increase the country's International  Monetary Reserve (IMR) to $1.5 billion; and put an end to the  fiscal deficit. The minister also reiterated the government's  "political resolve" to modernize and reduce the state apparatus  and to privatize all institutions hampered by deficits.</p>

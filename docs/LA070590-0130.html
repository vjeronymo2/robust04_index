			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SLAPP IN FACE FOR PROTESTING HOMEOWNERS;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: THE FORM OF LITIGATION, NOW BEING USED AGAINST A GROUP OBJECTING  TO A HILLSIDE PROJECT, IS VIEWED AS INTIMIDATION.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles homeowners group that has voiced objections over potential  environmental hazards posed by the development of nearly two dozen hillside  home sites above Beverly Hills is paying a price for its protests.  </P> <P> The developer of the sites has filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against the  North Beverly Drive-Franklin Canyon Homeowners Assn., claiming that the group  broke an agreement not to delay the project.  </P> <P> Association officers say the action, by R&amp;R Hillcrest Development Co., is  the latest example in Los Angeles of a form of litigation referred to as a  SLAPP, or Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation. They say the suits  are being used increasingly across the country by builders to intimidate  homeowners groups and discourage them from opposing development projects.  </P> <P> In recent years, a growing number of developers and public agencies have sued  community activists when their building projects have been delayed. The suits  usually allege nuisance, interference with economic advantage and abuse of the  legal process. According to two University of Denver researchers, the average  SLAPP asks for $9 million in damages and takes about three years before getting  resolved.  </P> <P> In the Franklin Canyon case, the association fought a decision by the city of  Los Angeles this year to waive a tract map requirement that would have allowed  the builder to develop the Hillcrest Drive home sites without an environmental  impact report. However, after the homeowners protested, the city attorney's  office intervened and ruled that the planners' decision violated the California  Environmental Quality Act and that a new tract map was needed.  </P> <P> After city planners reversed their decision, the developer last month filed a  lawsuit against the association and several former officers, alleging that the  requests for additional environmental studies "were taken to stall . . . to  block or defeat the proposed development." The developer is seeking unspecified  damages, likely to be in the millions of dollars, alleging that the association  breached a contract, committed fraud, misrepresented its intentions and cost  Hillcrest nearly $2 million because of the delays.  </P> <P> "It's a classic SLAPP suit in that it was done to silence them so the developer  would have an easier time getting the project through the city," said Benjamin  M. Reznik, an attorney for the association. "What the developer is saying is  that asking for studies on traffic, geology and noise constitutes opposition.  It's ridiculous."  </P> <P> However, Jonathan R. Bloch, vice president of the development company, said the  homeowners failed to abide by a written agreement not to oppose the project as  long as they were provided with all planning documents and building permits.  </P> <P> "It's regrettable that we've had to take this action," Bloch said. "Lawsuits  and litigation are a last resort to us, but after working with them for over  two years, we came to the conclusion that at least the board of the association  is not proceeding with the agreement."  </P> <P> The proposed development would include up to 22 lots, with most of the homes  ranging between 5,000 and 10,000 square feet. Bloch declined to give any other  specifics on the development, including the price. He described it as a  "high-end, custom subdivision."  </P> <P> The homeowners group has been negotiating with the owners of the property for  nearly three years. The association entered into the agreement with Leland  Hewitt, the original owner of the tract, in 1987. Under that plan, Hewitt would  have graded about 100,000 cubic yards of dirt to accommodate 22 homes. The  following year, however, R&amp;R Hillcrest bought the property from Hewitt, and  the building company's top officers, Michael and Gene Rosenfeld, agreed to  honor the contract if the homeowners association helped to expedite the  development of the home sites.  </P> <P> Michael Rosenfeld is a principal with the Anden Group, which recently received  county approval for a highly controversial project to build 69 luxury homes in  western Malibu. His father, Gene, is a former senior executive with Kaufman  &amp; Broad.  </P> <P> Jack Carter, president of the homeowners group, said Hillcrest's plan called  for nearly five times as much grading as Hewitt's project and would have  lowered some of the steep ridges by as much as 75 feet. Carter said that since  the canyon area is prone to mudslides, the association wanted further geologic  studies and a new subdivision tract map filed, because the old one was more  than 65 years old.  </P> <P> "Our goal all along was just to make sure that the development was  environmentally safe," Carter said. "We've never tried to delay the project. We  just believe that more studies are needed because safety is not negotiable."  </P> <P> City Councilman Mike Woo, who represents the area, agrees. Woo wrote a letter  to the city's Department of Building and Safety requesting that the developer  be required to conduct a full environmental review of the Franklin Canyon  project.  </P> <P> "I've heard some serious concerns raised by the neighbors about the unstable  land conditions in that area," Woo said. "If a full environmental impact report  found that there were no serious environmental consequences, then I believe I  could support the project. But that is a major hurdle yet to be crossed."  </P> <P> Bloch said Hillcrest intends to follow whatever requirements the city places on  the proposed development, including further environmental studies. But, he  said, the company has no intention of dropping its lawsuit against the  homeowners association.  </P> <P> Attorney Reznik said the lawsuit is misguided.  </P> <P> "It's the city that is not giving them what they want, not the homeowners," he  said. "But the idea of a SLAPP suit is to intimidate the homeowners, even if  the homeowners were right and justified in asking questions about the  environmental impact of the project. And in this case, they were."  </P></p>

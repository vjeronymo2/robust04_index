Lacayo appears on the legal document as the only plaintiff  in  the case opened on 19 February, when Matagalpa police arrested a  "mechanic" identified as German Saenz Perez, a native of  Matiguas.    Saenz appeared before the judge of the Matagalpa District  First Court, but when police realized the magnitude of his  statement, they took Saenz to the Managua Fifth Criminal  District Court, presided over by Martha Quezada.    Matagalpa authorities have not established if Saenz is  connected to any other crime. They added Saenz told them he was  one of the individuals who held a "meeting" with "certain  prominent figures."    The "prominent figures" to whom Saenz referred included no  less than Deputy Humberto Castilla, a man named Aristides, and a  mayor of an undisclosed location in northern Nicaragua.    According to Saenz, also known as "Tuti," the meeting was  held in San Jose de los Remates. He added many more meetings,  which were attended by recontra leader "Charrito," followed.    The main objective of these meetings was to devise the  perfect plan to assassinate Lacayo.    In addition to Saenz, Doris Isabel Lopez Morraz, Manuel  Salvador Lopez Morraz, Francisco Javier Rivera Picado, and Luis  Izaguirre Guevara are being tried.    The trial still lacks a writ of inquiry by the plaintiff, in  this case, but it has an exhaustive chronology by Saenz, the  main defendant, regarding his first "casual" encounter with the  mentioned prominent individuals.    According to Saenz, he met his presumed "employers" for the  first time when he was walking down a road in Matiguas and was  approached by several men in a luxury vehicle. The men,  including those already mentioned, then asked him for directions  to get to San Jose de los Remates.    Preliminary investigations indicate Saenz has links with  members of the former resistance movement and that he is living  with a woman whose relatives died during the war.    Reliable sources have disclosed Castilla mentioned the  subject in private at the National Assembly, referring to Saenz  as his "former driver," whom he had fired because Saenz  allegedly offered drugs to his son.    Castilla has also downplayed Saenz' version and denied all  accusations the defendants might make against him during the  process.</p>

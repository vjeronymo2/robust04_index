			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ONE TREND SURVIVES AND ANOTHER ENDS AS BISHOP AMAT DEFEATS SERVITE  </P> <P> One tradition came to an end while another was extended Friday night in Bishop  Amat High School's 27-6 victory over Servite in front of 5,000 in Kiefer  Stadium.  </P> <P> Bishop Amat (6-3, 3-0) clinched at least a tie for the Angelus League title  with one game remaining against St. Paul. It was Bishop Amat's fifth  consecutive league title.  </P> <P> Servite's streak of qualifying for the playoffs 18 consecutive years, the  longest run in the Southern Section, is over. Servite (3-6, 1-2) has one game  remaining with Mater Dei, but its loss to St. Paul last week means the Friars  are eliminated.  </P> <P> "Each one gets better," said Mark Paredes, Bishop Amat coach. "It got a little  hairy when we lost (Jeremy) Smith because our whole game plan was to get the  ball to him."  </P> <P> Smith, who moved from wide receiver to tailback, left the game midway through  the second quarter with a concussion and his team leading, 14-6. Smith made the  most of his playing time, gaining 72 yards in 8 carries and scoring on a  92-yard kickoff return.  </P> <P> Smith also had a 70-yard touchdown run nullified by a clipping penalty on the  first play of the game. Smith's replacement, Motu Ili, also posted some big  numbers, gaining 122 yards in 13 carries and scoring twice.  </P> <P> "They were by far the best team we've played," said Larry Toner, Servite's  first-year coach. "They were bigger, faster and stronger than us. They're  powerful and well-coached. A fine team."  </P> <P> Servite surprised Bishop Amat by opening a 6-0 lead in the first quarter when  tailback Kent Weiss capped an 80-yard drive with a two-yard run. But Servite  never came close to scoring again.  </P> <P> Quarterback Rob Walker, benched last week after throwing three interceptions in  the first half against St. Paul, was inconsistent once again. Walker completed  only 12 of 28 passes for 144 yards with most of the yardage coming against  reserves in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Bishop Amat's defense, led by linebackers Jason Patterson and Alex Pacheco,  sacked Walker four times and limited Weiss to 56 yards in 14 carries.  </P></p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Poland tries to halve debt Poland yesterday sought to encourage international creditors to commit themselves to financing proposals which will allow Poland to complete a 46 per cent reduction on its Dollars 13.2bn (Pounds 8.6bn) London Club debt in the first half of September. Mr Krzysztof Krowacki, Poland's chief debt negotiator, said he was 'extremely close' to obtaining the consent of holders of 95 per cent of the debt needed for the deal to be implemented in its entirety. Mr Krowacki said bearers of over 55 per cent of the debt want to change it into discount bonds at a 45 per cent reduction rate, while holders of 26 per cent of the debt have agreed to a Polish proposal to buy back their paper at a price of 41 cents to the dollar. The exchange of debt into discount and par bonds would go ahead even if the 95 per cent consent for buy-back is not achieved, as agreements from only half the debt holders are needed in this case. One London-based debt trader commented yesterday that the government's decision to hold a press conference showed that 'agreement was slow in coming at the end' but saw no reason to doubt that the 95 per cent target would be reached, especially as the buy-back element was 'generously priced'. Poland will be financing the reduction from its own reserves and loans from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.</p>

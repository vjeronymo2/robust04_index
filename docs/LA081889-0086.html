			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH COURT BACKS RENT BOARD AUTHORITY;  </P> <P> PANEL CAN RESOLVE EXCESSIVE-RENT CASES, ORDER REPAYMENT; APPEALS ALLOWED  </P> <P> The California Supreme Court, reaffirming the regulatory authority of  administrative agencies, ruled Thursday that a local rent control board may  resolve excess-rent claims against landlords and order wrongdoers to repay  tenants.  </P> <P> But the justices, by a vote of 6 to 1, held also that landlords must get the  chance to challenge a repayment order in court -- and that a board may not go  so far as to assess triple damages for a deliberate rent overcharge.  </P> <P> The ruling came in a legal challenge by landlords to a Santa Monica rent  control law enacted in 1979 as one of the most stringent in the nation.  </P> <P> The landlords argued that the rent control board, in deciding excessive-rent  disputes, had unlawfully assumed judicial powers in violation of the state  Constitution. The board lacked authority to resolve such cases, assess damages  or authorize rent withholding by tenants, they said.  </P> <P> The board replied that its assertion of such authority was a practical and  lawful means of enforcing rent-control regulations -- and that a ruling to the  contrary would undermine the well-established authority of countless  administrative agencies to exercise quasi-judicial authority in the regulatory  process.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Complete Win'  </P> <P> The high court's ruling Thursday upholding the general authority of the board  to resolve rent disputes was greeted enthusiastically by Joel Martin Levy,  counsel for the board. He noted that the treble-damages provision has since  been removed from the law -- and said that the rent-withholding section was  insignificant. "We look upon this as a complete win," Levy said. "From our  point of view, we got everything we really wanted."  </P> <P> Thomas A. Nitti, an attorney representing one of the landlords in the case,  called the ruling "a split decision."  </P> <P> "The court put limitations on treble damages, and more importantly, said the  rent board decisions are not final," Nitti said. "On the other hand, the court  gave the board credit for maturity and responsibility that the board does not  possess. The board is biased in favor of tenants and is incapable of making a  fair decision."  </P> <P> In the decision, the justices agreed that while it was permissible for the  board to levy fines, make awards of costs and attorneys' fees and take similar  steps to ensure compliance with the law, the since-abandoned provision of the  ordinance allowing treble damages against landlords was unconstitutional.  </P> <P> Such power, Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas wrote, "poses a risk of producing  arbitrary, disproportionate results. . . . "  </P> <P> Nor, said the court, could the city allow a tenant to immediately withhold rent  without permitting a landlord to seek judicial review of such an order.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Resolving Disputes  </P> <P> But the justices found that the board's general power to resolve disputes and  order restitution by errant landlords was permissible -- so long as doing so  was "reasonably necessary" to enforce rent control and losing parties remained  free to challenge board orders in court.  </P> <P> In dissent, Justice Allen E. Broussard agreed that the board's general  assertion of authority was legitimate, but he objected to the court's  invalidation of the treble-damages and rent-withholding provisions.  </P> <P> "If we follow the majority's lead in this case, we will put ourselves in the  business of deciding whether the thousands of administrative regulations that  bind up modern commercial activity are a good idea," he said.  </P> <P> The case arose in a suit brought in 1982 by Haidy McHugh, a Santa Monica  landlord involved in an excessive-rent dispute with two tenants. McHugh, later  joined by 20 other landlords, challenged a board award of $4,390.99 in damages  to the two tenants -- triple the amount of her alleged overcharge. At the time,  the ordinance permitted damages of $500 or three times the overcharge, which  ever was higher, for willful violations of rent control laws.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trial Court Ruling  </P> <P> In 1983, a trial court judge ruled that the board had improperly assumed  judicial authority in violation of the Constitution and barred the board from  receiving complaints, holding hearings and awarding damages in excessive-rent  cases. Later, a state Court of Appeal found the board's actions lawful, and  McHugh and the other landlords took the issue to the state Supreme Court.  </P> <P> Staff writer Julio Moran in Santa Monica contributed to this report.  </P></p>

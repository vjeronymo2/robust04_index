DOE is interested in receiving proposals that describe capabilities, experience, and proposed methods for conducting credible risk assessments. DOE is specifically interested in receiving proposals that include statements of the proposer's capabilities, experience, and proposed methods for assessing risk to human health and the environment. Proposals must also show experience in effective and efficient management of the tasks required in support of risk assessments, in preparing and presenting reports, and in working with stakeholders and decision makers at all levels. Proposals must also identify the technical and scientific staff, their professional experience and their level of program involvement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants must demonstrate that they can apply the most recent, cost-effective technology in their approach for evaluating and managing risk assessments for environmental management. The proposal must demonstrate that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The offeror is capable of conducting scientifically valid and responsible risk assessments without bias or organizational conflicts of interest in protecting the public health and environment. These risk assessments must include clear statements of what is known and the level of uncertainty of the risk data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The offeror's risk assessments will be supportable by independent external review by technical experts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The offeror has the experience and capability to plan, organize, manage, and facilitate local and national stakeholders' involvement in the development of credible risk assessments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The offeror has the experience and ability to effectively communicate complicated scientific information on potential risks and uncertainties, to local and national stakeholders, other concerned citizens, and decision makers at all levels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The offeror presently has or is capable of obtaining staff with the training, expertise, and experience needed to conduct scientifically complex risk assessments. Such assessments should include statements that clearly identify sensitive populations and exposed populations, and that characterize the degree of risk and the level of uncertainty in the process and assessments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The offeror has the ability to integrate the activities of all organizations conducting risk assessments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The offeror has management capability for both financial and scientific management and a demonstrated skill in planning and scheduling. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Due to programmatic constraints, proposals related to credible risk assessment at DOE facilities need to be received as early as possible.

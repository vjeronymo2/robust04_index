			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: MINIMALIST MARISCOS: STEP INTO THE COCTEL ROOM  </P> <P> What do we mean when we talk about restaurant minimalism? Do we mean the carpet  showroom high-gloss-enameled into a chic cafe, or the artfully arranged snippet  of chive that speaks volumes about its arranger's taste and refinement? Do we  mean the small trapezoid of poached cod posed with three daikon sprouts in the  middle of a vast Swid Powell plate? Or do we mean the secret restaurant above  Malibu that will serve you anything you want, as long as what you want is steak  and clams? How about sushi? Does that count?  </P> <P> Just west of downtown, the Mexican fish restaurant Ostioneria Colima is as  minimal as they come, with a menu nobody's ever consulted, an interior nobody's  designed and a building that barely exists. Colima's "dining room" consists of  a sort of lean-to behind the kitchen, made out of a sheet of corrugated  plastic, bamboo curtains and some poles, like a makeshift palapa you might find  sheltering a family on some deserted Yucatan beach. A faded lobster is painted  on one wall, a marlin on another. When it rains, you get wet.  </P> <P> When you slip into Colima from the parking lot, you seat yourself at one of a  half a dozen picnic tables, positioning yourself closer to either a speaker  blasting Mexican disco near the front or the thrumming racket of a massive  condenser motor, depending on your musical preference. It's a perfect spot to  kill a hot Saturday afternoon, slurping fresh Mexican oysters -- only $8 a  dozen -- and drinking cold cans of Tecate from the supermarket next door.  </P> <P> Everybody in the place will be eating cocteles, big goblets of shrimp or  octopus or (canned) abalone marinating in the traditional sauce of catsup,  water and chopped onion. A waiter will bring crackers and show you how to dose  your coctel with lime and still more catsup -- he has a special fluttery  technique for speeding the flow from a Heinz bottle.  </P> <P> The ritual is fun, but his concoction serves mainly to hide the good, fresh  taste of the seafood. Chase your beer with tostadas de ceviche instead, thick,  fried corn tortillas spread with a chopped salad of marinated raw fish, onion  and shredded carrot, sharp with the tang of vinegar, mellow with toasted corn,  sweetly fishy in an extremely pleasant way, dusted with fresh cilantro -- it  goes with Tecate the way Roquefort goes with Sauternes.  </P> <P> Order the half-lobster, and the waiter will lean over and whisper  confidentially, "You know, it will take 20 minutes, this lobster." What he  doesn't tell you is that it will be frying all that time.  </P> <P> When it finally arrives, it is like lobster jerky, permanently welded to its  shell. (As one particularly stubborn bit of meat finally yielded, I had been  using such force that it flew, attached shell fragment and all, clear across  the dining room, nearly missing the skull of a burly garage mechanic at another  table.) The flesh is as tough as a rawhide chew toy -- which, if my experiences  in the lobster houses of Puerto Nuevo can be viewed as typical, is undoubtedly  authentic. Still, the lobster is really tasty, full of sweet, briny flavor, and  it comes with a dip that resembles what gets squirted on your popcorn in  second-run movie houses. You'll probably hate it; I found it something of a  guilty pleasure. And the curry-yellow rice and soupy stewed beans that come  along with entrees here are terrific.  </P> <P> Shrimp soup and fish soup are just OK here, heavy with the potatoey taste of  overcooked vegetables. Order instead camarones rancheros, the best entree, and  you'll get a dozen meaty shrimp sauteed with crisp green peppers, swimming in a  light, buttery tomato sauce touched with garlic. The dish is a little rustic,  folk-arty, a version of the minimalist kind of thing Angeli's Evan Kleiman  might scour fishing villages for if she specialized in Mexico instead of Italy.  </P> <P> And that's about it for the Ostioneria, whose menu is, after all, extremely  minimal . . . but so is the tab. The only beverages available are Coke, 7-up  and a sickly yellow fluid the counterguy called, appropriately, "pineapple  water." BYOB.  </P> <P>  Ostioneria Colima, 1465 W. Third St., Los Angeles, (213) 482-4152. Open seven  days, 11:30 a.m.-9 p.m. Cash only. Lot parking. No alcohol. Lunch for two, food  only, $6-20.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: Norsk Hydro upgrades PVC sites Norsk Hydro, Norway's largest publicly-quoted company, plans to invest NKr700m (Dollars 102.9m) to increase the capacity of its PVC plants in the UK and Norway. It is also scrapping plans for a new plant in Rafnes, Norway, and will not expand output in Stenungsund, Sweden. The company will strengthen its position in the UK market by upgrading capacity by 60,000 tonnes at its PVC plant at Aycliffe, north-east England. The plant has annual production capacity of 130,000 tonnes. Hydro is the UK's second-largest supplier of PVC and commands about 25 per cent of the market. In Heroeya, Norway, where it has a PVC plant with an expected lifetime of no more than three years, the company intends to lift annual production by 15,000 tonnes to 80,000 tonnes. Production in Norway is aimed primarily at the Scandinavian market, where Hydro has a 40 per cent market share. The company believes worldwide consumption of PVC will rise by 5 per cent annually towards the year 2000. 'Today, PVC production in Europe does not fully cover demand, and PVC prices are rising,' said Mr Haakon Langballe, president of Hydro's petrochemicals division.</p>

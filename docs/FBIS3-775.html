He condemned the African National Congress [ANC] for its  "onslaught" in the homeland to topple President Lucas Mangope.  He also accused the government of willfully watching the  goings-on. "The ANC demonstrated what use they have of  violence...If this is the pattern for the future it spells no  good for South Africa." Both the government and the ANC could  not be allowed to dominate South Africa, he said.    There was tension between him and the controlling bodies of  the AVF [Afrikaner National Front]. He had also realised he was  not acceptable to a "large proportion" of AVF supporters, the  general said. Also, many of his supporters, had urged him to  create an opportunity not to vote for the National Party [NP].  He had also experienced "great pressure" from the security  forces that they did not want to vote for the NP.    Gen Viljoen said he had by Saturday morning not had contact  with Dr Hartzenberg. There was a good relationship between him  and Dr Hartzenberg and he would assist him in strategic planning  as military adviser, said the general.</p>

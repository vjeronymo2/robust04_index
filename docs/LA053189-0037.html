			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAM BUILDING AND ACROBATICS FEATURED;  </P> <P> NO 'GODDESS' SHOWN ON CHINA TV  </P> <P> Wu, a physician and viewer from afar of China's student democracy movement,  listened with amusement Tuesday to a description of the "Goddess of Democracy"  statue that students have erected in Beijing's main square.  </P> <P> As the visitor's tale ended, Wu moved to switch on the nightly national news on  television broadcast from the capital.  </P> <P> "I am doubtful," he said as a map of China appeared on the screen. "That kind  of thing probably won't be shown."  </P> <P> Wu's doubts were well founded, for a brief opening of the window of China's  televised news has been shut. On Tuesday's broadcast, no crowds in Tian An Men  Square were shown, nor was the raising of the enormous statue clutching a  torch, looking somewhat like the Statue of Liberty in New York harbor. No  fresh-faced students pleaded that their message be carried forth to all corners  of the land.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stories on Troops, Dam  </P> <P> Instead, there was a report on troops camped on the outskirts of Beijing --  they were shown goose-stepping for a visiting Communist party dignitary; a  story about the building of a dam -- plenty of pictures of earth movers moving  earth; and one about the return of a young acrobatics team from a triumphant  tour of Italy -- scenes of kids balancing trays piled high with champagne  glasses on their feet.  </P> <P> "Well, maybe last week they would have shown it, but not now," said Wu, sighing  and flicking off the set.  </P> <P> The difference between last week and this is the apparent strengthening of  hard-line leaders in Beijing in their battle with political reformers, led by  the embattled Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang.  </P> <P> A week ago, Chinese government television, called CCTV, offered lively accounts  of the turbulence in Beijing. It was perhaps the first time under Communist  rule that television gave freewheeling coverage to any controversial domestic  event.  </P> <P> The venture into uncensored TV was not to last.  </P> <P> Reports from Beijing say that Premier Li Peng, the conservative who appears to  be coming out on top in the power struggle in the party's top ranks, has  handpicked a five-member committee to watch for transgressions in the press and  on television. The committee takes over from Hu Qili, the party's propaganda  chief and a close associate of Zhao who has probably lost his seat on the  ruling Politburo.  </P> <P> Hu had not been known generally as one who gave television news free rein. But  as the struggle in Beijing developed, half a billion potential viewers were  treated to a rare, clear account of Chinese events.  </P> <P> During the course of a week, CCTV carried several dramatic moments of the  student movement.  </P> <P> There was the May 18 confrontation between student leaders and Li. Students had  demanded that Li not only meet with them but that the proceedings be televised.  They were, and the students took every advantage.  </P> <P> They accused Li of talking around their demand for greater democracy. The  cameras made the 60-year-old premier look doddering and jowly. Some students  who were on a hunger strike looked valiant and long-suffering. One wore a  hospital cloak and fainted at the end of the meeting.  </P> <P> Li appeared again on television the next day, this time among people more his  age. He was shown in the Great Hall of the People making a speech to party  functionaries, some of whom appeared to be propped up by their heavy Mao  jackets. Li then disappeared from view for a few days, replaced by messages  read into the camera or flashed on the screen.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in a moment of unfettered reporting, a TV journalist interviewed a  soldier on the street who admitted that his troops could not enter the city  because of barricades put up by the demonstrating students and the masses of  citizens blocking their way.  </P> <P> "Under such circumstances, we feel very embarrassed," the officer admitted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Was Shown Greeting Envoys  </P> <P> Finally, last Thursday, Li appeared once more, but this time in the ritualized  role of a leader in charge: He greeted ambassadors from other countries,  telling them that all China is tranquil.  </P> <P> Television also slipped into a ritualized role. The news broadcasts returned to  their previous pat manner. Several opened with written messages from government  organizations urging the students to give up.  </P> <P> While other cities and provinces have no alternative to the official view,  television viewers in Hong Kong do, and some residents of this southern city  can pick up their news from there. Only 75 miles away, Hong Kong beams its own  news programs here, along with a dominant fare of soap operas, American-made  sitcoms and sexy swimwear ads.  </P> <P> For good reception, the Cantonese put up antennas that are nicknamed "fish  bones" because of their shape. Recently, the provincial government urged  viewers to abandon Hong Kong television because of its immoral tendencies, but  a look at the fish bone-rich Canton skyline suggests that hardly anyone took  the advice seriously.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Silly' to Restrict News  </P> <P> "To us it seems silly for the government to restrict news. We can get all we  want from Hong Kong," said Wu. He added that he sympathizes with the students  but has taken no part in the few demonstrations that have occurred in Canton.  </P> <P> The Hong Kong news opened not only with a report on the "Goddess of Democracy"  but also with news that police in Beijing may have rounded up several union  activists in secret arrests. Wu did not switch back to CCTV after the news but  kept on watching the Hong Kong channel, where "The Graduate," starring Dustin  Hoffman, was set to play.  </P></p>

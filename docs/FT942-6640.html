			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Back on track - Cookery courses Before British Rail was created after the second world war, each of the independent railway companies had its own palatial hotel tucked behind its main terminal. In the majority of cases, the impressive shells of these buildings have survived although, in the intervening years, something of the spirit of British Rail crept into their corridors and public rooms, so that only the unwitting ever stayed in them. But one superb old station hotel has come in from the cold. The Regent Hotel in Marylebone Road, London, used to be called the Great Central, one of the last railway hotels to be built and one of the first to close its doors when it was requisitioned for troops in the second world war and turned into offices for the newly-founded British Rail immediately after. Fortunately, neither the soldiers nor the bureaucrats did much harm to the hotel's interior and, after a 3 1/2 -year restoration, it opened as an hotel in spring last year. The present owner, Four Seasons Hotels, has taken the bold step of establishing an Italian restaurant there. The chef is Paolo Simioni, who had a Michelin star at the Ristorante Concorde di Villa Poma in Mantua. It is for Simioni's north Italian cooking that the Regent is of interest: this is certainly one of the best Italian restaurants in London. Simioni is a stickler for quality ingredients. He shows off his collection of olive oils with pride, many of which he flavours with herbs and spices. Most things he can get in London, but a few special ingredients have to be flown from Italy, such as the buffalo-milk ricotta cheese which arrives on Tuesday every week and is used up by Thursday. He has a passion for vinegars including a 15-year-old vin santo from Badia a Coltibuono and numerous ancient balsamic products. Pasta is made on the premises; not just the very trendy squid-ink pasta but a deep-purple variety coloured with beetroot juice; fresh herb paste; and the more usual green, spinach pasta. The beetroot tortellini with ricotta were so good they were delicious raw (but even better cooked). He even makes a speciality of a rare style of pasta called garganelli where little squares are rolled round a stick and pinched together. Naturally, risotto is a strong suit. With crab and leeks, it was a notable success. Sea bass is stuffed into ravioli and served with big chunks of lobster. And the garganelle are presented with a spring sauce flavoured with saffron. One dish which was sadly out of season was a cup made from parmigiano reggiano cheese filled with cappelletti and a cheese and white truffle paste. From June, the Regent is offering readers the chance to learn to cook some of Simioni's dishes from the master himself. Courses take place on one Saturday a month and last for an hour. For Pounds 38, students also get a wine tasting, practical experience, a three-course lunch in the dining room, and half a bottle of wine - which sounds a generous package. Inquiries to Charlotte Lawson at the Regent Hotel (tel: 071-631 8000, fax 631 8080). Apply well in advance: for reasons of insurance in the kitchen, those taking part are limited to four a session.</p>

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Police act on Treuhand charges POLICE yesterday started investigating several investors in eastern Germany after evidence from the Treuhand, the agency charged with restructuring and privatising industry in the east, alleging corruption or misuse of funds. Two directors of Twenty First Century, a Malaysian-based subsidiary of Dalmia, the Indian conglomerate, were temporarily detained after allegedly misusing funds granted by the Treuhand for environmental clean-up and other investments. Dalmia had bought two east German enterprises employing more than 1,700 workers. According to the Treuhand, the company had invested only a small fraction of the DM100m (Pounds 40m) originally committed in its contract with the Treuhand. Police have also taken action against Mr Wolfgang Greiner, who has bought 18 enterprises since late 1990 from the Treuhand's regional branch in Halle, near Leipzig. He has been accused of defrauding the Treuhand of DM24m. The agency has also heavily penalised Alcor AG, a Swiss trading house, for breach of contract because it failed to guarantee 1,700 jobs until the end of 1994. It will have to pay heavy compensation for redundancies. The action follows a decision this week to establish a department to monitor implementation of the 40,000 sales contracts so investment commitments and job guarantees are honoured until the contracts expire. Most contracts are spread over four or five years. A spokesman for the Treuhand said the agency was determined to close loopholes, introduce more accountability, and send a signal to those who have already bought property from the Treuhand that every contract will be monitored. He added that between 30 and 40 of the total 40,000 contracts drawn up by the Treuhand were considered 'criminal cases'.</p>

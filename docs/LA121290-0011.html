			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL NATIONAL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PERFECT WITHOUT PRACTICE, VANDERBILT'S GRANT BEATS NO. 11 GEORGIA, 75-74  </P> <P> Steve Grant thought the time was right to launch the first three-point shot of  his career. And when his 26-foot jump shot connected with one second remaining  in overtime, it gave Vanderbilt a 75-74 upset victory over previously unbeaten  and 11th-ranked Georgia in the Southeastern Conference game at Nashville, Tenn.  Tuesday night.  </P> <P> "Grant has never taken a three-point shot in practice and never will,"  Vanderbilt Coach Eddie Fogler said. "That was helter-skelter. We were just  trying to find an open man before they got set."  </P> <P> Vanderbilt (4-3) sent the game into overtime on two free throws by Bruce Elder  with 25 seconds left in regulation.  </P> <P> Georgia (5-1) tried a desperation full-court pass with one second left, but  Elder intercepted the ball at the buzzer.  </P> <P> No. 2 Arkansas 101, South Alabama 91 -- Todd Day had 20 of his 26 points in the  second half to lead the Razorbacks at Fayetteville, Ark., in a game that was  delayed an hour when the officials didn't show up.  </P> <P> Arkansas (8-1) never trailed and led by as many as 13 points during the first  half.  </P> <P> Lee Mayberry added 25 points for Arkansas. Marvin Eackles led the South Alabama  (4-1) with 18 points and Bobby Curtis added 17.  </P> <P> Arkansas said officials from the Sun Belt Conference, of which South Alabama is  a member, were scheduled to work the game but either were not assigned or did  not show up.  </P> <P> A call went out in the area for officials and the game was worked by Mike Fox,  a Southwest Conference official, and Johnny Gabbard, a local high school  official.  </P> <P> No. 14 St. John's 57, Brooklyn College 47 -- Freshman Shawnelle Scott, starting  for one of two suspended St. John's players, scored 20 points as the Redman  hung on for a narrow victory at New York.  </P> <P> The Redmen (7-0) were playing without senior forward Billy Singleton and junior  guard Chucky Sproling, who were suspended for the game by the school for  failure to adhere to athletic department academic rules and regulations.  </P> <P> REGIONAL HIGHLIGHTS  </P> <P> EAST  </P> <P> Boston College 80, Providence 78 -- Free throws by Gerrod Abram and David  Hinton in the final minute of play lifted the Eagles over the visiting Friars  in the Big East opener for both teams.  </P> <P> The free throws offset a late rush by Providence's Eric Murdock, who scored a  career-high 34 points, including seven consecutive free throws in the final 77  seconds.  </P> <P> Boston College (7-1) ended a four-game, two-year Friar winning streak against  the Eagles. It was only the Eagles' third victory over Providence in the last  11 games.  </P> <P> Providence (6-1) was playing without three starters, who were suspended as the  result of a brawl in a Friar victory over Rhode Island Saturday. Corey Floyd,  Ken McDonald and Marvin Saddler were suspended for three games each.  </P> <P> MIDWEST  </P> <P> Orlando Stewart scored the final seven points for St. Louis, including a  three-point shot with 36 seconds left, and two free throws with 15 seconds  remaining to lift the Billikens to a 64-60 victory over Santa Clara at St.  Louis. . . . Northern Iowa ended a two-game losing streak with a 68-62 victory  over Iowa State, for its first victory over the Cyclones in 14 games. Iowa  State lost for the eighth time in a row, its worst start in 15 years. . . .  Carl Hayes scored 21 points to help Nebraska beat Wisconsin, 75-63, at Madison,  Wis.  </P> <P> WEST  </P> <P> Dion Brown scored 27 points and had 10 rebounds as Washington beat Nevada,  64-60, at Reno. The Huskies are 6-0. . . . Neil Derrick scored 24 points as  Washington State overcame a sluggish start in a 101-65 victory over Cal State  Sacramento at Pullman, Wash. The Cougars are 2-2.  </P></p>

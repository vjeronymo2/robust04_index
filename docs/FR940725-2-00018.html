The Amended PR Agreement revises the existing partial requirements arrangement between the parties to broaden the types of power supply arrangements that AMEA may obtain. In addition, the cost allocation and rate design methodology for partial requirements service has been revised so that the rates will not have to be redesigned in the event AMEA elects to enter into such other arrangements. The revised rates are revenue neutral when compared to the rates under the existing PR Agreement. The TCS Agreement makes available to AMEA other transmission and complementary services that are, or may be, required in conjunction with resource purchases by AMEA or with other transactions in which AMEA may desire to engage from time to time. The rates, terms, and conditions applicable to these services are set forth in exhibits appended to the TCS Agreement, many of which utilize formula rate methodologies and procedures. The Company submitted informational schedules and workpapers in support of these charges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> July 29, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph E at the end of this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 19.

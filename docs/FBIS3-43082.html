			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview between Boris Saltykov, Minister of Science and </F> Technical Policy RF, and Olga Kolesova: ``The Winter of Our  Science''; the first two paragraphs are an introduction]    [Text] It is cold in the unheated offices of Academy  institutes in Siberia. There also is cold in the hearts of  scientific specialists forever awaiting budget reductions or a  simple cutback. The most warmth-loving long ago were drawn to  the south, but more likely to the west...    Our correspondent took advantage of a visit of Boris  Saltykov, Minister of Science and Technical Policy of the  Russian Federation, to Novosibirsk, to inquire when there might  be a thaw for science.    Kolesova: Boris Georgiyevich, two years in the  ministerial seat these days is not a short time. So many changes  have occurred that each year one can count on three, and maybe  even ten. Have you had a change in your points of view on the  goals and methods for the reformation of science?    Saltykov: There has been a definite evolution in  points of view, I think, among all members of the government and  among all the citizens of Russia. We began reforms in 1991  without having had any practical experience in carrying them out  and therefore there was a definite idealism, purely theoretical  ideas of what had to be done.    On the whole the strategic ideas on the principal goals of  science reform have almost not changed. However, the forms, the  methods and the sequence of different measures had to be changed  as we went along, taking the developing economic and social  conditions into account. It was immediately clear to us: the  model of science which had been adapted to the  administrative-command control system inevitably had to be  changed because by that time the system had already changed. By  late 1991 all the branch ministries had collapsed and this means  that all the branch science which they fed had already come  apart at the seams. It was necessary to construct new  mechanisms, to devise new structures for its funding and control.    The idealism was manifested in the fact that we clearly had  underrated the stability of the old system, its capacity to  resist. When reforms began in the economy science (however, like  culture as well) suffered more than other branches. This was not  the fault of the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy, but  its misfortune. A substantially lesser growth of prices was  predicted for early 1992. We anticipated that in 1992 the budget  would be reduced by 40-50%, but the results for the year  showed  that it had fallen by almost a factor of three. This was a shock  for science. And our role under these shock conditions was to  react rapidly, to devise survival mechanisms. In short, whereas  initially the first priority was to bring the system for  organizing and funding science into line with the conditions of  the expanding market, by the spring of 1992 the problem of  elementary survival had already arisen. And it was important  (this, incidentally, was the most difficult task) to save the  best, sacrificing -- if necessity dictated -- that whose loss  would not exert too great an influence on the scientific  capabilities of the country. To be sure, the principal  difficulties arose in the choice of priorities due to the  enormous inertia of the former system. Let's say that we  inherited about 40 scientific-technical programs -- strongly  validated, organizationally formulated, but in many respects no  longer corresponding to the needs of 1992, much less 1993. It  was very difficult to change them. A start was made by replacing  several program directors.    In general I would say as follows: life constantly teaches  its lessons. The changes which occurred dictated that we take  new approaches. For example, the implementation of the program  for state scientific centers in early 1992 was planned in a  different form. But the crisis in branch science already by late  1992 forced a search for new forms of immediate assistance to  the best scientific and technical organizations in Russia.    And evolution of points of view of the type: we thought, it  is necessary to go to the market, but now we understood that it  was necessary to leave everything as it was, something which,  Thank God, did not occur. In general, however, the process of  acquiring work experience under conditions which were unusual  for us turned out to be not very easy. And this experience,  especially for high-level directors, in my opinion, was  invaluable.    Kolesova: ``There is too much science in our  country'' -- that is a contention with which everyone  mercilessly scolds you -- from academician to common folk. Do  you by chance not intend to refute it?    Saltykov: This thesis in actuality was advanced by  me early in 1992, but it was employed in a definite context.  There was probably as much science as was required by that  system which existed several years ago: a system which was  ideologized, militarized, oriented on the needs of a great  military power. But we changed the system: we decided that it  was necessary to cut the army in half, to reduce unnecessary  expenditures on defense because precisely they stifled the  civilian branch (we had five times more tanks than did the  United States!). Accordingly, in our country there came to be  many who were employed in the research, development, testing and  engineering fields, especially those who were related to defense  orders. This does not at all mean that we have too many educated  or too many talented people (and sometimes it is precisely so  interpreted to me). But it is just the other way around: the  more educated and talented people there are in society, the  better. But, after all, scientific specialists and engineers are  not simply educated people, but people producing some product  which must be required by society. Either fundamental knowledge  is involved, or practical development work, oriented on  industry, defense, etc. Specialists at any scientific research  institute know very well that each institute has been  supersaturated with people -- in the distant golden 1960's when  petroleum dollars flowed in a river and virtually everything  which was applied for was funded. To be sure, I exaggerate, but  not by much.    A civilian society, in which the interests of all layers of  society are balanced, must count its resources and also must  count its expenditures on science. All the time they say about  me: ``He wants to cut back on fundamental science.'' However,  even fundamental science has its funding sources. It is known  that even the Academy has received 30-40% of its funding  from  defense orders. And if we all are in agreement that expenditures  on defense must be reduced, it is inevitable that the Academy  will be allocated 30-40% less. Or that this percentage  must be  taken from another part of the budget. But from what part? At  whose expense?    Incidentally, one of the results of activity of the Soros  Fund was the appearance of interesting statistics. It was found  that from almost a million ``statistical'' scientific workers in  Russia during the last five years only 21 thousand have three  (or more) publications in prestigious scientific journals, ours  and foreign. Well, let's assume that an equal number simply did  not submit applications. And, unfortunately, this is a quite  objective evaluation of those really ``producing'' new knowledge  in fundamental science! Our drama was that in our country there  was a very labor-intensive (in contrast to fund-intensive)  development path, including in science as well. Whereas, for  example, in Europe, United States and Japan one scientist and  corresponding equipment are adequate for performing any work,  this would take us three researchers and five technicians. That  is, we have made up for the shortage of modern equipment by  work, sometimes even work by highly skilled specialists.  Accordingly, in the event of a changeover to advanced research  technologies reserves will be found for reducing numbers. On the  other hand, these people could successfully find themselves in  such organizations necessary for a market economy as those  introducing new technologies, consulting and servicing firms,  certification and information centers, etc. In the technically  well-developed countries this infrastructure is extremely well  developed and a great number of specialists are employed in it.    Kolesova: Many provincial scientists, including  those in Siberia, have suspected: the minister -- in any case at  the beginning of his activity -- held the opinion that all  science was concentrated within the limits of the Sadovoye Ring.    Saltykov: Just plain slander. I always criticized  the organization of our science precisely for the fact that in  the administrative system all decisions were made at the center.  And certainly in this sense Moscow made mistakes in the  distribution of resources. Accordingly, I am speaking out  precisely for the maximum decentralization of the making of  decisions, in particular, with respect to the allocation of  funding.    But when they tell me that it is necessary to elect  scientists to the Academy of Sciences not only from Moscow, but  from each provincial city because ``there are no academicians  there,'' I protest. Despite this, members must be elected on the  basis of the results of their work, not by place of residence.    Kolesova: Could you not formulate the key points  in the present-day scientific policy of the government, since  sometimes the fear arises that there simply is none...    Saltykov: There is a concept, and it is not the  result of office meditations of ministerial officials. It was  formulated together with the leading scientists of the country  and was discussed at the All- Russian Conference of Scientific  Workers and in the government. In the concept which is today  being implemented there are two main goals: creation of new  mechanisms for organizing and funding of science corresponding  to a market economy and conservation of the capabilities  accumulated over the course of the entire evolution of Russian  science. Among the methods for implementing these goals it is  necessary to mention the creation of alternative  extradepartmental funding sources. This funding system is  primarily governmental. One fund, for fundamental research, has  already been established; we are striving to set up a second for  research in the humanities. We also are approving the setting up  of regional funds. Incidentally, a good example is in Siberia:  the Krasnoyarsk Regional Science Support Fund.    With respect to applied science, there, as it seems to us  today, two processes should be at work. First, transformation of  some of the former branch institutes by means of organization of  joint stock companies, privatization and merging with some  production structures into companies heavily oriented on  science, large or small, which will live, as they say, ``from  the market,'' filling orders of consumers, among which the state  may be one. However, the institutes most important for the state  itself and for the time being (or in principle) not intended for  the market consumer are being transformed into state scientific  centers and are receiving considerable support from the budget,  although, to be sure, a search for clients is not forbidden them.    If one speaks of the entire innovative sphere, we will  assume  that it is necessary to develop small-scale innovative business.  We allocated an item in the budget for the funding of business  insurance policies and business motor pools, the ``incubators of  business,'' but for the time being there are no good mechanisms  for such support.    Still another of the principal points in our scientific  policy: a system for selecting priorities and funding in  priority directions, finalized, primarily, in the form of state  scientific and technical programs. This will make it possible to  fund important research within the framework of fundamental  programs having good coordinating structures: ``High-Energy  Physics,'' ``Human Genome,'' ``New Methods in Bioengineering,''  etc.    Another part is programs oriented on use in the economy.  Here, for the time being there are difficulties because it is  unclear how under market economy conditions it is possible to  distribute the rights of ownership for the results obtained  during work under a government program.    Finally, in the present-day difficult situation an acute  problem, as before, is the brain drain and ways to contend with  it. The ``Government Professor'' project already has been in  preparation for a year. The essence of this project is the  payment of the elite part of our scientists such sums as would  enable them not to think of departure for abroad.    Kolesova: Insofar as I understand, this idea found  its reflection, highly distorted, to be sure, in a recent  presidential decree entitled ``Material Support of Scientists.''  Under the circumstances of adoption of this decree, once again  there is evidently a manifestation of the disagreement between  your ministry and the Presidium of the Russian Academy of  Sciences, already becoming traditional, which in no way  strengthens the position of scientists in society and the  government...    Saltykov: We worked on the ``Government  Professor'' draft together, both the Academy and the Ministry. A  working group was organized in the Ministry of Science and  Technical Policy which included representatives of the Russian  Academy of Sciences, universities and government agencies and  these were the authors of this project. And we thought out the  details: selection method and organization of expert councils  which would include foreign scientists. But it turned out that  the preparation of the decree on ``Material Support of  Scientists'' went right past us, it did not receive the OK from  either the Minister of Science and Technical Policy or the  Minister of Finance or the science section of the government.    Kolesova: Why?    Saltykov: Don't ask me. They simply did not  present the draft to us.    The first point in this decree is seemingly a weak  reflection  of the ``Government Professor'' idea. But I assume that only the  vocabulary of the project was adopted: ``outstanding  scientists,'' ``stipends,'' etc. However, its essence has  nothing in common with the idea of contending with the brain  drain. First of all because there is violation of the  extradepartmental principle. With all respect to the Academy of  Sciences, it must be admitted that outstanding scientists are  working in both the higher educational institutions and in the  branches. It would be more natural to establish  extradepartmental councils for the selection. Incidentally, this  is not just my point of view -- after issuance of the decree  there was immediately a rain of accusations that the  universities and some ministries (the Ministry of Nuclear  Energy, for example, has excellent institutes at the academic  level) had been forgotten.    But the most important thing is the figures: the stipend for  an outstanding scientist, 75 thousand rubles, to be sure, cannot  pretend to be a realization of that idea which was embodied in  the ``Government Professor'' project. It is something else that  today any money is worth getting. But this is not a project for  contending with the brain drain; this is simply still another  stipend for some group of scientists.    The ``Government Professor'' project provided for a stipend  in the amount of a thousand dollars. A thousand dollars or five  hundred -- that can be debated -- but as you see, the scale is  completely different. It is not a matter of a dispute between  the ministry and the Academy, but an old fear: whether the  remaining scientific community will be insulted by designation  of such an elite?    I have dealt a great deal with the truly outstanding  scientists of our time and they are convinced: this would not  happen. Any proper differential treatment, for example, when a  person sells a license and receives three million, arouses no  envy among colleagues because they know that this money was  earned. It is far more dreadful when in such selections of the  elite one or two ill-chosen, inadequate persons are included.  The entire scientific community, indeed, knows what's up, who's  worth what. Such accidents therefore cannot be allowed.    But in the decree there is reference to such sums relative  to  which the lofty words ``material support of scientists'' are  inappropriate. For that reason as well the decree ought not have  been issued; a directive of the government would have been  entirely sufficient. Because scientists, to be sure, expected  major decisions.    Kolesova: Both during your visit to Novosibirsk  last year and today you spoke of the complex situation in the  government arising due to the strong pressure of some branches.  Did you make any attempts at organizing a strong science lobby?    Saltykov: Lobbying is not exclusively something  Russian, it is observed in all countries. If one speaks of the  relation of forces in the past parliament, there was a strong  agrarian lobby there, and it also exists in the government. The  organization of something similar for science is possible  through an adequate makeup of the State Duma, which need not  necessarily include scientists, but in any case intelligent  people understanding the role of science in the fate of Russia  and who understand clearly that expenditures on science must not  drop below a certain level.    Kolesova: Insofar as I know, you are running from  Novosibirsk Oblast in the ``Russian Election.'' In this  connection I ask the standard ``Bolshevik'' question: a minimum  program or a maximum program?    Saltykov: I have already set forth a maximum  program: to realize an increase in the fraction of the budget  for science in the coming year. The minimum program is to hold  at the same level. But I nevertheless will strive to achieve the  maximum program because this is an entirely realistic  parliamentary struggle. Excuse me for an entirely Bolshevik  answer: if the ``Russian Election'' turns out successfully we  will do everything in order to augment appropriations for  science.    Kolesova: Pardon me, but here's the traditional  challenge in the ``Russian Election,'' especially for candidate  ministers: you already have been in authority but expenditures  on science have in no way increased.    Saltykov: That is in error. We were in authority  only in 1992 and in 1993 the government became a coalition. I  don't have to tell you that the authority was in the hands of  the Supreme Soviet, not ours. A struggle of opinions developed,  alas, not to the advantage of science, although I also must bear  my share of responsibility. And nevertheless our principal task  now is to achieve an increase in the fraction of expenditures on  science in the Russian budget.    Kolesova: The last, purely personal question: are  you not weary of all this?    Saltykov: Fatigued, but also hardened.</p>

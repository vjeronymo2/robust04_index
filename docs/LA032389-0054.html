			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ORAL HISTORY REPOSITORY CHRONICLES THE COMMONPLACE  </P> <P> James Dodson considers himself an archeologist of ordinary memories.  </P> <P> From recollections of some "old bums" who lived under a lettuce shed to  memories of building a four-bedroom house for $75, Dodson's oral history  library at Valley College is a catchall of commonplace life in the San Fernando  Valley during the first four decades of this century.  </P> <P> "I just wanted to find out what life was like for the average person in the  Valley," said Dodson, curator of the college's Historical Museum, where the  library is housed. "I just wanted to know what people ate, what they raised in  their gardens, what clothes they wore and so on."  </P> <P> Dodson, who lives in La Crescenta, became the museum's volunteer curator -- it  is financed by private donations -- and started the oral history project in  1975, after 25 years of teaching history on the Van Nuys campus.  </P> <P> "I'm just one of the exhibits here," he said, shying away from mention of his  age.  </P> <P> Seated in a back room of the museum, Dodson fingered his collection of 70  audiotapes and glanced at the history around him: a panoramic photograph of the  Valley taken in 1912, an egg basket from the Lankershim Ranch in North  Hollywood and wooden mailboxes used by Valley College's first faculty in the  late 1940s.  </P> <P> Then he turned on the tape recorder.  </P> <P> "Well, my name is Rose Bundy, and I've lived in the Valley since 1923," one  tape begins. It was recorded in 1977, when the subject was in her 80s.  </P> <P> Bundy chronicles the trials of managing a chicken ranch in North Hollywood on  the corner of Lankershim and Victory boulevards during the 1920s, '30s and '40s  and raising rabbits there. During World War II, "we went through the rationing  period and rabbit wasn't rationed," Bundy recalls. "Well, I could sell rabbits  before they was born."  </P> <P> Others in Dodson's collection also cite memories of life at the chicken ranch,  which seemed to be a gathering spot for Valley residents. Dodson interviewed  one man who remembers playing on the ranch as a boy.  </P> <P> "He used to take a rooster to the top of the silo, tie a sheet to it for a  parachute and toss the rooster off," Dodson said. "I'll bet that rooster hated  the sight of that kid."  </P> <P> Dodson finds his subjects, who range in age from 60 to more than 90, through  associates who know of older residents in the area. They are sent a list of  questions -- which focus on social life, religion, education and politics,  among other topics -- a week before Dodson visits their homes.  </P> <P> "The questions help them consider things they haven't thought of in 30 or 40  years," Dodson said.  </P> <P> Charles Canby, who recorded a tape in 1977, said: "I think I was able to give  him some information that otherwise would have been lost."  </P> <P> Canby's father, Dr. Charles B. Canby, arrived in Van Nuys in 1918 and became  the area's third doctor, according to his son, 75, who also practiced medicine.  </P> <P> On his tape, Canby tells of the Los Angeles River when it was a "little,  meandering creek" that wound through the Valley.  </P> <P> "We used to go down there and fish for little minnows and catch crawfish and  collect butterflies," he says, adding that stands of black walnut, apricot and  orange trees were once abundant in the Valley.  </P> <P> Dodson recorded his own tape in 1977 to chronicle early life at Valley College.  On the tape, he speaks of rival basketball games played between the faculty  ("senior citizens") and the students, calling Mighty Ben McFarland and Walter  (Long Arms) Coulters among the faculty's better players.  </P> <P> Austin Conover, who once served as Valley College's public information officer,  said Dodson has been meticulous in assuring that tape transcriptions are  accurate.  </P> <P> "He wants it absolutely correct," Conover said. "He's done so much for the  museum. He's recognized that we're all mortal and will pass on. That's why it's  so important for oral history to be translated."  </P> <P> Dodson hopes that his tapes and transcriptions will be used as reference  material by future historians. But he would prefer that they listen to the  tapes before thumbing through transcriptions.  </P> <P> "A careful researcher will want to listen to the sound of a person's voice,"  said Dale Treleven, director of UCLA's oral history program. "In no way can  there be a one-to-one transfer of inflection, nuance, accent, emphasis and  irony in a person's voice when reading a transcription."  </P> <P> UCLA's oral history program, which began in 1959, is financed by the California  State Archives Government Oral History Program.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Projects  </P> <P> Other oral history projects in the Valley include a library of 30 tapes begun  by the Conejo Valley Historical Society in 1975. The tapes are kept at the  Stagecoach Inn Museum in Newbury Park, and copies can be found at the Thousand  Oaks Library.  </P> <P> The Chatsworth Historical Society began its collection of 21 tapes in 1982.  They are kept in the archives at Cal State Northridge.  </P> <P> The San Fernando Valley Historical Society began an oral history project in  1986 and now has a collection of 12 tapes, which are kept at the Andres Pico  Adobe museum in Mission Hills.  </P> <P> </P> <P> An Early Resident  </P> <P> In Valley College's museum, Dodson switched on a tape recorder to listen to one  of the Valley's earliest residents.  </P> <P> "My name is Lillian Rockwell Van Winkle. I've lived in the Valley since 1918,"  she begins. The voice cracks with 91 years of age, on a tape that was recorded  in 1976.  </P> <P> "I came to the San Fernando Hotel and lived and had my meals at Mother Van  Winkle's, who had lived here since 1887. I taught in the Mexican quarter."  </P> <P> Van Winkle pauses, then sighs deeply as she recalls her first view of the  Valley.  </P> <P> "It was a beautiful open valley, lovely stretches of beauty to me," she says.  "It was a joy. . . . It was heaven -- literally."  </P></p>

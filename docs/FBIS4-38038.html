			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz by Rafiq </F> Nasrallah in Beirut; date not given]    [Excerpt] [Nasrallah] The United States is said to have  asked Lebanon to hold separate talks with Israel. How do you  respond?    [Buwayz] The Lebanese media characteristically jump the gun  on political events. To date, we have not received any  invitation to restart the negotiations -- neither from the  United States nor from any other country. Reports about  separate deals, thus, do not add up.    I think there will be a kind of dynamism which the United  States will deploy both in regard to the Lebanese and Syrian  files. This initiative has yet to take shape. We don't know  yet whether it will it take the shape of Christopher's upcoming  visit to the region or an invitation to restart the negotiations?    [Nasrallah] There has been a major development recently in  the the Jordanian-Israeli track. How do you think this will  impact the overall negotiations, particularly regarding Lebanon,  and more especially given that southern Lebanon is on the  threshold of a major Israeli military escalation. Lebanon is  said to have been issued with what you might call an ultimatum  through the U.S. channel.    [Buwayz] Israeli threats are nothing new as far as Lebanon  is concerned. We have lived with them for many years. I can  tell you for certain, however, that such ultimatums will not  affect Lebanon's agenda.    Lebanon has incurred a heavy price in terms of its  sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. We are  not quitting half way down the road. The point I want to make  is that southern Lebanon will remain in a state of tension as  long as the Israeli occupation of the area remains and its  people are living under coercion. Any attempts to put an end to  practices [of resistance] in the south will not succeed as long  as the occupation remains in place. The only way out is for  Israel to start departing the south and reassuring the Lebanese  that it does not covet their land or resources. Resistance in  southern Lebanon is not a hobby pursued for its own sake. No  one wants to die for the sake of it. Those who die are giving  their souls for the sake of a cause which the they believe to be  a worthy one. National resistance is the outcome rather than  the cause of occupation.    [Nasrallah] Would you say that the developments in the  Jordanian-Israeli track has put an end to the cordon states  formula?    [Buwayz] We must see what happened on the Joran-Israel front  in perspective. Let's not blow it out of all proportion.  Naturally we would have liked Jordan to stay with us and  committed to the Madrid formula that gave birth to the bilateral  talks that took place in Washington. From our point of view,  the failure of the talks to make substantive progress,  especially on the Lebanese and Syrian tracks, does not warrant  the relocation of the negotiations from Washington to the  region. The movement of the negotiations from Washington takes  them away from the spotlight of world public opinion. At the  same time, the move reduces the American involvement and keeps  the United States from playing its role in full. Both in form  and content the Washington talks meet the requirements of the  peace process.    We would have liked Jordan to remain committed along with us  to the mechanism agreed to in Washington. As to the contention  that Jordan has gone its own way and signed, I have yet to hear  that Jordan has signed a peace treaty in the strict sense. The  two sides have agreed for the talks to be moved from Washington  to the Middle East, specifically to Jordan and Israel. Such a  step, in our assessment, could have waited. Again, to our  knowledge, Jordan has not signed a peace treaty. [passage  omitted]</p>

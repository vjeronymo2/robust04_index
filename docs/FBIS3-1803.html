The DPRK's acceptance of  nuclear inspections is prompted by its desire to improve  relations with the United States. It might also face  international economic sanctions if it continues to refuse entry  to international delegates to carry out inspections. The DPRK's  economy is going through a very difficult time. Continued  isolation from the international community could aggravate the  domestic political and economic situation, which is already  grim. Following the DPRK's acceptance of international nuclear  inspections, annual ROK-U.S. military exercises will be called  off, and a third round of talks between high-ranking officials  from the DPRK and the United States has been scheduled for the  second half of March -- both will help the DPRK break its  international isolation. For the United States, the biggest  worry in the Korean peninsula security question is its suspicion  about the DPRK's development of nuclear weapons, especially when  the DPRK announced on 12 March last year that it was withdrawing  from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to free itself from  restraints on its independent development of nuclear arms.  <H5>  Does Pyongyang Really Have Nuclear Weapons? </H5>   Does Pyongyang really have nuclear weapons? This is a  concern for the United States and its neighbors, such as the  ROK, Japan, and China. The long-term closed-door policy of the  Pyongyang authorities has made it next to impossible for the  outside world to know anything about the DPRK's national  defense, let its alone nuclear development. Japan is extremely  concerned about possible nuclear developments in the DPRK.  Around the world, four countries are suspected to be developing  nuclear warheads: Israel, South Africa, Iraq, and Pakistan.  Unlike those four, the DPRK's geographical location means that  it can launch two or three nuclear warheads against Japan. But  the DPRK has consistently denied it is developing nuclear  weapons and says that its nuclear technology only serves the  construction of nuclear power plants. The DPRK used to have  close ties with the former Soviet Union, and it is entirely  possible that Soviet nuclear and missile experts have helped  Pyongyang with its nuclear development. Japan believes that if  the DPRK has nuclear weapons, Japan should also be making them.  The United States says that it would not be unusual for the DPRK  to have more than 10 kg of plutonium by now, and that the DPRK  has been secretly developing nuclear warheads and carrier  rockets for two years and experimenting with detonators for  three years. Another expert view holds that the DPRK is  incapable of developing nuclear weapons. It is true that  Pyongyang badly wants to study and develop them, but it does not  have the economic strength and suffers acutely from electricity  shortages; the development of a nuclear industry requires  enormous electricity supplies.  <H5>  Pyongyang Develops Relations With ASEAN </H5>   The DPRK's economic situation also precludes it from  developing costly nuclear weapons. Last year, it completed its  third seven-year economic construction plan without achieving  the planned target of a 10-percent industrial growth rate --  officials said it was only 5.6 percent. The government has  designated the next three years as a period of economic  restructuring with the focus on developing food and light  industry and foreign trade. Such a move is bound to slow down  nuclear developments. The greatest disadvantages for the DRPK  are insufficient energy and food shortages. Its trade with  China has grown rapidly over the last two years from around $500  or $600 million to $900 million last year, mostly energy and  food imports from China. The view of the United States, Japan,  and the ROK is that the DPRK wants to develop nuclear weapons  very much but has shelved the project because of practical  difficulties. It remains to see whether the international  investigative team can get full cooperation from the DPRK and  can conduct its work smoothly there. However, the DPRK has  realized that Asia is the center of economic development and  hopes to strengthen its economic ties with the Asia- Pacific  region with requests to participate in the ASEAN economic  conference. All of this signals a policy change toward  embracing the international community. Opening the country to  nuclear inspections is part of that change.</p>

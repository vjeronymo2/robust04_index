			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Weapons go AWOL in army accounts The National Audit Office has found serious accounting deficiencies in the rundown of the British army in Germany. Missing items in the withdrawal included sub-machine guns, rifles, other automatic weapons, 60 pounds of plastic explosive and 110 detonators. Some vehicles were also unaccounted for. A small test audit showed that 10 per cent of equipment could not be located. In the case of one large store, the audit office found a virtual loss of accounting control during closure. After internal inquiries the Ministry of Defence has concluded that no weapons have been physically lost. Instead, the problem is blamed on a failure to complete the correct documentation. The weapons were traced, and the explosives had apparently been used in training but had been listed on the accounts as missing for nearly three years. Repatriating service personnel and equipment to Britain is acknowledged by the audit office to be a complex logistical task. But it has also found that a backlog of uncompleted accounts is building up and could get even worse.</p>

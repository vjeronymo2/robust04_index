			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Declaration of the Republic Committee of the Communist </F> Party of Crimea"]    [Text] The Supreme Council of the Republic of Crimea has  reinstated the validity of certain provisions of the Republic of  Crimea Constitution of 6 May 1992, thereby providing a pretext  for interpreting this step as a premise for violation of the  territorial integrity of Ukraine.    While understanding the motives guiding the people's  deputies, the Republic Committee of the Communist Party of  Crimea nonetheless considers it its duty to declare that this  step contradicts the Constitution of Ukraine and generally  recognized principles of international law, providing  dishonorable politicians an opportunity to stir up conflict.  This is exactly what has prompted the sense of alert with which  the world is following the development of events around the  peninsula.    However, something else is also drawing attention. Why is it  precisely right now that Crimea is surrounded with such  attention?    The president of Ukraine has long been attempting to  postpone  the elections of the president and local councils. Rumors  persistently abound regarding the incapacity of the new Supreme  Council of Ukraine, on the possible introduction of presidential  rule, and then--on elimination of the very system of councils as  organs of true sovereignty of the people.    Those who would like to see this have placed their hopes in  a  breakdown of the elections of the Supreme Council of Ukraine.  Not only did the elections take place, however--they also  constituted in essence a universal referendum which the  president has always avoided (contrary to the demands of the  miners) and which in fact condemned the course of the Ukrainian  leadership to one of self-isolation and severed ties with Russia  and other CIS countries, though in words there is no shortage of  oaths testifying to the benefit of such ties.    Is this not why the presidents of Russia and Ukraine  urgently  needed (just as was the case during the "conflict" in Odessa  prior to the second round of voting in the elections to the  Supreme Council of Ukraine) to tie into a single knot the  boycott by national-democrats of the functioning of the Supreme  Council of Ukraine, the tension surrounding Crimea, the resolute  declarations of ministers of defense and politicians, and the no  less haughty and disdainful utterances of B. Yeltsin "warning"  the Ukrainian president? Here they were counting on providing  the president of Ukraine a "pretext" for the introduction of  presidential rule and for postponing the elections of the  president and local councils. And on the president being able to  "save face" in this regard, "basing" this step on the highest  interests--the preservation of peace and tranquility in Ukraine  and in the world.    A dishonest game, a hypocritical position that can lead to  bloodshed--this is the price of that "anxiety" over the  situation in Crimea we hear resounding in speeches in Kiev and  Moscow, in the calls to "stand up for Crimea" that are ringing  out in response on the peninsula itself.    We turn to the deputies of the Supreme Councils of Crimea  and  Ukraine, and to political parties and movements, with the  following appeal: Realize in whose hands you may turn out to be  a tool, though guided by the finest motives. We call upon you  not to provide any pretext for canceling the elections of the  president and local councils in Ukraine. For if these elections  are not held, it will be a victory for reactionary forces. A  victory the consequences of which will be tragic for the fate of  social justice, democracy, and the striving to unite the peoples  of all fraternal republics!    People, be vigilant!</p>

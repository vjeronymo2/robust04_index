			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Third of an unspecified number of installments of an </F> "abridged" interview with Kurdish Workers Party, PKK, leader  Abdullah Ocalan by correspondents Ertugrul Kurkcu, Ragip Duran,  and Behcet Avsar in Barr Ilyas in Lebanon on 21 March] [Editor's  note: OZGUR GUNDEM was closed after publishing the following.]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted]    Question: Well, where does the solution rest then?    Ocalan: In a free democratic atmosphere! There  should be an opportunity for the free exchange of views and  political choice by removing the shadow of coercion. What I  really mean is using the right of engaging in secure politics.  If you guarantee this security throughout Turkey, I will have  no other demands concerning the Kurdish problem. I want to  engage in politics in an atmosphere in which arms are silent.  This is a reasonable right. If you give the guarantee, then I  will go in among the Kurds and Turks and engage in politics. If  there is a real desire to end this war, I am all for it, really.  And I will propose no preconditions regarding the Kurds'  demands. Let the use of force be removed. Yes, to engage in  free politics...    Question: I am pleased to hear this. I have an  actor friend who knows nothing beyond the propaganda in the  press. When I told him that "Apo [alias for Abdullah Ocalan]  might be satisfied with entering the parliament as a deputy from  Diyarbakir or might be satisfied only with forming his own  party," he replied: "Is that all?" I just wanted to mention  this.    Ocalan: Of course. This will require some  negotiation. What I am saying is: Let us smooth these problems  over. The use of political rights depends on particular  guarantees. If I go there today, they will detain me and hang  me tomorrow. The DEP [Democracy Party] was ostensibly given the  right to engage in politics but now its members are facing  execution on charges of being "traitors to the country." But I  would want to engage in secure politics. I will seek security  in the Constitution and the law. Not satisfied with that, I  will ask for particular institutional measures. Being a  democrat, I believe in a Kurdish identity. I will address the  people with this identity of mine. This should have a place in  the law. Let us make the necessary changes. Why should you  [the Turks] impose your own arrangements on me by unilaterally  denying everything that defines me? Will anything remain of  democracy if you act like that? In the context of democracy  there should be Kurdish parties and social and political  institutions. There are lots of local problems to be tackled.  So there will be local administrations. There will be local  parliaments. But there are also things to be tackled together  with the Turks. We will carry out joint government and  parliamentary work. Some do not want to understand this. Let  them come to me. I will explain all this in one go. I did not  attend the law faculty but I can show them how to do what. I am  looking for a counterpart. Let anyone with confidence in  himself come here so that we can rearrange all these things  within the context of Turkey's unity and territorial integrity.    Question: Who do you want? Who will we bring to  you?    Ocalan: Anyone. I am even ready for an ordinary  civil servant. Let him come so that heeding the people's voice,  we can stop this conflict and usher in freedom of thought and  particular political choices away from the shadow of arms. No  one is avoiding this. I am ready to open a debate about  particular and very modest democratic demands. I am asking you:  Do you have such a counterpart for me?    Question: They do not respect me, otherwise I  would have come to the talks. I do not know if those higher up  would. But what clear-cut communal and political projects is the  PKK offering for the meaningful, democratic, free, peaceful, and  stable solution of this problem?    Ocalan: We want to reorganize the historic  Turkish-Kurdish relations. History shows these relations. They  began under Sultan Selcuk and peaked under Sultan Yavuz. They  also form the foundation of the Republic established by Mustafa  Kemal. These relations must be admitted first. We want to  surmount the blind policy of violence, which is against the  interests of the Kurdish people and goes as far as to deny all  its national democratic demands and identity and even  annihilates it. The following are some of the fundamental  principles needed to surmount the current policy: (1) The  recognition of Kurdish-Turkish relations. (2) The suspension of  the policy of violence against and the assimilation of the  Kurds, that is, the erosion of the Kurdish identity. (3) I am  saying that alongside the institutions suitable for each  people's national identity, there is a need to make a transition  to a system of federal parliament and government based on  partnership institutions, that is, to put it more concretely,  based on local, or perhaps federal, parliaments and governments.  This is the most concrete path to a solution that we could  advance: the revision of all relations and the recognition of  the need for reorganization, not under the shadow of arms or  pressure, but based on complete free will. If this is accepted,  then there could be an easy movement toward reorganization  within Turkey's existing borders and based on the genuine free  will of the two peoples, which would forge a stronger fraternity  than the current one. This is possible without too much  fighting. I believe in this but I have no counterpart.    Question: You spoke against the use of force,  assimilation, and the threat of arms but primarily the General  Staff and an important section of the public accuse you and your  party of using violence and of committing savagery and  massacres. So while you declare your opposition to violence,  your party is being accused of practicing such things. Is there  not a contradiction here?    Ocalan: Before asking me that, you should have  read this [not further specified; however, Ocalan appears to be  referring to a paper in his hand]. Do I have to read it for  you? We announced the names of those killed during the shelling  of Gabar, Sirnak, and Soke. Their birthplaces were also given.  Some 16 people were listed. We also obtained the names and  dates of birth of the villagers killed in the village of Ziver  in the district of Eruh during the shelling. The number killed  here was 23. Over 50 villagers were killed in shelling on  election day alone. Their names are known. I am not  exaggerating their number. The press did not mention these  facts. So who is committing the savagery? Don't they claim  that children are being killed? Go and check their age. You  should be realistic. When women and children get killed and it  is beyond our control, when angry young people place bombs here  and there, you cannot describe this as PKK tactics. We are  trying to prevent such action. If we do not prevent such action  the streets might turn into a hell. We are very attached to the  principles of humanism and war conventions. It is the General  Staff that is not doing what is needed on this issue.    Question: When do you hope to see the realization  of your ideal of the "recognition of the Kurds' political,  cultural, and historic rights and of your return to Turkey to  represent your people on a legal platform?"    Ocalan: [passage omitted] It is my ideal to be  engaged in politics amid my people, even in Turkey. I am not  devoted to conducting a policy with the use of arms. I have no  intention of putting my neck out like a sheep if I am given no  alternative but execution. I will defend myself to the end with  whatever means I can find in any corner of the world. It is  obvious that the defense of my own person is linked with the  defense of my own people and party. Why am I doing all these  things? I am doing them so as to engage in politics. I have no  desire for violence for the sake of it. We have political goals  and national and democratic demands and I want to put them into  practice. It is the Turkish regime that does not grasp this.  Let this regime express a bit of goodwill to solve the  problems. Let it assign a counterpart to talks with us. Here  my presence is not a condition. Let those counterparts who  could solve this problem come together. Let us both [PKK and  Turkish Government] support them. What is needed is for both  sides to display goodwill. I reiterate: I am ready to display  my goodwill to the end. But at the same time I will never allow  the suppression, certainly not the denial, of a people's  national democratic demands. If need be I can use ruthless  violence for this purpose or act like the most democratic  politician to fulfill these same duties.</p>

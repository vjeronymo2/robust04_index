			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Rapid response pays off for textiles sector: How changing work patterns mean there is more to pay figures than meets the eye PAY IN the textiles industry is rising faster than any other segment of UK manufacturing. The finding, published this week by Income Data Services, an independent research agency, surprised many industry executives. The agency analysed Department of Employment figures and found that textile industry wages rose 6.5 per cent in the year to June 1993 compared with 4.7 per cent for manufacturing as a whole. However, industry executives said that special factors in the textiles and clothing industries could be swelling the pay packets of their employees. Managers were quick to point out there was more to the figure than meets the eye. 'It's certainly not straightforward pay increases,' said Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles, the UK's second-biggest textiles and clothing company. 'On basic pay we are looking to hold rates at or below the rate of inflation,' said Mr Andrew Mills Baker, finance director of William Baird, another large group. Clothing and textile industries - in an effort to fight off cheap imports from countries with low labour costs - have turned to 'rapid response', whereby manufacturers compensate for higher prices by offering quick delivery of small volumes, offering retailers the chance to cut their stocks and thus reduce their working capital. They can also respond more quickly to fashion changes. Under this system, manufacturers cut staff to a level to cope with slack periods and use overtime to meet orders. Mr David Parker, chairman of Nottingham-based Sherwood Group, one of Britain's biggest sock and lacemakers, said: 'Retailers' just-in-time policies mean that manufacturers are running more tightly. There is more often a demand for overtime and this seems likely to continue.' Overtime is often used by companies involved in the earliest part of the process of turning wool and cotton into garments. Mr John Embrey, group finance director at Dawson International, said that wages have increased most at its Joseph Dawson operation, which operates one of the earliest stages in the process, dehairing and combing cashmere and lambswool. Employees are working longer hours with more piecework and productivity bonuses, he said. Companies are also taking advantage of low interest rates to install new automated machinery and training staff to become multi-skilled. Employees with the lowest skill levels and earnings are losing their jobs in favour of quick learners with some qualifications. Spinning company John Haggas has seen its wage bill per employee rise 6.5 per cent over the past year. 'The new machines are easier to operate but you have to retrain,' it said. The rise in overtime and increasing skills of workers seem unlikely to signal a return to recruitment in the short term, said Mr Colin Purvis of the British Apparel and Textiles Confederation. 'Regrettably there is a reluctance on the part of companies to take on new employees,' he said. 'There have been 20,000-25,000 job losses a year during the recession.'</p>

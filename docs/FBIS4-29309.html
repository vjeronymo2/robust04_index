			<p>BFN     [Text] The House of Representatives held a meeting at  Parliament today beginning at 1350. It was expected that the  motion sponsored by Phalang Tham Party MPs proposing a special  committee to redraft the Constitution would be taken up for  discussion.    Before proceeding with the items on the agenda, which were  already scrutinized by the house committees, the chairman of the  session informed MPs that the Chat Phatthana Party requested the  withdrawal of its motion on setting up a special committee to  study guidelines to formulate a master plan for political  reforms. The party said it wanted to make improvements on the  proposal. The meeting approved the party's request. The  chairman then asked whether any MP's would like to propose any  other items for discussion, or proceed with items on the agenda.    The motion which the Chat Phatthana Party requested to  withdraw was tabled as the 26th item, an urgent motion. The  motion sponsored by Phalang Tham MP's was placed as the 28th  item on the list. The fact that nobody proposed to move the  motion up for discussion by the House of Representatives  indicated that it would not be discussed today. And if it is  debated according to the line on the agenda, the motion risks  not being discussed at all during the present House session  which is scheduled to recess by the end of July.    The House today discussed a report prepared by the committee  in charge of holding celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary  of the King's reign in 1996. MP's discussed the plan  extensively from noon until evening. Most of those who took the  floor proposed that the government hold celebrations worth the  honor of His Majesty the King so that all people can take part  in the campaign which should include activities which will  benefit the general public. The House session continued until  1800.    During the session, a delegation led by the deputy speaker  of  the House of Representatives of Kuwait visited parliament. The  group is currently on a visit to Thailand until 19 June.</p>

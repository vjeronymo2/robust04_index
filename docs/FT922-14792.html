			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: France doffs beret to rise of Super Bere - Alice Rawsthorn on reactions to the fait accompli appointment of the new premier IF YOU ask Parisian bankers or stockbrokers whether the outcome of next year's national elections will affect the French markets, the answer is almost always the same. Whether the socialists stay in power or not, they say, it will not make a scrap of difference so long as Mr Pierre Beregovoy is in charge of the economy. In his five years as finance minister, Mr Beregovoy, or 'Super Bere' as the French press calls him, has been as rigid in his grip of the economy - with his insistence on doing nothing, but nothing, to risk raising inflation - as even the most rabidly right wing of France's financiers could have wished him to be. The news on Thursday that Super Bere was succeeding Mrs Edith Cresson as prime minister was greeted with great sighs of relief on the financial markets. Mr Michel Sapin might have moved into his old office at the finance ministry, but the markets did not doubt for a minute that, when it came to economic policy, Mr Beregovoy would still be calling the tune. 'Before the announcement that Mr Beregovoy had actually been appointed, there was always a slight risk that Mrs Cresson might stay on and insist on reflation, forcing him to resign,' says Mr Christopher Potts, market strategist at Banque Indosuez in Paris. 'That risk has now gone.' Given the depth of the markets' regard for Mr Beregovoy, it seems surprising that their immediate reaction was relatively subdued. The CAC 40 index rose by a modest 0.72 per cent on Thursday and by 0.04 per cent to 1,942.73 yesterday, for a rise of 1 per cent on the week. Bond prices actually fell on Thursday after a lacklustre response to the Treasury's 10-year bond auction. It was only on the money markets that Super Bere received a really rousing reception. The franc broke through the critical DM3.39 barrier on Thursday to end at a nine-month high against the D-Mark at DM3.3877, and strengthened slightly yesterday. The reason for this muted response was that, by the time President Francois Mitterrand had finally made up his mind who was to take over from his 'little fighter', Mr Beregovoy had been seen as the likeliest candidate for so long that the markets regarded his appointment as a fait accompli. Furthermore, the rumours of Mrs Cresson's dismissal had been so strong for so long, that the markets had dismissed her as more or less irrelevant. When Mrs Cresson, whose socialism is of a much more idealistic stamp than that of the pragmatic Mr Beregovoy, was first appointed last May, the markets did react - by diving downwards. Her comment shortly after her appointment - that she 'didn't give a damn about the stock market'  - did nothing to restore confidence. 'The market fell by 7 or 8 per cent in the period immediately after her appointment,' recalls Mr David Harrington, French market analyst at James Capel in Paris. 'But since last autumn, as soon as people realised that she was not likely to last long and there would be no change in economic policy, her effect has been neutral. By contrast, Mr Beregovoy has always been seen as a positive influence.' Positive though the new prime minister may be, the French stock market seems set for a sluggish quarter. The combination of rising unemployment - to just under 10 per cent in February - and high interest rates is making companies cautious about investment and is depressing consumer confidence. James Capel expects a reduction of 7.5 per cent in the corporate earnings of the CAC 40 companies in 1992, compared with a fall of 5 per cent last year. The underlying trends are much more encouraging. Interest rates are almost certain to fall if German rates are reduced in the autumn, thereby alleviating the pressure on industry. French inflation, now running at 3 per cent, is still lower than any other major European economy. The official forecast, announced on Tuesday by Mr Beregovoy in one of his last acts as finance minister, of 2.8 per cent for 1992 and 1993 suggests it will stay low for the foreseeable future. He also signalled that France was on course for growth of 2 per cent this year and 2.6 per cent next year. 'French companies tend to be conservatively run and should be in good shape when the pick-up comes,' said Mr Potts of Indosuez. 'Everything suggests that the long-term outlook for the French market is really very good.'</p>

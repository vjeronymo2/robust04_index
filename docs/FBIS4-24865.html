			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Russian peacekeeping  forces will enter the Abkhaz region on June 3-5 as a buffer to  the conflict there between Georgia and the Autonomous Republic  of Abkhazia, the INTERFAX NEWS AGENCY reported.    Russian Deputy Defense Minister Georgiy Kondratyev told  INTERFAX today that the warring parties both expressed  understanding of the move and have no major differences with  Moscow over this issue.    Abhkazia proclaimed its independence on July 23, 1992, a  step  which was rejected by Georgia. Armed conflict between the two  sides began after Tbilisi sent troops to Abhkazia on August 14,  1992.    Under an accord signed in Moscow on May 14, the rival  parties  agreed to be separated in the disputed region and allow the  Commonwealth of Independent states (CIS) to deploy troops in the  agreed upon security zone.    According to the deputy defense minister, the separation  will  be achieved in three stages -- 1,500 Russian soldiers will enter  the region in the first stage, followed by the deployment of a  of 3,000 CIS troops.    CIS executive secretary Ivan Korotchenya said during his  visit to Azerbaijan that Russian President Boris Yeltsin is  expected to issue the order to send the peacekeeping troops to  Abkhazia on Friday.</p>

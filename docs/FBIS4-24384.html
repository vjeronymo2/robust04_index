			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by special reporter Ti An (4895 1344): "Dissident </F> Chen Ziming is Recuperating at a Hot Springs Resort, and Bao  Zunxin Complains About High Medical Costs"]    [Text] The fifth anniversary of the June 4th incident is a  very sensitive date for the Beijing authorities. Recently,  public security personnel could be seen outside the houses of  some well-known democracy activists in Beijing; they stood  guard, watched them, and followed them closely. It is believed  that they want to restrict contacts between the dissidents and  foreign reporters. Some democracy activists, including former  student leader Wang Dan and the old scholar Xu Liangying and his  wife, have had short trips arranged by the authorities to areas  outside Beijing to avoid "June 4," a date which causes concern  among the authorities.    Chen Ziming, an intellectual who has just been released, is  staying outside Beijing with his wife Wang Zhihong; they have  gone to a hot springs resort to recuperate. A medical  examination found that Chen Ziming has hypertension and a heart  problem (Chen Ziming's blood pressure is too high, over 100),  however, Chen Ziming's skin disease, which was not able to heal  in jail, has improved a bit after days of immersion in the hot  springs water (Chen Ziming had not taken a bath in a whole year  while in jail, and as he could only rub his body with water, his  skin disease got worse).    It is believed that Chen Ziming and his wife can only return  to Beijing after the fifth anniversary of the "June 4th"  incident. His family said that after Chen Ziming returns to  Beijing, he must visit the hospital for a thorough medical  examination. In addition, Chen Ziming wants to complete a book  on China's modernization--a book he started writing in jail; at  present, he has almost finished writing the book.    When Chen Ziming was in jail, his wife Wang Zhihong and his  sister Chen Zihua made a living by doing temporary jobs.    Chen Ziming was originally president of the Beijing Research  Institute of Social Sciences and Economics, a nongovernmental  think tank. According to his family, Chen Ziming, after several  years of hardship in jail, remains loyal to his view on the  country's affairs and has not changed his beliefs.    Bao Zunxin, another intellectual who was jailed for his part  in the 1989 pro-democracy movement, was a historian at the  Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; he has not been able to  regain his job so far and has been ill. Therefore, he relies on  his wife and daughter to earn wages to support the family, and  this means he has greater difficulties in his life.    Bao Zunxin's health was affected by his imprisonment. Since  he was released at the end of November 1992, he has been  recuperating up to this moment. Last week, he had a minor  operation to remove a polyp from his colon. He sighed and said  that medical costs in Beijing are very expensive and he cannot  afford it; for example, a visit to the doctor to treat influenza  costs more than 80 yuan, so he usually does not go to see the  doctor when he has influenza and just takes medicine prepared by  a pharmacy.    Bao Zunxin hopes to continue his academic research, and he  is  writing an article on the history of thought during the late  Qing period.    As the fifth anniversary of "June 4th" draws closer, two  public security personnel have appeared in front of Bao Zunxin's  house to watch him. He was forbidden from leaving to buy  vegetables, but he insisted on going out, and the public  security personnel let him go but followed him at all times.    In another development, apart from Wang Dan, who will leave  Beijing to avoid "June 4th," the well-known intellectuals Xu  Liangying and his wife have also had to leave Beijing  temporarily as a result of arrangements by the authorities.  According to their family, the Xu couple left Beijing last  Wednesday (25 May) for a certain locality, and will return to  Beijing on or after 8 June.    As for other young and middle-aged intellectuals who were  jailed for their part in the 1989 pro-democracy movement, such  as Liu Xiaobo and Min Qi, they are in Beijing but feel bored and  can only amuse themselves by playing cards.</p>

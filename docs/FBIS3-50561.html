The rebels left their positions in Oxchuc and Las  Margaritas,  while the Mexican Army expelled them from San Cristobal and  Oconsingo, in northern and northeastern Chiapas State.    Sources close to the Chiapas government have told EFE that  it  can be said unofficially that 200 people were killed, including  rebels, civilians, and soldiers, and 500 were wounded during the  past three days of conflict since the EZLN attacked several  towns in Chiapas.    They added that 25 rebels were captured during the military  operations and that apparently one of them is "Commander  Marcos," who appeared in a picture talking to the press at the  San Cristobal mayor's office, which was reproduced by Mexican  newspapers.</p>

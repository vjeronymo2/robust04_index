			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dr. Prasit Damrongchai] </F>   [Excerpts] At the end of 1992 and beginning of 1993, as a  member of the Political Science and Public Administration Branch  of the National Research Council, I was asked to conduct a study  on "The Suppression of Unusual Wealth in Thai Government  Circles." It was hoped that the results of this study would  benefit the country and society in general.    One of the important questions of this study was the  question  of how to seize the assets of wealthy state officials who have  gained their wealth by defrauding the public. The money they  earn from engaging in corrupt activities is considered to be  dirty money that must be seized and returned to the country.    The main problem is not authority to seize assets, because  OCCC [Office of the Commission to Counter Corruption] laws have  been promulgated. The problem is to find the location of the  huge sums of money earned from engaging in corrupt activities.    I think that in carrying on narcotics suppression  activities,  the ONCB [Office of the Narcotics Control Board] probably faces  the same problem. That is, it has the authority to seize assets  based on ONCB laws, but it is difficult to find out where the  narcotics traffickers keep their money and how they transfer it.    Those who are best informed about the movement of this cash  are the banks and other financial institutions. Thus, to locate  the cash earned from engaging in corruption and trafficking in  narcotics, we must rely mainly on information provided by the  banks and financial institutions. To achieve real results, a  special law must be promulgated that will make it possible to  locate this dirty money and prevent it from being transferred  and laundered. To put it simply, we must prevent this money from  being laundered, because it is then very difficult to prove  whether the money is "clean" or "dirty" money. [passage omitted]    Even though this law will be very beneficial, many people  don't think that it will be possible to promulgate such a law.  The powerholders in Thai society will probably oppose this and  take steps to prevent this bill from being passed by the  legislative council. The commercial banks, which would be  required to regularly file reports, are afraid that this will  increase the burden on them. Besides this, the money that once  flowed into the system will flow out of the system. The foreign  currency that flowed into the country will go to other countries  that do not have such a law. This will put our domestic economy  at a disadvantage as compared with that of neighboring countries.    Some groups hold differing views. Some think that this will  infringe on people's personal rights. Others think that it won't  be worth the price if we allow money to flow out of the country.  Others think that our monetary and banking systems are fine as  they are and that it isn't necessary to promulgate a special law.    While I was writing the report on the results of the study,  I  began to feel that getting this law passed by parliament would  probably be as difficult as pushing a mortar up a hill. This is  because there are very few people who support this. Many people  will be adversely affected, and most of these are highly  influential people who will oppose this, which is exactly what  has happened in many other countries.    But today, many people are interested in this and so there  is  hope that something can be done:    1. A way must be found to have countries throughout the  world  cooperate in promulgating such a law. Because the present  economic situation is now an international matter, it should be  easier to obtain such cooperation.    2. Fears concerning individual rights should carry little  weight. Even in the United States, Professor Peter Baldwin Jr.,  a professor at the University of Florida and an expert on  money-laundering laws, whom the OCCC invited to come give a  lecture on 3 December 1993, has said that those who violate the  law, particularly those who engage in corruption, have forfeited  the personal rights guaranteed by the constitution. If dirty  money is kept somewhere, that place must be considered dirty,  too. For example, if a house is used to conceal dirty money, the  state can seize that house.    3. We are in the information age. It is easy to transmit  information to people everywhere. The mass media can help inform  the people about the advantages and disadvantages.    4. Most members of the legislative council are concerned  about the common good rather than person interests.    Because money laundering is a very complex issue and affects  people in many countries, unless this problem is discussed in a  reasonable manner, conflicts and problems will arise. Thus, to  promulgate this law, things must be done very carefully. The  objectives must be very clear, and everyone must be made to  understand the reasons for this. If this law is really good, it  will be difficult for people to oppose it. This is a good  opportunity for those who support the principles of this law to  prove their case.</p>

			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT THE 1990S HAVE IN STORE FOR THE OIL INDUSTRY;  </P> <P> ENERGY: WITH PROSPECTS FOR STRONGER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND CONTINUING WEAKER  PRICES, THE OUTLOOK IS NOT GOOD. BUT THERE ARE SOME BRIGHT SPOTS.  </P> <P> The oil industry is entering the last decade of the century with the muck of  the 1980s still stuck to its boots like oil from the Exxon Valdez.  </P> <P> The legacy of the Valdez will haunt oil companies in California and elsewhere  that are just emerging from a period of major restructuring accelerated by the  collapse of oil prices in 1986.  </P> <P> During that time, major oil companies pared exploration and production staffs,  closed unprofitable refining operations and improved efficiencies at others,  and shifted emphasis from domestic to foreign oil prospecting as home-grown  sources dwindled.  </P> <P> Now, post-Valdez environmental concerns stand in the way of renewed domestic  oil and gas exploration, and proposed clean air rules threaten to transform the  industry's gasoline refining business forever.  </P> <P> In California, where environmental regulations are strictest, environmental and  financial obstacles to new refinery building are already making existing plants  among the most desirable in the industry -- and this in a place where gasoline  demand is expected to grow the fastest.  </P> <P> The last gasps of the industry's restructuring can be seen in recent industry  developments:  </P> <P> California companies such as Unocal Corp. and Occidental Petroleum Corp., as  well as Mobil Oil Corp. and British Petroleum, have announced reorganization of  exploration and production units, including some staff cuts.  </P> <P> "I think the layoffs are reflecting the real end of the depression in the  upstream (exploration and production) side of the industry," said Edward Morse,  executive publisher of industry newsletter Petroleum Intelligence Weekly.  </P> <P> Several refinery operations have gone on the block recently, many in  California. Southland Corp. said last week that it would sell its remaining  half-interest in Citgo Petroleum Corp., which operates a refinery in Northern  California, to the Venezuelan state-owned oil company for $675 million. Santa  Monica-based Tosco Corp., the West Coast's largest independent refiner, said  last week that it was entertaining offers from at least three multinational  companies for its business. And Unocal is about to close its own deal with the  Venezuelans, a joint venture to operate Unocal's Chicago refinery that would  bring Unocal more than $500 million.  </P> <P> "I think there's a recognition that this is a good market here," said Thomas K.  Nance, Tosco's treasurer. "The supply-demand balance appears to be very tight,  and the expectation is that the market will only get better."  </P> <P> The desirability of California refineries contrasts with refining in other  parts of the country. Unocal said last week that it would cease all refinery  production at its 65-year-old Beaumont plant in Nederland, Tex., which makes  lube oil, aromatics and solvents.  </P> <P> "It was very out of date for the marketplace. . . . And with the margins as  they are, you just can't compete," said Unocal spokesman Barry Lane. The Gulf  Coast region's refining profit margins rank last behind those of three other  regions of the country, according to a report by Drexel Burnham Lambert. The  West Coast has the strongest.  </P> <P> In the country as a whole, the restructuring period has resulted in a sharp  drop in domestic oil and gas production.  </P> <P> "This is really the second round in the long trend of downsizing in the  exploration and production business that started in '84 or '85," said Phillip  Ellis, a vice president with Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc. "The idea behind  it was that the U.S. resource base has the highest cost in the world. . . .  There's a lot of oil and gas left here, but very few elephants," meaning fields  large enough to reward oil company development.  </P> <P> In 1990, crude oil production will see the sharpest decline since the 1970s,  according to a forecast by the Independent Petroleum Assn. of America.  Production dropped 460,000 barrels per day in 1989 over a year earlier, and is  expected to fall an additional 329,000 barrels per day to 7.4 million in 1990.  Natural gas production remained level in 1989 at 16.6 trillion cubic feet.  </P> <P> The budget for domestic exploration and production, which accounted for about  75% to 78% of total E&amp;P budgets, now constitutes less than half, Morse  said. Amoco Corp., traditionally one of the first companies to announce its  annual exploration budget, says that for the first time in its history, more  than half of its budget will be spent outside the United States in 1990.  </P> <P> "When today's oil executives calculate and form their strategies for the  future, they confront the fact that U.S. oil production is not likely to occupy  the cornerstone of their operations," said Dillard P. Spriggs, president of  Petroleum Analysis Ltd., in a speech at Johns Hopkins University this fall.  </P> <P> But there are some signs that interest in domestic oil and gas exploration is  picking up as prices stabilize, although no one expects such activity to ever  match pre-collapse levels. "From almost every perspective, there are signs that  (exploration and production) operations are increasing, mostly outside the  U.S., but in the U.S. as well," Morse said.  </P> <P> The prime indicator of new drilling activity -- the rig count -- has been  climbing steadily in the past few months, according to Baker Hughes Inc., the  oil services firm. As of Nov. 6, the number of rotary drilling rigs in use rose  to 1,042. That's still well below the peak level of 4,530 or so in 1981, but is  nevertheless the highest level since the winter of 1988. For the year, the rig  count remains below 1988 levels.  </P> <P> Natural gas appears the most promising, especially if clean air regulations  spur demand and the current oversupply diminishes as hoped. Amoco has made  natural gas development a prime goal of its domestic operations. It became the  largest owner of U.S. natural gas reserves with the acquisition last year of  Canada's Dome Petroleum and part of the Tenneco reserves.  </P> <P> On the refining side, analysts agree that most of the weaker operations have  been weeded out, and improvements have raised operating rates to their highest  levels ever as demand remains relatively strong and profit margins remain  generally good.  </P> <P> Refining capacity is so tight now that prices spike sharply at any disruptions,  such as Hurricane Hugo's destruction to Caribbean refineries or last month's  explosion at a Phillips Petroleum Co. plastics refinery in Texas. And some  observers fear that the high rates of utilization make such disruptions all the  more likely.  </P> <P> All of which is placing a premium on refinery assets, particularly on the West  Coast, where refining margins are highest. Environmental regulations make it  hugely expensive, if not altogether impossible, to build a new plant in  California.  </P> <P> Tight capacity has also renewed interest in other refining assets. Last month,  Coastal Corp. said it would reactivate the closed Exxon plant in Aruba in the  Caribbean.  </P> <P> A number of things keep analysts from being overly optimistic about a strong  rebound in the oil industry's fortunes:  </P> <P> Independent producers still await federal action to return tax benefits lost  during the rewrite of federal tax laws.  </P> <P> Continued oversupply of natural gas could keep prices soft and discourage new  domestic production.  </P> <P> Environmental pressures could keep drilling out of promising areas. A  continuation of moratoriums on offshore drilling could put outer continental  shelf areas off limits to production indefinitely, and post-Valdez concerns  will probably keep exploration out of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  </P> <P> A downturn in the economy could mean the loss of refining profits at a time  when many will face upgrades to make cleaner gasolines or alternative fuels.  </P> <P> Looming over everything is uncertainty about where oil prices may go. Most  analysts expect prices to continue at their current levels through the year.  Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet later  this month to discuss their nations' production levels and other matters.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CUTTING BACK  </P> <P> Arco: The firm announced a reorganization plan in 1986 designed to reduce the  size of its domestic oil and gas work force by 23% -- about 2,000 employees --  and to divest itself of refining and petroleum marketing operations east of the  Mississippi River, as well as all remaining non-coal minerals operations.  Money-losing Arco Solar in Camarillo was sold earlier this year.  </P> <P> Chevron: By 1987, the company had eliminated 27,500 jobs since the 1984  acquisition of Gulf Oil. The reductions came through the sale of assets and  consolidation of operations.  </P> <P> Unocal: The company has been selling assets to reduce the heavy debt taken on  in 1985 when it fought a takeover bid by T. Boone Pickens Jr. The company sold  its Los Angeles headquarters building, and recently announced it will curtail  retail operations in the Pacific Northwest and close its Nederland, Tex.,  refinery.  </P> <P> Occidental Petroleum: Announced in early September it will lay off 900 workers  from its Oil &amp; Gas Corp. unit based in Tulsa, Okla., to streamline domestic  energy operations.  </P></p>

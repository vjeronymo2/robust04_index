			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DEMOCRATS HAVE THE MEMORY OF AN ELEPHANT WHEN IT COMES TO NIXON  </P> <P> The pomp and celebration of the Nixon library opening may be engulfing Orange  County this week, but for folks like Jane Gerber it's all a big pain in the  craw.  </P> <P> A lifelong Democrat, Gerber voted against Nixon in his tumultuous Senate  election battle against Helen Gahagan Douglas back in 1950. She voted against  him when he ran for governor in 1962, and in every presidential race before and  after.  </P> <P> So it's hardly surprising that the Westminster woman finds it particularly  galling to see a $21-million library opening for the politician she loved to  loath.  </P> <P> "I am just appalled at how quickly people can forget the bad things that  happened -- Watergate, the Vietnam War, all of it," said Gerber, 72. "I just  don't understand how we can build a shrine to that type of thing."  </P> <P> She is not alone. Nixon supporters of all stripes may see Thursday's grand  opening as the resurrection of a defrocked President, but for the Nixon haters  of the nation, the event represents a flash point igniting memories of  political shenanigans past.  </P> <P> Even in conservative Orange County, the feelings run deep among Democrats and  liberals who consider Nixon more of a crook than elder statesman. They grumble  and groan, they roll their eyes. Most plan to try and ignore the hoopla, hoping  that it all will just go away.  </P> <P> "The library dedication is an embarrassment," said Marion Pack, executive  director of the Alliance for Survival in Orange County, an activist group. "I  would liken it to a boil on the skin. The last thing you want to do is draw  attention to it."  </P> <P> But others welcome the celebration, which will feature all four living  Republican Presidents, as a perfect opportunity for a little demonstration.  </P> <P> A cavalcade of protesters from across the Southland -- among them peace  activists, gay rights advocates and environmentalists -- are expected to picket  the ceremonies to mark the library opening. Upward of 300 may show, organizers  say.  </P> <P> Many people say they will attend in an effort to make an impression on the  current resident of the Oval Office, George Bush, not to blast a President who  resigned nearly two decades ago under a cloud of scandal.  </P> <P> But Richard M. Nixon has always inspired the passion of protesters, and that  old magic hasn't waned, even as a civilian.  </P> <P> "My motivation to be there is to protest Nixon," said Tim Carpenter, co-founder  of Peace Politics, an Orange County-based band of activists. "The library is  embarrassing. Orange County is being saddled with another conservative icon. .  . . We need to show people that not all is quiet on the western front, that  even behind the Orange Curtain there are people in opposition."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, many Democratic politicians admit to feeling an uneasy sense of  irritation as the day draws near for the library opening.  </P> <P> "I still feel the man is a shyster and a crook," said Rep. George E. Brown Jr.  (D-Colton) who crossed swords with Nixon on numerous occasions during the  Vietnam War. "But American history will take care of that in due course."  </P> <P> Brown said the library opening is "a commentary on the nature of American  politics," demonstrating the nation's unerring ability to forgive even the  gravest political sins.  </P> <P> "Nixon probably helped to degrade the quality of American politics more than  any other American politician," Brown said. "If I thought about it a long time  I'd probably get nauseated, but I'm not going to think about it."  </P> <P> Some local Democrats contend it is less the library and more the imperial  celebration surrounding its opening that has proved vexing of late.  </P> <P> "A little more humility by everyone involved would be nice, instead of all this  pandering and looking at Nixon as a great President, which is ludicrous," said  John Hanna, an attorney and former chairman of the Orange County Democratic  Party in the late 1980s. "You've got to give credit where credit is due, but  certainly in any examination of the Nixon presidency the overwhelming thing one  has to come away with is the fact that he's the only President in our history  who resigned in disgrace under the threat of impeachment."  </P> <P> As for the library itself, Hanna figures it will fit the Orange County  landscape like Cinderella's slipper, establishing a spot on the tourist maps as  a Disneyland for political junkies.  </P> <P> "I live here in a Republican sea as it is," Hanna noted. "It seems to fit that  Nixon's library is here in this fantasy land, where most of our partisan  officials seem to think we live in a different century."  </P> <P> Richard O'Neil, a prominent Orange County developer and former state and county  Democratic Party chairman, said that in the hearts and minds of conservative  Orange County voters, Nixon has never really left.  </P> <P> "He never really was out of it here," O'Neil said. "This isn't a resurrection  for him really. It's just the same old thing. They see him as kind of a  hometown person. There's no doubt he had an awful lot of friends here in Orange  County."  </P> <P> And a lot of enemies.  </P> <P> "Richard Nixon reminds me of one of those blowup punching bags that has sand in  the bottom -- you give it a whop and it keeps coming back," said Sherry  Meddick, president of a group trying to ease the effects of development in  Orange County. "We all lived through the Nixon years. I can't see any reason to  go back and do it again at the library. I'm quite sure I won't go visit it."  </P></p>

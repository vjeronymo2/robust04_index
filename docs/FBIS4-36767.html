			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer] Lakhdar Brahimi, the UN secretary  general's envoy to Yemen, has arrived in Amman on his way to  Jeddah.    He was received by Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state  for foreign affairs; 'Ali Abu-Luhum, the Yemeni ambassador in  Amman; the UN representative in Jordan; and the Saudi charge  d'affaires in Amman.    Lakhdar Brahimi spoke to our political affairs  correspondent:    [Begin recording] [Correspondent] Are you carrying specific  ideas from the UN secretary general to the officials of both  sides [of Yemen]?    [Brahimi] The ideas are very simple. War and internecine  fighting will not solve the problem, dialogue is the preferable  means, and the international community is ready to help if  possible. However, these brothers can solve their problem among  themselves.    [Correspondent] What do you expect the alternatives will be?    [Brahimi] It is premature to discuss options. At present,  the urgent objective is to have a serious cease-fire, to respect  the cease-fire, and to resume the dialogue. The brothers in  Sanaa say that they accept the principle of dialogue, even  though they say that this dialogue should be based on  principles. They have their own principles. We told them that  is alright, and undoubtedly the brothers in the other party have  their own ideas and principles. If the principles are accepted,  then we will examine the bases, conditions, and circumstances  under which this dialogue will take place. [end recording]</p>

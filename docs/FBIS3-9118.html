			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak by Jan Zizka </F> in Warsaw; date not given: "We Want Not Assistance and Asymmetry  but Partnership Cooperation"]    [Text] Political and economic development in Poland as  well as regional cooperation in Central Europe and attitudes  toward the West European integrative groupings were the topics  discussed in an exclusive interview granted to our newspaper in  Warsaw by Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak.    [Zizka] On the one hand, the Polish economy is showing signs  of considerable recovery, while, on the other, many people are  dissatisfied with their standard of living, and Solidarity is  organizing strikes. In your opinion, could such actions  destabilize the situation in Poland?    [Pawlak] It is important for the future to ensure that  stability and development do not apply only to the economic  sphere, which is just one element of the whole social system.  The positive results of the reforms should be manifested in an  overwhelming part of societal life. In its practical activity,  our government would like to abide by the principle of  intensifying the entire context of the reforms. We want to  strive to overcome dissatisfaction, but, first and foremost, we  want to take part in creating the conditions for the active  involvement of a larger part of society in the transformation  process. It is also apparent after a few years of implementing  the reforms that they have to be carried out by evolutionary  means--without shocks and without leaps and bounds. Considerable  losses are incurred by hasty changes in both the economic and  the social spheres. The third principle we would like to abide  by is the rationalization of our activity and the better  utilization of our potential. As far as the protests are  concerned, they were organized in those economic branches in  which real wages rose last year, although average real wages in  Poland as a whole declined a little. The motive here is not so  much economic as political. The locations of the protests are  not congruent with the locations of problems and poverty. Those  whom Solidarity is mobilizing in protests--miners and railroad  workers--have, in short, above-average incomes. I think that,  during the course of discussions and negotiations, we will  succeed in improving the current atmosphere. However, the trade  unionists must also understand that the government has to  negotiate with all of the trade union organizations and is doing  so. Solidarity withdrew from these talks. I think, however,  that we will return to the negotiating table.    [Zizka] Problems are also cropping up in relations within  the ruling coalition--between the Union of the Democratic Left  (SLD) and the Polish People's Party (PSL). An example of this  is the affair surrounding former Finance Minister Borowsky, who  left the government. In your opinion, how will these relations  unfold?    [Pawlak] I do not think these are coalition problems. This  was the decision of Mr. Borowsky, who submitted his resignation.  In every step like this, it is necessary to reckon with the  possible consequences. There are no problems in the coalition,  however. The best example is the approval of the state budget,  for which the vast majority of deputies expressed their support.  That is, I think it is an exaggeration to interpret the facts  in this way.    [Zizka] This means that there is no threat to the coalition?    [Pawlak] The example of the budget proves that there are no  disputes within the coalition in specific issues.    [Zizka] And what about ratifying the treaty with the  Vatican--the concordat?    [Pawlak] We have not reached a coalition agreement on the  concordat. This is not an issue that should provoke a coalition  crisis. Within our PSL Club and in harmony with the freedom of  belief and religious affiliation, we do not insist on a common  point of view binding for all.    [Zizka] Another issue that causes disputes, mainly between  the SLD and President Walesa, is the drafting of a new  Constitution. Marshall of the Sejm Oleksy said that it will be  necessary to seek a certain compromise. What is your opinion?    [Pawlak] If you want to familiarize yourself with the crux  of the disputes, it would be better to turn to President Walesa,  Marshall Oleksy, and SLD Chairman Kwasniewski. The government  is not interested in examining the points at issue in this  matter; we are interested in cooperation in resolving specific  issues.    [Zizka] How would the PSL react to the candidacy of Mr.  Kwasniewski for the post of president?    [Pawlak] If Mr. Kwasniewski becomes a candidate for the  presidency, we will hold talks and discuss it.    [Zizka] The government coalition was criticized for its  personnel policy in individual regions, where it tried to make  numerous changes in posts in a number of provinces.    [Pawlak] When Bill Clinton became President of the United  States, there was a thorough and rapid change of personnel  throughout the administration. No one took exception to this.  In Poland, there was definitely a quite considerable  reevaluation throughout the political system. I am convinced,  however, that this process has been completed and that no more  significant changes should be made in the personnel sphere.    [Zizka] A protectionist policy, first and foremost in the  agricultural sphere, was expected from the PSL before the  elections. From this point of view, what is the situation now?    [Pawlak] It is impossible, of course, to claim that the  PSL's activity is associated exclusively with protectionism. On  the other hand, however, it is necessary to realize that this is  normal in the activities of much richer and more developed  countries, that they are seeking an international position for  their own economy, and that they are looking after their own  interests. Poland is also bound to look after its overall  interests in economic cooperation with other countries. This  also proceeds from the fact that the balance of trade worsened  considerably last year and that Poland had a trade deficit of  more than $2 billion. Most of this was due to trade with  Western countries. For this reason, at a meeting in Prague at  the beginning of this year, our side proposed a Partnership for  Development. The maxim is not to talk about assistance and  asymmetry but, rather, about partnership cooperation that is  advantageous for everyone. This involves a partnership where it  is irrelevant how great the differences are in economic  potential. I think that this idea could be appropriate, first  and foremost, for developing cooperation in our region. We  should try to develop the institutions that simplify economic  cooperation and the financial and transportation  infrastructures. However, the opportunities for immediate  contacts are also important, beginning with a meeting at the  highest level, followed by meetings between businessmen and  ending up with contacts among a large number of people--for  instance, within the framework of tourism. We are interested in  laying the real foundations of cooperation, not, however, by  means of a bureaucracy. We favor the "G-4" formula and not one  associated with the establishment of numerous institutions whose  activity does not always bear practical fruit. We agreed on  this at the meeting in Prague. The countries of Central Europe  and the Baltic region should be open to each other, which is  also important for creating joint enterprises and  infrastructures.    [Zizka] Talks are also under way on agricultural products  within the framework of the negotiations on the Central European  Free Trade Zone (CEFTA). What will Poland's position be?    [Pawlak] Agricultural products are a major problem. This is  the point of view of not only Poland but also all of the  countries. Agriculture was the most complicated issue in the  GATT talks. Agricultural products are also regarded as  sensitive in our contacts with the European Union [EU]. This  ensues from the specific nature of these products. Negotiations  within this category will also not be simple. I think, however,  that our countries are linked to such an extent by their common  geographical location and by the problems associated with the  changes and transformations that we are obliged to try to  improve our common potential. We have to seek a solution on the  markets of third countries in areas where we want to defend our  potential, our jobs. I think this is possible. Our potential  should be utilized not only in mutual cooperation within the  region, but also in relation to third countries.    [Zizka] In connection with what you said about the state of  Poland's exports, officials from the Polish National Bank  maintain that foreign currency reserves are increasing alongside  their decline. According to them, this means that exports are  higher than it seems from the statistics; however, a  considerable proportion of them are unregistered and take place  without the knowledge of the banks.    [Pawlak] I do not think we should be proud of this.    [Zizka] A number of Czech politicians do not want to talk  about "cooperation within the Visegrad Group." They would  prefer the expression "CEFTA states." What do you think about  this?    [Pawlak] I agree with this view. It is all very well to  come up with great ideas, but there comes a difficult point at  which it is necessary to put them into practice. The Visegrad  Group was based, first and foremost, on the idea of political  cooperation. CEFTA is an expression of very specific economic  cooperation--the liberalization of mutual trade. This course of  action is very practical, especially today, when it is necessary  to turn political ideas into specific acts. This involves  ensuring that our economies become a dynamic element of the  pan-European system.    [Zizka] In Prague, at the beginning of this year, you  discussed mainly economic issues, while President Walesa dealt  more with political and security issues. What is Poland's  priority here? For example, entry into the European Union or  admission into NATO?    [Pawlak] First of all, it is essential that there is  interest on both sides, which is not always the case. I think  that our experiences with NATO illustrate this well. It is the  same with the European Union. Discussions on whether we should  apply for membership now are, in my opinion, premature. To  responsibly proclaim such an intention, certain parameters have  to be complied with economically. It seems to me that we should  not bargain in the sphere of political ideas but cooperate in  such a way that our countries do not lag behind in mutual  relations--for instance, compared with bilateral contacts with  the European Union. On the contrary, there is nothing preventing  more dynamic cooperation in our region. Incidentally, this  would facilitate our entry into the European Union. At the  moment, this is a rather distant prospect, and the whole process  requires a certain amount of time. It is illogical to make an  idealistic announcement about an idea that cannot be put into  action for a long time.    [Zizka] Foreign Minister Olechowski, however, said in  Brussels that Poland will apply to join the European Union in  the near future. It is known that the head of the diplomatic  corps was nominated to the government by the president. To what  extent, therefore, is he the representative of the president,  and to what extent is he the representative of the government?    [Pawlak] I discussed this with Mr. Olechowski, who said that  he had spoken in Brussels about the prospects for such a  request. He definitely did not speak about it as a fait  accompli. This is a subject for discussion in Poland. We will  give it consideration in the government and parliament. The  process of incorporation into the EU's structures depends not on  proclaimed declarations but on the overall state of the economy.  It is necessary to stick to reality.    [Zizka] Is a situation in which not only representatives of  the coalition but also of the president sit in the government  compatible with effective work by the government?    [Pawlak] In Poland we have so many problems and so much work  that there are a great many areas toward which we should be  directing our energy. It is worse if someone deals with  something else. So far, however, such problems have not cropped  up in the government. Plurality is always better than a  unilateral orientation. There are often more ideas in a  pluralist system. Perhaps it is also more complicated to come to  conclusions. In short, we have more ideas and objectives to  think about and choose from. If we concentrate on our work,  there is no time for other issues.</p>

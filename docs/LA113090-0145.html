			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVE TO L.A. HOSPITAL MAY FOIL PLAN TO OUST LINDSAY;  </P> <P> COUNCIL: THE ACTION COULD BLOCK EFFORT BY HIS COLLEAGUES TO REMOVE HIM FOR  BEING ABSENT, OUT OF CITY.  </P> <P> Councilman Gilbert Lindsay, incapacitated by a stroke three months ago, is to  be moved from his hospital bed in Inglewood to a hospital within Los Angeles  city limits, an action that will foil plans by his colleagues to remove him  from office.  </P> <P> Lindsay, whose 90th birthday was Thursday, has been in Daniel Freeman Hospital  in Inglewood since a stroke Sept. 2 left him partially paralyzed and unable to  speak.  </P> <P> His extended stay outside the city, half a mile beyond Los Angeles city limits,  has put the council seat he has held for 27 years in jeopardy. A technicality  in the City Charter allows for the removal of a council member who is absent  from the city for 60 days or longer.  </P> <P> But Lindsay will be transferred, possibly as early as today to Queen of  Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Hollywood, according to his  stepson, Herbert Howard, and his council deputy, Bob Gay.  </P> <P> The 12-mile trip apparently will protect Lindsay's seat on the council, even  though it is not clear, according to visitors, that he is mentally or  physically up to the task.  </P> <P> The move also will mean that Lindsay will continue to receive his council  salary of nearly $90,000 instead of the pension of about $45,000 he would  receive if he left office now. If Lindsay can hold onto his seat until next  July, his pension will be boosted to about $60,000 under the city's formula for  calculating retirement benefits.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, Lindsay's fellow council members began invoking the  provision of the City Charter that allows them to unseat a colleague after a  60-day unexcused absence. The council stopped excusing Lindsay's absences on  Nov. 1.  </P> <P> By returning to the city before Jan. 1, Lindsay will stop the 60-day clock from  running.  </P> <P> When Lindsay first fell ill, some council members said they would never attempt  such a maneuver and one called it a petty technicality. Under increasing  pressure from community leaders in Lindsay's largely black 9th District,  however, the council reversed its position. The community leaders had  complained that they were without a voice on the council.  </P> <P> Beyond the 60-day rule, the Charter provides few options for removal. A council  member can be removed for conviction of a felony, if judged insane, or if  recalled by the voters. There is no movement afoot in Lindsay's district for a  recall -- an expensive and time-consuming effort -- and, although disabled, he  is not suffering from any mental illness.  </P> <P> Council members say Lindsay's situation has prompted them to seek changes in  the City Charter to make it possible to vacate the seats of elected officials  who are incapacitated. Such changes would have to be approved by the voters,  however.  </P> <P> Howard, who has been overseeing Lindsay's medical care, said Thursday that the  move to Queen of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian was approved by Lindsay's  physician and was not prompted by the council's apparent intent to remove him  from office. Howard added that the move was planned from the day Lindsay  entered the hospital.  </P> <P> "My only concern is my father's health," he said.  </P> <P> Howard said that Lindsay's regular doctor is at Queen of Angels-Hollywood  Presbyterian and is affiliated with a convalescent facility for stroke  patients.  </P> <P> The councilman, Howard said, has "pretty good vital signs. He is still  paralyzed. He still cannot talk. I don't know if he is recognizing people or  not. I have never felt that he did. But doctors say that he can be  transported."  </P> <P> Council President John Ferraro, who visited Lindsay several weeks ago, said he  was unsure if the elder councilman understood what was happening and could not  tell whether Lindsay recognized him.  </P> <P> Councilman Nate Holden, who visited Lindsay on Wednesday, said the councilman  seemed to respond to him.  </P> <P> "I think he was happy I was there," said Holden, who stayed with Lindsay about  half an hour. "I was able to communicate with him. He squeezed my hand when I  asked him to and he blinked his eyes.  </P> <P> "When it was time to leave, he squeezed my hand so tight as if he didn't want  me to go."  </P> <P> Earlier this week, Holden threatened to seek a court order, if necessary, so he  could visit Lindsay. Holden said council members should be allowed to make a  first-hand assessment of Lindsay's condition before taking any action to remove  him from office.  </P> <P> With the exception of Ferraro and Lindsay's aide Gay, Howard has allowed almost  no visitors since Lindsay entered the hospital.  </P> <P> However, Howard relented on Tuesday and said council members could visit.  </P> <P> Known for his gregariousness, Lindsay was the city's first black councilman  when he was appointed to the City Council in 1963. He handily has won  reelection ever since, including his most recent bid in 1989, a year after  suffering a mild stroke.  </P> <P> Lindsay's 9th District encompasses the extremes of the city, from the gleaming  skyscrapers of downtown to the crime-ridden slums of South-Central Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Howard said Thursday he was unsure when Lindsay would be moved, but Tim Ogata,  vice president of Queen of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian, said the hospital is  expecting Lindsay to arrive by ambulance today.  </P></p>

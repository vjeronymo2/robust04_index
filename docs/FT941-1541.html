			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee futures retreat after hitting fresh three-year highs Coffee prices hit fresh three-year highs before retreating towards the close at the London Commodity Exchange yesterday. The May futures position closed at Dollars 1,347 a tonne, Dollars 17 off the peak and Dollars 5 down on the day. Some traders were concerned that coffee prices had risen too quickly and were due for a correction. 'London is looking exceptionally over-bought: it's a bit worrying,' said Mr Lawrence Eagles, coffee analyst at GNI, the London brokerage house. Prices have surged by nearly 15 per cent since the beginning of the year after a tightening in supplies caused by some crop problems, rising consumption and the effects of the producers' export retention scheme. Stocks of coffee held by consuming countries dropped to 17m bags at the end of January from 18.4m bags last October. Mr Eagles suggested there would be a fairly steady draw down for the rest of the year to about 12m bags by 1995. The drop in consumer stocks is one indication of the success of the retention scheme set up by 40 producers in October. Producers agreed to withhold 20 per cent of their supplies from the export market until prices reached a predetermined level. That level was almost achieved yesterday when the daily indicator price rose to 74.88 cents a pound. When it gets to 75 cents producers will keep back only 10 per cent. However, this prospect has largely been accounted for in the recent move in coffee prices. If the indicator rose by another 10 cents producers could begin releasing stocks on to the market again. But that is some way off. Producing and consuming nations came closer to agreeing a compromise on a new International Coffee Agreement yesterday. The new pact could allow the industry to negotiate economic clauses if the political will arose at some stage in the future, but any economic provisions discussed would then have to be incorporated into a new pact. GNI has dramatically reduced its forecast for the deficit in this year's cocoa crop from 241,000 tonnes to just 50,000 tonnes. But its says these are largely accounting changes and that, with stocks reduced significantly by the decision to liquidate the International Cocoa Organisation's buffer stock, and crop output static, prices should still rise. The brokerage house forecasts that the stock to consumption level will fall below 30 per cent in the current crop year - the lowest level since 1977 when prices averaged nearly Pounds 3,000 a tonne.</p>

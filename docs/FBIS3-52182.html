			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Progressive Socialist Party Leader Minister Walid  Junblatt has condemned the Vatican's recognition of Israel and  described it as an alliance hostile to Arabism and Islam. This  action confirms Western-Jewish plotting against the region and  its peoples, resources, and identity. He said that the  Vatican's recognition of Israel 500 years after the fall of  Granada is a Zionist Jewish victory in the world, particularly  in the mother Christian church in Rome.    Junblatt added: Perhaps we cannot assess now all  implications of this Western-Zionist alliance, but we can say  that our Arab identity and our Islamic identity are in danger.  Pope John Paul's upcoming visits to Lebanon and occupied  Palestine come within this context and cap this alliance. Any  other talk about the pope's visit is meaningless. He said: The  church leaders in Lebanon--who now advocate human rights,  freedom, and other resounding slogans--were mute when Beirut was  pounded during the Israeli invasion and when the Lebanese  Government signed the 17 May accord with the Israeli Government.

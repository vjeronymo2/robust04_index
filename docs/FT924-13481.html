			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Arbitrage unwinding pulls Nikkei off its early high HOPES of an interest rate cut boosted share prices in the morning, but the Nikkei average closed lower on late-afternoon arbitrage unwinding, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average fell 146.64 to close at the day's low of 17,344.03. The index rose to the day's high of 17,714.04 in the morning on futures-related buying and small-lot buying by foreign investors. Volume rose to 250m shares from 204m. Advances led declines by 494 to 414 with 183 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 1.34 to 1,318.90 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.69 to 1056.56. The overnight rise of Nikkei futures in Chicago, prompted by hopes of an early cut in the discount rate, pushed up the futures contract in Osaka, triggering arbitrage buying. Investment trusts, and foreign investors joined in. 'There was active buying by European investors,' said Mr Chris Newton at James Capel. He added that some European investors have started to show an interest in allocating funds to Japan. But buying interest dried up later in the day as institutional investors failed to follow suit. Meanwhile, share prices were unaffected by the resignation from parliament of Mr Shin Kanemaru, former vice president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the country's most powerful politician. Expectations of high sales growth of Interferon, the hepatitis drug, boosted some chemical and pharmaceutical issues. Sumitomo Chemical, the parent company of Sumitomo Pharmaceutical which sells Sumiferon, the country's second largest-selling drug, rose Y5 to Y478. Inabata, a trading company which holds 25 per cent of Sumitomo Pharmaceutical, advanced Y50 to Y1,140. China-related stocks rose ahead of Emperor Akihito's visit to China on October 23. Yaohan Japan, the supermarket chain which plans to set up a retail chain in China, advanced Y60 to Y1,400. Speculators targeted Lion, the toiletries maker, which rose Y14 to Y635 in the day's most active trading. Rumours that the company is developing a fuel from palm oil triggered heavy buying orders. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 12.60 to 19,185.98 in volume of 20.7m shares. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets concentrated on domestic issues. HONG KONG closed at the day's high after an afternoon buying spree which ran against the market's cautious tone ahead of today's airport talks. The Hang Seng Index finished 50.67 higher at 5,806.77, most of it gained in the afternoon. Turnover was little changed at HKDollars 2.41bn. SINGAPORE closed mixed in brisk trading with shipyards coming under light selling pressure. The Straits Times Industrial Index edged up 0.97 to 1,333.85 on volume of 47.3m shares against 41.5m on Tuesday. A specialist rig-building company, Far East Levingston Shipbuilding, was among the key losers after it announced that its Danish client, AP Moller, was not accepting one of the two rigs it had ordered. FELS lost 11 cents to SDollars 2.66 in volume of 414,000 shares. SEOUL was lifted by across-the-board buying. The composite index rose 10.57 to 524.96 with turnover at Won182.3bn after Tuesday's Won119bn. Pohang Iron and Steel Co (Posco) and Korea Electric Power Corp, both heavily weighted on the index, gained momentum and accounted for nearly 10 per cent of the day's volume. A bourse watchdog body said that foreign investors placed buying orders for 370,000 shares in Posco, open to foreigners for the first time. KUALA LUMPUR closed higher but off the day's best as profit-taking emerged in the afternoon. Institutions held off ahead of the Malaysian budget as the composite index closed up 1.43 at 606.56 in volume of 117m shares after 97.7m. AUSTRALIA traded half-heartedly to close lower, with depressed metal prices and pessimism about the domestic and international outlook sidelining potential buyers. The All Ordinaries index fell 3.1 to 1,453.8 in turnover of ADollars 179.75m. Nickel prices reached a 34-month low in London overnight. In line with the softer prices, Western Mining finished down 1 cent to ADollars 4.14 with 2.3m shares traded. CRA, ex-dividend, fell a net 3 cents to ADollars 11.58. NEW ZEALAND ignored Wall Street's overnight gain and positive domestic economic data and ended the session flat. The NZSE-40 capital index lost 0.54 to 1,390.63 after an intraday high of 1,398.02. MANILA's composite index fell 11.75 to 1,386.81. Combined turnover climbed to 11.2bn shares worth 632.62m from 5.04bn shares valued at 331.1m. BANGKOK rose by 1.2 per cent on better foreign interest, and a move into finance sector stocks. The SET index closed 10.97 higher at 879.65 in turnover up from Bt8.5bn to Bt10.3bn, the finance sector gaining 3.4 per cent. BOMBAY opened weak, and subsequently took a severe beating to close with the BSE index 82.13, or 2.6 per cent lower at 3,1O5.63.</p>

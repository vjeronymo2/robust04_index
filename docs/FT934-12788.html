			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Russian banks enter an era of bombs and bodyguards - The new market economy A BOMB explodes at the central bank in the dead of night. Commercial bankers have private armies to protect themselves and their property: less fortunate colleagues have been gunned down. This is not Colombia or Sicily, but Russia. With the collapse of the old communist order, the banks in this fledgling market economy are more than ever before a target and vehicle for fraud, money-laundering, and extortion. Although some banks are unwitting victims, others have been set up by mafia-style organisations to launder ill-gotten gains. Until now absorbed with more basic problems, such as setting up a more efficient payments system, the Russian authorities are finally turning their attention to the need to clean up the banking sector. The central bank badly requires reforms to reduce its vulnerability to fraud. 'The real money in the country is with the banks,' says Mr Sergei Rodionov, the 32-year-old chairman of Bank Imperial, whose black Buick is said to be bullet-proof. 'Why should racketeers rob small stores when they can get millions of roubles from banks?' Mr Rodionov declines to say how many people guard him and his family in addition to the 60 men who protect his bank. But the Most (Bridge) banking and construction group openly admitted last week that it had a security force of 650 men. In contrast, Mr Dmitry Tulin, the 37-year-old deputy governor of the central bank, who has just been given the thankless job of trying to improve supervision over Russia's 2,000 banks, has no bodyguard. 'We are all under a certain pressure coming from . . . underground banking activities and the bosses of the underground economy,' Mr Tulin says. 'But many Russians have become fatalists.' This summer, Mr Sergei Panov, the official responsible for on-site inspections of banks, had his hand smashed and his dacha set on fire after he tried to investigate a Moscow commercial bank. One night in September, a bomb went off at a central bank annexe next door to the Interior Ministry, responsible for law and order. It is still extremely easy to set up a bank in Russia. 'Many of our well-to-do citizens have a choice between buying a new car and setting up a bank,' says Mr Tulin, who describes as 'ridiculous' the central bank's Rbs100m minimum capital requirement for operating a bank - at present exchange rates, the equivalent of Pounds 53,000, less than the cost of an imported American limousine. Although he foresees political problems in raising this limit, he hopes that a start in closing insolvent banks will dampen the enthusiasm for setting up new ones. Mr Tulin also wants to change the central bank's arrangements for refinancing commercial banks. In June, the management of one bank disappeared from Russia with Dollars 4m (Pounds 2.6m) borrowed from the central bank. 'All we can do in such cases is see if there is anything left to compensate ourselves and shareholders.' Nor does the central bank even have guidelines against money-laundering  - a problem Mr Tulin plans to start tackling by inviting leading international experts to a seminar in Moscow next month. Mr Sergei Rayevsky, a former finance minister who is now deputy chairman of one of the more conservative institutions, Neftekhimbank, claims that the 'problems start when banks accept dirty clients'. And when criminal clients ask for more 'loans', bankers either pay up or suffer.</p>

			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> STIEB, BLUE JAYS STOP A'S, 1-0, GO AHEAD IN EAST  </P> <P> Dave Stieb cooled off the Oakland Athletics with a three-hitter and Manny Lee  tripled home the only run as the Toronto Blue Jays ended the A's six-game  winning streak, 1-0, Monday night and moved into the AL East lead.  </P> <P> Stieb (6-2) struck out three and walked one in winning for the first time in  three weeks. It was his first complete game of the season and the 100th of his  career.  </P> <P> Only one A's baserunner got past first base until the seventh inning, when a  pair of two-out errors put runners on second and third. Stieb then retired  Terry Steinbach on a grounder back to the mound.  </P> <P> Mike Moore (4-4) lost despite pitching a six-hitter. Moore is 4-13 against  Toronto in his career.  </P> <P> The victory lifted the defending East champion Blue Jays a half-game ahead of  Milwaukee.  </P> <P> Lee's triple in the fifth scored John Olerud, who singled.  </P> <P> Boston 4, Texas 3 -- Tony Pena hit a two-run double with two outs in the eighth  inning at Arlington, Tex., and the Red Sox dealt the Rangers their eighth  consecutive home loss and dropped them into the AL West cellar.  </P> <P> Mike Greenwell doubled with one out in the eighth off Kenny Rogers, bringing on  Texas relief ace Jeff Russell (1-5). Tom Brunansky grounded out and Dwight  Evans was walked intentionally before Pena delivered.  </P> <P> Jerry Reed (1-1) went 1 2/3 innings and got the victory despite giving up two  runs. Jeff Reardon pitched two perfect innings for his fourth save.  </P> <P> Harold Baines singled home a run for the Rangers in the sixth, but Texas left  the bases loaded. Boston made the score 1-1 when Carlos Quintana doubled home  Ellis Burks in the seventh and scored on a single by Luis Rivera.  </P> <P> Texas regained the lead in the bottom of the seventh when Gary Pettis led off  with a home run and Julio Franco singled home Rafael Palmeiro, who doubled.  </P> <P> Chicago 2, New York 1 -- Scott Fletcher and Robin Ventura singled home runs in  the seventh and Eric King held the Yankees to three hits in eight innings as  the White Sox won at Chicago.  </P> <P> With the victory, the White Sox improved the major leagues' best home record to  16-6 and pulled within 3 1/2 games of Oakland in the West.  </P> <P> King (4-0) gave way to Bobby Thigpen, who pitched the ninth for his 15th save.  </P> <P> Fletcher scored Chicago's first run in the fourth when he singled with two  outs, took third on Guillen's double and came home on a wild pitch by Tim Leary  (3-5).  </P> <P> Jesse Barfield tied the score with a home run in the fifth.  </P> <P> Seattle 4, Milwaukee 3 -- Pinch-hitter Darnell Coles hit a two-run single in  the fifth at Seattle and the Mariners ended a four-game losing streak by  handing the Brewers their sixth loss in a row.  </P> <P> After being staked to a 4-0 lead, Seattle's Erik Hanson (5-3) gave up his first  home runs of the season, a solo homer to Dave Parker in the sixth and a two-run  homer by Paul Molitor in the seventh.  </P> <P> Kansas City 3, Detroit 2 -- Bret Saberhagen pitched his third consecutive  complete game victory and Kevin Seitzer hit two doubles, giving him five  consecutive extra-base hits, as the Royals beat the Tigers at Kansas City.  </P> <P> Saberhagen (4-3) gave up nine hits as the Royals equaled their longest winning  streak of the season at three games.  </P> <P> Saberhagen, 13-5 lifetime against the Tigers, has given up seven earned runs in  his last 40 1/3 innings. He gave up a run-scoring single to Tracy Jones in the  fourth and Matt Nokes' homer in the ninth.  </P> <P> Seitzer doubled to lead off the game and scored, then doubled in the third.  </P> <P> Mike Macfarlane and Terry Shumpert hit consecutive doubles in the seventh for  what proved to be the decisive run.  </P></p>

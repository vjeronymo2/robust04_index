			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Sychev: "NATO Invites Kozyrev to </F> Brussels"]    [Text] At the latest session of the NATO Council the North  Atlantic alliance member countries' permanent representatives  adopted a decision, as the press release says, "to invite Russia  to immediately begin talks in Brussels" on the problem of  developing broader relations.    The Russian Foreign Ministry has been informed of this  decision but has not yet received NATO's proposals which would,  on the one hand, augment the Partnership for Peace program,  which has already been signed by 18 European states not  belonging to the bloc, and on the other would take into account  Russia's special significance and role in European and  international affairs.    To judge from paragraph nine of the NATO Council decision,  which gives a quite extravagant account of Russia's significance  and talks of the need for the alliance to develop ties with it,  Brussels is aware that there can be no hope of the further  strengthening of stability and security in Europe without it.  Furthermore, the principle on which the new relations will be  based -- the "deepening of partnership without reciprocal vetoes  and surprises" -- causes no objections either in Moscow or in  Brussels. In other words, Brussels need not fear that Moscow is  going to interfere in NATO's affairs and Russia can expect to be  consulted when pan-European affairs are being decided.    Moscow has set out its vision of Russia's ties with NATO  twice -- the first time in Brussels during Defense Minister  Pavel Grachev's visit there, and again last week in Istanbul,  where they were developed by Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev.  Outwardly at least NATO reacted quite coolly to the Russian  proposals, fearing criticism from the East Europeans for  compliance toward "Moscow's expansionism" and hoping that the  active campaign for Europe's affiliation to the Partnership for  Peace program will force Russia to make major concessions.    When asked what compromise Moscow might make, one  well-informed Russian policy expert replied that Russia will not  be opposed to formulating additional measures in relations with  NATO in a separate protocol and will undoubtedly insist on  creating some kind of consultative mechanism, which would make  it possible to conduct a broad dialogue on the whole range of  policy and security questions.    Brussels is expecting the Russian Foreign Minister for talks  as early as next week. At the Russian Foreign Ministry  IZVESTIYA was told that Kozyrev did indeed intend to visit  Brussels and launch large-scale cooperation with the North  Atlantic alliance.</p>

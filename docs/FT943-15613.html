			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Whitehall agency praised on rents Property Holdings, the Whitehall agency responsible for providing civil-service accommodation, was yesterday praised for saving Pounds 500m in rents between 1988 and 1992. The report by the National Audit Office, the public-spending watchdog, comes just two months after the government announced plans to reduce the agency's powers. Instead of managing the government's general purpose office accommodation, Property Holdings will advise the departments, agencies and quangos which occupy a total of 7.5m sq m of office space. The watchdog's study was more critical of government departments which had reduced Property Holdings' bargaining powers with private-sector landlords by ill-defined or changing departmental requirements; by setting timetables which were too tight, or by making competitive negotiations difficult by signalling their intentions to prospective landlords. Property Holdings, on behalf of the Department of the Environment, manages 7.5m sq m of office space. In future the 3,267 offices in the estate are to be handed over to the bodies that occupy them. Property Holdings will continue to provide advice and support to departments.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 28/5/1994 -- The International  Conference "Central and Eastern Europe: Search for Security and  Stability" finished yesterday in Chisinau. The participants  examined several questions regarding the situation in the former  Soviet countries.    Leader of the Moldovan Socialist Democratic Party (PSDM)  Oazu  Nantoi pointed out that undoubtedly Moldova is under the  military and strategic influence of Russia and this is a  negative factor. Nantoi criticized the government coalition of  the Agrarians and Socialists. "In my opinion, Moldovan people  chose on February 27th the liquidation of independence," said  Nantoi.    Romanian Presidential Counselor on relations with Moldova,  Ion Netelea, stated during the conference that the Romanian  Government does not seek unification of the historic Romanian  territories. Nonetheless, Netelea emphasized that Bucharest  treats the events in 1940 as a territorial usurpation.  "Moldova's economic policy leans mainly on Russia. Romania by  no means intends to eliminate Russia from the Moldovan economy  in order to take its place. However, we would like Moldova to  have the choice to have as many options in the West as in the  East," stated Netelea.    Deputy chairman of the Euro-Atlantic Centre, Vadim Malakhov,  made a report on the parallels between the Dniester and Crimean  conflicts. According to Malakhov, the same structures for  setting up a break-away region were employed in Crimea as in  Dniester. Malakhov emphasized that the creation of autonomous  judicial organs in Crimea is alarming, as it should lead to a  military conflict.    Nicolae Turtureanu, of the Moldovan Defence Ministry, stated  that although Russia plays a negative role in the conflicts in  the former USSR, it cannot be eliminated from the collective  security system. "It would be better if a unique Euro-Asian  security system would be created in the future," added  Turtureanu.</p>

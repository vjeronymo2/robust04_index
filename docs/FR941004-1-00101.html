			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1357.50&blank;Direct Payments to Indian Tribal Organizations (Title IV&hyph;B, Subpart 2, Family Preservation and Family Support Services)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1357.50 is a new section added to propose requirements applicable only to Indian tribes eligible for and administering grants under title IV&hyph;B, subpart 2. We considered combining into one section all fiscal and administrative requirements for Indian tribes under title IV&hyph;B, subparts 1 and 2 but, as with the State fiscal requirements in &sect;&sect;1357.30 and 1357.32, the statutory requirements for Indian tribes are different in each subpart. It appeared to be simpler and clearer to put them in separate sections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In paragraph (a), we have included the definitions from section 431(a) of the Act for the terms ``Alaska Native organization,'' ``Indian tribe,'' and ``tribal organization.'' These are included for clarity; the tribal allotments are computed based on the first two definitions, and the definition of tribal organization is included because section 434 of the Act provides that ACF will pay to the tribal organization of the Indian tribe any amount to which the Indian tribe is entitled under subpart 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (b)(1) explains the statutory requirement for eligibility for funds in FY 1994 which is based on the Indian tribe's FY 1995 allotment. (The FY 1995 allotment must be at least $10,000 for the Indian tribe to be eligible in FY 1994.) Additional explanation on eligibility was sent to Indian tribes and others in Program Instruction ACYF&hyph;PI&hyph;94&hyph;04, January 18, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (c) proposes that, beginning in FY 1995, in order to receive title IV&hyph;B, subpart 2 funds, an Indian tribe must submit a comprehensive child and family services plan that meets the requirements applicable to Indian tribes in &sect;1357.15.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to fund as many eligible Indian tribes as possible under the law, we have proposed in paragraph (d) a process for adding Indian tribal grantees in FY 1996 through FY 1998.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For FY 1996, FY 1997, and FY 1998, we propose to calculate allotments as required in section 433 of the Act. Those Indian tribes whose allotment is at least $10,000 (the minimum for eligibility specified in the law), will be invited to apply. As in FY 1995, in order to receive funding, the Indian tribe must submit a comprehensive child and family services plan that meets the requirements applicable to Indian tribes in &sect;1357.15. The statute does not make available 100 percent Federal funds for planning in FYs 1996&hyph;1998.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We want to point out that while this proposal increases the number of Indian tribes receiving funds, it will decrease the amount the Indian tribes eligible in the first year (FY 1994) will otherwise receive in FYs 1996&hyph;98. Although we have received recommendations that funding additional Indian tribes should be our first priority, we also are concerned that the size of most of the grants to Indian tribes is small. Indian tribes have been creative in the past in using comparatively small grants to provide services, but we are concerned that smaller grants will be less effective in helping Indian tribes develop and operate the needed services. We look forward to hearing from the Indian community on this proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another issue about which we have received many recommendations is that of funding consortia of Indian tribes, e.g., to permit two or more tribes to apply for funding whose combined total grant would equal $10,000. We have researched the legislative history and analyzed the statute and can find no basis for funding consortia, given the clear language of the law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (e) specifies that the allotments will be computed based on section 433 of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have accepted recommendations from Indian tribes and other Indian advocacy groups to waive certain statutory requirements. This waiver authority is based on the Secretary's discretion in section 432(b) of the Act to waive any provision in section 432 that is determined to be inappropriate to Indian tribes, taking into account the resources, needs, and other circumstances of the Indian tribe. In paragraph (f), we propose to waive three statutory provisions for Indian tribes: the ten percent limit on administrative costs, the supplantation provision, and the requirement that a significant portion of funds must be used for both family preservation and family support services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe that waiving the supplantation and significant portion provisions are reasonable, given the limited dollars available to the Indian tribes, our desire to reduce inappropriate requirements, and the circumstances of tribal services programs. We believe that waiving the ten percent administrative cost limitation and allowing Indian tribes to use their current negotiated indirect cost rates is reasonable based on the need for flexibility in working with small grantees and our understanding that, in some cases, some service-related costs are reflected in the indirect cost rates negotiated by some Indian tribes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (g) reflects the statutory requirement for a 25 percent match rate. Although we received many recommendations that this provision also be waived, we do not have the authority to do so. Section 432(b) of the Act permits waivers only of requirements in section 432. The match requirement is in section 434 of the Act. However, we have included in paragraph (g)(2) a list of three Federal sources of funds which Indian tribes may use as a source of matching funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (h) states the time limit on expenditure of funds (section 434(b) of the Act). This means that Indian tribes must submit their Standard Form (SF) 269 expenditure reports annually, 90 days after the end of the expenditure period, i.e., by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> December 30 of each year. In addition, paragraph (h) references other applicable fiscal and administrative requirements (that may be found in the Program Instruction (ACYF&hyph;PI&hyph;94&hyph;04, January 18, 1994)) and which will be prepared by ACF in the form of assurances for all grantees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Impact Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Impact Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 requires that regulations be drafted to ensure that they are consistent with the priorities and principles set forth in the Executive Order. The Department has determined that this rule is consistent with these priorities and principles. This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking implements statutory authority for a broad consultation and coordination process leading to the development of a five-year child and family services plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEGISLATORS GO TO BAT FOR CONSUMERS;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO: FROM AUTO SAFETY TO CLOTH DIAPERS, THE BILLS ARE HAVING THEIR  GREATEST SUCCESS IN YEARS. LAWMAKERS CITE INCREASED PRESSURE FROM THE PUBLIC.  </P> <P> Legislation designed to benefit consumers on a host of topics -- from minivan  safety to cloth diapers to Small Claims Court actions -- is meeting with its  greatest success in the Legislature in recent years.  </P> <P> In the closing weeks of the Legislature's 1989-90 session, lawmakers have  approved dozens of bills to curb the abuse of personal credit information,  require banks to beef up security at automatic teller machines and prevent the  accidental poisoning of children by toxic household products.  </P> <P> And in a significant departure from the past, the Legislature approved a bill  that provides prison terms for employers and supervisors who knowingly expose  consumers or workers to hazardous conditions.  </P> <P> While the Legislature is still stymied on such major issues as auto insurance  and health insurance, advocates for consumer groups are pleased with the  success rate for bills of a moderate scale that could benefit large segments of  the public.  </P> <P> "I'm not a Pollyanna by nature, but I do think things are better," said Harry  Snyder, a Consumers Union lobbyist who has been pushing legislators for years  to pass such measures. "I think legislators are fed up with not accomplishing  stuff. . . . They are tired of being treated like potted palms by the special  interests."  </P> <P> The surge in consumer actions comes at a time when legislators have been  battered by accusations that they serve special-interest campaign contributors  at the expense of the public. The influence of special-interest lobbyists has  been highlighted this month by the corruption trial of former Sen. Paul  Carpenter taking place in federal court three blocks from the Capitol.  </P> <P> The push for consumer protections also comes during an election year in which  92 of the 120 members of the Legislature are up for reelection and a new  governor will be chosen.  </P> <P> But legislators themselves discount the importance of election-year politics or  their image problems. They say that consumer interest has intensified in the  Legislature because of increased pressure from the public, heightened  sensitivity among business leaders and a growing awareness among lawmakers.  </P> <P> "Partly it's tied in to the environmental movement," said Assemblyman Richard  Katz (D-Sylmar). "The public is more conscious about what they buy from a toxic  standpoint, from a recycling standpoint and also from a safety standpoint. That  increased pressure from the public puts more pressure on the Legislature to  pass consumer-oriented bills."  </P> <P> Among the consumer measures sent to Gov. George Deukmejian in recent weeks was  a measure by Katz that would require manufacturers of toxic household products  -- such as antifreeze, insecticides or cleaners -- to use child-proof  containers or add chemical agents to make them taste bitter. More than 130,000  poisonings occur in California every year, most of them involving children  under the age of 6, Katz said in pushing for the measure.  </P> <P> Also awaiting action by the governor is a bill by Assemblyman Johan Klehs  (D-Castro Valley) that would require automobile dealers to notify buyers  whether new minivans comply with federal safety standards. Under federal law,  minivans do not have to meet the same crash-protection standards as other  passenger vehicles.  </P> <P> The Legislature has also sent to Deukmejian a measure by Sen. Charles Calderon  (D -- Whittier) that would require banks to provide adequate lighting and other  security features to prevent assaults on customers using automatic teller  machines.  </P> <P> In an attempt to reduce accidents caused by automatic garage door openers, the  Legislature passed a bill by Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles) that  would establish minimum safety standards for the devices. At least 44 children  have been killed nationwide -- including six in California -- by automatic  garage door openers since 1982, Polanco said.  </P> <P> And Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) won passage of a bill that would  require all office computer terminals to conform to national safety and  ergonomic design standards. Injuries and stress complaints related to computer  use constitute the fastest growing category of employee disability claims,  Hayden said.  </P> <P> However, among the most significant consumer measures approved by the  Legislature this year are bills that would impose penalties on corporations and  employers.  </P> <P> One bill by Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles) would make it a crime  for a corporation or manager to knowingly conceal a dangerous product or  business practice from consumers, employees or regulatory agencies. The measure  provides up to three years in prison and a fine of up to $25,000 for a manager  convicted under the law.  </P> <P> A bill by Assemblyman Ted Lempert (D-San Mateo) would increase the limit on  Small Claims Court awards from $2,000 to $5,000. At the same time, it would  place a limit of two cases per year involving any claim over $2,500, thus  restricting the ability of businesses to use the Small Claims system for  recovering debts.  </P> <P> In some cases, consumer-oriented legislation has fared well this year because  it addresses environmental issues such as air pollution and recycling.  </P> <P> One such measure by Sen. Lucy Killea (D-San Diego) would require child care  facilities to give parents a choice of using cloth diapers instead of the  disposable plastic diapers that cannot be recycled.  </P> <P> A bill by Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) would give a sales tax break to  buyers of low-polluting automobiles while boosting the tax on high-polluting  vehicles. A consumer could save as much as $700 when buying a low-polluting,  medium-priced model, according to Hart.  </P> <P> In an attempt to protect the public from credit abuses, the Legislature has  sent a number of measures to the governor.  </P> <P> One bill by Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-Los Banos) would prohibit merchants  from requiring customers to write their telephone numbers or home addresses on  credit card slips. This information is sometimes resold to telephone  solicitors.  </P> <P> Another bill by Areias would prohibit merchants from requiring customers to  disclose their credit card numbers on the back of personal checks. In some  cases, the information has been used illegally to charge purchases to credit  card holders.  </P> <P> "Corporate leaders are becoming much more sensitive to their public image,"  said Areias in explaining why his measures succeeded. "They are aware of the  increasing concern by the general public as it relates to consumer protection  issues."  </P> <P> It is uncertain which of all these consumer-related bills the governor will  sign. Some bills, such as the measures that increase penalties for businessmen  and require new standards for computer terminals, are strongly opposed by  business groups who often have the Republican governor's ear.  </P> <P> But earlier this year, Deukmejian signed a variety of consumer bills including  measures to curb telephone harassment, prohibit the mail-order sale of hearing  aids by unlicensed distributors and require retailers who refuse to give  refunds or exchanges to disclose their policy in advance.  </P> <P> Assembly Speaker Willie Brown predicted that consumer legislation will win even  broader support in the future. "The level of interest is going to increase and  you're going to see every member having some bill he or she calls a consumer  bill," the San Francisco Democrat said.  </P></p>

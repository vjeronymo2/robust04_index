			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GETTING A LINE ON AMERICA'S GROWING APPETITE FOR HIGH-QUALITY FISH;  </P> <P> DISTRIBUTION NETWORK KEEPS CATCH MOVING FROM SEA TO YOUR TABLE  </P> <P> Health-conscious Americans have turned to fish. While consumption still trails  far behind chicken and beef, in 1987 Americans ate a record amount of seafood  -- 15.4 pounds per capita.  </P> <P> At the same time, the cost of fish escalated more than that of any other  protein food. This demand has not only put a strain on consumers' pocketbooks,  but also on the system's ability to provide fish of consistently high quality.  </P> <P> Transporting all this fish from the sea to the plate is a massive and difficult  task, a race against the clock that must maximize shelf life and minimize  temperature abuse. For example, if a cod fillet is stored at 32 degrees, its  shelf life will be 14 days, according to the National Marine Fisheries Service.  Seven degrees warmer and that cod's shelf life will be cut in half.  </P> <P> From the water, a fish may go through five owners before it is purchased by a  consumer. Because of their sales volume, supermarket chains can buy directly  from processors who will ship fish to the chains' main distribution centers.  From there, the products are shipped to individual stores.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Convolutions, Exceptions  </P> <P> Specialty fish shops and restaurants usually buy from a wholesaler. But there  are many convolutions and exceptions. Often, wholesalers sell to one another.  </P> <P> To consolidate orders, processors often ship fish back and forth with no  apparent geographic logic; turbot and john dory caught overseas are flown into  Dulles Airport outside Washington and shipped to Steve Connelly's seafood plant  in Gloucester, where they are repacked and then shipped back to Washington  restaurants. Connelly also buys grouper caught in Florida, processes it and  then ships it back to Florida restaurants.  </P> <P> "Quiet, boys," the woman orders in a distinctive Boston accent. It is 6:30 on a  Monday morning, and the start of the Boston Fish Auction.  </P> <P> In a musty room with the atmosphere of a disinterested high-school class, a  group of about 20 buyers from Boston's fish-processing plants are gathered to  bid on the morning's catch -- a load from about seven boats that have returned  from a week out on Georges Bank, one of New England's prime fishing areas.  These processors ship fish all over the country.  </P> <P> Aside from Boston, there are four other fish auctions in the country -- New  Bedford, Mass.; the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey; Portland, Me.;  and Honolulu.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bought Sight Unseen  </P> <P> In Boston the auction is not a display; processors will purchase fish they have  not seen.  </P> <P> A blackboard at the front of the room lists the names of the boats, the type of  fish and the amount caught: The Carol Ann, the Captain Sam II, the Nancy &amp;  Heidi, the True Life, the Reliable. Haddock, cod, gray sole, hake, cusk,  flounder. For example, the Carol Ann is listed for 500 pounds of haddock among  its catch; the Captain Sam II, for 500 pounds of gray sole.  </P> <P> The buyers are a hardened lot who know the inner workings of this business like  the inside of a timepiece. There are people such as Bobby Brandano, in his  shiny black jacket with Great Eastern Seafood emblazoned in gold, his onyx  pompadour and his tight-fitting jeans.  </P> <P> Brandano keeps close tabs on what boats have gone out to sea and when they are  scheduled to return. Fishermen have reputations, and Brandano wants to buy from  the best.  </P> <P> There's Mike Vitales from Puritan Seafood, who sells to seafood distributors  who in turn sell to upscale markets and restaurants. (Today, Foehrkolb will buy  200 pounds of cod, 50 of pollack, 160 of flounder and 120 of gray sole from  Vitales.)  </P> <P> "All the haddock is for sale," the auctioneer begins. The bidding starts at  $1.50 a pound, ends at $1.75. There are 3 minutes to bid on each species until  the buzzer is rung.  </P> <P> During the auction, several of the buyers talk in muffled voices on telephones  lined against the wall, relaying the bids to their companies as they are  shouted, inquiring whether they should up the bid depending on their client's  demands. In between, the woman in charge repeats: "Quiet, boys."  </P> <P> There are a lot of things that are not being said openly here, most of them  based on the supply of fish landed elsewhere. By 5 a.m., the buyers were in  their offices, calling around to find out the amount of fish landed at other  New England ports.  </P> <P> More importantly, the availability and price of fish in Canada also has a  crucial impact on the price and quality of fish purchased domestically.  </P> <P> Close to 60% of all the groundfish -- the cod, haddock, flounder, etc. -- that  are eaten in this country are actually landed off Canada, primarily off the  coasts of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. Domestic waters have been largely  overfished for these species.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Canadian Fish  </P> <P> This Canadian product is trucked and-or ferried from the Maritimes into the  United States and is called "over-the-road fish." Because the American dollar  is worth more than the Canadian, and because the supply of fish is greater, it  is less expensive than domestic "dock fish" and can be paid for as much as 30  days later -- a great incentive for many processors, according to Connelly.  </P> <P> As a result of the time it takes to get to this country, however, the Canadian  fish are "almost never as good quality" as domestic fish, Connelly believes.  </P> <P> Practically all New England processors are forced to buy Canadian fish at one  time or another to meet demand, but "as a rule" more of it will go to large  supermarket chains, according to Lee Weddig, director of the National Fisheries  Institute.  </P> <P> On this particular morning, market-sized cod sell at the Boston auction for 70  cents a pound. Over-the-road cod from Canada are selling for 55 cents a pound,  according to one processor.  </P> <P> Because there are a lot of over-the-road fish available this morning, the  Boston buyers don't have to clamor for dock fish, which explains the somewhat  sluggish pace of the auction, the processor said.  </P> <P> But this is where defensive games come in: One processor, who asked not to be  identified, said that if he knows he will be buying fish from Canada, he may  start a bid at the auction even though he has no intention of buying it.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Secrets  </P> <P> He will open the bid at the price of the Canadian fish, figuring another bidder  will up the ante. The upshot, he hopes, will be that a competitor will buy the  load and end up paying more (and having to sell for more) than he does. As he  explained, "Everybody knows who's doing what to whom."  </P> <P> Tom Morris, sales manager of Empire Fish, said that before fishermen go out to  sea, they'll arrange code words with him for when they radio in their catches.  The radio waves at sea are open. "Before they leave, they'll tell us, 'Every  time we say we're catching pollack, it'll mean haddock,' " said Morris. "Or if  they say 'we've caught 150 pounds,' it really means 1,500. They could talk in  Italian, but they're all Italian."  </P> <P> After the Boston auction, the fish prices are relayed to Gloucester processors,  who set their prices accordingly, generally at 3 cents to 5 cents less per  pound because the Gloucester boats are unloaded by workers from the processing  plants themselves. The fishermen don't have to pay "lumpers," workers who  unload fish at the Boston pier.  </P> <P> The pricing structure gets even more complex: Though Empire paid 67 cents a  pound for cod on this day, that price has little correlation to what the  supermarket will pay the processor. Because supermarkets need to know prices a  week or more in advance to plan for ads, Morris must quote a chain a price even  before the fish are caught. "You talk about a crap shoot," he said.  </P> <P> Also, the 67 cents represents what Empire paid for the whole cod, not the  fillet. Once the fish is filleted, only about a third of its original weight  remains.  </P> <P> Thus, that cod really cost Empire $2.23 a pound. According to the prior  arrangement, the processing firm charged Safeway $3 a pound for the cod. The  chain then sold it at fish counters for $5.49 -- an 83% markup.  </P> <P> Ann Cockrell, spokesperson for Safeway, said that the chain "does not discuss  gross profits," but that the markup simply reflects "our costs and the cost of  getting it to the consumer."  </P> <P> Some people pay the Boston auction price, but after that "there are a zillion  exceptions," according to Dave Coombs, manager of Steve Connelly's Seafood.  </P> <P> For example, if the fish are not of the quality that the processor expected,  the price may be renegogiated with the fisherman when they are unloaded.  </P> <P> Or, a processor or distributor who gets stuck with a product that it knows its  clients will not accept may sell it to another. "I guarantee that the stuff I  reject gets sold to a less discerning restaurateur," said Bob Kinkead, owner  and chef at 21 Federal restaurant in Washington.  </P> <P> In fact, this type of practice may offer one explanation for the varying  quality of seafood. For example, on a recent Friday afternoon, a  Washington-area distributor left a whole swordfish lying in the warehouse,  rejecting it because its bloodline was brown -- not red -- indicating that it  was an older fish. At some point during the beginning of the following week,  the fish would be sold to someone else. In the meantime, it would deteriorate  further.  </P> <P> Those processors, distributors and wholesalers who are most concerned about  quality keep close tabs on the fish all along the distribution chain --  starting at the docks.  </P> <P> Following the Boston Fish Auction, for example, several of the processors pick  and choose fish after they are hoisted in canvas bags from boats in the harbor.  Steve Connelly's Seafood also makes sure that its buyer is in close proximity  while this is occurring.  </P> <P> "Romeo goes to their weddings, their funerals," said Coombs, referring to the  relationship his buyer has established with the fishermen. Sometimes, it's  "Romeo's cousin who's in the hold," he added.  </P> <P> But some processors and distributors are forced to be concerned about volume.  For that reason, Kinkead believes that generally supermarkets are a bad place  to buy fish. Not only are they not able to "watch everything that carefully,"  but they are forced to buy less expensive fish to begin with.  </P> <P> A piece of good fresh fish can stand on its own: simply baked, grilled, poached  or sauteed with a touch of wine, a squirt of lemon or a light sprinkling of  herbs. But no matter how much attention is paid to a fish along the  distribution chain, it can all go down the drain if it's improperly cooked.  </P> <P> As George Berkowitz, owner of Boston's Legal Sea Foods restaurants put it,  "When people tell me they dislike fish, I suspect they probably have spent a  lifetime eating it overcooked . . . "  </P> <P> To avoid overcooking, Berkowitz offers these basic tips in his book, "The Legal  Sea Foods Cookbook" (Doubleday, $12.95):  </P> <P>  -- Cook fish just until it has lost its translucency and turned opaque -- no  longer.  </P> <P>  -- Whether it is whole, cut in fillets or left in steaks, bake fish at a high  temperature -- anywhere from 400 degrees to 450 degrees.  </P> <P>  -- Whatever the cooking method, use the rule of thumb: 10 minutes per inch of  thickness.  </P></p>

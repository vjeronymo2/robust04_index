Last year some substantial changes were registered  in commercial transactions with nonstate securities along with  trends that have persisted for a long time now, in particular a  stable improvement in trends on the market of shares of the  largest commercial banks and the prevalence of the stock markets  of the capital city in the breakdown of the volume of  transactions.    Thus, despite the prevalence in commercial circulation of  transactions with bank securities, with which institutional  investors (in particular, voucher investment funds) frequently  replenish their investment portfolios, last year new segments of  the market evolved virtually from scratch before our eyes: a  market for stock in privatized enterprises and a market for the  stock of voucher investment funds. Besides, as the general  knowledge of information of market participants improved and the  number of issuers whose stock actively circulates on the  secondary market increased substantially, the number of those  actively speculating in the securities of private and  institutional investors grew considerably. In the latter  instance an important role was played by the fact that the  intensification of inflationary processes has virtually robbed  long-term investment in stock (for the purposes of receiving  regular dividend income) of its attractiveness; this focused the  attention of market participants almost exclusively on  speculative play with the shares of Russian issuers.  Transactions to acquire or sell controlling blocs of shares of  the issuers continue to form a special group in operations with  the securities of Russian enterprises. The role of this segment  of the market grew the most as secondary trading in the shares  of privatized enterprises got underway.    In analyzing the dynamics of the activities of participants  in the market, we should note that this year market trends did  not experience the usual summer slump, and the volume of sales  on the securities market did not drop during the summer vacation  season; in some instances, volumes even increased.    Certain shifts occurred last year in the significance of  regions within the structure of the all-Russian securities  market. Thus, it should be noted that the proportion of  commercial volume sustained by participants in regional markets  increased substantially and confidently exceeded the 30-percent  mark. At the same time, the proportion of transactions involving  the stock of regional issues on the markets of Moscow and St.  Petersburg increased sharply, especially in the second half of  1993.    Nonetheless, despite the intensive development of new  segments of the market, the stock of respectable commercial  banks still enjoys well-deserved attention from investors; until  recently these banks were virtually the only group of issuers  vigorously involved in maintaining the liquidity of their  securities.    For a long time the Tveruniversalbank, the Commercial Bank  of  Mytishchi, the Siberian Trade Bank, and the Hermes Center Bank  led this segment of the market most of the time. A stable  improvement in trends on the market for the stock of these  issuers was due primarily to the vigorous activities of  market-makers for these stocks. Besides, in the case of the  Tveruniversalbank we have a wonderful example of coordinated  operations by an extensive Interregional Chain of official  dealers which was set up by the bank; the dealers offer  continuous two-way quotations of the stock in both capital  cities and the regions.    A "bank" market for securities that has evolved in St.  Petersburg merits special discussion: for a year now,  transactions with the shares of three or four local banks have  accounted for more than 80 percent of the commercial volume. The  banks have a wonderful field for the exercise of influence and  control in the form of the isolated and not-too-deep market of  St. Petersburg. This, in particular, may be the explanation for  the stable and extremely high rates of growth of quotations of  bank stock in the summer and fall of 1993. The St. Petersburg  Bank, Promstroybank, and Vitabank are among the largest issuers  in this group.    There were also other reasons for the sharp increase in the  value of stock of commercial banks. Thus, a leap in the value of  Inkombank stock in the fall of this year was due to a  combination of circumstances occurring simultaneously. After 20  July, Inkombank released information on the acquisition of 40  percent of its stock by a large American finance company,  Shearson Lehman Brothers [rendered in English in original]. This  large bloc of shares was distributed among three American  finance companies (their names were not revealed). The amount of  the transaction came to $40 million, which made it possible for  the bank to increase the paid-in statutory capital to at least  $90 million. At the same time, in the course of modifying  strategy in the market for its securities, the bank reverted to  a previously used pattern whereby liquidity in the secondary  market for its own securities was maintained through dealers  controlled by the bank. The Irtan joint-stock company founded by  Inkombank played the role of lead dealer. The set of measures  taken made it possible to substantially raise the quotations of  bank shares on the market. From the second half of July on, the  value of Inkombank stock has continuously remained above the  previously unattainable mark of 45,000 rubles [R], reaching  R49,000 on the exchange and R50,000 in off-exchange transactions.    As experts study the development of the Russian nonstate  securities market, on the whole they still agree that the  liquidity of traded stock remains at an unsatisfactory level.  Nonetheless, an extensive process of conversion to joint-stock  operations and privatization in Russia lays the foundation (in  the long term) for the rapid growth and expansion of the stock  market in Russia.    This is also confirmed by the fact that powerful groups of  institutional investors, which in the long run will be capable  of ensuring an acceptable depth of the stock market in Russia,  are gradually beginning to emerge in the market. The first group  was made up of voucher investment funds which have raised  massive batches of privatization vouchers in the process of  voucher privatization. The second group is being made up of  insurance companies; the volume of attracted insurance premiums  of the largest of them come to dozens of billions of rubles a  year. Finally, in the fall of this year the process of  legitimizing the operations of nonstate retirement funds, of  which there already are about 120 in Russia, should be  completed. These factors create a tremendous potential for the  development of the stock market in Russia.    As the most significant result of 1993 we may note the utter  collapse of illusions with regard to the ability of the existing  Russian stock exchanges to become stable centers for the liquid  trading of securities. During 1993 the stock market remained off  the exchange; an overwhelming majority of exchange transactions  were performed for demonstration purposes. Many professional  finance brokers are quite skeptical about the ability of stock  exchanges to become genuine centers for high-quality, liquid  secondary trading in securities even in the remote future. The  reasons for the pessimism of brokers with regard to stock  exchanges include the poor standards of their managers and  experts (the absence of exchange trading robs exchanges of their  main source of support, which makes it impossible for them to  retain highly rated specialists), the absence in most instances  of genuine steps toward the development of effective trading,  settlement, and data systems, and many other reasons.    Under the circumstances, 1994 may become the year of  unexpected self-organization of the strongest market-makers into  an off-exchange system for securities trading which would  function efficiently and would be managed by a collective organ.  Sufficient quantities of traded high-quality shares and  sufficient numbers of professional financial institutions are  already creating the necessary prerequisites for the emergence  of a system of this kind. It is "just" the organizational  solution for the operation of an off-exchange system of this  kind that largely remains a problem to this day.</p>

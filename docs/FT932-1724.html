			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (21): The very nuts and bolts of change - Management / Christopher Lorenz on the management world's most fashionable fad, process re-engineering IF YOU have just parachuted from Mars, or flown in from a six-month sojourn in the Seychelles, the term 'process re-engineering' may conjure up nothing more than the pipework of a chemical plant, or something equally obscure. If, on the other hand, you have skimmed the occasional business newspaper or magazine, you will know that 're-engineering' promises some sort of revolution, and has burst with a vengeance on to the management scene since Christmas. It has hit America especially hard, becoming the most instant fashion since 'excellence' a decade ago. If you have been reading more carefully, you will know that the reason for the craze is that re-engineering promises productivity miracles in virtually every industry through the complete redesign of white-collar 'business processes.' The last fad to grip the executive world, total quality management, took as many years to gather momentum as it does, through 'continuous improvement,' to accumulate dramatic pay-offs in cost, quality, and productivity. In contrast, re-engineering promises in just a year or two to squeeze at least ten-fold the time taken to complete many processes. This is achieved by replacing their traditionally fragmented, poorly connected processes, which operate within narrow, separate and steeply hierarchical 'functional' departments. In their place, a growing canon of US and European companies has installed single processes which span their organisations from side to side. A typical one will embrace sales, ordering, installation, billing and cash collection in one single stream of activity undertaken by multi-disciplinary teams. Another will link the design, development, engineering and production of new products and services. Beneath the detail, the most revolutionary aspect of re-engineering is that it challenges a prime principle on which 20th century organisations have been based: the maxims of 'Taylorism' (after Frederick Taylor) and 'Fordism' (after Henry Ford), that work should be broken into narrow, specialised activities and departments so that it can be supervised and controlled. It is the impact of re-engineering on the social and authority structures of organisations which makes it so difficult to achieve. It requires not only the redesign of the 'hard' elements of an enterprise - the processes themselves, and the systems which 'enable' them - but also considerable change in the organisation's 'soft' aspects: its people, their skills, behaviour, values and culture. With so much at stake - plus hefty publishing royalties and consulting fees  -it is not surprising that the past six months have seen a flood of books on the subject. The most hyped by far is Re-engineering the Corporation, by Michael Hammer and James Champy (Nicholas Brealey Pounds 16.99, 223 pages). These two consultants have done more to define the 'hard' side of re-engineering than anyone else; Hammer runs his own firm, while Champy heads CSC Index. The virtue of their book is its brevity, readibility and - for the most part  -clarity. It certainly explains the nuts and bolts of re-engineering and illustrates them well with packaged case studies. But it suffers from several drawbacks. Most important are its lack of detail on several key issues and its inconsistent approach to the cultural changes which are needed if re-engineering is not to run into a brick wall, or be undermined. Having declared in a surprising slip on page three that 'business re-engineering doesn't try to change the behaviour of American workers and managers,' by chapter four Hammer and Champy are exemplifying the very opposite: the vast changes in attitudes, values and behaviour that must be associated with re-engineering. They are also inconsistent about whether they think behavioural and cultural change - 'empowerment,' teamwork and so on - are an automatic result of the re-engineering of business processes, or whether such 'soft' change needs to be launched in parallel or even beforehand. Controversially, much of the book suggests that soft follows hard automatically, yet at Bell Atlantic, one of their prime case study companies, a culture change programme was launched two years ahead of re-engineering. This is not explained in the book. Surprisingly in view of its subtitle, which focuses on information technology, Thomas Davenport's Process Innovation (HBS Press/McGraw Hill Pounds 26.95, 337 pages) does a better but less readable job of relating all the hard and soft elements of re-engineering to each other. This is partly because Davenport made his book 50 per cent longer, but also because he sees re-engineering as only part of his universe, rather than its core. Davenport, a partner at Ernst and Young, underlines that re-engineering is only part of what has to be done when processes are changed radically. Refreshingly, he uses the term to refer purely to the actual design of the new processes. Far tougher and more 'wrenching,' he rightly says, are the human and organisational dimensions of change. He is also clear that behaviour and culture changes are necessary bedfellows of re-engineering, rather than its automatic progeny. For companies setting out on the re-engineering trail, this is a critical distinction. In a different and equally useful sense, Business Process Re-engineering (John Wiley Pounds 24.95, 241 pages) by Henry J Johansson and three other consultants from Coopers and Lybrand, also takes a refreshingly broad approach. For one thing, it is not entirely American. For another, its USP is to make re-engineering less inward-looking by setting it in the context of marketing and business strategy. Like others, Johansson and Co distinguish between two types of re-engineering: first, that which creates dramatic cost, time and productivity improvements in rather narrow business processes, such as Dun and Bradstreet's establishment of credit-rating contracts; second, that which helps a company achieve parity, or 'best in class,' in an entire 'core' process, such as the design-to-delivery cycle within AT&amp;T. But the Coopers team also adds a third type: the occasional process revolution which enables a company to leapfrog way ahead of its rivals by changing the rules of an entire market or industry. Wal-Mart re-engineered its 'supply chain' by replacing its own warehouses and distribution centres with point of sale systems linked instantly through to key suppliers. As a result it could offer its retail customers constantly refilled shelves of branded products at considerably cut prices. Its competitors reeled. Gluttons for jargon like all consultants, the Coopers team calls this the achievement of a strategic 'BreakPoint.' This is defined as when market share 'moves disproportionately upward' as a result of customers perceiving a dramatic improvement in cost, quality, service or lead time, or in all four. Compared with the first three books, Re-engineering Your Business (McGraw Hill Pounds 21.95, 247 pages) by Daniel Morris and Joel Brandon, will be more of a minority taste. It is far drier and much more of a hands-on guide to particular methods of re-engineering. But it also gives some useful general reminders: for instance, that processes should not be re-engineered in an internal vacuum, but only after the competitive advantage to be achieved in each situation has been analysed. Not really a book, but more of a study - and much more expensive - is one of the first publications to appear last winter on the subject, Business Re-engineering, by Peter Bartram (Business Intelligence, tel: 081-544-1830. Pounds 395, 296 pages). Though some of its contents have been outdated, it still provides a very welcome, plain person's guide to the field. It is unusually rich in case studies, especially of companies in Britain. It also contains a useful list of consultants in the field.</p>

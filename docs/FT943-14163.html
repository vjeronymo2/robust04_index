			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pulp industry awaits Canadian labour board ruling British Columbia's Labour Relations Board is to issue a ruling today on a dispute between wood pulp mills and their unions that could have an important bearing on world pulp prices and on the investment climate for forestry companies on Canada's west coast. The board will decide whether to allow employers to negotiate a new labour contract with their 12,000 workers on a mill-by-mill basis, or to bow to the demands of the unions for the retention of the present system of industry-wide collective bargaining. No matter which way the board's decision goes, industry executives and analysts say the odds are high that subsequent talks on a new labour contract will end in deadlock. Mr Ross Hay-Roe, analyst at Equity Research in Vancouver, said that 'we stand a high probability of some sort of shutdown'. Canada accounts for more than a quarter of world pulp production, with the bulk of output coming from British Columbia. Fears of a strike at BC's 19 mills have contributed to an unexpectedly steep spiral in pulp prices this year. Producers are about to raise the price of northern bleached softwood kraft pulp, the industry staple, to USDollars 620 a tonne, from about USDollars 390 last autumn. Many pulp mills have begun to ration sales. According to a trader at MC Forest, a Vancouver-based subsidiary of Japan's Mitsubishi, demand is especially strong from South Korea, Italy and northern Europe. The labour board decision comes on the heels of numerous initiatives by the left-of-centre provincial government that have left the BC forestry industry deeply demoralised. They include moves to protect a higher proportion of forests from logging, tighter regulations on forestry practices and other environmental restrictions. Employers contend that mill-by-mill bargaining is required to introduce more flexible work practices, rather than to squeeze wages. 'It's one of those watershed issues for the major companies,' an executive at one Vancouver group said. He predicted that if the decision went against the industry, companies would 'become a lot more selective about what they put their money into here'. The stakes for the two unions that represent the mill workers are also high as they struggle to adapt to competition from countries where costs are lower. The unions' dilemma was illustrated at a loss-making Newfoundland newsprint mill operated by Abitibi-Price earlier this week. Workers decided to let the company close one newsprint machine, with the loss of 370 jobs, rather than agree to reopen their labour contract to accommodate more flexible work practices.</p>

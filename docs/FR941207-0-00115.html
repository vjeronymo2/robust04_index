			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Question 4. This question should be answered by licensees of Low Power TV broadcast stations only. Licensees of Low Power TV broadcast stations are required by 47 C.F.R. Section 73.2080 to afford equal employment opportunity to all qualified persons and to refrain from discriminating in employment and related benefits on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin or sex. In conjunction with these provisions, every station with five or or more full-time employees must file an employment report on or before May 31 of each year, identifying the station's staff by gender, race, color, and/or national origin in each of nine major job categories. See 47 C.F.R. Section 73.3612. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, LPTV stations must file an original and one copy of an Equal Employment Opportunity Report (FCC Form 396) with their renewal application. This EEO form is required of all such licensees even where they do not employ five or more full-time employees or where there are less than 5% minorities in the labor force (however, in such cases you need only complete the first 2 pages of the EEO form). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Question 5(a). The provisions of 47 C.F.R. Section 74.1232(d) provide that an authorization for an FM translator station whose coverage contour extends beyond the protected contour of the commercial primary station ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  other area FM translator) will not be granted to the licensee of a commercial FM radio broadcast station, or to any person or entity having any interest or connection with a primary FM station. For the purposes of this rule, interested and connected parties extend to group owners, corporate parents, shareholders, officers, directors, employees, general and limited partners, family members and business associates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Question 5(b). The provisions of 47 C.F.R. Section 74.1232(e) provide that an authorization for an FM translator station whose coverage contour extends beyond the protected contour of the commercial primary station ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  other area FM translator) shall not receive any support, before, during or after construction, either directly or indirectly, from the commercial primary FM radio broadcast station, or from any person or entity having any interest or connection with the primary FM station. For the purposes of this rule, interested and connected parties extend to group owners, corporate parents, shareholders, officers, directors, employees, general and limited partners, family members and business associates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Section V_Question-by-Question Guidelines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This section must be completed and submitted by all applicants regardless of the service of the station for which renewal is being sought. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first three questions of this Section are intended to assure that the applicant has attached and included with its application all Sections of this form that pertain to the particular station for which a license renewal is sought. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certification.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ejup Ganic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Presidency, today gave an interview to VJESNIK of Zagreb, the  Slovene daily VECER, and FERAL of Split.    I am not an optimist when it comes to signing the agreement  as envisaged by Lord Owen. Both the agreement and its draft  will resolve nothing in Bosnia. In other words, it is merely an  academic paper that neither tackles the essence nor raises the  main issues facing this state.    We would like to avoid the war option but we expect Serbia  to  launch a new attack. The regime in Serbia sees the continuation  of the war as crucial for its survival. However, they are not  as strong as they think they are. They have artillery, criminal  units, but they have no popular army. On the opposite side they  are facing an army of volunteers.    As for the Croatian state, which has disintegrated on all  fronts and which is trying to step up its aggression against a  sovereign state, it is obvious that Tudjman's behavior is  preparing the ground for sanctions against Croatia, Ganic  stressed.    In eastern Bosnia, we will not allow homes and the land  belonging to Bosniak Muslims to be taken over by a single Serb  family. My message to the Serbs is this: Do not go there, do  not move into houses and land that belong to someone else.  Something terrible will happen to you, today, tomorrow, the day  after tomorrow, or in six months, it does not matter. Those  whom you have expelled have nowhere to go. They are strangers  in both Sarajevo and Vienna. The solution is to return these  people to where they came from, Ganic said.    The proposal for a union [in Bosnia-Herzegovina] will be  difficult to implement, Ganic said. If we are to accept the  proposal, at least 1 million people will have to be resettled.  To resettle them we would need at least $2 million daily or  about $700 million annually to relieve the misery of these  people. The union proposal is not a serious one because it does  not reflect reality. We are not in the process of setting up a  Muslim state. We want to create a state of Bosnia with Croats,  Serbs, and Bosniak Muslims living in it. I think that the idea  of a Muslim state was planted on us and has, in the meantime,  become transparent. Here the feeling of patriotism is much  stronger than any other passion. I am in favor of Bosnia as a  state of Bosniak Muslims, Serbs, and Croats but am not in favor  of an artificial peace. I advocate the rule of law.    It is realistic to expect a turnabout in Croatia's policy in  Bosnia. Its policy will hit rock bottom unless Tudjman has  reached an agreement to hand over the occupied territories in  Croatia to Milosevic. This would signal an end to Croatia as a  state, Ejup Ganic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency,  said in his interview to VJESNIK and VECER.</p>

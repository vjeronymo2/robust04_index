			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Second home I intend to buy a second home in the south of England which will be solely for my own use as a holiday home. In five years I intend to retire, sell my present home and move into the second home as my main and only residence. If house prices rise over the next five years, would a liability for capital gains tax arise on the second home if it were sold after it had become by main residence? If there are tax implications, should I be making any 'main residence' declarations to the Inland Revenue to minimise or avoid the liability? The solicitor who acts for you in the purchase - will be able to guide you on the question of the timing of main-residence notices (under section 222(5)(a) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992). In the meantime, to get an idea of the arbitrary rules laid down by parliament, ask your tax office for the free leaflet CGT4. Your solicitor's advice is likely to be broadly along the following lines: 1. A main-residence notice in favour of your present home should be lodged fairly soon after completion of the purchase of your second home (and certainly before the second anniversary of the purchase), retrospectively. 2. A notice of variation, in favour of your second home, should be lodged (retrospectively) no later than the day on which you are sure that the purchaser of your original home is not going to default. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

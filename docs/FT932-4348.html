			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Survey of Sheffield (5): Grasping sharp nettles - Pragmatism at the Town Hall WHEN Sheffield City Council staged the World Student Games last year, it was a bizarre mixture of triumph and fiasco. This year, it persuaded most of its 25,000-strong workforce to accept a pay cut to avoid job losses, winning widespread approval for its pragmatism. These two events say much about how the Labour-controlled council is changing from the Thatcher era when it was one of the most radical on the left. Mike Bower, leader for the last 12 months, explains: 'In the mid-1980s it was deliberate council policy to maintain employment. Employment in the steel industry crashed from 52,000 to 16,000. The council's reaction was understandable.' The council fell out with the business community as unemployment worsened and business rates - the tax it levy could locally on the private sector - rose. Detente was not widely apparent until the Conservative general election victory in 1987, when both sides realised they had got to recognise reality and work together. The World Student Games were supposed to cement relations and spark regeneration, but everyone discovered too late they were virtually unmarketable to television, the crucial medium for attracting enough sponsorship to run them at a profit. By then, the council had borrowed Pounds 157m to build sports facilities and the city was committed. After bitter recriminations in the winter of 1990-91, council and private sector tried to patch up the problems, but the company set up to run them had to be liquidated. The council then took over, staged an impressive games, but overran their budgeted loss by Pounds 5m and could not explain why. The District Auditor, the government's watchdog on council spending, blamed bad management and incompetence. Sheffield's embarrassment was tangible and many in the private sector still cringe about it. 'However, the games were good and enjoyable,' says Mr Alan Bamford of Henry Boot, who was president of the chamber of commerce at the time. 'We should make the best use of the facilities now we have them.' Mr Ray Douglas, the Master Cutler, says: 'The council made a cock-up of the finances, but in every other respect the event was successful and we now have some excellent facilities.' 'Forget the games,' says Mr Vernon Smith, chief executive of BSC Industry, the economic regeneration arm of British Steel. 'We should not be looking at a city of 500,000 people and saying all we have by way of facilities is a couple of Victorian football grounds. What we have now are the sort of things good cities of this size actually need. Everyone has to live, work and play.' Mr John Hambidge, chief executive of the chamber, says public attitudes are softening as the arena - voted one of the best in Europe for concert tours - swimming pool and stadium bring in events and revenue to the city. The dimming of memories of the fiasco will undoubtedly help Mr Bower. He is a former journalist, trades union official and head of the Co-operative Development Agency in Sheffield. 'A practical man with a background in negotiations who is used to stitching deals together,' says Mr Hambidge. This appeals to business leaders. The vote by the council workforce to help solve a budget crisis and avoid up to 1,800 sackings by taking a pay cut has particularly impressed them. Mr Bower meets business, development corporation, university and local media leaders once a month for breakfast to discuss strategy. Meetings are discreet, with no publicity. The group is known as the 'A-Team.' 'The city and the development corporation are the most important players,' says Mr Hugh Sykes, chairman of the latter. 'The old partnership between the council and the city was more of a front which took a high profile and claimed too much credit. The A-Team is deliberately lower key.' The team is planning to appoint a chief executive to act as enabler and progress chaser. This will overcome Mr Hambidge's criticism that too many things are as yet merely talked about rather than done. Meanwhile, everyone knows the pay-cut-for-jobs deal will buy only a year's respite because the council is still overstaffed from the days when it saw its priority as providing jobs. The introduction of the uniform business rate by the government has stopped it making local businesses bridge deficits. Mr Bower wants to trim numbers but not services - 'there are savings to be made in middle management,' he says. 'We employ a lot of people on supervision or in administration. I don't believe it's all necessary. Lots of people are not adding value. We will eliminate many of these posts.' He will have the necessary political support because the Labour group of backbench councillors last month voted out of leadership seven of the left's more prominent figures. Ever the diplomat, Mr Bower plays down this shift towards the centre of the political spectrum as an internal convulsion in the Labour group, but it is obvious a sea change has taken place, or he would not be able to act as he does. 'It is better to work with government than against it. The climate seems to be improving,' he says. Budgetary constraints are regretted, but will be addressed - 'the former impression of chaos and crisis has been replaced by an orderly approach to a difficult situation,' he adds. On the World Student Games: 'It was not bad luck; it was bad organisation. We didn't organise properly and it's a mistake we don't intend to repeat,' he avers. 'Our strategy now is to maintain the manufacturing base and develop it. No one believes that is going to get us back to previous levels of employment, but we have to concentrate on getting the ingredients needed for investment right.' Even the most grudging members of the private sector will not quarrel with that.</p>

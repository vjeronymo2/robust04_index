			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Schlesinger doubt on Eurobankers THE Bundesbank president yesterday expressed doubt whether European countries will be able to provide genuinely independent people to sit on the council of the planned European Central Bank. In a speech in Amsterdam highlighting the German central bank's scepticism about the path to monetary union in Europe, Mr Helmut Schlesinger warned that central bankers sometimes had to operate without government or public support if they were to hold to their central goal of curbing inflation. Worries about the domestic impact of the new bank's policies might stop suitably qualified central bankers from joining the institution, he said. He explicitly rejected President Mr Francois Mitterrand's recent comments that the future European central bankers would be monetary technicians, answering to EC governments. The Maastricht treaty, which guarantees the independence of the new institution, had to be implemented 'to the letter', he said. New orders for west Germany's manufacturing industry fell by 0.5 per cent in September from August, the seventh successive monthly decline, Quentin Peel writes from Bonn. The drop was entirely accounted for by a 2 per cent fall in export orders, according to the Economics Ministry. Orders from the home market increased by 0.5 per cent. A comparison of the combined total of August and September with the same two months of 1991 shows an overall drop of 4.7 per cent. Within that total, export orders were down 6.7 per cent, and domestic orders by just 3.8 per cent. Over the year, capital goods orders were down 6.9 per cent. Germany enjoyed a trade surplus in September of DM5.6bn, with exports of DM55.6bn against imports of DM50bn. The overall balance of payments was in deficit to the tune of DM4.2bn.</p>

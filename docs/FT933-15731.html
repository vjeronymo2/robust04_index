			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Economic gloom hits metal prices THE GLOOMY economic outlook for most of the world's big industrial countries was reflected by metals markets yesterday as nickel prices dropped to the lowest level for 5 1/2 -years, lead fell to a seven-year low and tin slipped back towards its recent 20-year low. With most of continental Europe gripped by recession, recovery in Japan still months away and a far from robust recovery in the US , 'the chances of a demand-lead boost for metals in the remainder of this year are slim,' said Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, a Royal/Dutch Shell subsidiary. Nickel was also badly affected by a rise in London Metal Exchange stocks reported yesterday following a steady fall totalling 10,000 tonnes in June. Traders said a ship carrying between 6,000 and 12,000 tonnes of Russian nickel had arrived in Europe. 'There is more than enough nickel around to justify a further fall in price,' said Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Bain &amp; Company, part of the Deutche Bank Group. Meanwhile, traders suggested tin for delivery in three months might be on its way to the Dollars 4,990 a tonne, the 20-year low touched recently. Lead, suffering from a huge contraction of demand from European and Japanese car makers, touched Dollars 388 a tonne yesterday before recovering slightly by the close.</p>

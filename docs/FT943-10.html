			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - World's Economies - Developing Countries (59): Still battling with self-doubt - Latin America / New reforms may be on the way The implementation at the beginning of this year of the North American Free Trade Agreement was expected to mark a watershed for Latin American economies. Yet 1994 has been marked more by reminders of the region's continuing political and economic difficulties than by indications of how far Latin America has moved in the past five years. The advances are nonetheless important. There has been a sharp decline in inflation in most countries. While generally economic growth has not been as rapid as governments had hoped, it has usually been positive enough to secure some modest rises in real incomes after the declines of the 1980s. Tariff and other barriers to foreign trade have universally been lowered. At the same time a plethora of free trade agreements and customs unions is spreading over the region, though this is a development which has its potential dangers as well as advantages. Nonetheless, as a result of more open economies, restructuring, aimed at increasing economic efficiency, has been promoted. This restructuring, involving the closing of old industrial capacity, is still going on, and has slowed growth in some countries, such as Mexico. It has also generated unemployment, ensuring continued unpopularity for the reform process. The opening of regional economies has also created conditions for a widening of trade and current account deficits. Until February this year, these were being readily financed by inflows from the international capital markets. Following that month's rise in US interest rates, net flows of financing appear to have continued to the region, but investors have been more selective about where they place their money. This increasing selectivity among investors also reflects an increasingly diverse economic performance by Latin American economies as they emerge from the decade of the debt crisis. These divergent economic and political factors confronting investors include: Mexico: The year began with the advent of Nafta - and a peasant uprising in the southern state of Chiapas. The assassination in March of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), led to further investor reassessment of political risk in Mexico. Fears were calmed somewhat by the election of Ernesto Zedillo, the PRI's replacement candidate, in August. Uncertainties remain about a current account deficit this year widely expected to exceed Dollars 25bn. Brazil: Renewed enthusiasm among investors about Brazil has followed the early success of a credible anti-inflation plan and the declining fortunes of the left-wing candidate in presidential elections due in two rounds in October and November. Whoever wins the election, significant reform is still required of the 1988 constitution to bring public finances, and therefore inflation, under more permanent control. Given the country's political system, this may be difficult. Argentina: This year is expected to be good again for growth - though it is likely to be slower than last year's 6 per cent - and inflation is widely expected to drop below 4 per cent for the year. There remain worries about overvaluation of the exchange rate, fixed against the dollar, as the current account deficit widens. Still, despite the more difficult international market conditions, financing has been available - including a voluntary syndicated loan made available by banks to the government for the first time since the debt crisis. President Carlos Menem faces elections next April, having secured a constitutional change to give him the right to stand again for office. Venezuela: A banking crisis and a response from the new government of President Rafael Caldera that is widely viewed to have been inept have led to Venezuela sliding off the screen for most international investors this year. The recession will continue for a second successive year, and with the economy shrinking by more than last year's 1.0 per cent. Inflation is rising. Investors are enthusiastic about Peru, in the middle of a big privatisation programme and where growth could top 10 per cent this year. An election next year will see President Alberto Fujimori challenged. Bolivia is embarking on an ambitious plan to take its state sector out of the hands of the government. Its first flotation is due in November. Chile has a new administration, mostly stressing continuity with the market-oriented policies of its predecessor. Colombia's new president Ernesto Samper has promised a softening of some of the previous administration's policies, particularly where they affect exporters, but also is pledging continuity overall. In general, however, while the importance of the market is still being widely stressed, many governments are now looking towards a new series of reforms. This may involve the development of infrastructure - often with the co-operation of private and public sector finance - which in many countries is already acting as a severe bottleneck to growth. Ironically, after years in which the role of government has been reduced in Latin America, improvements in government effectiveness are now viewed as vital to the reform process. Governments need to improve their delivery of services, such as education and health, and to build institutions - in particular the judiciary - needed for the proper and efficient functioning of market-based democracies. They also need to ensure that social pressures - and the widening gap between rich and poor - do not derail the progress which has already made towards greater economic self-sufficiency.</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRUST FUND CREATED FOR BOY SHOT BY 5-YEAR-OLD  </P> <P> A trust fund was established Thursday to help pay the medical bills of a boy  who was shot and injured by a 5-year-old.  </P> <P> Debbie Devine, manager of the apartment building where the shooting occurred,  said she set up the fund to help the uninsured parents of 10-year-old Oscar  Flores, who was listed in good condition Thursday at Western Medical  Center-Santa Ana.  </P> <P> "They need help . . . " Devine said. "Their son was a victim."  </P> <P> Oscar Flores and a second boy were injured Wednesday when the 5-year-old fired  a single bullet from a .38-caliber revolver. The bullet traveled through his  brother's chest and into Oscar's. The boys had been playing unattended at the  home of the brothers.  </P> <P> The parents of the second injured boy requested that the hospital not release  their child's condition. But Anaheim Police Sgt. Chet Barry said both boys are  expected to live.  </P> <P> Barry said the boys apparently found the gun unloaded in a metal box inside a  closet. "We have reason to believe that one of the older boys loaded the gun."  Police are still investigating the shooting, he said.  </P> <P> The gun is registered to the brothers' mother, Katherine McGuire.  </P> <P> Devine said she set up the fund at a First Interstate Bank branch at 222 S.  Harbor Blvd. in Anaheim. Anyone interested in donating can call her at (714)  776-6300.  </P> <P> Devine said office workers at the apartment complex have raised $65 for the  trust fund.  </P> <P> Oscar Flores' parents, Margarita and Hector Flores, could not be reached for  comment, but Devine said they were very grateful that a fund was being  established. "This whole thing has been very hard on them," she said.  </P></p>

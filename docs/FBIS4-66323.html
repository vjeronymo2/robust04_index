Under the conditions that the Cl[.sub]2[/] flow rate is 30  mmol/s, the I[.sub]2[/] flow rate is 0.3 mmol/s and the  cavity pressure is 200 Pa, the power outputs of linearly  polarized light were obtained from the experimental data:  maximum values of power output are 178W at the half extracavity  and 70.4W at the full extracavity.</p>

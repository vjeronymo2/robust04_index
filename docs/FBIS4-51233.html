			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 25 (CNA) -- Taiwan companies should  consider forming strategic alliances with their counterparts in  Sweden to tap north and east European markets, a senior trade  official said Wednesday [25 May].    "Sweden has advanced modern port and warehousing facilities  as well as well-developed distribution systems," said James C.K.  Lin, director of the Representative Office in Stockholm of the  semi-official China External Trade Development Council (Cetra).    Lin, who returned to Taipei earlier this week for  consultations, said Sweden is also a frontrunner in the  aerospace, automobile and electronics industries.    "By forging partnerships with Swedish companies, Taiwan  firms  can obtain advanced technical know-how in the above-mentioned  fields and gain access to north European markets," Lin said.    He said that although operational costs in Sweden are  relatively high, the Scandinavian country offers many tax  incentives for businesses. "Taiwan entrepreneurs can consider  setting up distribution centers in Sweden to facilitate their  entry to north and east European markets," he added.    Sweden has been Taiwan's most important trade partner in  North Europe. Two-way trade between the two countries totaled  US$880 million in 1993, down 12 percent from 1992.    In the first four months of this year, Taiwan-Swedish trade  increased to US$330 million mainly because of a nearly 40  percent growth in Taiwan's imports from Sweden. Taiwan's  exports to that country, however, declined by about 15 percent  during the four-month period.    Personal computers, bicycles, sporting goods and plastic  products were Taiwan's main exports to Sweden, while cars,  machinery and steel products formed the bulk of Taiwan imports  from that country.    Cetra officials said Sweden offers preferential tariff rates  for South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong because the Swedish  Government considers them "developing countries or areas."  Taiwan, however, is denied such treatment. This has been the  greatest obstacle for Taiwan goods to enter the Swedish market,  the officials noted.</p>

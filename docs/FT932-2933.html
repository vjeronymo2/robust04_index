			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Waters wanted The recently underperforming water sector staged a strong recovery as a number of the market's big action funds began to switch out of some of the generators and regional electricity stocks and into the waters. There was also a widespread view among sector specialists that the utilities' strong defensive qualities and the prospect of above average dividend increases in the next few years would provide strong underlying support for the stocks. The water issues in the FT-SE 100 Index were the brightest performers, with North West Water following Monday's rise of 16 with a further gain of 9 to 462p. Anglian moved ahead 10 to 470p, Severn Trent 8 to 487p and Thames 3 to 471p. Wessex Water's preliminary figures were at the top end of expectations, dealers said, triggering an advance of 12 in the stock to 570p. Welsh Water raced up 17 to 573p. Manweb, the second of the 'recs' to produce preliminary numbers, touched 526p before slipping back to finish unchanged at 522p. The company topped East Midland's 14 per cent dividend, increasing its payment by 15 per cent.</p>

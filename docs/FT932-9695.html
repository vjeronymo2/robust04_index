			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Bright close to a lacklustre session A DULL trading session was suddenly enlivened just before the close when a rally in early trading on Wall Street proved sufficient to lift the UK stock market from weakness to a modest gain. But equity strategists remained cautious, aware that the market is poised for the pricing this morning of the Pounds 1.3bn rights issue of Zeneca shares which opens the road to the demerger from ICI. Traders hesitated to applaud the late upswing, which left the FT-SE 100 Index with a gain on the day of 6.3 at 2,836.1. However, there were hints from the stock index futures market that a large buyer had shown up and was expected to continue his operations today. More sceptical sources noted that the UK stock market may be merely confirming its recovery from the lower end of an established trading range. A senior figure at one of the London stockbroker firms commented: 'The UK stock market is still dominated at present by trends in the derivatives markets.' For most of the session, share prices were on the downside in fairly unexciting trading. Losses were extended in the afternoon when the Footsie showed a fall of 6.2 at 2,823.6 after New York had opened easier. However, by the time London closed for the day the Dow Average was about four points ahead. The tone of the session remained much as it has been for the past week. A small - Pounds 22.5m - rights issue from Avon Rubber had little direct effect, although it reminded the market of its fears of fund-raising in both equities and government bonds and focused attention even more on today's news on the Zeneca issue. Also disappointing London was New York's failure overnight to live up to the high promise displayed as the UK market closed on the previous evening. Also, firmness in sterling appeared to imply reduced expectations of a base rate cut. On the corporate scene, insurance issues brightened after General Accident reported more than satisfactory first-quarter trading figures. But the overall market was slow to respond to GenAcc's news, or to a handful of minor corporate deals; Inchcape paid more than Pounds 40m for a 15.3 per cent stake in Gestetner, Alco bid Pounds 67.4m for Erskine House and Carclo paid Pounds 57m for Arthur Lee. Trading volume was very unimpressive for most of the day, although business jumped smartly when the market moved higher at the close. The day's Seaq total of 676.9m shares compared with 587.5m on Monday when retail, or customer, business only just scraped above the Pounds 1bn mark now regarded as the minimum acceptable daily total. Some strategists regarded yesterday's performance, and especially the late recovery, as confirmation that the market has established a trading range and is now rallying from the low end, which is put at around the Footsie 2,770 mark. At Panmure Gordon, Mr Robin Aspinall sees the current rally as taking the index no further than 2,860. While political pressures continue to pile on the UK government of Mr John Major, economic news this week has been more favourable. The fall of 1 per cent in producer input prices last month suggests that 'much of the devaluation effect' has now fed through into costs, according to Nikko Securities.</p>

			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / International Company News: Israel aims to raise Dollars 350m from sell-off ISRAEL'S government yesterday launched the country's biggest public flotation of state-owned shares, placing its 42.5 per cent stake in IDB Holding, a big industrial investment group, on the Tel Aviv stock exchange (TASE) for an anticipated return of more than Dollars 350m. Although no change of control in IDB was involved, as the balance of shares is held by the Recanati family of Tel Aviv, the government pointed to the issue as evidence of its commitment to privatisation. TASE officials said the issue was 120 times oversubscribed and testified to pent-up demand for privatisation issues, despite a bull run which has seen the exchange's main index rise by more than 60 per cent this year. The previous biggest sale of government-held shares was in February, when 25 per cent of Israel Chemicals was sold for Shk600m. The IDB sale was a spin-off from the government's programme to sell its majority holdings in Israel's four main banks, acquired at a cost of Dollars 7bn after a share collapse in 1983. IDB Holding had been split from its previous partner, Israel Discount Bank, and control sold back to the Recanatis, two of whom are on trial on criminal charges arising from the 1983 share collapse. However, the government has yet to finalise how it will dispose of Israel Discount Bank, or Bank Hapoalim and Bank Leumi, the country's three biggest financial institutions. There has been criticism that it has not moved fast enough to sell the banks, or the major candidates among government-owned companies. Yesterday's issue was split into tranches consisting of 26.6 per cent of IDB in shares and the remainder in options exerciseable by next October. The total raised will be Shk945m. At today's value of Dollars 357m, this compares with the Dollars 314m the government paid to acquire the shares in 1983.</p>

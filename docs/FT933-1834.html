			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Swan Hunter cuts 80 further jobs A FURTHER 80 jobs are to go at Tyneside shipbuilder Swan Hunter, unions were told yesterday, bringing to 830 the number shed since the company went into receivership in May. After a meeting with receivers Price Waterhouse, Mr Tommy Brennan, Tyne chairman of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, said the scale of the latest redundancies had been less than expected. This was partly due to hopes that Swan Hunter will win more work on the auxiliary oiler replenishment ship, Fort George, built by the company and handed over in March. Mr Brennan said if this work goes ahead it would employ 150 people for about seven weeks from late October. The Ministry of Defence confirmed it is discussing with the receivers 'minor adjustments' and defect rectification work on Fort George arising from its trials. The MoD declined to say whether other shipbuilders had been approached about the work. Its value has not been disclosed. Mr Brennan said the discussions were a welcome sign that, contrary to union anxieties, Swans may still be able to win MoD work while the receivers seek a buyer for the company. He said they remained 'very optimistic' about an eventual sale. The 80 redundancies affect manual workers. They will leave by the end of next week, reducing the workforce to around 1,600. Joint administrative receiver Mr Ed James said job cuts were inevitable as work on three Navy frigates, the only work in progress at Swans, neared completion.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: WMX moves back into the black WMX Technologies, the international waste haulier and processor, reported third-quarter income of Dollars 212.8m, or 44 cents a share, up from a loss of Dollars 127.1m, or 26 cents, in the same 1993 quarter. The 1993 third-quarter loss was the result of a Dollars 285m charge for a restructuring at WMX's struggling Chemical Waste Management subsidiary. WMX's third-quarter sales were Dollars 2.6bn, up from Dollars 2.3bn a year earlier. WMX is also the majority owner of WMX International, Rust International and Wheelabrator Technologies. Chemical Waste this week reported that it earned Dollars 15m, or 7 cents a share, in the third quarter, recovering from last year's third-quarter loss of Dollars 359.9m, or Dollars 1.72. Excluding special charges, Chemical Waste earned 4 cents a share in the 1993 third quarter. WMX said Chemical Waste still suffered from low volumes in its core hazardous waste businesses. In June, state regulators sharply restricted the use of the company's Barnwell, South Carolina, low-level radioactive waste processing facilities, dampening earnings prospects. WMX last week agreed to buy back the 45m shares, or about 21 per cent, of Chemical Waste that it does not already own for Dollars 8.85 a share, substantially above an initial offer of Dollars 7.86 made in July. For the first nine months of the year, WMX earned Dollars 578.6m, or Dollars 1.20, on sales of Dollars 7.4bn. That is up from Dollars 289.8m, or 60 cents, on sales of Dollars 6.7bn in the same 1993 period.</p>

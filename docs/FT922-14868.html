			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: A balance sheet battering - How Heron has been hit by the recession in all its main markets THIS MORNING Mr Gerald Ronson's Heron International will tell its bankers that it is writing off more than Pounds 400m, over two thirds of its balance sheet, because of the slump in worldwide property markets. Heron will also ask the banks to reschedule its Pounds 1.3bn debt, and announce the first pre-tax losses in its 26-year history for the financial year that ended three days ago. The figures mean it will no longer rank as the UK's second largest private company. Heron is fighting recession in its key markets of property, housebuilding and luxury car sales, and the request has not come as a complete surprise to the financial markets, which have been heavily discounting its Eurobonds for a year. The problem is not that debt has soared. Heron's net debt has fallen slightly in the past year to about Pounds 1.3bn, including Pounds 448m in Eurobonds. That compares with Pounds 1.4bn in the March 1991 accounts, which included Pounds 357m borrowings within the US businesses marked for disposal. However, the slump in US and UK property has savaged the balance sheet, which had already seen write-offs of about Pounds 200m over the past few years from the group's ill-fated move into US financial services Heron will give a new figure for its net assets of about Pounds 150m, compared with Pounds 585m in March 1991. At that date Heron's investment property was valued at Pounds 772m, in the judgment of the group's senior employees. Heron says that it currently has over Pounds 100m of cash and liquid assets and that there is no immediate crisis. However, in anticipation of cashflow problems it will ask banks and bondholders today to delay capital repayments until the last years of the decade, and to delay some interest payments. Apart from the US investments, Heron is in a position to paint a more optimistic picture about the future value of its investments than many property developers who have recently run into financial trouble. It is expected to argue to the bankers that its portfolio of businesses has many strengths, and that it has been peculiarly unfortunate in the acute vulnerability of its main businesses to recession. The response of the bankers will determine whether it is given the room to realise the long-term value. The group is not exposed to City and Docklands commercial property markets, with their acute oversupply. Its office development near Heathrow has let all 47,000 sq ft and will be completed by the end of 1992. Its developments at Basildon and in Cornwall are fully let, as are the shops in Sunderland town centre and Victoria Station in London. The Southampton investment, which will be completed in the autumn, is about 82 per cent let. Heron has also expanded its property division vigorously into Europe and currently has developments in Berlin, Paris, Lyons, Brussels, Madrid and Barcelona. Several recent sales of European investments showed a profit. However, the most troublesome part of its property portfolio continues to be the US. It started building two Manhattan tower blocks, called in 1980s-style Heron Towers I and II, but while the first is 95 per cent let, building of the second has been frozen until the market improves. It also holds 9,000 acres in Arizona, a legacy of its 1980 move into financial services in the US south-west, and the subsequent collapse of the local property market. Unsurprisingly, the group's UK housebuilding division, Heron Homes, has been hit by the collapse of the housing market. It will nevertheless tell bankers that in the year to March 1992 it sold 900 homes - about 17 per cent up on the previous year - and that its housing bank remains at 5,000 plots in southern England with options on a further 6,300. Its luxury car dealerships in the UK for Jaguar, Rover, Rolls Royce and its Suzuki manufacturing franchises, have also suffered from recession, although Mr Ronson has reiterated his commitment. The fourth arm is petrol stations, whose cashflow supported some of the group's early expansion. Last autumn Heron agreed to sell 150 stations to Elf Aquitaine over the next two years in a deal believed to be worth about Pounds 100m. One question bankers will ask is the effect of the disposal, which will leave the group with only around 30 stations, on projected cashflow. On at least one division - albeit one of the smaller ones - Heron is expected to tell an extremely encouraging story. Its distribution and transportation services in the UK have increasingly focused on food, drinks and white goods, and now count among their customers Zanussi, Electrolux, Tricity and Bendix. Heron will report that in the 12 months just completed sales were 'considerably up ' on the previous year.</p>

			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> EXTENSION OF FREEZE ON BUILDING SOUGHT  </P> <P> A one-year building freeze on development around the Disneyland and Anaheim  Convention Center area will go into effect immediately if the City Council  accepts city planners' recommendations tonight.  </P> <P> This is the last time the temporary ordinance can be renewed, and planners are  seeking the maximum extension of one year.  </P> <P> The 1,040-acre area has been under a temporary freeze since the 30-day  emergency ordinance was first enacted May 1. It was extended for 90 days in  June, and will expire this weekend.  </P> <P> The Disney Development Co., on behalf of the Walt Disney Co., sent the City  Council a letter supporting the one-year extension, calling it a "necessary and  customary planning tool."  </P> <P> The company has supported the moratorium from the outset and is working with  city planners, who are evaluating the possibility of a "second gate," an  expansion of Disneyland in Anaheim.  </P> <P> The city originally initiated the building freeze because a $300,000 study of  the area was near completion, and planners said they needed to study the area  under unchanging conditions. The study outlines ways to revitalize the tourist  area.LISA MASCARO  </P></p>

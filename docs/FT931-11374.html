			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Contracting out policies face further trouble THE GOVERNMENT'S policies on contracting out public services faces continuing disruption because of uncertainty over the rights of employees whose work is contracted out. Legal advice obtained by the Labour-dominated Association of Metropolitan Authorities says that the overwhelming majority of contracts put out to tender by councils are covered by European Community legislation protecting the jobs and conditions of workers in mergers. This means that the contractor must take over the employees on their existing terms and condi-tions, removing scope for savings through lower pay or cutting staff. The confusion has arisen over the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations 1981, which implement the EC's 1977 Acquired Rights directive. Recent decisions of the European Court of Justice have extended the scope of the regulations to cover contracting out of some public services. However, Mr Patrick Elias, a leading employment QC, has advised the local authorities associations that the EC directive is likely to apply in most cases where a service is contracted out. An amendment to the regulations now passing through parliament will make this absolutely clear, he says. Government departments are continuing to suspend plans to put Civil Service work out to tender until it is clear whether market-testing is covered by the legislation. The Home Office has shelved the contracting out of the Prison Service stores from April 1, following advice that the regulations would apply. The 120 staff employed in the stores had been issued with redundancy notices after the contract had been won by Beck &amp; Pollitzer, the contract-services group, in the belief that the regulations did not apply. The Crown Prosecution Service has shelved plans to put its file store out to tender while seeking advice from the Treasury solicitor on whether the regulations apply. It emerged last week that Mr Michael Bichard, chief executive of the Benefits Agency, had complained to Sir Michael Partridge, permanent secretary at the Department of Social Security, over the failure of the Cabinet Office to answer key questions over the issue. Mr Bichard said that the lack of clarity threatened agency plans to market-test some 10,000 jobs. One option for the government would be to seek an amendment of the EC acquired rights directive to exclude contracting out of public services. The UK, however, is reluctant to be seen to be pressing too hard for such an amendment for fear of creating an anti-British coalition against change. Both Mr Leon Brittan, the EC's external economic affairs commissioner, and Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, have expressed an interest in an amendment to exclude contracting out in the public sector. Mr Padraig Flynn, EC social affairs commissioner, has not ruled out such an amend-ment. He said recently: 'If it could be shown to me that in special, isolated, cases, the intention of the law was being defeated in usage then it may require amendment.'</p>

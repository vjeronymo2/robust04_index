'My agenda is simple: strengthen economic relations and improve opportunities for American goods, investment and financial services,' Mr Bentsen said.

Mr Bentsen believes Russia's economic woes stem not from too much economic reform, as Mr Yeltsin's political foe, ultra-nationalist Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, asserts, but from too little. He goes on to Indonesia, Thailand and China and will seek to build on Mr Clinton's summit with Asian leaders of last November.

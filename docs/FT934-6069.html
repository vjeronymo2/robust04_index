			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Mr Kohl loses his gamble Under the wise post-war German constitution, the country's federal presidency is a post devoid of real political power. Mr Richard von Weizsacker, the incumbent, has, however, shown that the German head of state can wield weighty influence within and beyond his country's borders. Germany's complex struggle to come to terms with unification has increased both the potential authority of the office and the pitfalls into which it can stumble. After chancellor Helmut Kohl's mishandling of the issue of Mr von Weizsacker's successor, the damage runs deep. The stature of the presidency will probably recover. Mr Kohl's may not. Yesterday's decision by Mr Steffen Heitmann, the chancellor's choice as Mr von Weizsacker's successor, to step down from the presidential race was an inevitable reaction to the hostility caused by his candidacy within and beyond the governing Christian Democratic Union (CDU). The tactlessness of Mr Heitmann's remarks during the summer on the holocaust or Germany's European role has sometimes been exaggerated. Yet he never looked likely to live up to Mr von Weizsacker's standards. Mr Kohl's initial decision to back an untried east German was always risky. It has now been exposed as an ill-thought out gamble, laying the chancellor open to charges that, after 11 years in power, he is falling prey to hubris. After his 1989-90 reunification triumph, Mr Kohl has during the last few years started to look out of touch with the realities of his country's economic challenges. In contrast to his predecessor, Mr Helmut Schmidt, the chancellor's strength has been his pre-eminence in dealing with adversarial elements in his own party. His loss of sure-footedness as revealed in the Heitmann affair will further weaken an already unpopular CDU. Mr Kohl has earned his place in the history books. But, as he ponders next year's mammoth run of regional and national elections, he runs the risk of looking like a lame duck. No party can benefit from the last few months' spectacle of horse-trading of Germany's highest political office. But the chances must have increased that the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) will take the presidency for only the second occasion in the history of the post-1949 republic. The party has now two respected candidates, Mr Johannes Rau and Mr Richard Schroder, the east German professor yesterday endorsed by Mr Heitmann. Mr Kohl's rationale in putting forward the Heitmann candidacy was to avoid formally endorsing a Social Democrat candidate. This would have undermined Mr Kohl's position by appearing to open up a path next year to a formal CDU-SPD grand coalition, under another leader. After the presidential debacle, Mr Kohl's strategy has misfired. If a grand coalition starts to look the most likely outcome of next year's elections, Mr Kohl's position as party leader and chancellor could become increasingly untenable.</p>

			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> BEAUX ARTS TRIO AT DOROTHY CHANDLER PAVILION  </P> <P> For the occasion of its Los Angeles Philharmonic-sponsored program on Sunday  evening, the Beaux Arts Trio hewed to dead-center of the standard repertory,  perhaps for the purpose of attracting as many bodies as possible to the vast  Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, hardly a heaven-sent venue for the intimate muse.  </P> <P> Still, to downplay the pleasures of hearing Haydn's Trio in E-flat, Hob. 29,  Ravel's Trio in A minor and Schubert's B-flat Trio in such vital, informed  readings as the Beaux Arts' would be churlish if not downright stupid.  </P> <P> Pianist Menahem Pressler, violinist Isidore Cohen and cellist Peter Wiley are  the top of their field and on Sunday they were at the top of their form.  </P> <P> Their Romantic approach to the quietly melancholy Haydn proved appropriate,  while Ravel and Schubert sang their hearts out, sensuously in the former, with  pristine sweetness in the latter.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, at least one listener could yearn for a taste of something  slightly off-center, a bit dangerous -- say a trio by Roussel, Turina or  Martinu, or Ives, Copland, William Schuman.

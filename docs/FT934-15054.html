			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (16): Tehran's delays worries bankers - How can an exporter check the creditworthiness of a buyer overseas? / A look at the countries with payments problems - Credit watch IRAN remains a focus of attention for trade creditors as its payments problems seem set to drag on into 1994-95. Banks report delays of seven to nine months on letters of credit (l/cs) drawn on Iranian banks. However, the pattern is more complex as, for some imports (mainly priority goods), payments may be roughly on time. Tehran is now making outstanding payments that were due last December. The nine-month gap is worrying, bankers say, because it goes over the six-month limit for arrears set by the Iranian authorities. Worries are growing that the problem is taking root. In May, Bank Markazi, the central bank, issue a circular permitting Iranian banks to pay late-payment interest at margins up to 0.75 per cent over Libor. The scale of Iran's arrears problem emerged in 1992. Export credit agencies (ECAs) have started to indemnify exporters but, where possible, (to Germany's Hermes, for example), Tehran is making repayments before this becomes necessary. Meanwhile, Iran has negotiated a series of one and two-year 'deferrals' of trade debt of up to Dollars 5bn with big creditors, including German, French and Swiss banks, and Japanese trading houses and has held talks with other creditors including Belgian, Dutch, UK and Italian banks. If, as seems increasingly likely, roll-over options reportedly included in some deferral agreements are taken up, Iran's payment problem will continue into 1995. For those concerned at not being paid, some banks are offering to purchase overdue deferred payment and sight l/cs at discounts of about 75 per cent. Obtaining new financing is difficult. KENYA Kenya has arrears of up to one year. This is reflected in the wider problem of securing trade finance that affects much of sub-Saharan Africa. Some help may be obtained from niche players. The Banque Indosuez group says it will buy overdue debt from government-related contracts guaranteed by Kenya Commercial Bank at 75-80 per cent of face value. Confirmed l/c terms on all deals are recommended. LEBANON Lebanon has secured some of the financing for its reconstruction programme. The local banking sector's remarkable capacity for survival gives some scope for trade deals. L/cs can be arranged without undue problems for reputable buyers through leading banks. British Bank of the Middle East reports a 24-hour turnaround on confirmation. Securing short-term finance may be costly. The Cardiff-based NCM Credit Insurance has reduced its premiums for Lebanon, but still charges Pounds 3.50 per Pounds 100 of business insured, limited to 180-day confirmed irrevocable l/c. To cut costs, Banque du Liban, the central bank, recently guaranteed an l/c opened for a Dollars 22.7m contract for telephone repairs by Ericsson. Given Banque du Liban's backing, the Swedish company decided it did not need reconfirmation. INDIA India is enjoying reduced margins as markets warm to the potential offered by reform. Leading importer Indian Oil Corporation went from paying 125 basis points on 180-day financing to 100 bp and is now paying around 75 bp, bankers report. Competition is tough for Indian export credit business, with British exporters complaining that, at around 9 per cent, ECGD premiums are uncompetitive. Financing through Italy's SACE is in vogue and the Export-Import Bank of the US is said to be aggressive on Indian deals. SLOVENIA Slovenia is establishing itself as forfaiters become active with deals up to five years. L/cs backed by the long-established Ljubljanska Banka are attractive. The country's first syndicated loan provided Dollars 100m over three years at margins of 2 3/8 per cent plus fees. The margin was high, a banker says, 'because for all its attraction, Slovenia is next to Croatia'. But a further loan is expected which will bring pricing much lower and this will feed into the price paid for refinancing trade debt. CENTRAL ASIA The region of Central Asia is trying to build national economies, but has yet to establish itself as a trade finance market to allow normal trade flows. Uzbekistan has led the way to the international capital markets, with a Dollars 90m syndicated loan to finance its Murantau gold project. Of this, at least Dollars 35m comes from commercial banks and the rest from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The commercial portion was heavily over-subscribed but unfortunately Murantau is no benchmark for future trade payments: the EBRD's participation in the A-loan/B-loan structure and the unusual attractions of the project, with its assured revenue stream from gold ore reprocessed by US company Newmont Mining Corporation, make it a one-off. Kazakhstan is most ready for short-term deals. Banks say they will refinance up to 180-day l/cs carrying the guarantee of Alembank, formerly the local branch of Vneshekonombank. Some ECAs, including the UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD), may soon provide limited medium-term cover.  ----------------------------------------------------            OECD EXPORT CREDIT RATES 1993              MINIMUM INTEREST RATES FOR            OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED CREDITS (%)  ----------------------------------------------------                                   Sept 15-   Aug 15-                                    Oct 14   Sept 14  ---------------------------------------------------- Australian Dollars                  7.16      7.43 Austrian Sch                        7.51      7.67 Belgian franc                       8.09      8.09 Canadian Dollars (to 5 years)       6.90      7.02 Canadian Dollars (5 to 8+ yrs)      7.32      7.50 Canadian Dollars (over 8 yrs)       7.66      7.90 Danish krone                        8.00      8.60 Dutch guilder (to 5 yrs)            6.80      6.90 Dutch guilder (5 to 8+ yrs)         7.00      7.20 Dutch guilder (over 8 yrs)          7.50      7.85 Ecu                                 7.33      7.52 Finnish markka                      8.15      8.90 French franc                        7.10      7.06 German Mark                         6.89      7.18 Irish punt                          7.70      7.87 Italian lira                        9.37     10.30 Japanese Yen                        4.60      4.80 New Zealand Dollars                 6.85      7.35 Norwegian krone                     6.82      7.07 Spanish peseta                     10.15     10.96 Swedish krona                       8.16      8.75 Swiss franc                         5.55      5.59 UK pound                            7.42      7.80 US dollar (to 5 yrs)                5.36      5.43 US dollar (5 to 8+ yrs)             6.03      6.09 US dollar (over 8+ yrs)             6.35      6.48  ---------------------------------------------------- Source: OECD  ----------------------------------------------------</p>

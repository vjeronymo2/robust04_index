			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAKING IT WORK;  </P> <P> CARING FOR CHILD SHOULDN'T PUT MARRIAGE IN JEOPARDY  </P> <P> Raising a handicapped child can put enormous stress on a marriage. The biggest  stress results from the constancy of the problem -- you never get time off from  it. The child always has to struggle to overcome his handicap, so the parent is  always on call. But there are ways to meet the child's needs without risking  your marriage in the process. Jeanne Preble, a licensed marriage, family and  child therapist who practices in Fullerton and Irvine, suggests:  </P> <P> * Caring for a handicapped child should be a part of your life -- not your  whole identity. A common problem is that one partner becomes completely  involved in taking care of the child and the other gets mad because his or her  spouse is no longer available. The marriage is lost in the process of caring  for the child. Or one partner has trouble facing the responsibility and runs.  Don't let the handicap run the relationship.  </P> <P> * Your child may be handicapped, but that doesn't mean he or she is helpless.  Handicapped children need to grow and change and move away from their parents  just like everyone else. They need to be allowed to go through normal  developmental stages. Letting go at the right time is important to your child  and your marriage.  </P> <P> * Take advantage of all the community resources available to help you and your  child spend satisfying time away from each other. It's important for both  parents and children to have their own circle of friends and their own  activities. Then your handicapped child won't become too dependent on you --  and will have more opportunities to grow.  </P> <P> * Caring for a handicapped child can be so tiring that you end up feeling  resentful toward the child and have no energy left for the rest of your family.  Get as much support as you can from family and friends, or join a support  group, so you don't feel pressure 100% of the time.  </P> <P> * Remember to put your marriage first. You need each other.

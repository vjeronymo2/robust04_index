			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (9): A tighter rein on public spending - Tony Hawkins examines the budget's objectives IF THE FAILURE of structural adjustment in Nigeria could be blamed on a single policy, it would have to be the military government's inability or unwillingness to balance the budget. 'The lack of fiscal discipline,' says Chief Shonekan 'is the bane of our economy,' - an assessment justified by official statistics showing that 94 per cent of last year's N44bn budget deficit arose from supplementary and off-budget spending. His transitional government acknowledges five steps are crucial to restoring and maintaining fiscal balance: Broadening the tax base to reduce the existing 80 per cent dependence on petroleum revenue. Phasing out the petroleum 'subsidy', which would bring in an extra N62bn in gross revenue, though in net terms, once government's own spending on fuel is taken into account the actual revenue gain would be significantly less, perhaps in the region of N40bn. A debt reduction agreement with foreign creditors that would reduce the level of scheduled debt service payments, estimated, last year, at a quarter of GDP or 133 per cent of federally-retained revenue. The introduction of effective controls over public revenue and expenditure, including a revamped public sector investment programme, and The privatisation and commercialisation of remaining state-owned enterprises. The 1993 budget, the first and only one for which Chief Shonekan's transitional administration is likely to be responsible, is the first step along this lengthy, obstacle-ridden road to reform. Outlining a medium term strategy in his budget speech, the chief said the government would reduce the budget deficit from 12.4 per cent of GDP in 1991 to a manageable 3.3 per cent by 1995. A budget monitoring committee to assess actual performance in meeting revenue and spending targets has been created, along with an interdepartmental working party of officials charged with recommending how best to entrench fiscal co-ordination and transparency in Nigerian public finance. To broaden the tax base, a modified value added tax (MVAT), levied on 10 categories of goods and 23 services at an initial rate of 5 per cent, is to be introduced in mid year, with 80 per cent of the revenue going to state governments and the rest to the federation. Basic food items, pharmaceuticals, rents, vehicles and components, will all be exempt, but the government still expects the new tax to bring in significantly greater revenue than the existing sales tax which it will replace. On paper, the 1993 budget forecast of deficit of N28.6bn (5.6 cent of GDP) is highly optimistic. Not only is the government being pressured to make payments for extra budget commitments undertaken before the transitional council took office, but with inflation accelerating, the authorities committed to picking up the tab for the party conventions and the subsequent presidential elections, it is clear the very modest 4 per cent rise in planned spending this year will be overtaken by a substantial margin. In any event, the deficit forecast understates the true position because debt service obligations are restricted to 30 per cent of foreign exchange earning. If full servicing is assumed, the deficit doubles to approximately 9.7 per cent of GDP. But even with spending overruns, the actual deficit is likely to be well below this worst case scenario. With external arrears of Dollars 2.6bn last September and over Dollars 3bn by now, it is clear the government will underprovide debt servicing again this year. Furthermore, the 1993 budget assumes a price of Dollars 17.50 a barrel and an exchange rate of N20 to the dollar. The price for crude has since moved above Dollars 19 and the exchange rate is forecast to average N27.5 this year. Devaluation cuts both ways, however, raising revenue but also increasing expenditure, especially external debt service which will be closer to N55bn than the N40.5bn forecast. On a conservative estimate, federally retained revenue will be at least N25bn above forecast so that even if government does overspend, it should still be possible to keep the deficit below N25bn or less than 4 per cent of GDP. The Shonekan team makes no secret of its determination to keep a tight rein on spending. More important, by setting up a new system of budget monitoring and, possibly, launching the new MVAT, it may be able to change the country's fiscal culture. After all, the fiscal problem has more to do with corruption and managerial and administrative incompetence than any deep-seated structural defects. If the federal and regional administrations could collect even threequarters of the non-oil revenues to which they are entitled, the underlying situation would be healthier. So much so, in fact that the government would do better to stick to straightforward retail and manufacturing level consumption taxes, such as excise duties and sales tax, rather than opting for the more complex and more costly VAT.</p>

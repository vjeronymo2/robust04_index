			<p>BFN     [Text] Recently Samdech Son Sann, dean of the National  Assembly, issued a four-point statement on behalf of the  Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party [BLDP] affirming his party's  position and appealing to all parties with seats in the National  Assembly to work together for a solution to the Khmer Rouge  problem.    This statement was made as His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk  and his queen were returning to the country and after government  forces had captured the Khmer Rouge's important region of Pailin  and other positions along the western border.    Samdech Son Sann gave the following as reason: "The conflict  in Cambodia has caused untold sufffering to the people. Of all  the major problems that they have faced over the past two  decades, the serious Khmer Rouge problem is yet to be solved."    In point one, Samdech Son Sann explained that "the  settlement  of the Khmer Rouge problem must be achieved through peaceful  means..." because any military solution would only bring  tragedies and deaths to the people and cause shortages of food,  medicine, and so on.    Samdech Son Sann said: "We believe that solving the Khmer  Rouge problem militarily can only delay Cambodia's  rehabilitation and reconstruction. It can only frighten away  foreign investments to neighboring countries." He pointed out  the eventuality that "such an action would instead help the  neighboring countries suck up all the economic advantages and  would plunge Cambodia into a state of insecurity."    In the second point of his statement, Samdech Son Sann  proposed that to solve the Khmer Rouge problem and put an end to  the tragedies, "the Royal Government and all parties in the  National Assembly must make sacrifices and concessions."    Samdech Son Sann urged the parties to consider not just  their  own interests but also those of the nation and to reconcile with  one another in accordance with the peace proposal of King  Norodom Sihanouk, the architect of national reconciliation.    Samdech Son Sann stated: "The Constitution is the work of  the  National Assembly. Therefore, the National Assembly has the  right to amend it" for the sake of national unity and national  concord. He made this remark in reference to certain provisions  in the Constitution that do not agree with the king's proposal  to give cabinet positions to some persons within the Khmer Rouge  leadership.    In the third point of the statement Samdech Son Sann  declared  on behalf of the BLDP: "The party supports the king's five-point  peoposal made on 23 November 1993" and "we appeal to the Royal  Government to agree to solve the Khmer Rouge problem on the  basis of this five-point proposal."    In the fourth point of the statement Samdech Son Sann also  voiced support for the king's communique dated 7 March 1994  concerning the dangerous consequences of a war between the Khmer  Royal Armed Forces and the forces of the Khmer Rouge. He went  on to say: "We would like to emphasize that without national  reconciliation there can be no peace, there can be no  reconstruction, and the question of territorial integrity cannot  be settled."    Some analysts noted that the timing of Samdech Son Sann's  appeal seems to be wrong because, first of all, the Royal  Government has already controlled the Khmer Rouge areas at  Anlung Veng and Pailin, thus bringing changes to the situation  although the door to negotiations is said to remain open.    They think that there is now a tendency to use military  means  rather than talks. On the chessboard, the government side has  the upper hand as it is winning one Khmer Rouge "pawn" after  another, and it is even on the verge of checkmating the Khmer  Rouge "king."</p>

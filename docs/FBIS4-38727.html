			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Tatyana Khudyakova report: "Number of Unemployed Grows </F> Slowly but Surely"]    [Text] As of 1 May the State Employment Service had  1,459,000,000 citizens registered as not having a job [ne  imeyushchiy raboty], of whom 1.18 million were acknowledged as  unemployed [bezrabotnyy]. April saw almost 100,000 people  deprived of a livelihood "signing on" at the labor exchanges.  The unemployment level for Russia as a whole stands at 1.4  percent.    There are not many vacancies -- 325,000 jobs in all, of  which  83 percent are intended for workers and only 17 percent for  employees. The number of applicants per post, namely four  people not in regular work [nezanyatyy] and three unemployed  people for each one, gives an idea of the scale of the problem.  However, there are regions where jobs are like gold dust. In  terms of applicants per vacancy there are 255 in the Ingush  Republic, 51 in Ivanovo Oblast, and 31-35 citizens without  regular work in Dagestan and Chuvashia.    Only 285,000 Rusians have been able to obtain work this year  through the employment service, and their number also includes  those who were able to receive vocational training and  retraining.    There has been a slight increase in the number of people who  have fixed themselves up with public works jobs and improved,  albeit temporarily, their material position -- they number  38,000 since the start of the year.    The Russian Federation Government Center for Monitoring  Economic Conditions has prepared on the basis of the employment  services' data a short-term forecast of the situation in the  labor market in terms of Russia as a whole and individual  regions covering the next few months. It is expected that May's  unemployment figure will reach 1,284,000,000, June's will  increase by roughly another 100,000, while July's will reach  1.52 million. The unemployment level by mid-summer will reach  1.7 million.    The highest rate of increase in the number of unemployed  people continues to occur in Ivanovo, Yaroslavl, Kostroma,  Pskov, and Vladimir Oblasts; the lowest rate of increase is in  Tatarstan, Yakutia, Smolensk and Belgorod Oblasts, and Moscow  city.</p>

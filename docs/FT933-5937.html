			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Brussels backing for French farm campaign FRANCE'S campaign for changes in Europe's draft farm trade accord with the US yesterday gained ground when the Belgian presidency of the EC said it was open to 'a certain renegotiation' of the transatlantic deal. With two new French documents on Gatt in his pocket, Mr Willy Claes, Belgium's foreign minister, came away yesterday from a meeting in Paris with the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, saying that he had 'no objection in principle' to renegotiating a farm trade agreement with which Belgium had some difficulty itself. One of the two French documents - on the need for strengthened EC defences against unfair trade practices - will be unveiled by French ministers today. It would place Commission trade negotiators under closer supervision by national governments represented in the EC Council of Ministers, spur the EC's executive commission into tougher action against dumping and give Gatt reinforced powers as a means of reining in America's tendency to seek unilateral trade remedies. More controversial are France's proposals to water down constraints in last November's Blair House accord on farm trade with the US. Paris is still keeping these proposals confidential, but among them are two suggestions to preserve Europe's exports and to reduce American inroads into the EC market. Paris proposes that existing EC stocks - amounting to nearly 30m tonnes of cereals and 1m tonnes of beef - should be exempt from the Blair House accord, and that the 21 per cent cut in subsidised exports over six years should apply only to future EC production. It has also sent a separate memo to Brussels, suggesting curbs on imports of American corn gluten.</p>

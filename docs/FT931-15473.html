			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / International Company News: Swiss Volksbank names new chief executive SWISS VOLKSBANK, the object of an agreed SFr1.5bn (Dollars 1.04bn) share exchange takeover bid by CS Holding, the parent company of Credit Suisse, has appointed Mr Kurt Widmer, until now a member of the executive board of Credit Suisse, as its chief executive. The move follows the sudden resignation of Mr Walter Ruegg after the takeover was announced last Wednesday. Mr Ruegg said then that he supported the takeover, because the future of Volksbank as an independent bank looked bleak. However, since he had committed himself to trying to keep Volksbank independent, he felt he should resign and make way for a Credit Suisse appointee.</p>

			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Styles change in the capital. President-elect George Bush and his wife Barbara  and some friends showed up unexpectedly over the weekend at the Kennedy Center  to take in the long-running audience-participation satire "Shear Madness." Two  weeks earlier, they also went to the center to hear singer Barbara Cook, and  shortly before that had dinner at a favorite suburban Chinese restaurant. The  Washington Post says it's an indication that the Bushes aren't stay-at-homes  and plan to find ways around the tight restrictions of the presidency. During  their eight years in the White House, President and Mrs. Reagan showed up  mostly at events where they were expected. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

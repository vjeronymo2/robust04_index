			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor (2): Pseudo 'intellectualism' has disturbing hold over common-sense morality Sir, Mr Dunkley's argument is as flawed as the programme he purports to criticise. He jumps from attacking feminism to justifying (which I trust he is not really trying to do) making love to children. BBC 1's Inside Story may be questioned on several fronts, but the testimony of the adult men in the film should go some way towards proving that 'making love with children really is the most damaging crime of all'. Quite evidently those interviewed were very damaged by the adults who were sexually abusing them. And what the programme had to do with feminism (which is separate from Dunkley's so-called 'victim culture') is beyond this viewer and reader. Perhaps Dunkley's column was cut? I trust the Financial Times does not advocate such a justification of paedophilia. Edi Smokum, 11 Dulwich Road, London SE24</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 29 April (MTI) -- Under Hungarian  electoral law, April 29 is the last day for the press and the  media to publish opinion poll results before the May 8  elections. Therefore, several national dailies published the  latest prognoses in today's issues.    The daily NEPSZABADSAG summarizes the analyses of four  public  opinion research firms -- Szonda-Ipsos, Median, Modus, and the  Hungarian Gallup Institute -- concerning the first (May 8) round  of the general elections.    According to the paper's summary, the number of Hungarian  citizens planning to vote has increased recently: Two of the  institutes expect a 70 percent turnout for the elections. All  four surveys show that the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP)  retains first place in popularity so far. Three surveys place  the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) in second, followed by  the Federation of Young Democrats (Fidesz) and the Hungarian  Democratic Forum (MDF), vying for third with a equal number of  points. The Independent Smallholders' Party (FKGP) and the  Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP) come next, with only  a small difference in their popularity level. According to the  polls, besides the above six, no other party is likely to reach  the 5 percent limit -- the minimum for obtaining a mandate in  Parliament.    The last research of the Hungarian Gallup Institute was  carried out between April 22 and 24, taking a nationwide sample  of the over-eighteen electorate. On the basis of the answers  they received, participation in the elections will approach or  might even reach 70 percent.    The analyses of the Gallup show only slight changes in the  proportion of party adherents. According to the sample, general  support for the MSZP has increased from 19 percent in March, to  20 percent currently; for the SZDSZ it has increased from 9 to  11; for the MDF, from 6 to 8; while for the Fidesz it has  dropped from 10 to 9 percent. However, these results apply to  the whole of the population, not only to those intending to cast  their ballots.    According to Gallup: 31 percent of the citizens who will  vote and have already decided for a party, wish to cast their  ballots for the MSZP; 16 percent will vote for the SZDSZ; 13  percent for the Fidesz; 12 percent for the MDF; 9 percent for  the FKGP; and 7 percent for the KDNP.</p>

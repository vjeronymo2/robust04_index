			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Observer: Changing times What are we to make of the government's decision to find a new public relations and marketing adviser for the sale of its next tranche of BT shares? With the reappointment of S G Warburg and Linklaters &amp; Paines, it looked as if the government intended to use the same old team of advisers. However, it has replaced Dewe Rogerson, the undoubted pr king of the privatisation world, with Brunswick, a relative upstart in the business. It seems that the Treasury simply wanted a change. But in the candyfloss world of the pr merchants, it will be seen as a big blow for Dewe Rogerson.</p>

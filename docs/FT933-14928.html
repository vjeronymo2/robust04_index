			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Nadir set to meet president of northern Cyprus MR ASIL NADIR, the fugitive businessman, was due to meet Mr Rauf Denktash, president of northern Cyprus, last night for the first time since he fled the UK in May. Their meeting comes amid further signs that the regime of the Turkish-occupied part of the island is co-operating to block the efforts of UK administrators to Polly Peck International. On Friday, the finance ministry announced that a pharmaceutical plant belonging to Polly Peck International, Mr Nadir's former company, would be auctioned to settle debts owed to the north Cypriot regime, which says it is owed a total of TL43bn (Pounds 2.6m) in unpaid debts to the local social security agency. The administrators were earlier close to concluding the sale of ICP, the drug company, and had convened a shareholders meeting for July 27 in a step to replace Mr Nadir as a director. Local lawyers say the regime's latest move is seen as further collusion with Mr Nadir to frustrate the sales of the assets in northern Cyprus - one of the last hopes of raising cash for the 23,000 PPI creditors, who are owed a total of Pounds 1.3bn. In London last week, in a move aimed at winning over the northern Cyprus authorities, Mr Christopher Morris of Touche Ross, one of the three UK administrators, formally apologised to the Turkish Cypriot Central Bank over allegations of fraud and money-laundering made in a suit against the bank and other plaintiffs in October 1991. The administrators last week met finance ministry officials in Nicosia, northern Cyprus, hoping to win a breakthrough in efforts to gain access to the local companies. Mr Nadir was expected to meet both Mr Denktash and Mr Dervis Eroglu, prime minister, at a party last night to celebrate the fifth anniversary of Kibris, Mr Nadir's Turkish-language newspaper. Local company officials say the regime had earlier discussed a plan with the administrators whereby the administrators would repay the social security debts in return for limited access to the local companies to prepare a sales prospectus. However, since Mr Nadir fled to the island in May, all talk of disposals has been put on hold. Since PPI went into administration in October 1990, local officials have won 23 separate court actions to block the administrators.</p>

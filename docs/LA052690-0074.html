			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW YORK;  </P> <P> GOETZ BARRED FROM QUESTIONING VICTIM  </P> <P> Bronx County Court Judge Barry Salman ruled that Bernhard H. Goetz cannot  interrogate one of the 1984 subway shooting victims who is suing Goetz for $50  million.  </P> <P> Goetz asserted that Darrell Cabey is not the "mental vegetable" he claims to  be. At a news conference, Goetz handed out a videotape of an interview with  Cabey last December in which Cabey appeared coherent. Cabey was left partially  paralyzed and was in a coma for two months after the shooting. Goetz has filed  a $100-million counterclaim against the teen-agers he shot when he thought they  were about to mug him.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: EL MONTE;  </P> <P> DIAL-A-RIDE SUSPENDED  </P> <P> The City Council voted to temporarily suspend its Dial-A-Ride service to  elderly and disabled residents after concerns were raised about whether the  program was properly insured.  </P> <P> City officials said a Jan. 7 accident involving an off-duty Dial-A-Ride vehicle  revealed that Dial-A-Ride contract holder Mid-Valley Transit Inc. was not  insured for the livery services Dial-A-Ride provides.  </P> <P> Although Mid-Valley Transit owner Wagih Meleka told the council that he bought  the proper insurance coverage beginning June 4, the council voted unanimously  to stop providing Dial-A-Ride services until confirmation of insurance is  obtained.  </P> <P> The council also voted to transfer the Dial-A-Ride contract to ATE/RYDER, the  company that runs the city's old-fashioned trolley system, on July 1, when  Mid-Valley Transit's $223,000 contract expires. Transportation services manager  Gary Byerly said details of the new contract have not been worked out.  </P></p>

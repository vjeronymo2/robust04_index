			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> EC BODY OKS AIRLINE CHANGES  </P> <P> European Community transport ministers today agreed in principle on the basic  outlines of air transport liberalization between the 12 member states by Jan.  1, 1993, officials said.  </P> <P> "I believe that today we see a major breakthrough toward the liberalization of  air transport," Sir Leon Brittan, EC Commission vice president in charge of  competition, told a news conference.  </P> <P> Brittan said that the ministers after a two-day session adopted "a pilot  package" but that there will be further evolution in the future.  </P> <P> He said the package applies "pressure toward lower fares and a wider choice for  customers."  </P> <P> The EC Commission has been trying for a long time to break up the monopolies of  state-run or state-protected airlines in the community that agreed among them  on fares and distribution of routes.  </P></p>

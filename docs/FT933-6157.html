			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Serbs count human cost THE headlines in Belgrade newspapers each day reflect a human tragedy as the Serbian economy suffers under the weight of United Nations sanctions. 'Babies are dying,' one says, while others claim that 'starving pensioners are committing suicide' and 'grocery store shelves are bare'. After months of virtually ignoring the west, Serbian leaders have launched an offensive to get sanctions lifted on humanitarian grounds. Mr Milorad Unkovic, federal minister for foreign economic relations in the rump Yugoslavia, which comprises Serbia and Montenegro, said there was 'great danger with the approach of winter. People will not be able to heat their homes.' The economic decline of Serbia shows no sign of bottoming out. Inflation in August ran at a monthly rate of 1,500 per cent. The Yugoslav National Bank yesterday issued a 1bn dinar banknote worth less than Dollars 3. Industrial production in June dropped by 37 per cent compared with the same month last year and hundreds of thousands of workers have been sacked as factories close. Serbian health care is suffering badly. Medicines and food are not covered by sanctions, but 'if you need surgery, bring your own medicines, needles, anaesthetics and linens, or commit suicide if you don't have money,' said Mr Predrag Simic, director of the Belgrade institute of international politics and economics. If a settlement is reached in Geneva this week for a partition of Bosnia, Serbia will step up pressure for lifting sanctions. But if sanctions were eased, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic would be rewarded for destroying Bosnia and creating Greater Serbia. Russia has called for sanctions to be eased if progress is made on partition but the US says it is far too early even to discuss such measures. Proponents of sanctions on Serbia are convinced that they represent the only means of containing an aggressive state, which is now a regional military power. However Mr Vladislav Jovanovic, Serbian foreign minister, warned that 'sanctions have become the biggest generator of instability in the Balkans'. Serbian officials point to a growing number of countries hit by 15 months of sanctions on Serbia: Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Ukraine, and Hungary have all sustained large losses, while officials from Macedonia say sanctions are harming the former Yugoslav republic even more than Serbia, its northern neighbour. The imposition of sanctions against Serbia has proved to be one of the few issues on which the west was united. But removing them looks likely to be yet another divisive issue.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Magazine regrets 'distress' to PM NEW STATESMAN and Society, the left-wing magazine being sued by Mr John Major over an article in last week's issue, said in a statement yesterday that it 'very much regretted' any distress caused to the prime minister. Similar letters went to Mr Major's solicitors and those acting for Ms Clare Latimer, also referred to in the article, and who is also suing the magazine. The letters conclude: 'Just as speedily as the litigation was commenced so we now hope that litigation can be speedily brought to an end.' The New Statesman's considered reply from its lawyers says the article 'was intended to be a serious and responsible criticism of the Press generally for conducting a whispering campaign based on rumours which, when investigated by the Press, had been found to be totally unsupported by any evidence. 'That clearly was a comment on a matter of public interest since the rumour-mongering and whispering campaign involved the Prime Minister. 'The article was never intended to assert that an affair, let alone an adulterous relationship, had ever taken place between the Prime Min ister and Ms Clare Latimer.' It points out that the writs were issued and served before there was any chance for the magazine to put the record straight in a formal statement and says it will make any other public statement that might be needed to vindicate Mr Major's and Ms Latimer's reputations. These views will be repeated prominently in this week's New Statesman.</p>

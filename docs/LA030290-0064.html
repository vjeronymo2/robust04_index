			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DROUGHT COPS PATROL STREETS OF SANTA BARBARA  </P> <P> The chief of the drought police was on patrol in the streets of west Santa  Barbara when he spotted his first clue: water in the gutter. He pulled over,  studied the flow for a moment and then examined a nearby lawn.  </P> <P> "There's evidence all over the place," said drought officer Mike Morales as he  ran a hand over the damp lawn and examined a still-wet sprinkler head. "This is  flagrant."  </P> <P> Morales is the head of a three-person staff created by the city of Santa  Barbara to enforce its harsh new water conservation measures. Faced with a  water shortage of almost 50% this year because of the ongoing drought, the City  Council earlier this week voted to make watering lawns illegal. The ordinance  also prohibits residents from using hoses to water trees and shrubs.  </P> <P> Morales and the two other drought officers patrol the city streets, looking for  telltale signs like wet gutters and puddles on the sidewalk. They also respond  to calls. So far, The officers have received about 30 calls a day, mostly from  residents who have spotted neighbors watering their lawns.  </P> <P> "We don't consider the number of calls to be particularly high . . . mainly  because the ban was only recently announced," Morales said. "Overall, we feel  most people are complying with the order."  </P> <P> After studying the front lawn of the west Santa Barbara house with the wet  gutters, he spotted the culprit in the back yard. Morales introduced himself  and informed the man that watering lawns is now prohibited in the city.  </P> <P> Norman Lang, the homeowner, shrugged sheepishly. He knew about the water  restrictions, he said, but he had just put in a new lawn and sprinkler system.  </P> <P> "I figured I'd water one last time and hope for rain," Lang said. He gazed at  his lawn wistfully. "But the lawn will probably die anyway. And all that time  and money I put into it will be wasted."  </P> <P> Lang got off easy this time -- only a verbal warning. But the city soon will  start issuing citations to transgressors, said Bill Ferguson, Santa Barbara's  water development planner. A warning citation will be issued for the first  offense; second and third offenses could result in fines and a fourth violation  could lead to shut-off of a resident's water service.  </P> <P> "Unless we get some incredible rainstorms, the watering ban will be in effect  for at least the coming year," Ferguson said.  </P> <P> Morales, 54, was hired by the city last month to enforce a number of water  conservation measures. He drives around town in a white pickup truck with  "Drought Officer" stenciled on the door, along with the city seal.  </P> <P> When Morales began his day Thursday, he had a list of homes to check out.  During the night, about 10 residents had called a city hot line to report  violators.  </P> <P> "We don't look at it as snitching," Morales said. "We're all in this drought  together. And if we didn't get the cooperation of people, we'd need a lot more  officers and a lot more water would be wasted."  </P> <P> Responding to one tip, Morales arrived at a group of condominiums in the city's  eastern foothills. A neighbor was waiting out in front, drinking coffee and  smoking a cigarette. He pointed out to Morales a wet lawn, puddles on the  sidewalk and a broken sprinkler head. Morales promised to obtain the names of  all the condominium owners and remind them of the watering ban.  </P> <P> During the course of his morning patrol, no residents openly resisted Morales  or expressed hostility. Most listened to what he had to say and nodded wearily.  </P> <P> But some, even in the face of overwhelming evidence, refuse to admit  culpability. One man, whose lawn had been watered during the night, opened the  door in his bathrobe and told Morales: "The gardener must have done it."  </P> <P> Later, Morales spotted a trail of water flowing through the gutters. He drove  slowly for several blocks, following the stream, until he located the source: a  small tract home. The lawn was drenched.  </P> <P> When Morales confronted a woman at the front door, she stared at him wide-eyed  and declared: "I haven't watered any lawn."  </P> <P> Problems like these will soon be solved, Morales said, when a drought officer  is assigned to the night shift and can catch scofflaws in the act.  </P> <P> Morales, who used to own a small energy conservation firm, knows that his job  security is tied to the city's current bad fortune. Santa Barbara is entering  its customary dry season, so he is virtually assured of employment through the  end of summer.  </P> <P> "But after the next good rain," Morales said, "I know I could be gone."  </P></p>

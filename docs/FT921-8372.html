			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / International Bonds: European Investment Bank set to launch Dollars 500m deal THE EUROPEAN Investment Bank was yesterday preparing to launch a Dollars 500m seven-year issue in the international bond market, with five underwriting firms bidding for the new issue mandate. Some syndicate officials anticipated that the deal would be launched at a yield spread as low as 5 basis points more than US Treasury bonds. Others argued that the uncertain tone of the Eurodollar sector last week demanded a more generous spread - at least 10 basis points. One area of uncertainty is the demand from Italian investors, usually heavy buyers of EIB paper, which is exempt from withholding tax. The last EIB Eurodollar deal, a Dollars 400m 10-year issue launched via IBJ International in January, did not attract the frenzied buying by Italian investors which is often associated with tax-exempt issues. However, from a spread of just 6 basis points this earlier transaction has since held its ground and EIB is likely to launch another very tightly-priced issue today. Elsewhere, activity was restricted to retail-targeted deals. Shell Australia added to recent supply of medium-dated Australian dollar paper, launching a ADollars 100m five-year deal lead managed by Deutsche Bank Capital Markets. The 10 1/8 per cent bonds traded down to less 1.95 bid by the close, just inside full fees of 2 per cent. Prudential Funding added CDollars 100m to its CDollars 150m three-year deal launched last November. The new tranche of 8 1/4 per cent bonds, lead managed by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, was priced to yield 32 basis points more than Canadian govern-ment bonds, which is a pick up of 17 basis points over the outstanding bonds.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "Our Firm Stand," the newspaper  AL-THAWRAH says: Syria has always proved it truly wants peace  based on UN resolutions and the principles of international law.  It has shown during all stages of the peace process that it is  ready to respond to any effort to entrench the bases of a just  and comprehensive peace that will ensure an end to injustice and  occupation. AL-THAWRAH notes that Syria has repeatedly  announced that the peace for which it is working and exerting  every effort is the peace that can lead to Israel's withdrawal  from the Golan and all other occupied Arab territories, that can  entrench the values of right and justice, and that can lead to  the restoration of all Arab rights.    The newspaper adds: Syria has rejected phased steps and  unilateral solutions and has stood firmly against Israeli  attempts to divide the solution. This is because Syria depends,  in its peaceful trends, on objective and logic realities, which  no one can deny or ignore, foremost of which is the reality that  peace cannot come in installments or stages and that if it is  not just and comprehensive, it will not be a real and  deep-rooted peace.    AL-THAWRAH stresses that Syria has offered all it can to  preserve the credibility of the peace process and to save the  process from any deviation from its specified goals. Moreover,  Syria has always resorted to UN resolutions and the law of  international legitimacy to refute Israel's allegations, to  prevent its calls for partial and unilateral solutions, and to  prove the futility of these offers.    Concluding, the newspaper says: There is no doubt that  Syria's eagerness to provide a suitable climate to make the  peace process successful comes from its concern about regaining  all the Arab territories and rights and also from its desire to  save the region from the whirlpools of confusion and instability  that are threatening more war disasters and tragedies. Syria  adheres to this noble goal that is sought by all nations and to  the peace process as a valuable and important opportunity that  should lead to a real and strong peace.    The newspaper TISHRIN writes in its editorial on the  atmosphere of disappointment and bitterness, which the occupied  Arab territories are experiencing as a result of the signing of  the self-rule accord. It points out that our kinsfolk in the  West Bank and Gaza Strip are still in shock because the accord  has resulted in certain arrangements and measures that have  given Israel all it wants, including occupation; control of  crossing points, bridges, and roads; security and protection for  the settlers; and absolute Israeli sovereignty over political,  defense, and foreign affairs.    TISHRIN notes that the accord will protect and achieve  Israel's goals in devouring and controlling territories. This,  the paper says, indicates that by signing the self-rule accord,  Israel has lifted a heavy burden from its shoulders, namely, its  complete failure to guarantee security for its occupation and  its settlers and to confront and limit the intifadah.    TISHRIN adds: The accords' stipulations, annexes, and maps  conflict with the Palestinian people's will, have made gains for  the occupation, and are aimed at liquidating the Palestinian  people's right to independence, freedom, and self-determination.  This conflict, the paper says, will not last because nations'  fate cannot be determined by fragile accords or unilateral  policies that have nothing to do with nations' rights and real  trends toward full independence.    TISHRIN asserts that the current insistence in the occupied  West Bank, Gaza Strip, and Jerusalem on the continuation of the  intifadah against the occupied forces and settlers is viewed as  part of our people's determination not to bow to the policy of  concession that began with the Oslo talks and that produced an  agreement that emptied the peace process of its essence.    Concluding, TISHRIN says: It is natural for the Arab parties  taking part in the peace process, namely, Syrian, Lebanon, and  Jordan, to hasten to coordinate their positions and stress their  adherence to the principles of a just and comprehensive solution  and to the Madrid conference formula that calls for Israel's  total Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories.</p>

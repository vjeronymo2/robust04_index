			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Chemicals switch hits ICI CHEMICALS group Courtaulds stood out in a listless London market as traders suggested that investors were switching funds from ICI, which was further weakened by a withdrawal of US interest. Courtaulds rose 5 to 562p while ICI shed 16 to 1273p. Initial speculation that Charterhouse Tilney, the stockbroker, was the driving force was denied by the house and it appeared that existing recommendations from Smith New Court might have held sway. Smith is a renowned bear of ICI but is a buyer of Courtaulds on the basis that the company's export market, which represents Pounds 400m of sales, is benefiting from currency factors and US economic recovery. Finally, dealers said that US brokers PaineWebber and CJ Lawrence, both aggressive buyers, finally came off the bid yesterday. The two houses have been primarily responsible for driving ICI's price higher and there was a feeling that now the shares have hit Dollars 80, US investors may be happy to take profits.</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold price takes another knock Gold's price, which started the new year seemingly set to rise to Dollars 400 a troy ounce, took another big knock in hectic European trading yesterday that saw it close in London at Dollars 383.10, down Dollars 5.15 from Friday's close. The trend started in New York on Friday when some institutional investors switched money from gold to bonds, traders suggested, partly because the institutions were disappointed that the precious metal had failed to break through the Dollars 400 level. Analysts suggested yesterday's drop had changed gold's technical picture and it could be heading for further falls - with Dollars 380, Dollars 375 and Dollars 370 an ounce important 'support' points on the way down. Gold bounced off Dollars 379.85 at the lowest level in London yesterday, at which point bargain hunters appeared, traders said. There were some rumours that Australian producers were selling gold again yesterday after restraining themselves as the price approached Dollars 400. In contrast, the Reuter news agency reported suggestions that South Africans had been supporting the market.</p>

The negotiators  have given themselves an extra three days to resolve a number of  outstanding constitutional issues.    The extension results from "technical problems" that have  delayed the promulgation of the election expected on Friday.  ANC negotator Mohammed Valli Moosa said the problems had  nothing to do with the discussions involving the Alliance.    Mr Valli Moosa said the ANC had given the Alliance a set of  proposals which took into account most of its legitimate  demands. The alliance wanted until Monday to take the proposals  back to its principals.    He said there was a possibility that the Alliance would  accept the interim constitution even at this late stage. "The  talks did not break down. Our proposals were not rejected out of  hand. That indicates that the show is still on the road," Mr  Valli Moosa said.    He said the ANC's proposals were an attempt to come to terms  with Alliance concerns about regional constitutional and fiscal  powers.    Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer said the ANC  and the Alliance remained at odds about the extent of powers of  regional governments. He said talks had also been held with a  kwaZulu royal delegation and that these could lead to a  constitutional amendment involving the position of traditional  leadership.    The talks with the royal delegation and other talks with the  Afrikaner Volksfront [AFV, Afrikaner National Front] were not  necessarily interrelated, but the trilateral negotiators had  taken note of earlier discussions on a Afrikaner volkstaat  [homeland], he added. But the volkstaat issue had not been  resolved, and a new hitch on the volkstaat issue had arisen, Mr  Meyer said.    AFV leader Gen Constand Viljoen left the meeting reportedly  on his way to the Bophutatswana Embassy in Pretoria, where  Alliance leaders were waiting to be briefed on the  constitutional proposals presented by the ANC.    SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news  reported this could be an indication that the Alliance was  considering the proposals seriously.</p>

In its annual trade policy report released Tuesday, the USTR  said, however, that South Korea should soon implement laws to  protect patents, trademarks and copyrights (trips) as reports of  piracy and counterfeiting continue. The USTR also urged Seoul  to ease formal and informal restrictions on motor vehicle  imports.    "As part of its contribution to a successful Uruguay Round,  Korea will lower barriers to trade that will benefit U.S.  exporters and investors," the report said.    It recalled that last July, Presidents Bill Clinton and Kim  Yong-sam launched the Dialogue for Economic Cooperation (DEC), a  one-year initiative to expand bilateral economic ties with  special attention paid to Korea's plans to deregulate and  internationalize its econony.    "Liberalization of Korea's investment restrictions is a top  priority for the United States in these consultations," the  report said.    In another area, the United States and South Korea concluded  an agreement in July 1993 which contained specific steps to open  Korea's beef market fully, it said. The agreement, subsequently  expanded and modified as part of the Uruguay Round negotiations,  strictly limits the Korean Government's involvement in  regulating importation and distribution of beef and creates an  alternative private-sector distribution channel, it said.    Korea has also taken positive action in lowering tariffs on  agricultural and manufactured goods, it said.    "In the services area, Korea has provided broad commitments  with relatively few qualifications," it said. "Korea's  commitments are especially strong in advertising, architecture,  engineering, computer services, construction, value-added  telecommunications, and movement of personnel."    "Korea's offer provides not just a standstill commitment to  adopt no new restrictions, but a rollback of existing  restrictions," it said.    Last December, Korea completed its accession negotiations to  the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) government  procurement agreement in renegotiating the pact in parallel with  the Uruguay Round.    The agreement will result in significant new opportunities  for U.S. exporters from 1997, the report said.</p>

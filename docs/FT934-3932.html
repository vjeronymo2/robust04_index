			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Fixed phones ride the airwaves: Andrew Adonis on technology that could provide cheap networks An idea as revolutionary as the mobile phone was a decade ago could provide telecommunications networks which replace miles of costly copper wire with radio waves. The technology is being developed in the UK for launch in early 1995 by Ionica, based in Cambridge. Mr Nigel Playford, Ionica's founder and managing director, says the wireless system, which will link exchanges with fixed phones in homes and businesses using signals from a network of base stations, will slash the cost of building and operating local phone networks. This will boost competition in a sector which has been a virtual BT monopoly. Ionica secured a UK licence in February, but has spent nearly three years on research and development. 'Markets create services,' says Mr Playford, an electronics engineer turned entrepreneur. The market was created by the government's abolition of the BT/Mercury duopoly in 1991, and Mr Playford and two others launched the company that year. It now has about 150 employees, including designers from Northern Telecom, the project's main contractor. The Ionica service for the UK will be geared to the existing market of more than 20m fixed phone subscribers. A receiving antenna, like a television aerial, will be attached to the roof of each subscribing home or business. Ionica is confident it can provide a service without the fluctuations in signal quality experienced with mobile receivers. 'With copper-wire networks, capital investment has to be up front. With us, most of it follows the customer,' Mr Playford said. Only the base stations - each of which would cost about Pounds 10,000 and could serve about 1,000 customers - are 'up front'. The rest of the investment - the antenna and internal wiring - is made only after the customer has signed up. While cable TV companies spend about Pounds 5bn building networks in conurbations, Ionica plans to cover half the country for about Pounds 100m by 1997. The company plans to offer a national service, aiming for a foothold in the small-business and residential market. It intends to guarantee sizeable savings on BT prices and will offer features such as three-way calling, voice messaging, and extra lines at low cost - each antenna link will be able to carry up to eight lines. For larger businesses, the fact that radio waves cannot cope with heavy data transfer will reduce Ionica's appeal. By creating an alternative 'local loop', Ionica is targeting the least competitive part of BT's market. Even when the cable companies have completed their networks, they will cover less than half of the UK. Ionica's radio waves will connect to BT's principal exchanges via parallel Ionica exchanges. It will send the trunk portion of calls over the BT network, or that of one of its long-distance competitors. In doing so, it is able to exploit the most competitive part of the UK telecoms market, the long distance networks. With at least three nationwide long-distance operators in the market by 1995  -BT, Mercury and Energis, a subsidiary of National Grid - and BT making hefty margins on its trunk business, Ionica expects to be offered attractive deals. Backers include Northern Electric, Yorkshire Electricity and Telecom Finland. About Pounds 30m of the Pounds 100m needed has already been raised. But launching the service will be far from simple. Capital has to be raised to fund an unfamiliar venture. Base station sites have to be found. Does the technology work? There is some scepticism in the telecommunications world. Trials in East Anglia next year will show whether Ionica's radio quality is up to that offered by copper and fibre. It also has to ensure uninterrupted service quality in hilly areas. Meanwhile, imitation is flattery: Mercury, the main UK competitor to BT, recently announced its intention to test wireless technology, with a view to possible introduction not long after Ionica. Millicom, a US company, is also planning a radio-based service. The system has strong attractions for developing countries with inadequate fixed networks. The Mexican government recently received an application to build a second national telecommunications network using the technology developed by Ionica. The request for a Mexican licence by Pulsar, the Mexican conglomerate founded by multi-billionaire Mr Alfonso Romo Garza, could be a milestone.</p>

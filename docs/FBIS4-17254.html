			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, 21 Apr, BNS -- Estonian Foreign Minister  Juri Luik met today with Daniel Tarschys, the head of the  Swedish parliament's foreign commission and the new secretary  general of the European Union [EU], the Foreign Ministry press  service told BNS. Tarschys is in Tallinn to attend a meeting of  parliamentary foreign commissions of the Baltic states, the  Visegrad states and the Nordic countries.    Tarschys affirmed that the European Union will in the next  few years attach top priority to strengthening the young  democracies of the central and east European countries.    The EU secretary general said expansion of the union is also  of great importance. In this connection he voiced the opinion  that a democratic Russia as a member of the EU would be a  positive development and that just for this reason Russia's  admission to the union should be conditional upon its fulfilling  the same requirements as other states.

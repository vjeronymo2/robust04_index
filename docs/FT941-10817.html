			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Tougher tobacco advertising rules rejected The government yesterday rejected proposals for firmer legal controls on tobacco advertising and said it would not impose tax penalties on manufacturers which advertise. The news was welcomed by the Advertising Association, the umbrella group for clients and practitioners in the industry, but greeted with dismay by health groups and Ash, the anti-smoking group. Mr Kevin Barron, Labour MP for Rother Valley, said he would press ahead with a private member's bill banning tobacco advertising which will have its second reading debate in the Commons on Friday. Mr Barron said he was confident that a majority of MPs from all parties will support the bill. The government is expected to concede a free vote, allowing Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, and other health ministers to abstain. Mrs Bottomley, who failed to persuade cabinet colleagues to accept a package of compromise proposals, is expected to try to change the bill during its committee stage. However, Mr Barron said he would resist pressure to water down the bill. 'If the committee reflects the vote on the floor of the house, as it should do, I am sure that there will be no need to change it at all,' he said. Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, said there was 'little to support the argument that a statutory ban would have a dramatic effect on further reducing smoking, especially in comparison with the impact of other measures such as price or parental influence'. The government plans to start talks with the tobacco industry on increasing some voluntary controls, particularly in relation to children. The rules relating to poster advertising near schools and playgrounds, for example, could be tightened. A health education campaign, which will cost Pounds 12m over the next three years, is also planned. Ash said experience in Canada and Norway showed that advertising bans could lead to a drop in consumption of 4 per cent to 9 per cent - equivalent to saving between 4,400 and 10,000 lives a year in the UK. It added: 'Their plan to renegotiate the voluntary agreement is worth nothing. It plays into the hands of the tobacco industry, allowing it to retreat into prepared positions from which to carry on its war against the nation's health.' The Royal College of Nursing said good intentions without a statutory ban on tobacco advertising were not enough. 'Instead of tackling what the RCN believes is the root cause in tempting first-time smokers, the government have played safe,' it said. Dr Mawhinney refused to comment on reports of a cabinet split on tobacco advertising. He said the real issue was 'whether it is appropriate to legally ban the advertising of a substance which it is perfectly legal for people to use and enjoy'.</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE CORNER BAR: MILD EXCITEMENT WHERE ONCE WERE ONLY LIMA BEANS  </P> <P> There's a good reason the drinking age in California is 21 -- kids would be  bored by most bars. Their protest would probably have something to do with bars  being dank, cramped, Naugahyde-filled places.  </P> <P> I think kids have a good point. I like cavernous bars that promise mild  excitement and pollution-free lungs upon departure.  </P> <P> I've found such a place at Tia Juana's in Old Irvine, which is housed inside a  restored 95-year-old lima bean warehouse. The zeppelin-like wood and corrugated  metal ceiling guarantees that the A-bomb could go off inside and not smoke up  the atmosphere.  </P> <P> The bar itself is 75 feet long, providing plenty of room to belly up to or --  for the less sociable among us -- there are private tables, some with views of  the trains that zing by outside.  </P> <P> Order a cerveza (they claim to serve any Mexican beer an aficionado can name)  or one of their hand-shaken (never blended) margaritas on the rocks, and  pretend you're inside some upscale south-of-the-border restaurant that actually  has napkins.  </P> <P> The sweet-and-sour margarita mix is produced by a local "juicer" exclusively  for Tia Juana's. Customers, who range from construction workers trucking in off  the Santa Ana Freeway to Irvine Spectrum suits rolling in after a hard day of  reconfiguring the wheel, can harden the mix with one of 18 different kinds of  tequila.  </P> <P> Mercifully, airings of Monday Night Football occur only once a week, replaced  the other six nights by live music. Rock 'n' roll gets its moment Fridays and  Saturdays, and a South American Folk duo plays guitars and pan flutes Sundays,  Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.  </P> <P> Of course, you can eat Mexican food here too, underneath a platoon of pinatas.  Ever dined with a papier-mache Ninja Turtle dangling above you? Now that's what  I call mild excitement.  </P> <P>  Tia Juana's Long Bar &amp; Mexican Cafe Deluxe, 14988 Sand Canyon Ave.,  Irvine. The bar is open 11 a.m to midnight Sunday through Thursday, till 1:30  a.m. Friday and Saturday. (714) 551-2998.  </P> <P> JANET EASTMAN  </P></p>

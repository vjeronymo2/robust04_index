			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / The limits to repression / Examination of the latest political manoeuvres in Algeria The trial of strength between Algeria's military-backed government and the opposition Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) has entered a new and dangerous phase. At the weekend the government declared a one-year state of emergency, banning protests and anti-government preaching from mosques. Tension was already running high following the annulment last month of Algeria's first multi-party elections, which the FIS was poised to win. The latest move will polarise the country further between the 'haves' and 'have-nots' - the growing army of unemployed. Until now the authorities have held back from declaring a state of emergency, well aware that it risked plunging the country into a cycle of repression and violence. Instead they sought to isolate the FIS and arrest its leadership, while holding out an olive branch to those within the movement anxious not to see the country destabilised. They hoped to play on divisions within the FIS and expose the extremists, bent on establishing an Islamic society. This carrot and stick approach also reflected differences within the military. Hardliners led by General Khaled Nezzar, the powerful defence minister, favoured an immediate ban on the FIS. More junior officers, along with some civilian members of the cabinet, were reluctant to acquiesce in a move that would split the country and make nonsense of their 1988 commitment to introducing democracy. However, the mounting cycle of country-wide violence with more than 40 killed last week, the continued use of mosques as centres of political protest and the appearance of armed opposition groups attacking strategic installations, undermined this policy. That it took the FIS three weeks to take to the streets suggests the movement was initially disoriented by the cancellation of elections. It is still hard to tell whether the FIS has developed an underground leadership, or whether the protest is more a mix of spontaneous action by frustrated supporters reacting to the removal of mosque leaders and scattered acts by autonomous armed groups. In seeking to maintain order, the authorities are gambling that Algerians will shy away from the threat of civil strife. Algeria's Arab neighbours - as well as industrialised countries which rely on its gas exports - clearly share that hope. The authorities have also sought to combat a potential legitimacy problem by recalling from 28-year exile Mr Mohammed Boudiaf, the veteran independence leader who is untainted by the abuses of power of the former ruling party, the FLN, to head a five-man Council of State. But to keep the lid on, the military needs to count on the loyalty of conscripts and middle ranking officers. Despite long experience in repression, the military has never had to deal with sustained civil unrest. Nor will administering the country be easy since the FIS controls two-thirds of Algeria's local councils. In the medium term, perhaps the most important factors will be economic. The authorities are hoping for a breathing space to implement economic policies that address opposition grievances: cleaning up the government and increasing spending to provide housing and jobs. The constraints they face, however, are enormous. For each of the past four years, three-quarters of Algeria's oil and gas export income has gone towards servicing its Dollars 25bn foreign debt. And there is little sign of relief. Authoritative projections show Algerian debt repayments running at around Dollars 8.5bn annually well into the second half of the 1990s, compared with annual oil and gas export revenues of Dollars 11bn-Dollars 12bn. The only way out of this squeeze is a debt refinancing. This Friday a group of eight commercial banks headed by Credit Lyonnais will meet in Paris to decide whether to proceed with a Dollars 1.5bn loan to help Algeria refinance its bank debt. If they do the government will have a bit more room for manoeuvre. However, much greater help from western state creditors will be needed if Algeria is to revive its economy. A year ago Italy made a significant gesture, effectively refinancing state-guaranteed and other debts falling due between 1991 and 1993. But France, the biggest creditor, has so far refused to follow suit. The debt squeeze is extremely painful. Many factories are running at one third of capacity, their managers running up large debts with local banks and having to sack workers to stay open. Domestic demand remains severely depressed. The question remains: will the government be able to channel funds into such sectors as construction and food production? Repressive measures alone will not contain the fundamentalists.</p>

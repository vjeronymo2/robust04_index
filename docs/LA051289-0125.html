			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: OPTIONS ARE OPEN FOR ABDUL-JABBAR AFTER THIS SEASON  </P> <P> What does a 7-foot-2 basketball center do after he retires?  </P> <P> If you're Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, almost anything you want to do.  </P> <P> And what Abdul-Jabbar wants to do is get into the television and entertainment  business, but not necessarily behind a microphone.  </P> <P> "People have suggested I get into basketball commentating," he said. "But  that's not what I want to do, at least not now."  </P> <P> What interests Abdul-Jabbar is producing films. He has formed his own company,  Kareem Productions, which has already completed two projects.  </P> <P> One is a one-hour special, "All-Star Tribute to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar," which  will be on NBC tonight at 8.  </P> <P> Due to some ingenious programming by NBC, it runs opposite the Lakers' 7:30  game at Seattle on Channel 9, so if you're a Laker fan and interested in yet  another Kareem tribute, you'll have to crank up the VCR.  </P> <P> Pierre Cossette, producer of the Grammy Awards show, and Abdul-Jabbar are the  co-executive producers of the star-studded special, which was taped April 24 at  the Century Plaza Hotel.  </P> <P> Cossette, asked about Abdul-Jabbar's abilities as a producer, said: "Kareem  knows what it is he wants. There are 30 different ways to do a show like this,  but he was very specific on the format, very creative. That's what the  production business is all about."  </P> <P> Kareem Productions has also made a videotape, "Kareem: Reflections From the  Inside," which is available in video stores.  </P> <P> Richard Crystal, the older brother of comedian Billy -- Richard is 43, Billy 40  -- produced this film with Abdul-Jabbar.  </P> <P> And it is excellent, showing a more human side to Abdul-Jabbar than publicly  seen before, plus some outstanding footage from his playing career, going back  to when he was a 6-foot-8 eighth-grader.  </P> <P> Channel 9 recently had a one-hour feature on Abdul-Jabbar, called "Summer of  42," which was very good, but the tape he did with Crystal is even better.  </P> <P> Crystal and Abdul-Jabbar, who met through a mutual friend when both were in  high school in the New York area, are close friends.  </P> <P> After Abdul-Jabbar made a deal with CBS Fox Video, the distributor of the tape,  he asked Crystal, a writer-producer, to work with him on the project.  </P> <P> "I feel we got Kareem to be himself," Crystal said.  </P> <P> Abdul-Jabbar said the film goes deeper than others because he felt comfortable  working with Crystal.  </P> <P> He said that is not to imply he does not get along with Ted Green, the producer  of "Summer of 42," even though Green, who once covered the Lakers for The  Times, was often critical of the Laker captain.  </P> <P> "That's water under the bridge," Abdul-Jabbar said. "That has been forgotten."  </P> <P> What next for Abdul-Jabbar?  </P> <P> "For now, I'm concentrating on the playoffs," he said. "Then I'm going to take  a couple of months off.  </P> <P> "After that, I'll have time to see what happens and where I fit into the  business. I don't want to try and do everything at once."  </P> <P> What's new at Channel 2: Beginning this weekend, there will be a new set and a  new name for the Sunday night sports wrap-up show at Channel 2, but the host  will be the same.  </P> <P> The 11:15-11:45 p.m. sports segment, to be called simply "The Keith Olbermann  Show," will be done on a set that resembles Olbermann's office, filled with  sports memorabilia.  </P> <P> Maybe the changes will also change Olbermann's luck. He's had a tough go the  past two weeks.  </P> <P> First, he got some heat for reporting that Al Davis was negotiating to move the  Raiders to Sacramento.  </P> <P> Gregg Lukenbill, managing general partner of basketball's Sacramento Kings,  called the report, in which Olbermann used unidentified sources, "irresponsible  journalism."  </P> <P> The story, however, is still alive. The Sacramento Bee, also quoting  unspecified sources, reported Thursday that Lukenbill was heading a group  continuing negotiations with the Raiders.  </P> <P> Asked by the Daily News' Paola Boivin about doing stories using unidentified  sources, Olbermann was quoted as saying: "I don't like to do them. I certainly  don't do them for the glory that's supposedly involved. The principal purpose  is that people need to know what's going on."  </P> <P> Steve Roah, a sportscaster who used to work with Olbermann at Channel 5, has a  different opinion.  </P> <P> "While I've worked with a lot of big egos in this business, I don't think I've  worked with anyone who is more concerned about glory for himself than Keith,"  he said.  </P> <P> Olbermann also was supposed to do a three-part series on sports memorabilia. It  was cut to a single segment.  </P> <P> "One part was enough," said Erik Sorenson, Channel 2 news director.  </P> <P> And finally a contest to come up with a name for the Sunday night show was  nixed.  </P> <P> Said Sorenson: "Although we had some interesting names submitted, such as Keith  Olbermann Sports-o-Rama and Keith Olbermann Sports Emporium, we decided to keep  it simple and go with 'The Keith Olbermann Show.' "  </P> <P> What's new at NBC: The one person at NBC Sports who figured to have job  security was executive producer Michael Weisman.  </P> <P> He was bright, creative, willing to take chances, liked by staff members and  reporters, and he had won all kinds of awards, which most television types  think is important.  </P> <P> But Weisman, 39, was fired this week and replaced by Terry O'Neil, also 39,  even though Weisman had 2 1/2 years left on his $600,000-a-year contract, which  NBC must pay.  </P> <P> Last month, Arthur Watson, also respected and liked, was replaced by Dick  Ebersol as the president of NBC Sports.  </P> <P> More changes are reportedly forthcoming.  </P> <P> It's a crazy business.  </P> <P> TV-Radio Notes  </P> <P> HBO offers an attractive fight Saturday night when unbeaten lightweight  champion Julio Cesar Chavez takes on super-lightweight champion Roger  Mayweather at the Forum. The word super in this case is not a description, it  denotes a weight class. If you're going to apply the word super to one of the  fighters, it better fits Chavez, 60-0 with 50 knockouts and considered by many  as the best boxer, pound-for-pound, in the world. Mayweather is 34-5, and one  of the losses was to Chavez, who stopped him in the second round of their 1985  fight. But Mayweather has improved since then and is 6-0 against Mexican  opponents in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Chavez, from Culiacan, Mexico, recently toured East Los Angeles and HBO  producer Rick Bernstein sent along a crew to film the visit. It will be shown  as part of the prefight coverage, which begins at 7 p.m. Announcers Jim Lampley  and Larry Merchant will work the fight without regular commentator Sugar Ray  Leonard, who is busy preparing for his June 12 bout against Thomas Hearns.  Former boxer Ruben Castillo of Bakersfield, who was knocked out by Chavez in  April of 1981, will work the fight as a translator. . . . HBO will also provide  a Spanish-enhanced telecast to cable companies in Spanish-speaking areas, and  radio XPRS (1090) in San Diego will carry a Spanish-language broadcast of the  fight. There will be no English-language radio coverage.  </P> <P> After two weekends of National Basketball Assn. playoffs, the ratings on CBS  are up from an average of 5.6 a year ago at this juncture to 6.2. CBS will  televise doubleheaders both Saturday and Sunday, with games at 10 a.m. and  12:30 p.m. both days. The Saturday games are New York-Chicago, with Dick  Stockton and Hubie Brown, and Phoenix-Golden State, with Greg Gumbel and Quinn  Buckner. The Sunday games are New York-Chicago, Game 4, with Stockton and  Brown, and the Lakers at Seattle, with Verne Lundquist and Tom Heinsohn.  </P> <P> The Tribute to Kareem ceremony held at the Forum April 23, before the Lakers'  final regular-season game, finally was shown by Prime Ticket Wednesday night  after the Lakers' victory over Seattle. Prime Ticket is tentatively planning to  show it again next Tuesday at 6 p.m. before Game 5 of the Laker-Seattle series,  provided there is a Game 5.  </P> <P> Tom Lasorda and Don Drysdale will be Bob Costas' guests on "Costas Coast to  Coast" on KFI Sunday night at 6. . . . Prime Ticket and GGP Sports of San  Francisco have entered into a production deal in which GGP will provide such  shows as "This Week in the Pac-10" and "Pac-10 Today" during the college  football season.  </P></p>

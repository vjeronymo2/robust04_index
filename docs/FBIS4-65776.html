			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "`Government Must Save 20 Billion'"] </F>   [Text] Over the next four years, the new government will  have to save almost 20 billion guilders in order to halt growing  unemployment. This recommendation, contained in a memo to the  government formation, was made by the Central Economic  Commission (CEC), which is comprised of senior officials from  the Ministries of Finance, Social Affairs, Economic Affairs, as  well as from the Central Planning Office.    The CEC's savings measures are on the high side compared to  the electoral platforms of the four major parties. Only the VVD  [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] wants more savings:  17 billion guilders in addition to the 5 billion the current  government has already chalked up.    According to the CEC, 10 billion guilders must be saved in  social benefits. Next, 11 billion guilders must be used to  lower employers' wage costs to the level of the minimum wage.  At the same time, the CEC is advocating measures to maintain  the purchasing power of those earning the lowest incomes.    In this respect, the officials are opting for a completely  different path than that taken by the committee chaired by  former European Commissioner F. Andriessen. Last week, he  advised increasing the difference between benefits and wages by  giving working people a tax break. The CEC wants to make it  more attractive for employers to create jobs for people who are  poorly trained.    According to the CEC, intervention measures are inevitable  if  the government wants to prevent a situation in 1998 in which  there are 89 people not working for every 100 employed. The  officials call the growth in the number of nonactive people  "socially and economically disruptive."    They want to maintain the current social security system for  those people who are currently dependent upon it. The changes  should apply only to newcomers. As was already known last week,  the CEC wants to place further limits on access to occupational  disability insurance.    Only those people who have worked five years or longer and  who are more than two-thirds occupationally disabled will still  be considered for occupational disability benefits. The  officials feel that people suffering from partial occupational  disabilities must remain at the service of their employers.  This was also suggested by parliament's Buurmeijer committee of  inquiry.    As for the investigation into the viability of a "purple"  government coalition comprising the Pvda [Labor Party], the VVD,  and D66 [Democrats 66], the results of the Buurmeijer committee  play an important role. The D66 embraced them in its electoral  platform and VVD leader Bolkestein let it be known even before  the elections that he wanted to give up the former system if the  Buurmeijer proposal was adequate. The PvdA, which rejects the  former system, also feels that the Buurmeijer proposal is more  open to discussion.    The CEC also wants to privatize the national health  insurance  system, abolish the Heir Act, and lower the contribution for  single people to 60 percent of the minimum wage. In addition,  old age pensioners who have a supplementary pension of at least  10,000 guilders per year will have to pay taxes for all kinds of  national insurance, including of course the old age pension.    The senior officials also proposed putting stiffer taxes on  cars and energy. These measures should yield almost 5 billion  guilders.    Working through the plan it would appear that the ratio of  working to nonworking people may become more favorable over the  next four years: 100 working people to 82 nonworking people.  The advantage of this is that the linking of benefits to wages  in industry can continue. The law states that linking may only  be applied if per 100 working people there are not more than  82.6 nonworking people.</p>

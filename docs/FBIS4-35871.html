			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, 3 Jun (MENA) -- PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat  last night received Sten Anderson, head of the Scandinavian  Countries Council and Sweden's former foreign minister.    The Palestinian News Agency WAFA said 'Arafat and Anderson  discussed the latest developments in the Middle East peace  process, especially the Palestinian National Authority's  takeover of its tasks in the Palestinian land. The discussion  also dealt with the Palestinian Authority's responsibility for  reconstructing Palestine and the international community's  responsibility to help in this task.    The Palestinian News Agency said the head of the  Scandinavian  Countries Council expressed his support for the Palestinian  National Authority with all means to enable it to implement its  tasks.    Informed sources here expressed their belief that announcing  this meeting, which might have taken place in 'Arafat's home,  aims to counter reports on the seriousness of 'Arafat's illness.    Informed Palestinian sources affirmed that a suite has been  booked for 'Arafat at the Medical City in Jordan and that  'Arafat will be moved there in the next few days for treatment  and necessary medical tests.    It was announced yesterday that 'Arafat had suffered a  severe  ailment that kept him at home and halted his activities.</p>

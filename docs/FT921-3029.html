			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Costings assume saving on tax administration THE Liberal Democrats sought to win credibility for their manifesto with a supplement setting out full costings - including the higher taxes they would charge. But they risked raising as many questions as they answered. The party's central proposals for tax and benefits are intended to be self-financing. They are separate from the Pounds 4bn emergency investment programme planned by the party which would be funded by abolishing the new 20p income tax band and increasing borrowing by Pounds 2bn. The extra 1p on income tax would then fund an extra Pounds 2bn spending on education. In the first year, the gross cost of the party's benefit proposals is shown as Pounds 4.3bn. No breakdown is supplied but it includes increases of Pounds 5 a week in a single person's pension and Pounds 8 a week for a pensioner couple, plus a rise of Pounds 1 a week in child benefit, together with the abolition of the 20 per cent minimum poll tax contribution. Offsetting this will be an expected Pounds 4.4bn raised from a integrated tax, national insurance and benefit system. Like Labour, the party would end the ceiling on National Insurance contributions (NICs), but it claims its tax proposals would be less harsh on middle-earners. Income tax rates would start at 35 per cent (a 26p basic rate plus 9 per cent NICs). For earnings above Pounds 33,000 there will be a combined rate of 42 per cent, and on earnings of about Pounds 50,000 there would be a 50 per cent rate. However, the costings also assume a saving on administering the new tax scheme of Pounds 400m in the first year, largely from ending the need to collect the 20 per cent minimum poll tax. The figure appears highly ambitious given the complexities which would be involved in integrating Britain's tax and social security systems. At the same time, the cost of the party's promise to provide a 'citizen's income' is not included in the manifesto supplement. While party officials said it would not be introduced until the sixth year of a Liberal Democrat government, a delay is not mentioned in the manifesto itself. The party's costings show the public sector borrowing requirement rising in real terms for two years under the Liberal Democrat programme but then falling at a faster rate than envisaged by the Tories. That assumes the planned programme of public works can be successfully halted after two years.</p>

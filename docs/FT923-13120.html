			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Riding the roller-coaster of New York's high-life DO DEMOCRATS have more fun? If they don't, it's not for want of trying. On Monday afternoon in New York, just as the party's convention was being gavelled to order at Madison Square Garden, more than 500 of the 5,000 delegates seemed far more interested in making merry. The scene was a huge white carnival tent beneath the Brooklyn Bridge, where Senator John Breaux, a dapper good ol' boy from the bayou country of Louisiana, found himself surrounded by beautiful blondes, carnival clowns in pale blue satin and raucous bands that played pure Dixie, as the party faithful attacked plates piled high with blackened catfish and crab fritters. The Brooklyn bash, just one of dozens of convention-related parties this week, saw Governor Bill Clinton's army of supporters keenly intent on imbibing an ocean of alcohol. The music played, the sun bore down on the crowd, the din became a roar and Brooklyn's borough president extolled the virtues of cheesecake, Coney Island hot dogs and the Democratic party. The party faithful, however, were busy in vigorous pursuit of the fun side of 'Fun City'. The 45-year-old Senator Breaux, neatly sidestepping oil industry lobbyists and besotted delegates in Hawaiian shirts, addressed himself to the issue at hand. 'You have to understand that we have raised fun to a new standard this week. There's fun. There's a whole lotta fun. And then there's Louisiana fun. We closed down the Tatou Club early this morning and we're still at it,' he explained. The ever-salacious New York Post newspaper was spot on, meanwhile, as its three-inch headlines screamed PARTY TIME] and proceeded to tell the story of how go-go dancers from a strip bar called Goldfingers shed their bikini tops before cheering Democrats as they cruised around Madison Square Garden on a flatbed truck. The incessant partying, which was already under way at the weekend, took delegates on a roller-coaster series of taxi rides from socially conscious 'minority' festivities in Harlem to funky gatherings in Greenwich Village, from select soirees on the Upper East Side to dives on the Lower East Side. The Tatou, a midtown night club where Mr Clinton recently played his saxophone, was everybody's favourite. Less popular was the black-tie Texas All-Star Gala on Sunday night at the trendy Supper Club in the theatre district. 'The highlight of that event,' said one weary Congressional staffer from Oklahoma, 'was getting out of there.' While the rank and file guzzled beer, the well-heeled and well-connected sipped champagne at the A-list events. Chief among these was party stalwart Pamela Harriman's Waldorf Astoria function in honour of Bob Strauss, the Democratic power broker turned Bush administration ambassador to Moscow. Equally coveted was an invitation to the Dollars 1,000-a-ticket gathering at Mayor David Dinkins's digs, starring newlyweds Senator Edward Kennedy and Victoria Reggie, just in from Hyannisport. Sandwiched between the elite and the street were the numerous cocktail parties for state delegations. Mr Tom Udall, New Mexico's attorney-general, explained why he was attending so many functions: 'The reason is to keep my wife from shopping all the time.'</p>

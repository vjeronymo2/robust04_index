			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yuriy Gladkevich article: "Russian Production Tired of </F> Waiting for Reforms. Russian Federation Presidential Edicts  Initiate Them"]    [Text] A lot of water has passed under the bridge since  Russia was declared a land of reform. Whole oceans have flowed  by while our legislators have waffled. The Russian Government  (in one form or another) has repeatedly attempted to channel  these reforms in the main direction -- that of improving the  economy, boosting production, strengthening the country's power,  and enhancing the people's prosperity. But, alas, the planned  results have not been achieved.    Throughout these years many Russian and foreign specialists,  assessing the Russian leadership's practical policy, have  repeatedly noted its contradictory and inconsistent nature in  the economic sphere. Industrial production, particularly in  relation to high-tech and labor-intensive output and to sectors  ensuring our economic and defense might, has steadily fallen,  depressed by various crises.    The country is getting close to a situation where the  economy, as the head of state recognizes, is on the verge of  collapse.    Only one thing can save it -- slowly transferring the  reforms  to the production sphere. Under these conditions the action  taken by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who has signed a  package of highly important edicts (on the abolition of quotas  and the licensing of goods for export; on certain issues of  fiscal policy; on the reform of state enterprises; on additional  measures to normalize transactions; on the restoration of tax  payment discipline; and on the consolidation of the Highways  Fund into the Russian Federation budget) may be of decisive  importance.    In the opinion of experts, the first five of these edicts  should have a decisive impact on the situation in Russia. The  lifting of export quotas, for instance, should stimulate the  further liberalization of Russian exports and remove the  administrative barriers in the way of exporter enterprises. But  this does not mean that the mechanism for monitoring their  activity will be destroyed. The system of foreign exchange  controls will continue to operate, and the institution of  specialized exporters will be maintained and could even be  strengthened in the future. Quite clearly, enterprises  themselves can count on a lowering of export tariffs, which will  have a favorable impact on their business.    The second edict instructs the Russian Federation Government  to submit draft laws to the Federal Assembly which would reduce  the number of taxes and make it possible to lower the main taxes  -- income tax and value-added tax -- by 10-20 percent on  average. This measure is very necessary, since enterprises are  being crushed by the burden of taxation, which makes it harder  for their output to compete in the world market, rendering it  inordinately expensive. This edict also establishes  concessionary taxation for enterprises using foreign capital and  engaged in the production sphere.    Sanctions have also been tightened up against enterprises  owned by the federal government which violate the state's rights  as their owner. Currently the leaders of certain state  enterprises are very actively manipulating funds and budget  resources for their own interests -- for instance, federal  appropriations are "put to work" on the interbank market, and  the profits go straight into the pockets of the tricksters.    Enterprises discovered to be acting in this way and not due  for privatization will be immediately redesignated as  treasury-funded [kazennyye] (the most stringent form of state  ownership).    The measures to normalize transactions envisage the  introduction of strict chronological sequence [kalendarnaya  ocherednost] being followed for payments from current accounts.  If, say, an enterprise has no funds in its ruble accounts, it  is obliged to convert money from its foreign-currency accounts  and settle up with the other party. I think that even if this  measure does not end the growth in mutual nonpayments between  enterprises -- which is forcing many of them into extremely  difficult positions -- it will at least stop the problem getting  any worse.    For entirely understandable reasons, the military are  particularly interested in whether these edicts will be able to  improve the situation in the defense industry. It is no secret  that, for various reasons, the military department sometimes  cannot even afford the output of military-industrial complex  enterprises, and it owes the defense industry a lot of money.  As for mutual nonpayments between enterprises -- it is hard to  calculate just who owes whom how much. Add to this the pressure  of the tax burden and it is clear that if this situation  persists for a while longer, we run the risk of witnessing the  wholesale bankruptcy of Russian arms, combat hardware, and  systems producers. Almost 80 percent of military-industrial  complex enterprises have already reached this point, and the  number of potential bankruptcies is growing. We must assume  that the signing of the aforesaid edicts will improve the  condition of the severely ailing defense sector. But  specialists believe that a full recovery will only come about  when the first set of "healing" edicts is backed up by new ones.    In complete agreement with this, it seems, is Aleksandr  Lifshits, leader of the president's group of experts, who stated  that the main task is to keep inflation reasonable and switch  the reforms to the sphere of production -- the very sphere that  forms the foundations of our power, the improvement of the  economy, and the implementation of the reform program as a  whole. The Russian Government, we understand, has so far  received only an incomplete "guidance document." But even this  is already a considerable normative basis for stimulating the  reform process -- a process which the country's parliament was,  regrettably, unable to come up with in good time.</p>

			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONCERN ABOUT DOLLAR DRIVES DOW DOWN 15  </P> <P> The stock market moved broadly lower Tuesday, depressed by concerns about the  adverse consequences of a recently robust dollar.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials finished with a loss of 15.30 points at  2,503.54.  </P> <P> In nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, losers swamped  gainers by a margin of about 2 to 1, with 1,014 down, 503 up and 483 unchanged.  </P> <P> Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 164.87 million shares, up from  151.46 million in the previous session.  </P> <P> Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp., said a weakening  in long-term Treasury bond prices acted as a catalyst for the selloff in stocks  and encouraged investors to prune their holdings of shares on which they had  made substantial profits in recent weeks.  </P> <P> Also motivating sellers was a desire to collect their profits before the  government reports a string of potentially market-moving economic statistics  later this week. Reports on merchandise trade are due Thursday. On Friday,  reports for May on consumer prices and housing starts will be issued.  </P> <P> The pharmaceuticals concern Pfizer partly blamed the dollar's appreciation for  an expected 30% to 40% decline in its second-quarter earnings. Disclosure of  the disappointing estimate late Monday led Pfizer stock to plunge 3 1/8 to 58  in heavy trading Tuesday.  </P> <P> Other drug companies took a cue from Pfizer, including Syntex, which slid 1 1/2  to 50 3/4, SmithKline Beckman fell 1 1/8 to 61 3/8 and Warner Lambert tumbled 2  3/8 to 89.  </P> <P> Among other blue chips, International Business Machines jumped 2 1/8 to 111 as  more than 2 million shares changed hands on news that an investment firm had  confirmed its buy recommendation.  </P> <P> Time rose 5 to 180 as reports circulated that General Electric might enter the  bidding for the publishing giant. GE led the actives' list, closing with a loss  of 3/4, at 53 1/2.  </P> <P> Time is fighting a hostile $175-a-share buyout bid from Paramount  Communications in an attempt to preserve a planned stock swap merger with  Warner Communications. Paramount rose 3/4 to 57 3/4 and Warner closed off 1/4  at 54 1/4.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, stock prices fell Tuesday when investors sold on fears of a discount  rate rise to brake the dollar's rise. The 225-share Nikkei index fell 184.46  points or 0.55% to close off its lows at 33,213.55, after surging 157.50 to a  high 33,555.51 near the open.  </P> <P> In London the Financial Times 100-share index was down 15.3 points, or 0.7%, at  2,123.0, after slumping as much as 22.1 points at midday.  </P> <P> Credit  </P> <P> Bond prices fell Tuesday as many traders cashed in on the market's recent  robust rise.  </P> <P> The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond tumbled about 7/8 point, or $8.75  for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite  direction from price, jumped to 8.22% from 8.13% late Monday.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of short-term  government issues slipped 7/32 point to 11/32 point, intermediate maturities  declined 13/32 point to 5/8 point, and 20-year issues fell 13/16 point,  according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a financial information  service.  </P> <P> Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.40% as the discount edged up 1  basis point to 8.13%. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.24% as the discount  increased 4 basis points to 7.82%. Yields on one-year bills advanced to 8.42%  as the discount jumped 8 basis points to 7.83%.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for short-term  loans, was quoted late in the day at 9.31%, up from 9.25% late Monday.  </P> <P> Currency  </P> <P> Central banks helped push the dollar lower Tuesday as the U.S. government  reported that the deficit in its broadest measure of foreign trade worsened  dramatically in early 1989.  </P> <P> The dollar fell against all major currencies except the British pound, which  was weakened by speculation of a rift between Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher  and her top economic official, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson.  </P> <P> The pound finished the European trading day at its lowest level against the  dollar in more than two years, although action by the Bank of England and a  statement by Thatcher supporting Lawson raised it from its lowest levels.  </P> <P> In London, the pound slipped to $1.5162 late Tuesday. That was the pound's  lowest rate against the dollar since February, 1987. Late Monday, sterling cost  $1.5250. In New York, the pound traded at $1.5270, down from $1.5285 on Monday.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar  rose 0.30 yen to a closing 148.70 yen. Later in London, the dollar was quoted  at 149.15 yen. In New York, the dollar fell to 147.75 yen from 148.46 yen on  Monday.  </P> <P> In Hong Kong, gold rose $2.63 an ounce to close at a bid of $361.66.  </P> <P> Gold fell in London to a late bid of $359.50 an ounce from late Monday's  $359.95.  </P> <P> Commodities  </P> <P> Coffee futures prices dropped to a 10-month low Tuesday amid fears that the  International Coffee Organization's failure to forge a new price-support pact  could leave unroasted coffee free to fall to as low as $1 a pound.  </P> <P> On other markets, orange juice futures rose sharply; grains and soybeans  advanced; petroleum futures were mixed; precious metals gained, and livestock  and meat futures were mixed.  </P> <P> Coffee futures settled 4.75 cents to 9.46 cents lower on New York's Coffee,  Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange, with the contract for delivery in July at $1.1538,  the lowest close since Aug. 8. The price of coffee for July delivery in New  York has dropped more than 11% since Friday.  </P> <P> The loss of nearly 9 1/2 cents Tuesday was nearly twice as large as the decline  posted Monday, when it became apparent the world's largest coffee producer- and  consumer-nations would end their nine-day meeting in London without an  agreement to replace the 6-year pact that expires Oct. 1.  </P></p>

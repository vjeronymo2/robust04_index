			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] The ambassador of the European Union to Vietnam Mr.  (Will Morgan) has said that the Union and Vietnam have  potentials for development and cooperation. Here is our review  of this relationship.    Last year, the 12 countries of the European Union expressed  interest in the development of cooperation with Vietnam. The  European community has committed 40 million U.S. dollar  technical aid to help Vietnam develop afforestation. Last  month, the European Union Parliament approved the signing of a  treaty of cooperation between the EU and Vietnam. EU member  countries then advanced the draft frame agreement for the  discussion of cooperation and investment in Vietnam. According  to the EU Ambassador to Vietnam, in June, EU will continue the  discussion of the draft agreement and it might be signed in  October this year.    These developments are positive signals for the development  of economic relations between Vietnam and the EU member  countries.    At present, Vietnam has a big contingent of scientists, but  is in short of capital. Once the agreement is signed, it will  enable the operation of the European bank in Vietnam. That  means Vietnam can obtain loans for economic development, and at  the same time, Vietnamese and foreign scientists have  opportunities for cooperation.    Speaking with newsmen in Vietnam last week, Mr. (Will  Morgan)  said that the EU is expecting a long-term cooperation with  Vietnam. The two sides will also establish an official committee  between the EU parliament and the National Assembly of Vietnam.  There are enough conditions for strong cooperation between  Vietnam and the EU.</p>

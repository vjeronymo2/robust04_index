			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: Delta Air slices Dollars 5bn off nine-year spending DELTA Air Lines, one of the three US 'mega-carriers', yesterday announced plans to cut more than Dollars 5bn from its capital expenditure plans over the next nine years by reducing new aircraft deliveries. The carrier said the spending reduction was part of an attempt to 'implement changes in its fundamental cost structure,' and would result in the airline taking delivery of over 100 fewer aircraft. Capital spending plans had previously stood at about Dollars 22bn. Delta's action mirrors that of American Airlines and United Airlines, its two big rivals in the US. Delta declined to specify precisely which aircraft would be affected although it said both Boeing and McDonnell Douglas aircraft were involved. It has 275 aircraft on option with the two manufacturers, and 168 on order. But The airline said it would not exercise options expiring on May 1 for 10MD-88s and two Boeing-757s. Boeing said yesterday it had only had preliminary discussions with Delta, and believed only aircraft under option were affected. Delta, however, said  -within the total cuts - both aircraft on order and under option would be involved. The Atlanta-based carrier, which last year bought Pan Am's east coast shuttle and transatlantic routes, stressed that other efforts to prune its cost base were under way. Mr Ron Allen, chairman, said personnel would be cut via attrition, some facilities consolidated, some hub city flight complexes streamlined, and more use made of part-time and contract personnel. Delta has one of the youngest fleets in the US, with an average age of 9.17 years. It has also been among the strongest carriers financially. However, this month it reported a Dollars 199.3m operating loss for the first quarter of 1992, despite a lower fuel bill. Mr Allen conceded that losses had escalated recently.</p>

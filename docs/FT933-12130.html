			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Polishing off gilts For a while last week it seemed as though the rally in the gilts market might have run its course. To the problem of over-supply was added a sense that accelerating recovery might preclude further interest rate cuts. On top of that was the political uncertainty - now resolved - over the Maastricht treaty, while sterling was at a level which might deter foreign buyers of gilts. The mood changed after the French franc came under pressure on Thursday afternoon, creating extra demand for sterling. Now it looks as if the downward blip was more a question of the market trying to position itself for this week's Pounds 3.25bn auction. The fall in yields may thus have some way to go. The latest economic data showing growth sufficient to make inroads into the PSBR without reviving inflation ought to be positive for gilts. If currency turmoil in Europe prompts lower interest rates there, the short end of the gilts market may be sustained by parallel cuts in UK base rates. Admittedly the long end might begin to fret about the eventual revival of inflationary pressures, but for the time being real yields still look attractive. That is not to say the rally can continue indefinitely. The gilts market has pencilled in tax increases worth perhaps 1 per cent of GDP into November's Budget. It will be rudely disappointed if the measures are not forthcoming. Since the yield spread over German government bonds is now a mere 110 basis points there is not much room for further convergence. The need for a premium sufficient to attract overseas funds means the gilts market depends as much on developments abroad as at home.</p>

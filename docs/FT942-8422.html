			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / BT raises regional pricing issue British Telecommunications has raised the possibility of regional phone pricing in the UK. At yesterday's results meeting, Mr Michael Hepher, BT's managing director, flagged regional pricing as an option after the introduction of a new charging system next year, which will replace unit-based prices with per-second charges. Mr Hepher insisted BT had 'no plans' for such a change, which would be highly controversial, but analysts believe it has clear attractions for BT in its battle with competing operators building local or regional networks. BT announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.76bn for the year to March 31, against Pounds 1.97bn. Leaving aside redundancy charges, disposals and other non-recurring items, the increase was less than 3 per cent. Operating profits were Pounds 3.53bn (Pounds 3.47bn) before redundancy charges of Pounds 517m (Pounds 1.03bn). At Pounds 13.7bn, BT's annual turnover rose 3.3 per cent. Earnings per share were 28.5p, against 19.8p. Before one-off items the increase was 0.4 per cent. A final dividend of 10.05p raised the total by 7.1 per cent to 16.7p (15.6p). Growth was stronger than expected in the UK, but the Pounds 750m of redundancy charges to be taken in this year's figures were larger than analysts had anticipated. The high cost, against the past year's Pounds 517m (down from Pounds 1.03bn), is due to a new emphasis on cutting management jobs. BT is set to shed 15,000 jobs this year. Its share price has fallen by nearly 20 per cent against the FT-A All-Share index over the past year amid fears about regulation and strong UK telecoms competition. Inland call volumes were 6 per cent up on 1992-93, increasing turnover by 1.9 per cent despite the effects of a price cap agreed with Oftel, the telecoms regulator, obliging BT to cut its prices by 7.5 per cent after allowing for inflation. BT is bound by the same price cap this year. Sir Iain Vallance, BT chairman, committed BT to vigorous efforts to attract customers back from competitors who have taken about 11 per cent of the UK market. Mr Hepher promised an intensification of the marketing campaign aimed at the residential sector. The objective was to build 'a high phone-usage culture in the UK'. BT will make a special Pounds 250m contribution to its pension scheme this year following a revaluation, after an Pounds 800m special payment last year. Mr Hepher claimed BT had won back more than Pounds 200m of business from rival Mercury as part of its 'win back' programme. More than 50 per cent of its business revenues now derive from discount schemes, offering reduction of up to 16 per cent on standard tariffs in return for a quarterly fee. BT's gearing was down to 9 per cent at the end of March, but will rise sharply this year if its Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.5bn) alliance with MCI, the US long-distance carrier, is cleared by US regulators.

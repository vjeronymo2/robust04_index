			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Technology: Patent benefit on-line From this month , it will be much easier to find patents held at the British Library in central London. The increasing use of CD-Rom is helping to control the largest collection in the world, with material from Europe, the US and Japan. The library contains 34m patents, increasing by about 1m a year. To cope with this volume of material, plus a year's worth of scientific books and periodicals also housed at the library, requires almost 2km of extra shelf space each year. Many people come in person to search the collection; more use the library's Patent Express service which sends copies by post, courier and fax. People search the collections for various reasons. Inventors need to be sure their brainchild is original. Companies use searches to watch competitors or guard against wasteful research and development. Recently, the process of applying for a patent has become much easier. Under the European Patent Convention only a single application is needed for a patent to be granted in up to 14 countries. In addition, the Patent Co-operation Treaty provides the basis for a single international application. Eighteen months after a successful application, a patent is published by the Patent Office and can be anything from two or three pages in length to several hundred, the average being 10 to 12. As well as being printed conventionally, a copy is scanned and put on to a CD-Rom which can hold about 1,000. An exchange network has been set up between patent libraries around the world which swap CD-Roms. The development is also bringing significant benefits for both storage and searching. Looking through an on-line database is obviously quicker than consulting bound volumes on the shelves and makes it possible to carry out complicated searches.</p>

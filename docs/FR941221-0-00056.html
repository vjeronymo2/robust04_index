			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Project owners should note that the following types of projects or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance would  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NOT <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  be covered by this rule:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Section 202 housing projects,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Section 221(d)(3) BMIR housing projects,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Section 221(d)(4) retirement service centers (because such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects have FHA mortgage insurance but no section 8 assistance),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Section 236 housing projects,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Housing projects with contracts for section 8 loan management set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aside (unless the projects also have contracts for section 8 assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involving new construction or substantial rehabilitation, in which case only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those units could be covered),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Housing projects with project-based section 8 rental certificates,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Section 8 tenant-based assistance programs (rental vouchers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificates).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Assisted Under a Contract for Assistance Under Section 8(b)(2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated projects have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unassisted units and assisted units. These projects are often referred to as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``partially assisted projects.'' Because the statutory definition of ``covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 8 housing'' only applies to housing that is under a contract for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance, the subtitle D system of preferences would  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  apply to unassisted units in a partially assisted project. Additionally, nothing in this regulation establishes a cap on the number of unassisted units for disabled families in a partially assisted project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While this regulation does not apply to the unassisted units in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> partially assisted project, this regulation also does not relieve any owner of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any project, including the owner of a partially assisted project, from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complying with the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, section 504 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the implementing regulations for these statutes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or any other applicable statutory or regulatory requirement, including the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of the National Housing Act, with respect to the assisted or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unassisted units. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, owners may provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the preferences in accordance with this rule, with respect to the assisted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Originally Designed Primarily for Occupancy by Elderly Families  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final statutory requirement for qualification as a ``covered section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8 housing project'' is that the project must have been  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> originally designed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupancy by elderly families.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The statute does not define the term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``originally'' or define the phrase ``originally designed for occupancy by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elderly families.'' However, the House Report offers some insight on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject. The House Report suggests that to qualify as housing originally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed for occupancy by elderly families, the owner of the project must have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expressed an intent to create housing for elderly tenants when the developer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negotiated with the Department for Federal financial assistance. (H.R. Rept.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. 760, 102d Cong. 2d Sess. at 141 (1992).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the various types of housing projects covered by this rule were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed under several different programs, and over a period of time which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spans almost two decades, there is no uniform documentation at HUD which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidences the population group to be served by a project. In many instances,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the application in response to a notice of funding availability (NOFA) shows  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a project was designed as an elderly housing project. However, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indication of the population group to be served by the housing project does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not always appear in any one document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, because one of the previous definitions of ``elderly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families'' in section 3(b) of the 1937 Act included disabled families, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not always clear from documents that indicate a project was developed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``elderly families'' whether the project for elderly families was intended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mean housing for the broader eligible category of families (i.e., elderly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> and <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  disabled families) or for families who qualified by virtue of age  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alone. Further confusion may be added by the fact that for most of the period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when this housing was being developed, HUD policy required all housing for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elderly (defined by age) to incorporate certain accessible features and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design a certain percentage of the units to be accessible for persons with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physical disabilities. Typically, these units were made available to eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families with physical disabilities, regardless of age.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, in establishing whether a project was originally designed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primarily for occupancy by elderly families within the meaning of subtitle D,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two distinctions must be drawn: (1) the project was designed primarily for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elderly families (as opposed to non-elderly families); and (2) the project was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed for elderly families (i.e., seniors), and not designed for elderly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families under the broader meaning of this term, which formerly included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elderly families and disabled families.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Final Rule_Adoption of Interim Rule With Only Clarifying Changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed in the May 3, 1994 interim rule, subtitle D is very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prescriptive in establishing how the system of occupancy preferences is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operate (see 59 FR 22921&hyph;22922). Subtitle D establishes which section 8  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> housing projects are eligible for the election of preferences provided by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subtitle D. Subtitle D establishes that the ``elderly families'' eligible to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reside in covered section 8 housing projects for which the owner has made the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> election of preferences provided by subtitle D are those families who meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of ``elderly families'' as set forth in section 3(b) of the 1937 Act,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as amended by section 621 of the HCD Act of 1992. Subtitle D establishes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formula by which an owner will determine the number of units in the covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 8 housing project that must be reserved for occupancy by disabled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families who are not elderly or near-elderly. Subtitle D establishes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> secondary system of preferences available to owners if there are insufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numbers of elderly families and disabled families who are not elderly or near- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elderly to occupy all the units reserved for such. Subtitle D also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishes the procedures to be followed if units remain vacant after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner has elected to provide the secondary system of preferences, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures to be followed concerning the order of selection within groups to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whom a preference has been given. Given the statutory framework of the system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of preferences for elderly families authorized by subtitle D, most of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of the May 3, 1994 interim rule flow directly from the statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One provision in the May 3, 1994 interim rule that was not addressed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statute and added by regulation concerns the type of documentation that would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support an owner's claim that the owner's project was originally designed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primarily for occupancy by elderly families. In the May 3, 1994 interim rule,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HUD noted that with the exception of possible further changes to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision (to add additional types of documentation that should be included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the list) and possible clarifying changes, public comment would not alter the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions of the interim rule because of the prescriptive nature of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subtitle D.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule adopts the May 3, 1994 interim rule with eight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarifying changes, which are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The final rule clarifies that the election of elderly preference by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an owner of a covered section 8 housing project can be made at any time. (See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;880.612a(a)(1)(i), and comparable sections in other parts covered by this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The final rule codifies the guidance provided in the preamble to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> May 3, 1994 interim rule that states that where an election of an elderly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preference would have an adverse effect on non-elderly families on the waiting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> list, the owner is required to notify those families of the new policy (i.e.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the subtitle D system of preferences) and how this policy may affect them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (See new &sect;880.612a(a)(1)(iii), and comparable sections in other parts covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by this rule.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The final rule also codifies the preamble guidance that otherwise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualified families for a section 8 housing project, such as disabled families,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> near-elderly disabled families and families with children, who are on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waiting list for the project, cannot be removed from the list because of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner's election of an elderly preference. (See new &sect;880.612a(a)(1)(iv), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparable sections in other parts covered by this rule.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Suspended director of British Coal quits MR MALCOLM EDWARDS has resigned as commercial director of British Coal after 35 years with the company, he and British Coal announced last night. Mr Edwards, who warned last week that 80 per cent of pits will close if the government's energy policy continues, was suspended at the end of last year after disagreements with other coal chiefs. No reason was given for the resignation. A statement issued by Mr Edwards' solicitors and British Coal said the two sides had negotiated a 'mutually acceptable clean-break settlement and Mr Edwards will be resigning his position as a member of the board of the corporation on February 27 1992'. Neither Mr Edwards nor British Coal would comment on the terms of Mr Edwards' resignation package. According to industry commentators, Mr Edwards's stance was becoming increasingly embarrassing for the corporation and the government. Mr Edwards has been increasingly vocal in his defence of British Coal, which the government has earmarked for privatisation. He was re-appointed on a five-year contract by Mr John Wakeham, the energy secretary, last year and has argued he could be dismissed only by Mr Wakeham. After his suspension last year the corporation had said it lacked 'confidence in his commitment to the company or his ability to negotiate contracts with the electricity industry'. A conflict between Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, and Mr Edwards was exacerbated by the strong and public support for Mr Edwards in the coal and electricity industries. Critics of Mr Clarke, including the Commons energy committee, questioned the wisdom of suspending the company's most experienced negotiator as British Coal faced negotiation of critical contracts to sell coal to the electricity industry. These contracts will determine the future size of British Coal. Mr Michael Clark, energy committee chairman, asked Mr Wakeham to reinstate Mr Edwards earlier this month. There has been widespread speculation that Mr Neil Clarke wanted to oust Mr Edwards in order to pave the way for Mr Wakeham to arrange a deal between British Coal and the electricity industry which would not be very favourable to British Coal. On Monday plans to develop a main coal-importing centre were abandoned, lifting a substantial threat to the jobs of thousands of miners. The deep-water terminal at Immingham, on the Humber, had been expected to handle between 10m and 12m tonnes of imported coal a year.</p>

			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Palestinians celebrate a new era: Israelis withdraw from Jericho after 27 years of occupation Jubilant Palestinians hugged and kissed their new police force as it triumphantly entered Jericho yesterday after Israeli soldiers lowered the Star of David flag and formally quit the town after 27 years of occupation. The Palestinian police, in green uniforms and berets, arrived showing the victory sign and brandishing new AK-47 automatic rifles above their heads. Under the Palestinian self-rule accord, Jericho will become the seat of the new administration, which covers the area around the town and the Gaza Strip. In the main square, drivers honked their horns, cafe owners played loud music and boys waved the Palestinian flag and pictures of Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman. Jericho's residents mixed euphoria with near disbelief that the Israelis had really gone. Townspeople woke to find a vanguard of Palestinian policemen standing on the roof of the central police station, evacuated by the Israelis during the night. 'I nearly lost control of my car when I saw our Palestinian police there,' said Mr Isaac Shawa, a storekeeper. 'I thought I was still dreaming but then I realised it was true. 'I feel extremely happy. There is a real change on the ground and we can start to sleep peacefully and start a new life with our freedom. For us, Friday the 13th will always be a lucky day.' Just outside the town, trucks loaded with uniforms, boots, filing cabinets and furniture moved into Israel's former military camp. Brigadier Ismail Jabr, commander of the Jericho police force, promised Palestinians that he would govern them with democracy and law, and that from Jericho the PLO would one day enter Jerusalem. The 750-strong police force came from the Al-Aqsa brigade of the Palestine Liberation Army, based in Iraq, and the Badr brigade from Jordan. One officer said he had been in Basra, southern Iraq, during the Gulf War 'on operations'. Mr Mohamed Mahmoud, another policeman, said he had fought in Beirut in 1982, when the PLO was forced to withdraw from Lebanon, and in Tripoli in 1983 when some PLO fighters staged a mutiny against Mr Arafat. 'We want to rekindle the hope of our people after so many years of occupation,' he said, as he hugged relatives he had not seen for more than a decade. Policemen immediately started directing traffic and operating joint patrols with Israeli police in separate vehicles, as agreed under the self-rule accord. In Gaza, Israeli troops finished pulling out of Palestinian areas in the south of the Strip. Up to 20,000 supporters of the extremist Islamic Hamas Movement marched through Gaza City to welcome the Palestinian police but condemn the peace accord. Demonstrators hurled stones at remaining Israeli positions and troops opened fire wounding two. Israel says it will complete its pull out from Gaza by next Wednesday.

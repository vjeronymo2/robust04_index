			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian </F> Socialist Party, by Georg Hoffmann-Ostenhof and Gregor Mayer;  place and date not given: "I Ask You: Is This Liberal?"]    [Text] [PROFIL] Mr. Horn, are we talking to the future  prime minister of Hungary?    [Horn] I do not know. This question is of little concern to  me. We say that we do not commit ourselves to anything  regarding this question before we get the election result. If I  am correctly informed, there are 11 candidates for the office of  prime minister in this country. Why should we increase their  number?    [PROFIL] Over recent months your party has gained a degree  of popularity, which is surprising to many. Is it also  surprising to you?    [Horn] It makes one feel rather good. One sees that one's  own political work has meaning. We are dealing with questions  of the social restructuring of the economy, for which there is  no recipe and where we are treading on virgin soil. Nowhere in  the world is there an example of such rapid and massive  privatization. One must not deal with ideologies in this  matter. We decided the ideological issues during the second  half of the 1980's when we passed laws on the multiparty  parliamentary system and urged associated membership in the  European Community and when I stated at the beginning of 1990  that Hungary's security would be ensured within the framework of  NATO.    [PROFIL] Four or five years ago most people would have  assumed that the long communist rule would give rise to a long  political quarantine for the Communist Parties and their  successor organizations. Would you have believed at that time  that you would get close to power so quickly again?    [Horn] Why do you use the term "Communist Party"? This is a  term that is used by the right. I just want to remind you that  on 7 October 1989 we founded the Hungarian Socialist Party  (MSZP). This party broke with the old state party, not only in  ideological and political terms but also in practice.  Therefore, I reject the adjective "communist," even though I  have never denied that I was a communist. But one can develop  also in this region, and not only in the West.    [PROFIL] Let us turn to the future. You have an economic  program that is expressly liberal on economics. In the  Socialist International you would be on the far right wing.    [Horn] This statement is not correct. Why should a program  be liberal that says that one must no longer place the burdens  of restructuring more or less one-sidedly on those who earn  wages and salaries. Is a program liberal that calls for equal  opportunities, that gives the state a greater role in the social  field? I ask you: Is this liberal?    [PROFIL] So your party is not liberal. Is there anything on  which you agree with the liberals, with whom you want to form a  coalition?    [Horn] On the fact that the economy is in a disastrous  situation. On the fact that the entrepreneurs are suffering  under enormous taxes and burdens. However, this is also in  harmony with the political ideas of the Socialist International.    [PROFIL] Thus, you would say that a government with  socialist participation would be better for Hungarian  entrepreneurs than a new edition of the current conservative  government?    [Horn] Look, the majority of entrepreneurs have clearly  indicated that they support the MSZP. For two reason: First,  they want competent people in the government and, second, they  want a predictable government policy.    [PROFIL] Is this support from the entrepreneurs also due to  the fact that some former communists have become capitalists?    [Horn] The majority of communists did not join us. Those  who had middle-echelon posts in the former state party founded  small shareholding companies; they are not the owners or  managing directors of large companies.    [PROFIL] In all the eastern Central European countries there  is the problem of how one can get out of the mess. Do you think  that the privatization of the Hungarian economy must be slowed  down or accelerated....    [Horn] It is not the speed that is the essential thing. In  implementing privatization we would do two things in a  fundamentally different way: First, we would once again make  privatization subject to parliamentary control and, second, the  point is not how much money a company is sold for -- the revenue  is mostly used to close gaps in the budget anyway -- but that  the new owner invests in modernization, preserves jobs, or  creates them. The usual practice with the European Community  is, however, that the company is closed down, the workers are  dismissed, and the goods of the new owner stream into the  country. Thus, in most cases a market is bought up, not just a  company.    [PROFIL] Prime Minister Antall reportedly said on his death  bed: "Only a Christian Hungary has a future." What kind of  Hungary has a future, in your view?    [Horn] I was not present at Antall's death and, therefore, I  cannot judge what he said. However, I know very well that most  states in Europe do not define themselves as Christina  countries. I believe that Christians and non-Christians,  believers and non- believers, Hungarians and non-Hungarians all  have their place in this country. Today it almost looks as if  those who are not Christians, who are not believers, are a kind  of second-class citizens. This is nonsense and has nothing to  do with a European attitude.</p>

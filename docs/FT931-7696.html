			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Andersen Consulting UK fee income rises by 25% ANDERSEN Consulting yesterday reported fee income up 25 per cent to Pounds 215m in the year to December 31 1992. Revenues worldwide rose to Pounds 1.7bn in the same period. In common with other accountancy firms and consultants, Andersen refused to provide details of its profits. Mr Keith Burgess, UK managing partner, said: 'The industry average (of profits) is 10-12 per cent. We are at the high end, but margins are under pressure.' He said that about four fifths of revenues came from professional billings. Most of the remainder - with slightly lower margins - came from outsourcing, by which the firm takes over the direct running of clients' computer systems. Aside from outsourcing, the firm said other fast-growing divisions were financial services and utilities. He admitted that the revenues included any hardware or other goods and services bought-in on behalf of clients he said this only amounted to about 4 per cent of revenues. 'We think we're doing remarkably well in difficult circumstances,' said Mr Burgess. Andersen's professional staff rose from 1.790 in 1991 to 2,125 last year.</p>

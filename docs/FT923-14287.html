			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Personal View: Preaching pragmatism to free trade church The free trade church is in need of a Reformation. Consider Britain's recent history. From the first impact of Honda's arrival to the death of the British motorbike industry was about a decade. By the time colour tele-visions and cars began to come from Japan the UK had learnt its lesson. It trumped up charges of dumping to justify punitive tariffs, and thereby pushed the Japanese into VERs - 'voluntary' export restrictions. They responded - resentfully and reluctantly - by manufacturing inside the UK market. The result: Britain now has flourishing colour television and car industries. True, sad things have happened to British companies in those industries. But they would have happened anyway - faster and more brutally - under free trade. And at least a very large chunk of the value-adding activity which goes into making our cars and televisions takes place in the UK and generates labour incomes in the UK. As for the capital income - who gets the profits - British insurance companies and pension funds long ago shifted their investments out of British car manufacturers and into Toyota and Nissan. British bureaucrats had stumbled on a sensible and pragmatic form of protectionism. But how will the economist high priests of the free trade orthodoxy describe it? As the unprincipled and self-defeating expediency of short-sighted politicians. They will tell you precisely how much extra this protectionism makes us pay for our cars; how big the extra profits of Nissan and British Rover. What they will not tell you is how much of the 'consumer surplus' yielded by cheaper cars would have been mopped up in unemployment pay, or how many fewer pounds we would have had for spending on cars if the car industry had gone the way of the motorbike industry. The high priests of free trade frequently pretend to despise such a self-centred single country calculation. Has world GNP been increased or diminished by British protectionism? The answer is it has probably increased. Thanks to the chicanery of anti-dumping tariffs, less of the Japanese surplus has been channelled into buying US Treasury bonds and real est-ate, more into direct overseas investment, thereby doing more to add to world efficiency by diffusing their work practices around the world. Suppose we did reform the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to allow for such sensible pragmatism. What might it mean in practice? First, it would mean dropping all the provisions which allow protectionist measures to be justified by charges of dumping or hidden subsidies. (But not those that allow developing countries to protect infant industries to gain learning time.) Anti-trust prosecution of predatory pricing can still continue - without discrimination between imported and domestically produced goods. Second, introduce a new concept: Investment Inviting Import Quantity Restrictions (IIIQRs). These do not, like anti-dumping actions, say: 'You are cheats and we are going to block your imports.' They say: 'You are clearly more efficient than us. But we don't want to lose the industry. We shall import only a certain number of your widgets per year for the next ten years. But by all means come and manufacture here. We shall give you all the facilities available to domestic start-ups, though we shall insist on enhanced phased-in local content rules.' The conditions for IIIQRs should be defined tightly in the Gatt - in terms of an industry's share in GNP, its multiplier effects on the economy, the growth rate of import penetration, and so on - taking care, probably by some measure of labour-intensitivity, that IIIQRs cannot be used against developing countries' attempts to escape poverty by trading on their sole - cheap labour - advantage. What are the implications of such a Lutheran shift, making free trade no longer absolute virtue, and discrimination no longer absolute vice? An end to the most poisonous feature of our current hypocritical orthodoxy; the fact that the way to practice (frequently sensible) protection is by calling a trading partner a cheat. It takes experts to expose the dishonest chicanery of anti-dumping suits. But every newspaper reader can see how unhealthy Japan-bashing is for US politics, let alone international relations. Japanese firms would come to Europe, not resentful at being bludgeoned by charges of unfairness, but flattered at the acknowledgement of their solid competitive strengths. They would be more ready to comply honestly with local content rules. Acceptance that discrimination against states with an inbuilt structural surplus is legitimate - as Keynes argued in the 1940s when it was the US which was the obvious target for discrimination . Such discrimination is a recognition that we live in a world community - just as the universal practice of progressive taxation which discriminates against the wealthy is a recognition that the nation is a community. To be sure, there are problems with these proposals. IIIQRs protect industries not the existing domestic firms' in an industry. Unfortunately, it is existing companies which finance pressure group lobbies and political parties, and often actually believe that the Japanese win by cheating and not by exercise of the solid Victorian virtues of thrift, diligence, long-term planning and managerial efficiency. Reform needs politicians with the Lutheran toughness to resist the lobbies. Orthodox beliefs are powerful. Free trade orthodoxy rests partly on ideals, partly on theory. As for ideals, accelerating investment through IIIQRs shows an even stronger spirit of internationalism. As for trade theory, the bankruptcy of the comparative advantage paradigm with its assumptions of competitive markets and 'undistorted' prices is apparent even to some of its high priests. A world in which one country's export drive can destroy another country's industry in the space of half a decade is no longer the world in which Ricardo developed his theory of comparative advantage.

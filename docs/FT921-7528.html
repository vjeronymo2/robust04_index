			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Arts: Christopher Hollyday - Ronnie Scott's It is easy to feel cast down at the prospect of hearing another implausibly young, yet skilled, jazzman. There are a lot of them around. These fresh-faced things front festivals, make record deals and wear Armani suits before they have got the chops in. They appear self-confident and can read all right, but they do not sound interesting - yet. It is a comfort then to find Christopher Hollyday, from Norwood Massachusetts, walking uncertainly to the stand and looking every inch the nervy 22 year old, before blowing with the abandon a young man should. This skinny altoist, who has yet to grow into his suit jacket, started on the sax at the age of nine, according to his biog, and had most of Bird's solos down before the onset of puberty. By 15 he had cut an album on his own (sic) Jazzbeat label and at eighteen was recording with seasoned pianist Cedar Walton and drummer Billy Higgins behind him. Awkwardness aside - he refers to Ronnie's smoky club as a 'performance centre' - the shy demeanour evaporates as he puts the reed to his lips and tears headlong into 'Scorpio Rising', a cut from The Natural Moment (Novus/BMG), his most recent recording. What he lacks in hot-house technique Hollyday more than compensates for in sour-toned strength - it is said that his hard bop playing has been tinged by Jackie McLean and he has a similar flawed beauty in his phrasing. But his real appeal lies less in the influences of McLean and Parker and more in the reckless lack of restraint shown with even pretty tunes like 'September in the rain' and a bittersweet ''Round midnight'. A substantial and galloping rhythm section in Ritchie Goods (string bass) and Ron Savage (drums) gives Hollyday impetus and hardworking pianist Anthony Wonsey's sparkling right hand adds again to the excitement in numbers like McCoy Tyner's 'Exotique' or his own 'A treaty of jazz'. A bit of greased and greasy lightning, Hollyday's pitching alto is a welcome contrast to the flatness of so many young fogies painted as young turks by their record companies. It would be as well to hear him before he starts relaxing. A bonus at this week's residency is the ample and often bawdy blues shouting of American Irene Reid. More, er, experienced than Hollyday, her raucous tale of Long John the dentist is a fine complement to the saxophonist's blushing impetuosity.</p>

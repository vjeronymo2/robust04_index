			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Athens, April 12 (TANJUG) -- Greek Defence Minister  Yerasimos Arsenis said Tuesday [12 April] that Greek crews,  objecting to NATO air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions near  Gorazde, would no longer fly NATO AWACS planes.    Following a general staff meeting which has been in session  overnight, Arsenis said that Greece would withdraw its only  warship from the Adriatic if NATO marines became engaged in NATO  actions against Bosnian Serbs.    He said that AWACS planes were not flying out of the NATO  base in Aktio in northwestern Greece and that they had all been  transferred to the NATO base in Aviano, Italy.    On April 10-11, NATO warplanes launched air strikes on  Bosnian Serb positions near Gorazde, after Serb forces had  crushed a Moslem offensive, mounted in early March from the  "safe area" of Gorazde, which should have been demilitarized  last spring.    However, Greek opposition parties found Greece's  disassociation with the NATO action against Bosnian Serbs as  insufficient and urged the government, despite Greece's NATO  membership, to intervene promptly to avert the flaring up of the  Bosnian conflict.    The United Left, the Communist Party of Greece and the  Political Spring party said there was no justification for the  NATO attack on Bosnian Serbs and added that it only served to  the intrests of the West.    A conservative, New Democracy Party leader Miltiadis Evert  late on Monday urged that Greece, currently holding the rotating  presidency of the European Union (E.U.), should interfere with  the European allies to help stop NATO actions in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

During the informal Council, they assessed the state of the  negotiating mandate with Switzerland. The European ministers  feel in particular that "the debate on the issue of the transit  of Community vehicles weighing more than 28 tonnes must be  resumed."    The draft negotiating mandate drawn up by the Commission in  Brussels on 16 September will be submitted for the approval of  the Twelve by 18 April, said European Transportation  Commissioner Abel Matutes. The Greek minister said there was  "clear resistance from Switzerland concerning the transit  problem and the problem of flexibility regarding the matter of  the 40-tonne trucks."    "However," continued the Greek minister, "Switzerland's  presence in the European Economic Area [EEA] is absolutely  essential." According to him, "the issue must be revitalized and  a standstill must be avoided." "We therefore endeavored," he  concluded, "to select the positive points where there is a  convergence of views in order to resume the dialogue with  Switzerland so that the geographical area of Switzerland would  indeed become an integral part of the EEA."    Most of the participants in Athens asked Switzerland to  relax  its regulations in order to make it possible to increase the  number of trucks that benefit from an exception to the 40-tonne  trucks. For Greece, which is currently EU president, Bern must  make concessions. In Swiss diplomatic circles in Athens, the  emphasis is being placed on participants' desire to avoid a  confrontation with Bern.  <H5>  Negotiating Mandate </H5>   "I am completely in favor of resolving the Swiss issue once  and for all," the European transportation commissioner told ATS.  "Today, I noted the willingness of all the member states to  conclude the matter and to give the Commission the negotiating  mandate for a transportation agreement with Switzerland."    In September, the European Commission proposed draft  negotiating guidelines. According to this text, the negotiations  should mainly pursue two objectives: obtaining more openness  from Switzerland for European trucks weighing 40 tonnes, and  facilities for Alpine transit. In exchange, Swiss airlines and  long distance trucks will be able to gain access to the European  transportation market.    For the EU, the sectorial negotiations with Switzerland are  part of an overall approach. The negotiators will have to seek  out a balance on a sector-by-sector basis, as well as globally.  It is understood that a transportation agreement will only be  able to enter into force at the same time as an agreement on the  free movement of workers.</p>

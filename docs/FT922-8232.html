			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: SFO becomes involved as MTM reveals Pounds 20.6m pre-tax deficit THE SERIOUS Fraud Office has become involved in the investigation into MTM, the specialist chemicals company where the share price collapsed in March leading to the resignation of Mr Richard Lines, founder chairman, and the finance director. A report by Binder Hamlyn, MTM's auditors, is to be forwarded to the SFO, probably by next week. Mr Ken Schofield, chief executive, who took over from Mr Lines 10 days ago, said the SFO's position is that it wanted to look at the report following a Stock Exchange insider trading investigation into the company. The Binder Hamlyn report reveals transactions that were 'incorrectly recorded' last year and in 1990 which boosted sales and possibly profits. During 1991, Mr Lines sold 3.3m shares at over 200p, a price that analysts believe would not have prevailed had the revised figures reported yesterday been available at the time. Yesterday's long-awaited 1991 results were worse than expected. On an unaudited basis, pre-tax and pre-exceptional profits for 1991 were Pounds 5.14m, down from Pounds 9.75m the previous year. This 1990 figure was itself revised down from Pounds 13.5m to take account of the questionable transactions. Mr Schofield said these transactions involved MTM selling chemicals to a bank at the year-end and recording them as sales. He would not say how much similar transactions affected sales and profits last year but said there were 'a whole raft of items.' In addition, MTM has taken a Pounds 25.7m exceptional item. This included a Pounds 17.5m provision to revalue assets to true market value. As a result, pre-tax losses were Pounds 20.6m, down from an adjusted Pounds 7.9m on sales of Pounds 104m. The company also incurred an interest charge of Pounds 7.39m on debt that ended the year at Pounds 85m but which has subsequently grown to Pounds 109m. Debt rose partly to reverse Pounds 7.1m of sales which were taken last year and should have fallen in 1992.</p>

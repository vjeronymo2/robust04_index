			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / SFO seeks two men who fled with Nadir: Officials 'gnash teeth at borders' DETECTIVES FROM the Serious Fraud Office want to question two UK businessmen, Mr Peter Dimond and Mr David Hamilton, who are living in northern Cyprus after flying there with Mr Asil Nadir. Mr Dimond, a former aircraft dealer, this week described how he helped Mr Nadir jump his Pounds 3m bail by flying to Beauvais in France, where they were met by a Cessna Citation jet which flew them to northern Cyprus. Mr Hamilton has been identified as having at least a part interest in the US-registered Cessna Citation. Mr Dimond and Mr Hamilton were on the plane with Mr Nadir when it landed in Kyrenia on May 4. Mr Michael Hamlin, owner of Hamlin Jets, which manages the Citation, yesterday said Mr Hamilton had been a 'co-owner' of the plane for three years. He confirmed Mr Hamilton had been on board. He said that two other passengers, Mr Timothy Lambon, a Zimbabwean, and Mr Anthony Sawyer had also been on board. The SFO also wants to question them. Mr Hamlin said yesterday the jet had not flown directly to Beauvais, as originally thought, but had spent a night in Dinard, France. He said he had been unaware of the purpose of the flight. Mr Dimond said in Cyprus yesterday he had no intention of returning to England to face police questioning. 'If you were in my shoes would you go back?' he said. 'The police can come here and question me here. There is nothing to stop me talking to them. But they know they can do nothing.' Asked about possible extradition, he said that so far the Turkish Cypriot authorities had left him alone, adding he did not know the status of his stay on the island. Foreign Office officials indicated that efforts to secure Turkey's help in having Mr Nadir and British citizens linked to his escape brought back to the UK remained deadlocked. The growing frustration felt by British officials was summed up by a senior detective last night: 'We are sitting at the borders, champing and gnashing our teeth, but there is very little we can do.' Police hope Mr Dimond will eventually return to England voluntarily to rejoin his wife and family in his Hampshire home. Under UK law anyone who helps a financial fugitive to jump bail faces a potential prison term of anything up to five years.</p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> COMMERCIAL TV IN CLASS 'BAD DEAL' FOR SCHOOLS, HONIG SAYS IN ANAHEIM  </P> <P> State schools Supt. Bill Honig today delivered a negative report card for  Channel 1, a controversial, satellite-delivered television show that introduced  commercials into the classroom.  </P> <P> "Our students' minds aren't for sale," Honig said in Anaheim as he announced  that public schools would not be allowed to collect state money for the time  that students spent watching the commercial television.  </P> <P> Whittle Communications had introduced a pilot program into five schools  nationwide, including Gahr High School in Cerritos. The five-week pilot program  ended in April. Students watched a 12-minute news and public affairs program  that included two minutes of commercials for such products as Snickers, Levis  and Ford automobiles.  </P> <P> "California law protects our youngsters against forced commercialization in  school," Honig said. "On the whole, it's a bad deal for kids, a bad deal for  education, and it sets a terrible precedent."  </P> <P> Honig and Betty Lindsey, president of the California PTA, said they believe  that California is the first state to take a position against Whittle's plan to  expand its program nationwide.  </P></p>

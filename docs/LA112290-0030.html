			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY  </P> <P> MORE EATERIES:  </P> <P> Watson's Drug &amp; Soda Fountain, 116 E. Chapman Ave., Orange.  </P> <P> Open Mondays through Fridays 6:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Saturdays 5:30 p.m. to 4  p.m. (714) 532-6315. This diner/drugstore in the heart of Old Towne Orange is a  real throwback. True, the bobby-soxers are gone and the drugstore no longer  fills prescriptions for whiskey, but the malts still come thick, rich and big  enough to share, and meals are the kind mom might've made.

			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> IT'S SHAKESPEARE AS YOU LIKE IT -- FREE OF CHARGE  </P> <P> Sometimes, the best things in life really can be free.  </P> <P> And, if you count Shakespeare as among those best things, then you are in luck.  </P> <P> In San Diego this summer, free weekend performances of two Shakespeare  productions are being presented: a classically costumed "Romeo and Juliet" by  the Spring Valley-based Octad-One Productions and a raucous, modern-robed "A  Midsummer Night's Dream" by the Naked Shakespeare Company, a subdivision of the  Ruse Performance Gallery downtown.  </P> <P> Neither company is professional, but both clearly care about the work they are  doing and both present community theater with a healthy emphasis on community  by using local actors.  </P> <P> For some of these actors, this is their first chance to perform Shakespeare.  But they get audiences, here; so far this summer, locals have been turning out  in the hundreds for each weekend show.  </P> <P> Both productions take place outdoors -- Octad-One's is in the amphitheatre  outside the East County Performing Arts Center and Ruse Performance Gallery's  is in Alcazar Gardens in Balboa Park -- are high-spirited and virtually devoid  of props. Without scenery, there are no scene breaks; the plays run swiftly and  smoothly without intermissions. The attentive and appreciative audiences need  no reservations, and people tend to bring their own chairs and blankets as well  as pizzas, Chicken McNuggets and other picnic goodies. The audiences are all  ages, and dress is casual -- T-shirts, sandals and jeans. Little children have  been seen with Cabbage Patch dolls in tow.  </P> <P> Octad-One, now in its 10th year, has found a magical place to present what it  calls its Shakespeare-by-the-Lake. The shows begin at 6:30 p.m. on Saturdays  and Sundays through Aug. 26, so they get their principal lighting first from  the sun and then, as the sky darkens, from a spotlight that begins to shine in  time for the young lovers' moonlight balcony speech.  </P> <P> The set design is by none other than Mother Nature; trees and a lake act as  backdrop, often enhanced by a gentle breeze.  </P> <P> As directed by Martin F. Gerrish, president and founder of Octad-One, the  production emphasizes the innocence and youth of the principal players.  </P> <P> Romeo and Juliet, here, are literally high school-aged; Morgan Brown, who plays  Romeo, is still a student at Granite Hills High School and Alexandra Auckland,  who plays Juliet, just graduated this year.  </P> <P> If the two are not expert at the subtleties of characterization, they do  succeed in capturing the aching loveliness of teen-agers groping to understand  the passions ruling them. This production makes it hard to forget that Juliet  is only 13 in the play.  </P> <P> More mature performers are here, too, to give balance to the show, particularly  Don Pugh as a forceful and charismatic Mercutio, and Bruce Erricson as the  anxious Friar Laurence. Jane Hopf earns her share of laughs as Juliet's  ever-pragmatic nurse.  </P> <P> Mark Butler's sound design romanticizes the mood with gentle incidental music.  The fight choreography by Donald Pugh lends an authentic feeling of danger. The  director's wife, Elaine Gerrish, designed the lovely period costumes. And the  company, in its program, provides a synopsis of the play.  </P> <P> Ruse Performance Gallery is presenting "A Midsummer Night's Dream" in modern  dress -- colorful exercise stretch tights and skirts for the women, with shorts  and T-shirts for the young men. It's the first of what director Christopher R  hopes will become an annual free Shakespeare presentation by The Naked  Shakespeare Company.  </P> <P> As in the Octad-One production, the Naked Shakespeare company benefits from its  setting. In the Alcazar Gardens in Balboa Park, the play begins at 4:30 p.m.  Sundays through Sept. 23, with one Saturday performance Sept. 1. It is a woodsy  grotto that needs no props to conjure up the forest in which the lovers lose  themselves. And, happily, the company provides blankets for the audience to sit  on.  </P> <P> Christopher R succeeds best when he fosters the natural enthusiasm of his  company. The exercise outfits, for example, encourage a welcome playfulness in  the actors.  </P> <P> The production falters when ideas appear that are not carried through. What is  the point of having Theseus bring in an angry Hippolyta in chains? There is no  transition between that scene and the later scenes where she is in love with  Theseus.  </P> <P> But this is a minor distraction in what is largely a high-spirited,  entertaining romp through the story of four mismatched lovers who go "into the  woods" and find everything made right again.  </P> <P> The cast, like that in Octad-One, is a mix of those new to Shakespeare and  those familiar with it. Andy Wynn, a sadly under used local actor, stands out  as Oberon, the fairy king, who sets things right. Cindy A. Lu, as Oberon's  messenger sprite, Puck, has some genuinely funny moments. So does Murray  Stanley as Nick Bottom, the weaver. The young lovers are a green but appealing  lot, with Lee Allison making a vivid mark as Helena, the ultimate woman who  loves too much.  </P> <P> The overall feeling is unpretentious. The actors scamper up and down the walls  in the park with abandon, and their high spirits are infectious.  </P> <P> Christopher R said he last used the Alcazar Gardens space 15 years ago when he  was the co-founder of Indian Magique, the company that was the precursor of the  San Diego Repertory Theatre.  </P> <P> To the appreciative audience that numbered about 250 Sunday night, it was a  happy return.  </P> <P> "There is no reason that journeymen and apprentices can't take on a full  Shakespeare," he said after the show. "This is a street theater version of  'Dream.' In a way it helps to have naivete, because then you don't know you  can't do it."  </P> <P> Although there is no charge for either show, contributions are accepted after  each performance.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By 'Awdah 'Awdah; all quotation marks as published] </F>   [Excerpt] Major General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya, deputy  head of the Palestinian delegation and chairman of the Security  Committee in the self-rule negotiations, has said that "a  meeting will be held in Cairo this week between President  'Arafat and the Palestinian delegation to the self-rule  negotiations to assess the most recent phase of negotiations and  lay the main guidelines for a new negotiating strategy."    In an exclusive statement to AL-RA'Y in Amman one hour  before  departing for Cairo yesterday morning, Maj. Gen. al-Yahya added  that "in view of the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, it has been  necessary to reconsider the Palestinian negotiating strategy."  He said that "suspending the negotiations does not mean ending  them but temporarily stopping them to conduct a comprehensive  study in light of recent developments, reports by the  Palestinian envoys in Paris, London, and Washington, and a  possible Security Council resolution."    Maj. Gen. al-Yahya, who was commander-in-chief of the  Palestine Liberation Army, added that "negotiations are the only  way to achieve the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza Strip and the  Jericho area, but we need new concepts."    Asked about moving the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations to  Washington, al-Yahya said that "the main factor is not the venue  of negotiations but the real attitude toward implementing the  Declaration of Principles without any obstacles, particularly on  the part of the Israeli side." He added that "moving the  negotiations to Washington poses no problem for the Palestinian  side. If the negotiations resume, we hope that the final  results will be achieved in the shortest possible time."    Al-Yahya revealed that "the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre  deferred  an "urgent meeting" which the Palestinian-Israeli Security  Coordination Committee was about to hold to explore the Israeli  withdrawal and make arrangements for the Palestinian police  entry to the Jericho area and Gaza Strip and their deployment  and duties."

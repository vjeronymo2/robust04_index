			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / British PM seeking to draw E European countries to EC AN initiative to establish a framework of political co-operation between the European Community and the three Visegrad countries - Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia - will be signalled next week by Mr John Major during a visit to central Europe. To underscore his commitment to their eventual membership of the EC, Mr Major plans to invite the three to a joint meeting with Community leaders after Britain assumes the presidency in July. The aim is to reassure them that the association and trade liberalisation agreements they have already signed with Brussels will be quickly followed by a much broader framework of co-operation. Mr Major will meet leaders of the three countries during visits next week to Warsaw, Prague and Bratislava, and Budapest. The trip, his first abroad since his general election victory last month, is intended to demonstrate a personal commitment to intensified political links between the EC and central Europe. It also fits neatly with one of Mr Major's domestic political priorities - to show Britain will lead in promoting a wider, more liberal Community. One idea under discussion in Whitehall is that the heads of state of the three countries should attend the EC summit in Edinburgh in December. Mr Major is expected to raise the possibility during his talks next week with Presidents Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia, Lech Walesa of Poland, and Jozsef Antall of Hungary. Mr Major wants to assure the Visegrad countries that the time-scale of up to 10 years envisaged for EC membership does not preclude a closer relationship in the short term. France and Germany yesterday supported the early enlargement of the EC to include members of the European Free Trade Association, and urged that membership negotiations should start as soon as possible, Ian Davidson writes from La Rochelle. At the end of a two-day summit in La Rochelle, President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl said their two governments welcomed the candidacies of those Efta countries - Austria, Sweden and Finland - which have applied to join the Community. The two leaders also formalised their decision to set up a Franco-German corps of some 35,000 men, to be operational in 1995. They said the new unit would contribute to giving the European Union its own military capacity, and called on the other members of the nine-nation Western European Union defence grouping to join. They rejected US criticisms that the unit would undermine the Atlantic Alliance.</p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: Karstadt warns of 'marked fall' in profits Karstadt, Germany's biggest retail group, yesterday warned there would be a 'marked fall' in profits for the year because of stagnant consumer demand, writes Michael Lindemann in Bonn. The group said turnover had risen 30.8 per cent to DM19.4bn (Dollars 12.48bn) in the first nine months of the year following the takeover of Hertie, the country's third-biggest retailer. Sales at Karstadt itself fell 5.8 per cent to DM8.45bn, while Hertie's turnover dropped 2.8 per cent to DM3.27. Karstadt's travel services were virtually the only sectors able to report sales increases. While most of the German economy is pulling out of its worst post-war recession, retailers have yet to benefit. Next year is not expected to improve because of new taxes and a national pay round which is not seen as likely to boost wages significantly.</p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / (CORRECTED) Arts: A Method of satire - Theatre Correction (published 4th May 1991) appended to this article. BLACK SNOW, which opened at the National's Cottesloe Theatre on Thursday, is the funniest and cleverest new play I have seen for a very long time. If anyone says that you need to know something about Mikhail Bulgakov's theatrical novel of the same name, forget it. Keith Dewhurst's dramatisation stands in its own right. Anyone who likes the whole idea of acting and directing should love Black Snow. For a start, William Gaskill's production is full of wonderful performances, at least three of which are exceptional. Bulgakov (1891-1940) was a successful Russian writer, though he ran into problems with Stalin. He wrote his slightly bitter, but overall comic, novel about his experience of the Moscow Arts Theatre and, in particular, of the director, Konstantin Sergeyevich Stanislavsky. The novel was not published in the Soviet Union, or indeed anywhere else, until 1965. Stanislavsky was the arch proponent of the method school of acting. That is all you need to know. Black Snow is a satire about the theatre in general - or any institution that has become too grand to laugh at its own follies. The Stanislavsky figure is Ivan Vassilevich, played by Robin Bailey. He is very old, very dignified: feared rather than loved. When he enters the theatre for a rehearsal, the cast stand up and applaud. He distorts texts to make them fit his own idea of the character. Sometimes he has characters written out altogether because of his own prejudices. It also emerges that his theatre can no longer stage modern plays because modern plays are written about young people and the founding members of the company have grown too old to play them. Bailey's performance is utterly commanding. We see him conducting rehearsals and occasionally playing a role to demonstrate a point. There is an unforgettable scene where he sends for a bicycle so that a character can ride it round it round stage in a way that shows he is passionately in love. This is real method and Bailey is both master and tyrant. Other outstanding contributions come from Ron Cook as Maksudov (alias Bulgakov), the writer, and Elizabeth Bradley as Stanislavsky's secretary. Cook plays the part of the baffled outsider, whose drama is not performed in the way he wishes, to perfection. There is a touch - presumably deliberate - of Joseph K in Kafka's The Trial as he is overwhelmed by other people. He usually has to silence his own intelligence, though sometimes he hits out: 'You can't act. If you could act, you wouldn't need a method,' he says of one of the females. Ms Bradley has one gem of a scene: Although hysterical a few moments earlier, she takes down the text of the play immaculately on her typewriter while simultaneously dealing with the telephone and the stars. Other parts are played uniformly well. There is some marvellous business, too, when a mad actress chases a mad cat and the cat runs up the curtains. All theatrical bitchiness is there. Correction (published 4th May 1991). In my review of Black Snow at the Cottesloe in last Saturday's paper, the role of one of the secretaries at the Moscow Arts Theatre was attributed to Elizabeth Bradley rather than Gillian Barge. There are two secretaries in the play, both of whom play other parts as well and both are uniformly excellent. Apologies to Ms Bradley and Ms Barge for any confusion.</p>

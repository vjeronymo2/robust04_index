			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / People: Talking and walking like a retailer Following an internal reorganisation designed to sharpen its retailing skills, Post Office Counters has brought in Mike Flanagan to the new board position of network director. A marketing man who has worked with Gateways, BP, Lenscrafters and Wickes, he is the only one of the six-man board who has been recruited into his current position from outside. Post Office Counters, which runs 20,000 post offices and hence claims to be the largest retail network chain in Europe, has been slimming down its head office and transferring more accountability to retail network managers. Under the new structure, each board member also has line management responsibilities for one or more regions, with Flanagan looking after the South East and Scotland and Northern Ireland. Much of Flanagan's new network job had previously been performed by an operations director. Flanagan, 44, says his aim is to dispel the 'feel of going into a government office. We have 19,000 independent dealers; we need to get them to start using the vocabulary of shopkeepers not civil servants. They have to start talking, then walking, like retailers.' In the last decade, Flanagan has moved about a bit. From an advertising background, he became marketing director of Fine Fare and Gateway in the mid 1980's before moving across to BP in 1987, where he was manager of merchandise retailing. During his three years he set up convenience stores at several hundred European petrol stations and sharpened up merchandising standards in others, in Europe, the US, and South East Asia. He was briefly managing director of Lenscrafters in the UK, but was edged out when the company hit the recession in its home US market, and sent an American over to run the UK side. He then became marketing and buying director of Wickes Building Supplies, but fell out with his managing director six months ago. He intends to stay at the Post Office, however. 'I'd be amazed if I were not here for the rest of the century.'</p>

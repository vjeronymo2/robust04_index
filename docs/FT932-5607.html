			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Moscow closes in on western satellite deal RUSSIA has won half the battle to enter the west's lucrative commercial satellite launch market but must now get the west Europeans to endorse its deal with the Americans allowing it two space launches a year up to the year 2000. Having decided to make market access for Russia a key priority after the US-Russian summit in Vancouver, the US has agreed in principle for Russia to conduct 12 launches until the end of the century to try to help its impoverished space industry. In order not to undercut western companies, Russia would commit itself to charging prices which were no more than 7.5 per cent cheaper than comparable western launches. The market for launching telecommunications satellites into space is dominated by western Europe's Arianespace, which fears its business could be wiped out by cheap Russian launches on high-quality Proton rockets. It is therefore trying to impose quotas and price floors. The US is involved because it can withhold export licences for mainly US-built satellites which are to be shipped to Russia for launching. The simmering trade war between the US and the EC has made it impossible to hammer out a tripartite agreement. Instead Russia is having to negotiate separately with the Americans and the Europeans. Mr Valentin Kozyrev, a Russian space agency official, said: 'We are not satisfied by the quotas offered by the Europeans. We want to get closer to the agreement reached with the Americans.' He declined however to spell out the differences. Russia and the US want a bilateral agreement to be ready for signing when Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, meets Vice-President Al Gore at the end of June. It is not clear however when a similar agreement might be reached with the Europeans, although one west European diplomat said this would be soon since everybody was in a hurry to show goodwill to Russia as it struggles with economic reforms. The issue is likely to be raised during talks starting in Moscow today between the Russian government and Sir Leon Brittan, the EC commissioner responsible for negotiating a partnership agreement with Russia, as well as for handling the EC's international trade negotiations. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, is expected to arrive in Moscow today to urge the Russian government to speed up progress on economic reforms and prepare for the G7 summit in Tokyo.</p>

			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GLOBAL PANEL WANTS U.S. TO SHELTER REFUGEES  </P> <P> An international commission today urged nations that oppose the forced  repatriation of Vietnamese boat people to establish and finance refugee centers  on their own soil.  </P> <P> One delegate said the call was aimed at countries like the United States, which  has condemned Hong Kong for sending back Vietnamese refugees.  </P> <P> Thailand and Malaysia sponsored the statement, which was released at the  opening session of a conference of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees  committee on Indochinese refugees.  </P> <P> The statement was endorsed by all delegations except the United States and  Norway, which expressed reservations, conference sources said.  </P> <P> U.S. and Norwegian representatives believe that the statement should have  accentuated positive developments, like a decrease in the numbers leaving  Vietnam, said Herman Laurel, a member of the Philippine delegation.  </P> <P> "This is mostly directed at the U.S. and Vietnam," he said, adding that Asian  nations "took the initiative out of their frustration on the continuing  problem" of Indochinese who leave for economic and not political reasons.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the British government announced that it had suggested that the  United States take 9,000 Vietnamese boat people from Hong Kong and house them  in a special camp, possibly on the American island of Guam.  </P> <P> In the statement, so-called "countries of temporary refuge" -- those where boat  people land first -- urged Vietnam to take effective measures to prevent its  people from leaving their homeland illegally.  </P> <P> The statement said the repatriation of those not considered political refugees  was needed to prevent Asian nations from being flooded with Indochinese who do  not qualify for settlement in the United States or other third countries.  </P> <P> "There is an obligation on any country which opposes the repatriation of  non-refugees who do not volunteer (to return home) to offer an effective  intermediate solution, such as the setting up and financing on its own  territory a regional holding center for all non-refugees," the statement said.  </P></p>

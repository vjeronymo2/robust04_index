			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> JUSTICE;  </P> <P> LAW MAY PORTEND TOUGHER PUNISHMENT FOR JUVENILES;  </P> <P> OTHERS MIGHT FOLLOW MASSACHUSETTS' MOVE TO TRY SOME AS ADULTS.  </P> <P> In the late 1970s, responding to public outrage over a case in which a New York  City teen-ager was sentenced to only five years in detention for two brutal  subway murders, the state Legislature changed the way juveniles involved in  violent crimes were treated.  </P> <P> In what soon became a booming national trend toward "man-sized punishment for  man-sized crimes" over the next half decade, a host of states followed New  York's lead -- California and Florida among them.  </P> <P> One holdout was Massachusetts, which had pioneered a "rehabilitative" approach  to juvenile justice and saw no reason to join the crowd. Massachusetts  maintained its longstanding focus on community-based treatment for youthful  offenders and resisted having juveniles tried as adults.  </P> <P> But recently, in a move that many leading authorities on juvenile justice  contend signals an ominous turn of events in the rapidly rekindling national  debate over how society should handle violent juvenile offenders, the  Massachusetts Legislature adopted a "get tough" measure that makes it easier  for juveniles charged with murder to be prosecuted as adults.  </P> <P> Under the bill, which was signed into law last week by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis,  youths 14 to 17 who are charged with first- or second-degree murder will  automatically be required to have a hearing before a judge to determine whether  they should be transferred to adult court. The burden of proof will rest with  their defense -- not with prosecutors, as is now the case.  </P> <P> What makes the new Massachusetts law so portentous to many juvenile justice  specialists is that it comes at a time when violent crime by juveniles is on  the rise and many states have begun re-examining their juvenile justice  systems.  </P> <P> "Study after study has shown that these 'get tough' laws have no measurable  deterrent effect on juvenile crime and that the bulk of kids waived to adult  courts got lighter sentences than if they had remained in juvenile court," said  Barry Krisberg, president of the San Francisco-based National Council on Crime  and Delinquency.  </P> <P> In New York, for example, only 4% of juveniles tried as adults under the  stiffer provisions adopted in 1979 were given longer sentences than they would  have gotten in juvenile courts, according to a State University of New York  study.  </P> <P> Massachusetts, meanwhile, could boast of having some of the lowest rates of  juvenile crime and recidivism in the nation as testimony to its outlook on  treatment of juvenile lawbreakers. A recent study showed that only 23% of  Massachusetts' juvenile offenders were recommitted within three years,  contrasted with 62% in California.  </P> <P> But Massachusetts has not remained untouched by the dramatic growth in violent  crimes by juveniles that has afflicted much of the rest of the nation in recent  years. Over the past decade, the number of juveniles in Massachusetts charged  with murder has shot up from an average of three a year to 15 a year, for a  500% increase, much of it attributable to residents of drug-ridden inner-city  neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Then, on Halloween night this year, an incident occurred that paved the way for  the Legislature's recent action.  </P> <P> In a case that has drawn comparisons to last year's "wilding" attack on a  female jogger in New York's Central Park, a 26-year-old black woman, Kimberly  Rae Harbour, was savagely beaten, raped and murdered in Boston's Dorchester  neighborhood.  </P> <P> Eight youths, ages 15 to 19, were charged in the crime, but five are legally  considered juveniles.  </P> <P> Legislators and lobbyists, including many parents whose children have been  murdered by juveniles, hailed the bill.  </P> <P> But critics contend that it represents an ominous step backward for  Massachusetts.  </P> <P> Della Hughes, who is executive director of the National Network of Runaway and  Youth Services and co-chairs the Ad Hoc Coalition on Juvenile Justice, says  Massachusetts has adopted the "quick-fix, simple-solution approach" that the  nation increasingly is taking toward the whole array of mounting social  problems.  </P> <P> "Instead of addressing the root causes, like poverty and poor housing and lack  of education, we say: 'Let's lock them up,' " she said.  </P> <P> Gwendolyn Holden, executive vice president of the National Criminal Justice  Assn., sees the Massachusetts bill as another in the increasing number of signs  -- including the growing favor with which big-city mayors are looking upon  curfews as a means of curbing juvenile crime -- that "get tough" policies still  have appeal, as they did in the early '80s.  </P> <P> "I would say this issue is on the verge of a second coming," she said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOLIDARITY OFFERS REPRIEVE FOR REGIME'S ELECTION LOSS  </P> <P> The Solidarity trade union, flushed with its election victory over Poland's  ruling Communist coalition, said Tuesday that it is willing to allow the  government to restore or replace a special list of its candidates sent down to  defeat by an angry electorate.  </P> <P> But the union leadership stood firm on its refusal to enter into a coalition  government with the Communists, arguing that Solidarity had competed in  national elections as an opposition party and could not surrender that role.  </P> <P> The official tallies from Sunday's voting were still not completed, but the  government and a spokesman for the Communist Party coalition acknowledged that  their ticket had been overwhelmingly beaten by Solidarity-backed candidates for  the Sejm, or Parliament, and a newly constituted Senate.  </P> <P> Under an agreement reached by the government and Solidarity in April, the  Communist coalition was supposed to control 65%, or 299 seats, of the  460-member Sejm, with 35% of the seats open to be contested by opposition  candidates. In the Senate, all 100 seats were open to competitors from all  sides.  </P> <P> It seems likely that Solidarity will win more than 90, and perhaps all 100, of  the seats in the Senate, and about 150 of the 161 seats open to its candidates  in the Sejm.  </P> <P> Those results, although a bigger landslide that even Solidarity's most avid  supporters predicted, cannot be viewed as an upset. But the failure of the  government's so-called national list of 35 unopposed candidates, most of them  major party and government figures, was a genuine shock to the authorities.  </P> <P> The embarrassment from the government and Communist Party side was evident, as  the party Politburo met in an extra-long session and the government's press  spokesman evaded key questions about the government's next step.  </P> <P> Among those on the national list were Premier Mieczyslaw Rakowski, Minister of  Internal Affairs Czeslaw Kiszczak and veteran Politburo member Jozef Czyrek,  who was among those who had pushed through the idea of holding talks with  Solidarity. Although all were running without competition, they had to be  approved by 50% of the voters in order to win election to the Parliament.  Unofficial returns, so far not disputed by the government, indicate that all 35  had been rejected.  </P> <P> The key issue now, for Solidarity as much as for the government, is how to  replace the rejected 35 officials so that the balance agreed upon earlier can  be achieved.  </P> <P> While the embarrassment is most acute for the Communist side, it is also a  sticky issue for Solidarity, which had counted on working with those officials  -- most of them regarded as the regime's most reform-oriented liberals -- in  the new national assembly.  </P> <P> "This problem can be solved according to the law," Bronislaw Geremek,  Solidarity's key strategist, said Tuesday. "This means we are ready to accept  any solution which will conform to the round-table agreement. This means a  (Communist) coalition participation in the Sejm of 65%."  </P> <P> Repeatedly pressed by reporters to suggest a formula by which the government  might replace the 35 candidates, Geremek replied: "It's not our problem."  </P> <P> Pressed on the same issue, deputy government press spokesman Zbyslaw Rakowski  answered, "It is being discussed," but he would not elaborate.  </P> <P> Rakowski did question whether the election results really represented the "will  of the people."  </P> <P> "The decisions of the individual voters were guided above all by emotions," he  noted.  </P> <P> Bogdan Borusewicz, a Solidarity leader in the port of Gdansk, cautioned Poles  against overconfidence.  </P> <P> "We have to remember that police, army and Communist propaganda remain in the  same hands," he said.  </P> <P> And Solidarity adviser Adam Michnik noted that the Soviet Union and China, both  run by apparently reform-minded regimes, recently had resorted to violence when  people demanded too much freedom. He cited the deadly military crackdown in  Beijing as well as the use of chemical gas against demonstrators in the Soviet  republic of Georgia earlier this year.  </P> <P> "The firing at people and death victims . . . indicated what kind of dangers we  should avoid," he said.  </P> <P> Solidarity spokesman Janusz Onyskiewicz acknowledged that some of the union's  supporters would be angry with any solution that allowed the national list  candidates to be chosen for Parliament after their clear rejection by the  voters.  </P> <P> "But it should be noted," he said, "that people who voted for Solidarity voted  for the Solidarity platform, and that platform included our pledge to the  round-table agreement."  </P> <P> Onyskiewicz admitted that the union is worried by the election's overwhelming  outcome.  </P> <P> "It is too good a result for us," he said. "What worries us is that we counted  on our reform program to be negotiated in Parliament. But if the leading  members of the government side from the round-table talks are not in  Parliament, we may be forced to conduct our negotiations outside."  </P> <P> Onyskiewicz's concern is a recognition of the divisions inside the ruling  party, where hard-liners and the party's vast nomenclatura apparatus oppose the  kind of political and economic reforms engineered by the present leadership.  The fear, among both the opposition forces and the party liberals, is that the  humiliating defeat in an open election could lead to a party backlash.  </P> <P> Thus, as Onyskiewicz suggested, Solidarity would prefer that the government  find some face-saving way of slipping the national list officials into the  Sejm, rather than risk having to deal with another, more stubborn lineup of  opponents.  </P> <P> Political observers noted that it is in the interests of both Solidarity and  the government to solve the national list issue as gracefully as possible to  avoid a paralyzing deadlock in the new national assembly, where some solutions  must be found for Poland's ever-mounting economic problems.  </P> <P> Even though Solidarity refuses to join the government at the ministerial level,  both sides will be forced to cooperate in the national assembly, where a vote  of the Solidarity-controlled Senate can veto legislation passed by the Sejm.  </P> <P> Such a veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority of the Sejm. But even  with a 65% majority in the Sejm, the Communist Party and its allies would need  at least eight Solidarity votes in the Sejm to override a Senate veto.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Paul De Bruyn: "Russians Distance Themselves </F> From West Again"]    [Text] The confirmation that Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev will not, after all, be coming to visit NATO  Headquarters on Thursday [21 April] to sign the Partnership for  Peace [PFP] no longer came as a surprise. Over the past few  days it had already become clear that Moscow (for the time  being) feels unable to consolidate such a cooperative link with  the Western alliance. The reason given by Kozyrev, his  colleague Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, and others, was that  the United Nations and NATO did not inform them about the air  strikes launched against Bosnian Serb positions. Moscow  describes this as a breach of confidence and as proof that the  West is still not prepared to regard the Russians as full  partners. Moscow wishes to express its displeasure at this,  authoritative sources claim.    While nobody would deny that the latest developments in  Bosnia have indeed not gone as the Russians might have wanted  (the United States, in particular, is emphatically attempting to  weaken the position the Russians have built up for themselves),  this alibi is far too comfortable. So the question arises as to  whether Moscow has not merely waited for an appropriate moment  to put off its rapprochement with the West. After all, in  February the Russians themselves agreed that the UN commanders  in Bosnia had the authority to request NATO actions. So they  knew that no further approval by the Security Council was  necessary in this respect.    For anyone within NATO it is clear that the Russian  hesitation to sign up with the Partnership for Peace can be  directly attributed to the power struggle over foreign policy  which has long been fought out behind the scenes in Moscow.  Although "ultranationalist" Vladimir Zhirinovskiy would appear  to have been neutralized, his influence is still filtering  through in many circles. He is playing on the latent fear among  the Russian people that from now on Russia will only be a  second-rate power. Figures like Kozyrev, who is regarded among  the pro-Western Russians, are not in a sufficiently strong  position to turn around the tide of nationalistic, anti-Western  feeling. They cannot convince their opponents that it would be  advantageous for Moscow to cooperate with NATO. Moreover, it is  noticeable that President Boris Yeltsin is not playing any role  in this debate, possibly the clearest indication yet that he is  finished.    Consequently, Moscow is immediately confronting NATO with a  new dilemma. The Partnership for Peace, limited though it may  be, was not only a way of offering the countries of Central and  East Europe a prospect of NATO membership, but was also intended  to set off the dangers of a shattering Soviet Union. By  bringing Russia and other former republics into play in a  cooperative alliance, the West counted on averting potential  unrest within the armed forces. However, that calculation  presupposed that Moscow would play a subordinate role to  Washington. Now that Moscow appears unprepared to do this, NATO  is once again faced with problems that it thought it had solved.    A Partnership for Peace without Russian participation is  dangerous. The hardliners in Moscow could exploit such a  situation by asserting that the West is indeed out to isolate  Russia. That would not benefit pro-Western elements. However,  such a situation merely consolidates the worst fears of the  countries of Central and East Europe. They were scared to death  of a development whereby Russia would once again adopt an  anti-Western stance while they had no guarantee of security.  Precisely that is now threatening to happen.    The Partnership was meant to give all parties involved the  time they required to prepare for full NATO membership. There  would now appear to be little chance of any quiet preparations.  NATO diplomats will once again have to show all their creative  flair to find a way out of the situation.</p>

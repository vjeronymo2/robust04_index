			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Yule Catto 4% ahead at Pounds 10.2m IN SPITE of the effects of the continuing resession in its markets, Yule Catto, the industrial chemicals and building products group, showed a 4 per cent improvement in the six months to June 30. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 10.2m, against Pounds 9.87m last time, and were struck on turnover down by Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 126m. The result was helped by a lower interest charge of Pounds 1.04m (Pounds 1.76m). Directors said the speciality chemicals operations had performed strongly, with sales and profits increasing by 4 per cent and 8 per cent respectively. However, 'unsurprisingly', the building product companies had experienced tough trading conditions, they added. An interim dividend of 2.5p (2.3p) is declared, covered three times by earnings per share of 7.5p (7.2p). Since the start of the current year two small acquisitions have been made, both of which have been fully integrated within existing operations, the company said.</p>

			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOW TO JOIN A TRADE CLUB  </P> <P> If you own a business (or are yourself incorporated), bartering could offer  cash savings for you or your company. For more than 20 years, bartering  networks have offered the goods and services of doctors, carpenters,  restaurants, graphic artists, print shops, interior decorators and new-car  dealerships, to name just a few.  </P> <P> In the bartering system, members use trade dollars instead of  </P> <P> federal currency. For example, if a restaurateur needs work done on a car, he  would select a mechanic and the two would negotiate the mechanic's labor and  parts costs. The mechanic would in turn receive an equivalent credit for meals  at the restaurant. The parties to the deal do their own negotiating, in some  instances with the club monitoring to make sure one side does not get cheated.  </P> <P> Barterers are not limited to making a direct one-to-one exchange. A major  function of a club is to maintain a "credit market," where goods and services  are offered to the larger group. This facilitates more trades, particularly of  those goods that are not easily matched. Plus, some companies have begun to use  gift certificates from trade clubs to provide bonuses for their employees.  </P> <P> Benefits of joining a trade exchange include club-sponsored social gatherings  and business expos among members to encourage a sense of camaraderie and  introduce businesses and products to each other. Trade clubs also co-produce  shows -- for example, home and garden, computers and interior design. Members  buy booths on trade, but non-member attendees represent cash sales and, of  course, potential trade club members.  </P> <P> Most clubs provide varied "products" to members, working to maintain an even  ratio between goods and services. Trade brokers help members find products  through a membership bank and will also match buyers with sellers, helping to  move items that have been part of previous bartering deals. Any high-demand  service or product missing from the membership roster is sought out by the  club's sales department, which then approaches companies offering this product  line. On the other hand, the club will monitor the goods and services being  offered so no single "product" is overrepresented.  </P> <P> To join a trade club:  </P> <P> * An individual must own a business with an address (corporations may also  join).  </P> <P> * The business must be licensed, bonded or insured.  </P> <P> * A person must pay an initiation fee, which gives access to the system  (including "shopping" at barter showrooms).  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY TRADE CLUBS  </P> <P> Business Exchange of Orange County  </P> <P> 1920 Old Tustin Ave., Santa Ana  </P> <P> (714) 973-1712  </P> <P> Members: 1,200  </P> <P> Initiation fee: $495  </P> <P> Trade American Card  </P> <P> 777 S.

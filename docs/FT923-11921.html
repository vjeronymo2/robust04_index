			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia in call for oil investment lifeline RUSSIAN oil production could fall by 15 per cent both this year and in 1993 without foreign investment, an aide to Mr Yegor Gaidar, acting Russian prime minister, said yesterday. Mr Sergei Roginko, an adviser on foreign investment projects in Mr Gaidar's secretariat, was in London to promote OGE '92, the first international oil industry trade fair in the autonomous republic of Tatarstan in October. The exhibition is jointly backed by the Russian energy ministry and the Tatarstan government to highlight investment opportunities for foreign companies, despite Tatarstan's vote for self-rule in March, and a dispute between the two governments over shares of oil revenues. 'We are trying to stress our common interests,' Mr Roginko said. He added that at least 5m tonnes of oil had been sold illegally in the past year by 'speculators' who were 'bleeding Russia dry' by buying oil cheaply for roubles and selling it for hard currency on the world market. He pledged, however, that 'serious' foreign investors prepared to make a long-term commitment could be exempted from the punitive Ecus28 a tonne (roughly Dollars 5 a barrel) export tariff the Russian government had been forced to implement to combat illegal exports. Gulf Canada and Conoco had both recently secured exemptions from export tariffs, Mr Roginko said, and the White Nights project, operated by US companies Phibro Energy and Anglo Suisse with Siberian producer Varyeganneftegaz, was also negotiating possible exemption. The pledge will be welcomed by western companies, for which the export tariff has been a major disincentive for investment. Raising Russian oil prices to world market levels could solve the problem of fraudulent exports, but the Russian government had concluded this could only be done gradually, otherwise it would 'turn our economy upside down' and aggravate inflation, Mr Roginko said. He predicted the process would take 'a couple of years'. Mr Roginko said investment of Dollars 5bn to Dollars 10bn was needed to halt the decline in output. He said western technology could significantly extend the life of some fields and re-open many of the 15 per cent of wells now standing idle.</p>

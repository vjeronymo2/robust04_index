			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / In defence of his realm: George Bush is vulnerable on his right flank First there was Nelson Rockefeller, then Richard Nixon, briefly Gerald Ford and last Ronald Reagan. For 25 years, these lions of the Republican party - three presidents and one who might have been  - were George Bush's political patrons. He served them well and was rewarded with posts from Beijing to Langley, Virginia. Even when finally elected in his own right four years ago, as qualified, by dint of public service, as any man ever to make it to the White House, he did so principally as keeper of the Reagan flame in a mean campaign designed by those who had long served his predecessor. Now Mr Bush is on his own. He can blame Congress, Saddam Hussein and Japanese food for his troubles, and he might even think privately that the men around him are no longer lean and hungry. But it is his own presidency he is defending, not somebody else's. It follows he has to define his presidency - and therein lies the rub, because he is not doing it very well in this election year. He is mostly not doing it well inside his own party. This is less surprising than it appears, for the challenger, Pat Buchanan, is, in his way, as much party mainstream as the president. For, ever since Barry Goldwater's shock troops howled down Nelson Rockefeller at the Cow Palace in San Francisco in 1964, the activist soul of the party has been on its right flank. Goldwater was extreme enough - and beaten badly enough in 1964 by Lyndon Johnson - for Nixon and Ford to keep the right at bay, though Reagan nearly ousted Ford for the nomination in 1976. But, once Reagan was in office, the hegemony of the right was not in dispute. The agenda was theirs, they licked the envelopes, mounted campaigns and pushed through the sort of policies that Mr Bush himself, when trying to thwart Reagan in 1980, once derided as 'voodoo economics'. Pat Buchanan now leads them and George Bush seems to think that he cannot do without them. The trouble is that they neither like nor trust Mr Bush; they never have, because he has never really been one of them. Yet it must be surprising that the president should be rendered so vulnerable by a political tide which, no matter how pugnaciously swept along by Mr Buchanan, surely has passed its national high-water mark. The country may be angry, but there is no evidence it now wants Mr Buchanan's alternative agenda. The public's plague is on all political houses in Washington, not just the white one at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. It is surely no coincidence that the Democrats doing best in their primaries - Clinton, Tsongas and Brown  - do not live in the nation's capital. George Bush's problem seems to be that he does not quite know how to deal with this. It might be thought that his coolness under pressure during both the Gulf war and last August's abortive coup in Moscow would have taught him some lessons. But the current approach is a frantic, frenetic defence of his realm built more on the expediency of the moment than any sense of what he wants to do or thinks is right. It is not so much the absence of 'the vision thing' as what he offers instead that is sometimes alarming. Thus, in confessing this week that he was wrong in 1990 to drop his election pledge never to raise taxes, his principal justification was that he had got a lot of political flak for doing so, and, ipso facto, must have been wrong. His critics had a field day - 'flip, flop and flip' joked the Washington Post. 'In a single utterance, he managed to tarnish his own good deed and reveal an appalling lack of conviction,' declared the New York Times. The willingness to cave in to pressure from special interests - as when the fundamentalist right induced the president to get rid of the mildly liberal head of the National Endowment for the Arts on the grounds that he condoned pornography - is not exactly the principled George Bush Saddam Hussein came to know and love. His sometimes farcical attempts to reveal a common touch are threatening to become the stuff of political legend, comparable to Jimmy Carter's epic battle with a swamp rabbit. The fractured syntax even exceeds the worst of Ford and Reagan and is becoming shrill. Mr Bush is being laughed at, not with, always a dangerous sign for any politician. There is another barely subcutaneous concern about the president, which is the state of his health. He pursues politics, policies and leisure like there is no tomorrow, but he only has to collapse one more time and what is now politely called vulnerability may come more to resemble terminal frailty. But none of those Republicans in the wings - James Baker, Dick Cheney, Phil Gramm - can or will make a pre-emptive move. Dan Quayle does not have to. And yet, for all the actual and potential disasters and faux pas, Mr Bush remains the favourite to win in November. Pat Buchanan cannot knock him off the Republican perch and the Democrats cannot be certain they have yet found the candidate to fly rings round him all over the country. Meanwhile, 'the American people', invoked this year as in every election for their wisdom, tolerance and nobility, wait, and wait, and wait.</p>

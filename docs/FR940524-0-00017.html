After bidding closes, a defaulting or disqualified auction winner will be assessed an additional penalty of three percent of the subsequent winning bid or three percent of the amount of the defaulting bid, whichever is less. Deposits will be held by the FCC until full payment of the penalty. If default of disqualification involves such actions as gross misconduct, the Commission may declare the applicant ineligible to bid in future auctions and may take other actions including the revocation of Commission licenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 26. If the down payment is timely made, a long-form application filed on FCC form 401 (as modified) will be required to be filed by a specified date, generally within 10 business days after the close of the auction. Upon acceptance for filing of the long-form application, the FCC will release a public notice announcing this fact thus triggering the filing window for petitions to deny. If the petitions to deny are denied, and the FCC finds the applicant qualified, the license will be granted to the auction winner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 27. As proposed, we adopt a modified version of the application requirements and processing rules in part 22 of the Commission's rules for narrowband PCS. These rules govern such matters as application filing and content requirements, waiver procedures, procedures for returning defective applications, and procedures regarding the modification of applications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 28. With regard to petitions to deny, we adopt expedited procedures consistent with the provisions of section 309(i)(2) of the Communications Act for narrowband PCS applications. A hearing need not be conducted before denial of a petition to deny if the Commission determines that an applicant is not qualified and no substantial issue of fact exists concerning that determination. If the FCC identifies substantial and material issues of fact in need of resolution, section 309(i)(2) of the Act permits in any hearing submission for all or part of the evidence in written form and allows employees other than administrative law judges to conduct hearings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 29. As a general rule, when an auction winner defaults or is otherwise disqualified after having made the required down payment, the best course of action is to re-auction the license either to existing or new applicants. However, if the default occurs within five (5) businesses days after bidding has closed, the Commission retains the discretion to offer the license to the second highest bidder at its final bid level, or if that bidder declines the offer, to offer the license to other bidders (in descending order of their bid amounts) at their final bid levels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30. If a new auction becomes necessary because of default or disqualification more than five (5) business days after bidding has ended the Commission will afford new parties an opportunity to file applications because so much time is likely to have passed that different parties may be interested in bidding and existing applicants may have different valuations of the license. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Procedures in Other Auction Designs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 31.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Single round bidding. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Where we use sealed bidding, in addition to the information specified above, the initial public notice will specify the date on which sealed bids must be submitted. In single round sealed bid auctions, we will not require bidders to submit upfront payments because we believe that there is less risk of frivolous bidding when this auction design is used. We may, however, announce by public notice that bidders must tender the 20 percent down payment at the time they submit their buds in order to ensure payment of the penalty in case of bid withdrawal or default. In single round sealed bid auctions, we will require that bids be received on a date specified in the public notice and that bids clearly indicate the bidder's identification number and the auction and license to which the bid relates. Bidders submitting bids for more licenses than they are permitted to hold must also specify the order in which they wish to be awarded such licenses if they are the high bidder on more licenses then they are eligible to hold. After bids are submitted and evaluated, the Commission will issue a second public notice indicating all bidders who have made timely bid submissions. After release of the second public notice, the Commission will issue a third public notice announcing the high bidders on each license. (If a tie occurs, bidders will be afforded the opportunity to submit another bid and the highest bidder in this round will be designated the winning bidder.) If the 20 percent deposit has not already been submitted, then the high bidder will be required to submit the 20 percent down payment within five (5) business days after release of the public notice announcing the high bidders (if the 20 percent down payment has already been submitted, the Commission will simply deposit the high bidder's down payment). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 32. In the case of single round bidding, the withdrawal and default penalties must be modified to reflect the fact that bids cannot be withdrawn during the course of an auction because there is only a single round of bidding. In this context, if a bid is withdrawn before the Commission releases the public notice announcing the high bidders, no harm is likely to occur and no penalty will be assessed because the Commission can easily designate in the public notice that the party with the next highest bid is the winning bidder. If, however, a high bidder in a single round auction defaults after release of the public notice announcing the high bidders, the licensing process is likely to be delayed. Therefore, in order to encourage bidders in single round auctions to avoid default and the associated delays, we will impose a default penalty if a high bidder withdraws, defaults or is otherwise disqualified after release of the public notice announcing the winning bidders. This penalty will be equal to the difference between the high bid amount and the amount of the next highest valid bid. A bid will be considered valid for this purpose if the bidder has not already been designated the winning bidder on more licenses than it is permitted to be awarded. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

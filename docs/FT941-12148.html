			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Arts: Today's Television Tuesday has become Social Conscience Night. Assignment tells the ghastly story of 'social cleansing' in Colombia where death squads with names such as 'Kan Kill' and 'Black Hand' set out to clean up the streets by murdering prostitutes, drug addicts and street children. It is said that tramps were lured to a university campus, murdered, and sold to medical students for dissection. One, who was clubbed almost to death, came round in a room full of corpses and escaped to alert the police ..who tend to be a part of the problem instead of the answer (7.45 BBC2). Undercover Britain found itself a game 71-year-old woman willing to spend two months with a camcorder filming secretly in a succession of old people's homes in the Liverpool area. Three of the homes were run by people with criminal records and a fourth accepted her even though it was registered as men-only (9.00 C4). The people with buckets at busy junctions who rush out when the lights go red and start making your windscreen opaque are the subject of 40 Minutes (9.50 BBC2).</p>

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Guinness Mahon to form specialist bond-broking unit GUINNESS MAHON, the UK merchant bank owned by the Bank of Yokohama, is setting up a capital markets operation which will specialise in broking bonds. 'A major capability in the fixed income sector is something I have been seeking for some time,' said Mr David Potter, chairman and chief executive of Guinness Mahon. Guinness Mahon Capital Markets will be headed by Mr Guy Burgun, who previously ran Leu Securities, and will be staffed by 10 former Leu traders. Leu Securities, part of the Bank Leu group which is majority-owned by CS Holding, was closed down at the end of July and its activities merged with Swiss Volksbank's London operation to form Swiss Volksbank Securities. The move was part of a restructuring of subsidiaries of CS Holding, the parent company of the financial group built around Credit Suisse, which bought Swiss Volksbank for SFr1.6bn (Dollars 1.05bn) in an agreed takeover in March. Mr Potter said the development of the fixed income side of the business would provide greater balance, as the company was currently mainly equity-orientated through its stockbroking and corporate finance businesses. He said: 'We will want to focus on developing our presence in the sterling market. We have been successful as an agency broker in equities and will look at the possibility of agency broking in gilts.' However, the firm will not attempt to compete for Eurobond underwriting business. 'The barriers for entry into the primary market are too high,' he said. The new unit, which starts trading on September 1, will concentrate on broking less liquid Eurobonds and structuring private transactions. Bank of Yokohama, Japan's largest regional bank, took over Guinness Mahon in 1991 after the company had suffered heavy losses on leasing, property and commercial loans during the 1980s.</p>

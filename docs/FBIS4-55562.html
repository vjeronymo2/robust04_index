			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by Maria </F> Hluchanova; place and date not given: "Talks on Economic  Cooperation Will Dominate"]    [Excerpts] Slovak Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik will depart  for an official visit to the French Republic tomorrow. In this  context, we asked him for an interview. [passage omitted]    [Hluchanova] What attitude will you adopt, on behalf of  Slovakia, toward the stability pact, and how will you justify it?    [Moravcik] I have been informed about the results of expert  talks on this issue that were held in Athens on 10-11 May 1994.  At these talks, we succeeded in pushing through our standpoint,  which has opened the path for Slovakia's active participation  [in the conference on the stability pact to be held in Paris in  late May]. The only question that remains open is that of the  modalities of this participation. Regarding the voices that the  stability pact may lead to a new Munich or a new Vienna  Arbitrage [in November 1938, by which southern Slovakia was  ceded to Hungary], I would like to stress that this is  completely out of the question because one of the conditions I  have laid down is that the principle of the inviolability and  unchangeability of borders be fully respected and included in  the document. This implies an advantageous starting point for  further negotiations on our part. [passage omitted]</p>

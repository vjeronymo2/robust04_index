			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Rise in advertising and sales lifts Fairfax 50% John Fairfax, the Australian newspaper group in which Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian media proprietor, holds a minority interest, yesterday announced a 50.2 per cent improvement in first-half profits after tax but before abnormals, at ADollars 54.2m (USDollars 38.9m). The advance at the pre-interest operating level was slightly more modest - a 15.2 per cent rise to ADollars 101.8m. This, said Fairfax, reflected 'improving economic conditions and reduced costs'. Operating revenues were up by 7.2 per cent as a result of increased advertising rates and volumes, and increases in some cover prices. Overall, Fairfax - which takes in the Sydney Morning Herald, The (Melbourne) Age and The Australian Financial Review - saw advertising revenue increase by about 6 per cent and circulation revenue by some 10 per cent. Operating costs for the half-year were up by 4.7 per cent due to promotional initiatives and the increased activity. The company said that circulation figures for the Saturday editions of The Age and Herald were strong and that AFR circulation had also increased. But it acknowledged that weekday circulations of The Age and Herald had fallen. Fairfax's net profits total was helped by a significant fall in interest charges - down from ADollars 27.1m in the first half of 1992-93 to ADollars 19.6m in the most recent period. The company also enjoyed a ADollars 28m abnormal income tax benefit, bringing bottom-line profits to ADollars 82.1m, compared with ADollars 36m last time. An Australian senate inquiry looking into foreign ownership in the print media is being extended to give the committee time to question Mr Black. The committee is examining reasons behind the Labor government's decision to allow Mr Black's Tourang consortium to lift its interest in Fairfax from 15 to 25 per cent. See UK Companies</p>

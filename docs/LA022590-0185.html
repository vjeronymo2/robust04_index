			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISNEY'S TELEVISION QUEST;  </P> <P> NETWORK PRIME-TIME SUCCESS STILL ELUDES THE GIANT THAT'S ENJOYED MOVIE HITS AND  PROFITS AT ITS THEME PARKS  </P> <P> Across three sound stages at the Culver Studios lies the first lunar colony.  Emily's, a diner with a crater view, is serving mushroom burgers and onion  omelets. Across a town plaza graced with potted plants, the medical clinic  stands ready for any emergency. Nearby sits the general store, a cave-like  building that also houses the local barber shop and the communications center.  </P> <P> This is Plymouth -- the lunar colony featured in an upcoming TV movie of the  same name that the Walt Disney Co. is producing for ABC. There is no guarantee  that the elaborate set will ever be used for anything but this one telefilm.  Disney executives hope, however, that the moon village and the "jes' folks"  townspeople who inhabit it will score huge ratings and leave TV viewers crying  for more. The studio is itching for ABC to pick up "Plymouth" as a weekly  series for the 1990-91 season.  </P> <P> But as the Walt Disney Co. has learned the hard way, landing on the moon is one  thing. Landing on a network schedule is something else.  </P> <P> Despite repeated efforts, Disney has not been successful at producing  prime-time network programs. The only show it has been able to sustain is the  venerable "Magical World of Disney" on Sunday nights, and even that ranks only  76th among 96 series that have been on the three major networks this season.  NBC executives are not sure they will renew it for another year.  </P> <P> The company's poor showing is particularly mysterious because it stands in  dramatic contrast to the gains that Disney has made in every other field since  it was revitalized by an aggressive new management team in 1984. In the years  since Chairman Michael Eisner and his lieutenants set up shop at the  then-moribund company, Disney has become a diverse entertainment powerhouse.  </P> <P> In feature films, Disney hit No. 1 at the box office in 1988 before dropping to  fourth place in 1989. The company vied with Warner Bros. for the top slot in  the home video market in 1989, with an estimated $480 million in sales, and  should continue to dominate the industry, says Seth Goldstein, senior editor of  This Week in Consumer Electronics. Syndicated cartoons, Disney merchandise, the  Disney Channel on cable -- all are part of the success story. Disneyland and  Disney World remain national institutions as well as the company's biggest  income-generators.  </P> <P> The Theme Park and Resorts division brought in $2.6 billion last year while the  Filmed Entertainment division, which includes theatrical releases, broadcast  television, cable and home video, grossed $1.6 billion. The Consumer Products  division brought in $411 million. Total company revenues were up 34% from 1988.  </P> <P> Yet while the rest of the company has taken a rocket to the top, the network TV  division is still waiting to blast off.  </P> <P> It has produced pilots that didn't become series. It has produced series that  quickly disappeared -- among them ABC's "Ellen Burstyn Show" in 1986 and  "Harry" in 1987, CBS' "The Oldest Rookie" in 1987, Fox's "Down and Out in  Beverly Hills" in 1987 and CBS' "Hard Time on Planet Earth" in 1989. It has  tried and failed to develop series within the framework of its Sunday-night  anthology -- in an earlier incarnation on ABC and then, for the past two  seasons, on NBC. Duds include revivals of "Davy Crockett," "The Absent-Minded  Professor" and "Parent Trap."  </P> <P> Disney's only new prime-time entry this season was the NBC sitcom "Nutt House."  It was axed after five episodes.  </P> <P> Now even "The Magical World of Disney" is in trouble. Disney executives,  anxious to keep the program alive, have sent bushels of new programming ideas  for it to NBC. "It's a major priority for the television division at Disney,"  reports Warren Littlefield, executive vice president of prime-time programs at  NBC. Getting the series renewed, he says, has the "time and attention" of  Disney's top executives, including Eisner and Walt Disney Studios Chairman  Jeffrey Katzenberg.  </P> <P> The show, which has survived changes of networks, titles and time periods --  even a three-year absence from TV -- since it debuted in 1954, has long been  used by Disney as a way of promoting various company projects, especially its  theme parks. "The 'World of Disney" is, in effect, a commercial for the Disney  company," grumbles another NBC executive.  </P> <P> Determined to boost its lowly ranking, Disney has embarked on a costly mission  to muscle its way into the network business. The company is spending millions  buying up talent -- trying to find the people who will produce, write and star  in shows that can climb to the heights of the Nielsens. Former Fox Broadcasting  executive Garth Ancier was brought in as president of network production one  year ago to oversee the process.  </P> <P> Among the people signed to Disney are "Roseanne" creator Matt Williams, who is  working on a new Carol Burnett series for NBC; the original team of head  writers from "The Golden Girls," who have a project in development at NBC; and  "L.A. Law" co-creator Terry Louise Fisher, who is developing a drama for CBS  about a woman in the legal profession. Also tied to Disney are numerous others  writers and producers who are not household names but have been associated with  hit shows.  </P> <P> "That's suddenly going from nobody to a whole lot of people," observes NBC's  Littlefield. "The last few years they've been crawling. Now they're walking."  </P> <P> In addition, Disney executives like to boast about the performance and quality  of the high-rated NBC shows "Golden Girls" and "Empty Nest," which appear under  Disney's Touchstone Television banner. But some industry observers believe the  boasts are misleading because Disney serves only as the financial backer and  distributor of those shows, taking a share of the profits in return. It's  Witt-Thomas-Harris Productions that created the shows and that churns them out  each week. In fact, the modest-sized production company had already sold  "Golden Girls" to NBC when Disney stepped into the deal.  </P> <P> Disney's low network profile apparently has not escaped the watchful eyes of  Wall Street. When rumors of a possible Disney-CBS merger resurfaced earlier  this month, one analyst told the Hollywood Reporter that Disney would be the  perfect studio to take over a network. The reasoning went that since government  regulations prohibit networks from syndicating shows they produce, most studios  would stand to lose huge profits if they coupled with a network. But it would  not be a problem for Disney, the analyst said, "because they are a non-factor  in the prime-time series business."  </P> <P> The question is, why? Why would a company have such a dismal record in one  field when it has found such a winning formula everywhere else?  </P> <P> The answer, some industry analysts and insiders say, may be found within the  question itself.  </P> <P> Some suggest that Disney may have hobbled itself by using the same techniques  to produce television shows that it uses to produce feature films. During its  climb to the upper levels of the film business, Disney became known as a studio  that liked to keep a tight fist on the budget and a strong hand in the creative  process. That M.O. appears to have carried over to the TV business as well.  </P> <P> "What works in features might not work in television," says Leslie Moonves,  executive vice president of creative affairs at Lorimar, the leading supplier  of network programs for the past three seasons. "Lorimar has proven the point  in the opposite way," he laughs, noting his company's weak performance in film  production.  </P> <P> The Disney network division also has sometimes suffered because of conceptual  problems in developing programs. Such was apparently the case when the studio  sold a TV version of its hit movie "Down and Out in Beverly Hills" -- about a  bum who moves in with a rich family -- to the new Fox Broadcasting network. The  concept not only was sold without a pilot but also without the involvement of  any creative staff at all. Disney's upper management reportedly sold the 1987  show directly to Fox Chairman Barry Diller. When work on the series finally  began, producers found there was nowhere to take the story week after week.  </P> <P> Disney's TV department also has built a reputation for stubbornness and hard  bargaining. Several NBC staffers say the studio can be difficult to work with.  </P> <P> "I won't say to you that doing business with them is easy," Littlefield says.  "The studio comes to its projects with a point of view. They come at it with a  stamp. Sometimes we go to war with them."  </P> <P> Producers and writers have felt the imprint of the Disney stamp.  </P> <P> "Nightmare on Dopey Drive," is the way one producer termed his experience on a  Disney TV project. Staying true to their cost-conscious reputation, Disney  officials would not budget money for original music for the show. "They wanted  us to use music from previous Disney shows," the producer said. "They're  completely hands-on, starting with the kind of staples you use. There's a  tremendous amount of interference."  </P> <P> On a 1988 Disney sitcom pilot for CBS called "Tickets, Please," (" 'Cheers' on  a train" was one description), executive producer Charlie Peters saw studio  executives edit out a subplot containing roughly a third of his show just  before it was presented to the network for consideration. Peters, now with two  feature films in development at Disney, was reluctant to speak of the studio  overhaul of his work. "I don't think they made or broke the show," he says.  </P> <P> A former "Nutt House" staffer says Disney programming executives tried to  sugar-coat the series. "While the producers' and writers' desire was to create  wild and crazy comedy in the tradition of Mel Brooks," the staffer said,  "Disney executives insisted it be filled with heart and poignancy."  </P> <P> Not everyone is complaining, though. "Disney's been terrific to us," says Terry  Grossman, one of the four ex-"Golden Girls" head-writers who formed their own  production company and signed on with the studio. "We have tremendous freedom."  </P> <P> Another explanation for the tepid performance of Disney's network efforts, some  TV industry executives believe, is that strengthening Disney's network  television division was not a top priority when Eisner and crew took over the  company. Instead, the new managers focused their immediate attention on their  biggest assets -- the theme parks and the film business.  </P> <P> "I don't think anyone can argue with that strategy for success," says NBC's  Littlefield.  </P> <P> Disney executives won't discuss strategy -- or anything else about their  network TV operations, for that matter. Studio executives declined to be  interviewed for this story. A company spokeswoman said that Disney officials  will be happy to talk "when we have a story to tell."  </P> <P> Disney staffers -- including Randy Reiss, executive vice president of Walt  Disney Studios and president of its network TV division -- also took the highly  unusual step of calling people who have worked on Disney television programs to  ask them not to talk to The Times. Some people also were asked if they knew of  anybody who had agreed to be interviewed.  </P> <P> But people throughout the TV industry are talking about Disney and are watching  closely to see if the company's current drive pays off. With only a limited  number of time periods available on network schedules, a strong entry by Disney  into prime time would affect every other company fighting for the same precious  slots.  </P> <P> "I think Disney in the future will do much better," Lorimar executive Moonves  predicts. He believes his rival had not been managing its network operations  effectively before the new talent-buying push.  </P> <P> "I think they have not had the proper show-runners," he says, referring to the  studio executives and producers who oversee budgets, production schedules and  story development. Now he thinks Disney's spending spree has brought them "not  just creators, but people who can run shows."  </P> <P> "From the NBC perspective," says Littlefield, "Disney seems to have come to  life."  </P> <P> Disney has numerous projects in development at the No. 1 network.  </P> <P> "Carol &amp; Company," the comedy anthology starring Carol Burnett, has been  slowed by problems of concept and execution -- namely how to put on a different  show with different characters every week. But it should reach viewers this  spring, Littlefield says. Michael Jacobs, the "My Two Dads" producer who also  is tied to Disney, is developing one project for the "Magical World of Disney"  and another series for NBC.  </P> <P> The former "Golden Girls" team is making a pilot for NBC tentatively titled  "Fanelli and Sons," about a widow whose four grown sons, aged 19 to 40, move  back in with her. Disney also is producing a pilot for NBC called "Hell Street  High," which will be a musical set in a high school.  </P> <P> The studio has strengthened its ties to Witt-Thomas-Harris Productions,  recently signing the company that produced "Beauty and the Beast," "Benson" and  "Soap" to an exclusive contract that gives Disney the distribution rights to  its TV projects for 2 1/2 years.  </P> <P> Also developing Disney shows for NBC are William Blinn ("Our House") and Ken  Estin ("Taxi"). "L.A. Law" co-creator Terry Louise Fisher produced a pilot at  Disney for NBC last season that was not picked up. This year she is producing  one for CBS.  </P> <P> Among the Disney projects in development at ABC is "STAT," a comedy about  doctors and nurses in an inner-city trauma center. The producer is Danny  Arnold, co-creator and former executive producer of "Barney Miller."  </P> <P> And there is the ambitious "Plymouth," which is being produced by David Zlotoff  ("MacGyver"). With a budget estimated at $8 million, the lunar project carries  a price tag that is roughly double the cost of an average TV movie. Disney has  hedged its bets on the costly project and entered a co-venture arrangement with  the Italian media company RAI-Uno. The Italians have invested about half the  budget in exchange for international distribution rights, Disney officials have  said.  </P> <P> It is unclear what financial involvement ABC has in "Plymouth." But if the  network is paying an average TV movie license fee -- $3.5 million might be  about right -- then Disney has little to lose in the deal.  </P> <P> Whether signing pricey deals will translate into network success for Disney  remains to be seen. As a Disney spokeswoman put it while explaining why studio  executives did not want a story about their TV efforts, "Just because you're  buying up all the talent in town doesn't mean you're going to be the biggest  success in town."  </P></p>

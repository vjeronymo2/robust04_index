			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / International Company News: Indian share discounting opposed INDIA'S main financial institutions have opposed a move by some Indian companies to consolidate their holdings through preferential share allotments at prices lower than those prevailing in the stock market. The heads of India's largest financial institutions met officials from the finance ministry and the central bank this week to stress the need for a rational policy on preferential share pricing. Financial institutions have agreed that neither Indian promoters keen to strengthen control of their companies nor multinationals seeking enhanced equity should be allowed differential share-pricing to the extent that other shareholders are heavily disadvantaged. The meeting follows the decision last month not to allow the founding family of Mahindra and Mahindra, a Bombay-based vehicle and heavy engineering goods manufacturer, to buy stock at less than one-third the market price. The institutions were not averse to preference allotments at reasonable discounts.</p>

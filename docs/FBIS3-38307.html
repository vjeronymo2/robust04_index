			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Christian Brondum and Erik Bjorn Moller: "The </F> Last Chance for CD"]    [Text] In a cabinet reshuffle which gave the Center  Democrats [CD] two heavyweight ministries in the government,  Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen and CD leader Mimi Jakobsen  are trying to make sure that the hard-pressed government party  will survive the next election.    Poul Nyrup Rasmussen sacrificed his social affairs minister,  Karen Jespersen, whose ministry went to CD rebel Bente Juncker.  Mimi Jakobsen takes over the Industry Ministry, along with her  own Ministry of Business Policy and Coordination.    Yesterday, neither the prime minister nor Mimi Jakobsen were  making any secret of the fact that this is the last chance for  the CD, which, in opinion polls taken since August, has been on  the verge of disappearing from the Folketing.    The rescue operation cost the two CD ministers, Arne  Melchior  and Svend Bergstein, their posts, while the previous transport  minister, Helge Mortensen (Social Democratic Party), now moves  into Arne Melchior's Communications and Tourism Ministry. The  Transportion Ministry is being taken over by the man who had  been the industry minister, Jan Trojborg (Social Democratic  Party). CD Ecclesiastical Affairs Minister A.O. Andersen will  additionally take over Svend Bergstein's Technology and Research  Ministry. This means that the total number of ministers falls  from 24 to 22.    The reshuffle simply has the aim of strengthening the CD --  the government's policies remain unchanged, Nyrup Rasmussen  stated yesterday.    But the decision to allow the church affairs minister to  take  over Svend Bergstein's controversial Research Ministry has come  in for criticism from the former Social Democratic Folketing  group chairman and minister, Ritt Bjerregaard.    "Research is incredibly important for the changes which  Danish society is facing. Merging it with the Ecclesiastical  Affairs Ministry is a miscalculation regarding the role such a  ministry ought to play. Here the reshuffle has gone wrong."</p>

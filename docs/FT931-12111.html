			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Making sense of chaos - Bernice Cohen says charts dispel the casino image of share investing MOST INVESTORS plan their decisions purely on criteria gleaned from financial data relating to a company's performance. They disregard charts as voodoo magic. In contrast, technical analysts seek guidance on probable future share price movements from market statistics, supplemented by charts where recurring patterns provide buy and sell indicators. As a dedicated DIMI (Do-It-Myself Investor), planning my portfolio from my own research efforts, I prefer a belt and braces approach. Fundamental and technical analysis should be complementary tools in a fully-rounded investment system. When asked, 'Why bother with charts?' technical analysts often give defensive replies. Charts, they suggest, reveal the human psychology of the struggles between buyers and sellers in a competitive market under the twin stresses of greed and fear. Yet I believe the central rationale for charting stems from the possibility that charts reflect the presence of chaos in financial markets. Observing the everyday mayhem surrounding most financial markets, the suggestion that they are chaotic makes sense, at least superficially. However, chaos is actually a formal, relatively new science centred on mathematics. If it could be convincingly shown to apply to financial markets, that scientific base would lend respectability to counter the casino image. Intriguingly, most chaotic systems share a group of typical characteristics which are instantly seen to apply to unruly stock markets. They are highly complex systems comprising numerous interacting elements. They are inherently unstable with continuously changing behaviour. It is extremely difficult to predict their future conduct since numerous different outcomes are equally possible. They are intrinsically irregular and prone to trends and cycles. They are described by a mathematical geometry called fractal which can be shown on graphs. Fractal shapes, like the frost patterns on cold windows, have essentially the same pattern at any selected scale. In nature, ocean ripples create the same patterns as giant waves, while a local topography of bays and inlets takes a similar pattern to the overall coastline viewed from the air. These features are all typical of financial charts, supporting the notion that they reveal chaos in the market. Because chaotic systems can move in one of several different directions, charts offer visual images for interpreting share price gyrations, often by highlighting trends which are hard to spot within a welter of tabulated statistics. They help to sift out vital information from background noise. This logic underpins the use of moving averages (MA). By smoothing out local irregularities, they expose the underlying trends. And because they derive from the same price series, they are fractal, with similar structure across every scale - for five, 20, 50 or 200-day MAs. Moving average calculations give three helpful buy signals; first when the share price rises through its average, if both are rising; second, when the share price dips below the rising average but then soon bounces back through it; and thirdly, when the share price falls towards the average and bounces off it again. I used charts long before I understood their chaos basis because I find they reduce uncertainty and impose more discipline for timing purchases and sales. I used a chart with 20- and 50-day moving averages, purchased from Investment Research of Cambridge, to track progress of an investment in Glaxo made in September 1990. I bought Glaxo on the fundamentals of its good growth record and several new major drugs lining up to come to market this decade. During the following six months, I studied technical analysis more thoroughly and realised I had bought my Glaxo holding before the chart signalled a buy. During September the share price lay below the 50-day MA. The buy signal came in October when the 20-day MA cut up through the 50-day MA, known as a golden cross, and from late October both averages were rising, one above the other, which is a very positive sign. The price rose strongly during December, supported by both rising averages, as shown on the chart. Mid-January 1991 (as the Gulf war began and the markets turned bullish) gave another buy signal as the price approached the 50-day MA and bounced firmly up from it. This occured again in late May, late July and early November. Each occasion gave a buy signal and on two of the signals, I added to my existing investment. The Glaxo chart over this period is an excellent example of a long-term uptrend. For FT-SE 100 shares, the 50-day MA often gives the best signals. The chart provided a sell signal six weeks after the shares peaked in mid-January 1992, when for the first time in 17 months, the price fell below the 50-day moving average, which had stopped rising. Amid all the gloom about manufacturing in Britain, the pharmaceutical industry is a great success story. 'Don't sell Glaxo' were the dying words of a father to his daughter in an Anita Brookner novel. With its strong fundamentals, it could pay to watch the catch for another buy signal.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 2 SAPA -- Five IEC [Indepent  Electoral Commission] officials, three of them seconded by the  Department of Home Affairs, are being investigated for the  concealment of large quantities of ballot papers and other  materials at the height a shortage crisis during the election.    Peter Harris, Chief Director of IEC monitoring, told  reporters on Tuesday night that cases had been refered to the  attorney general and the Goldstone Commission as a result of  investigations into irregularities.    One official was under investigation for, as he put it,  gross  dereliction of duty at best. He was in charge of 611 boxes  containing 5,499,000 ballot slips at Marievale.    He had been giving conflicting counts of his available  material, turning away electoral officers before a team of  specialist functions monitors entered his warehouse on the  morning of April 28 when the missing stock was discovered. The  searchers were accompanied by nine SAP [South African Police]  officers.    In Pretoria another warehousing facility was found to  contain  150 boxes (of 9,000 each) PWV  [Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging] ballots, 100 boxes of  Western Cape, 30 of Northern Cape, 10 national, 300 OFS [Orange  Fre State] and 10 North West. There were also 100 boxes of IFP  [Inkatha Freedom Party] stickers, 200 UV lights and four boxes  of ink.    Mr Harris confirmed that an investiation was also in  progress  in respect of ballot and material stashes found in warehouse  facilities on the West Rand. The findings would also be made  public once investigations were completed. He was not prepared  to speculate regarding the motives of those involved.    "Suffice it to say that the two instances occured at the  height of the crisis to supply particular areas that needed them  and which could have escalated into conflict. It was at best  gross dereliction of duty not to ensure that those materials  reached their destination," he said.    He said there were also many ballot boxes originating from  so-called "pirate polling stations" under dispute in Northern  Natal. Discussions and attempts at mediation were in progress.  His monitoring group had dealt with 3,500 complaints thus far  of which 156 had been refered to the SAP and 10 to the Goldstone  Commission.    By the time of his reporting 73.9 per cent of the ballot  counting had been completed and the final tallies were expected  by early Wednesday.</p>

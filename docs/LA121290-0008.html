			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RACE AND HATE IN AMERICA  </P> <P> Race reverberates in American politics like no other issue, past or present.  </P> <P> It always has, at least as far as I can tell. Alexis de Tocqueville, who sat  next to John Quincy Adams at dinner in Boston one night in the spring of 1831,  asked the great man what was the greatest problem in the new republic.  "Slavery," Adams said. "That is the root of almost all the troubles of the  present and the fears for the future."  </P> <P> The country's sixth President then added: "I know nothing more insolent than a  black, when he is not speaking to his master and is not afraid of a beating . .  . . The Negro women especially very often take advantage of their mistresses'  kindness. They know that it is not the custom to inflict corporal punishment on  them."  </P> <P> Adams' views were milder than those of a predecessor, who offered these  thoughts:  </P> <P> "The real distinctions that nature has made, and many other circumstances, will  divide us into parties and produce convulsions which will probably never end  but in the extermination of the one or the other race . . . . They have less  hair on the face and the body. They secrete less by the kidneys and more by the  glands of the skin, which gives them a very strong and disagreeable odour . . .  . Comparing them by their faculties of memory, reason and imagination, it  appears to me, that in memory they are equal to whites, in reason much inferior  . . . and that in imagination they are dull, tasteless and anomalous . . . . In  music they are generally more gifted than whites . . . ."  </P> <P> If many modern Americans find those words to be stupid or offensive, I  apologize. It was Thomas Jefferson who said them.  </P> <P> There is no point in writing a column like this if you do not plan to  occasionally yell "Fraud!" at the dishonesty of political dialogue. My purpose  in quoting Jefferson at his worst is to argue that we were racist at the  beginning -- in the modern dictionary sense of unscientific perceptions of  racial differences in character and intelligence -- and we, whites and blacks,  have not improved on that as much as we like to say we have.  </P> <P> Tocqueville concluded his thoughts on equality in America with this note to  himself:  </P> <P> "It's not now a question of equality before the law; that kind is complete in  America . . . . But when one wishes to estimate the equality between different  classes, one must always come to the questions of how marriages are made.  That's the bottom of the matter. An equality resulting from necessity, courtesy  or politics may exist on the surface and deceive the eye."  </P> <P> Look at the social pages in any American newspaper today, the words and the  pictures. We are intermarrying across lines of geography, economic class and  religion as never before. People seem to marry now by shared aspiration, by  their conception of where they are going in this life. But the racial line is  rarely crossed. Black and white together? No, we are still living separate  lives -- and at the moment, that separatism may be getting worse rather than  better.  </P> <P> Perhaps it is time for us to talk about and do something about what is really  going on racially in the United States right now -- about fear and hatred, and  the unresolved questions and feelings of years of lying to ourselves in public.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARTHQUAKE RATTLES BOTTLES AND NERVES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WINE COUNTRY  </P> <P> The earthquake that struck Northern California on Oct. 17 could have been a  tragedy for California wineries, especially to those in the Santa Cruz  Mountains just west of the epicenter in Hollister, but no injuries were  reported and there was only a minimal amount of wine lost.  </P> <P> However, the quake left many wineries in a shambles, with a long clean-up  process ahead. Coming, as it did, after a difficult harvest, complete with  damaging rains, the quake created more sleepless nights and untold hours of  work for crews that had looked forward to a rest.  </P> <P> But there were bright spots: "Thank God for the World Series or we might have  been killed," said Val Ahlgren, co-owner with her husband, Dex, of the small  Ahlgren Winery in Boulder Creek in the Santa Cruz Mountains.  </P> <P> "We had been working in the cellar, but we quit early to watch the Series  game," said Val. The quake struck at 5:04 p.m., just as the pregame show for  World Series Game Three was starting. When the quake hit, it tossed barrels  about in the cellar and anyone standing in the small work area would have been  crushed, she said. Instead, Val and Dex were in their home, above the winery,  and were uninjured.  </P> <P> Bob Roudon at Roudon-Smith Winery in Santa Cruz said he and his crew had just  quit work at 5 p.m. "We were in the parking lot when it hit," he said. Barrels  tumbled off barrel stacks, scattering here and there and spraying wine all  around the winery.  </P> <P> "Lots of barrels were smashed, and we lost some of the bungs," he said, adding  that most of the loss was in expensive Chardonnay. The winery, which he and  partner Jim Smith designed, suffered no structural damage, however. "We  designed it to flex quite well," Roudon said.  </P> <P> "We haven't been able to assess what we've lost yet, but it looks like it'll be  about 30% of the (1989) crush," he said.  </P> <P> "Our big mistake is how we stacked the barrels, barrel on barrel, and when the  quake hit, they just squirted off the stacks. We're just grateful no one was  hurt."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Barrel Racks Split  </P> <P> At Santa Cruz Mountain Vineyard, barrels were on racks, but half of the barrel  racks split apart, "and barrels just tumbled everywhere," said Jeff Emery, wine  maker. "But I have yet to see a broken barrel, and most of the bungs stayed  in."  </P> <P> The wine library, including bottles of every wine the winery had made as well  as old and rare French wines, was hard hit. Emery estimated that owner Ken  Burnap lost about a third of his collection, including a bottle of 1945 La  Mission Haut-Brion and a range of older Bordeaux and Burgundies.  </P> <P> Moreover, the pile of barrels that remains "is very unstable so it's dangerous  to move them." Immediately after the quake, he began pumping wine into the  seven empty barrels he had.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Longer Maceration  </P> <P> Moreover, a tank of Cabernet Sauvignon "should be pressed off today, but it'll  have to wait." The wine has macerated on the skins for seven days. "What the  hell, in the old days we used to leave the wine on the skins 21 days, so I  guess we'll make this one like those.  </P> <P> "I was going on vacation in two weeks, but that ain't happening now," Emery  said.  </P> <P> A number of wineries that ferment their wines at cold temperatures and need  refrigeration to maintain low temperatures said the loss of power for two days  may have hurt the quality of the wine. But most said they couldn't say yet what  the effect will be.  </P> <P> Some wineries were luckier than others. At Bonny Doon Vineyard , no wine was  lost, either from barrel or tank, and no bottles were broken, said Patrice  Boyle, assistant to owner Randall Grahm, who was cleaning up the cellar when  the winery was called.  </P> <P> "A couple of barrels fell onto the rack below, but nothing broke," said Boyle.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Losses Reported  </P> <P> Losses were reported at David Bruce Winery, Bargetto and Devlin in the Santa  Cruz Mountains, as well as J. Lohr Winery in San Jose. Hallcrest and Ridge  reported no serious losses.  </P> <P> A number of cases of wine stored at California Wine Transport in San Jose were  lost when stacks of boxes of wine fell over. But even there the losses were  minimal. Marcia Ljubojevic, vice president of finance at Ridge, said about  3,000 cases tipped over, but that only eight cases of wine were lost.  </P> <P> Val Ahlgren said her wine cellar was "so full (of barrels) that they all came  together like popcorn in a bowl. The wine library is a mess, but when the  barrels came down, none of them broke, and we don't see a bung out." The cellar  is "very precarious, so we'll wait until after the worst aftershocks before we  move in there and try to organize stuff we can move. It's like giant pickup  sticks."  </P> <P> Things were so tossed about in their house that they initially cleared a path  to the bathroom, to the sink and the telephone, and then slept outside on a  porch.  </P> <P> "And we look up at the stars and the moon and they're all still in the right  place," she said.  </P></p>

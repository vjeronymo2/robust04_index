			<p>Article Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Rio de Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in  Portuguese carries in its 25 January edition, on page 7, three  unattributed articles about Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos de  Magalhaes' actions to become a presidential candidate.    The first 250-word article states: "Although he guarantees  that his main priority is to run for a Senate seat for the  Liberal Front Party, PFL, Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos  Magalhaes, yesterday admitted for the first time during a  luncheon held for him by the Rio de Janeiro Businessmen  Association that he may run as a candidate for the presidency of  the Republic. `I will continue crafting an alliance for the  first voting round with all the parties whose candidates may  withdraw. My name is available, but I would be the sixth option  because I also defend five other candidates,' Magalhaes said  before 200 businessmen, including Globo Companies' Roberto  Marinho, his longtime friend."    In a second 200-word article describing his speech to the  Rio  businessmen, Magalhaes harshly criticizes the economic policy of  Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Magalhaes states:  "The fiscal reform that the government wants to pass will not  yield any results. It will only increase taxes for you. The  government is not brave enough to say that the Real Value Unit,  URV, is a disguised dollarization of the economy that will  create salary problems like in Argentina and Mexico." Magalhaes  continues by saying that the government needs a "credibility  shock," which for him means an "effective fight against  corruption and tax evaders, and an immediate constitutional  revision. `We need a strong government and a return to the  principle of authority,'" Magalhaes said.    The third 250-word article describes Magalhaes as a  political  chess master who, although he seems to be warming up the seat  for another candidate, is really doing it for himself. His  speeches gain more media coverage than the Citizenry Caravan  carried out by opponent Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. The article  states that the other presidential candidates, Jose Sarney,  Orestes Quercia, and Paulo Maluf, are morally discredited, while  Antonio Britto finds strong resistance within his own party. The  candidacy of Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso depends  on whether he can control inflation; otherwise his party will  have to support Senator Mario Covas. Considering this, Magalhaes  is launching himself as the "sixth option."</p>

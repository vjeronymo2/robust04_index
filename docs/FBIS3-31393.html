			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Budapest, 15 Feb (MTI) -- At the foreign affairs  spokesman's news conference today, questions were asked  regarding Hungary's policy toward Yugoslavia, and Prime Minister  Peter Boross's recent statement that NATO's AWACS planes were  authorized to use Hungarian airspace only for the purpose of  peacekeeping. Spokesman Janos Herman was asked if this implied a  change in Hungarian foreign policy and if Brussels had reacted  to Boross's statement.    "The prime minister's statement was not a novelty," the  spokesman said. "Hungary previously informed its NATO partners  that the AWACS are only allowed to operate in Hungarian airspace  under the Hungarian Parliament's mandate."    The spokesman said that NATO had not made any formal  reaction  to Boross's statement. "Brussels seems to be aware that in the  interest of both this region and NATO, Hungary should not play  even an indirect role in any offensive manoeuvre. The Hungarian  Government's position is identical to that of parliament,"  Herman said.    The spokesman said that a hypothetical situation was at  issue  and expressed the hope that the action would not take place at  all and the Bosnian serbs would fulfil NATO's demands.    Herman added that Hungary and NATO were in constant touch  with one another, also for reasons other than the Yugoslav  crisis.    Herman confirmed that Hungary would continue to take part in  international efforts aimed at settling the Yugoslav crisis, and  observe the decisions of the international community, including  the U.N. Security Council embargo on Serbia and Montenegro.    "Since Hungary is a neighbour of Yugoslavia and a Hungarian  minority exists in Vojvodina, its situation differs from that of  the countries located further from this region. As a  consequence, Hungarian diplomacy faces a twofold task. First,  it should make it clear that it has invariably made every effort  to settle the situation. Second, it should enforce Hungarian  interests within appropriate frameworks. The two goals do not  contradict each other. Its basic stance is unchanged but the  reactions may differ pending the changing situation," the  spokesman said.    "Budapest will not initiate any easing, suspending or  lifting  of sanctions. All the more so because others have already made  that initiative and set concrete terms which Hungary backs,"  Herman said.    "Hungary wants to see a solution found, and peace restored  in  Yugoslavia," Herman said.</p>

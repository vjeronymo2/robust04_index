			<p>BFN     [Text] Since the very beginning of the reforms Russia has  regarded foreign aid as crucial. As a result of this incorrect  orientation internal sources were not used to stimulate economic  and investment activities, Russian First Vice Premier Oleg  Soskovets said at the constituent meeting of a consultative  council on foreign investments under the Russian government  today.    He said the total volume of foreign investment in Russia  remained very small and did not conform with the capacities and  needs of the country. "According to expert evaluations, only  about 0.1 percent of foreign investments in the world is being  placed into Russia," Soskovets said.    The Russian government realizes that during the next five  years the economic reforms in Russia will make Russian small and  medium enterprises the main source of new jobs, Soskovets said.    However, Soskovets said there was quite a number of negative  tendencies in the development of small business. Today there  are only about 700 enterprises performing in the sphere of small  business and there should be at least 2.5 million or 3.5 million  of them.    Soskovets said that small business in Russia was not  receiving enough support on the part of Western capital. He  added that only the $300 million-credit given to Russia by the  European Bank was the most significant one allotted by the West  to Russian small and medium business. Soskovets said he hoped  that the problems concerning the attraction of Western capital  to Russia would be settled by the consultative council on  foreign investments headed by Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin.</p>

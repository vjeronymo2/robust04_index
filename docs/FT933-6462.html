			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Observer: Hitting the target The stuffier fans of The Archers, BBC Radio's rural soap opera, hate the realistic notes creeping into their beloved programme. Only yesterday Baroness von Twickel wrote to The Times complaining that the sheer noise of recent programmes has nearly driven her to apostasy. Her letter was triggered by this week's high point - the re-enactment of a real English Civil war battle 350 years ago. The Sealed Knot, one of the main real-life societies which mounts 'living history' re-stagings of battles, sieges and occupations was even given a walk-on part. But, here again, The Archers is not a patch on reality. A fortnight ago, in what was supposedly a peaceful restaging of Royalist life in Stokesay castle in rural Shropshire, all hell broke loose when a female member of The Sealed Knot showed up (in male 17th century dress) at an event staged by the arch-rival English Civil War Society for English Heritage. Flanked by their imposing pikemen, officials of the society barred her way into the castle, even though she had paid her entrance fee. After much cursing and swearing, during which the audience realised only gradually that the confrontation was for real, she was forced to leave. Behind the confrontation lies not only the fact that the society considers itself far more purist than The Sealed Knot, from which it broke away some years ago, but that living history is becoming almost as big business for societies which mount such events in Britain as it already is in America.</p>

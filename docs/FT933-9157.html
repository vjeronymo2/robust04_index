			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Arts: Weill success at Santa Fe - Paul Griffiths enjoys a pre-Brecht double bill at the Festival The opera best made for Santa Fe has to be The Magic Flute: thunderstorms are almost guaranteed to be rolling around the nearby mountains as the sky darkens during performances in the open theatre, and Sarastro's crew are right at home in a city whose 20th-century psychic history goes back from the shamanic healers and Eriksonian hypnotists of today to a 1911 Masonic temple shaped as a Moorish fantasy in strawberry mousse. Almost inevitably, the piece is a regular here. This year's new production, though, cut away from awesomeness and spirituality to side with Papageno's vulgar good sense. Marie Anne Chiment's costumes were on the lurid side of dreaminess: robes of scarlet and purple for the adepts, snowy fur and little forehead lights that made the boys look like Christmas-tree decorations. Reto Nickler's staging provided the pantomime that Mikael Melbye, as Papageno, knew well how to handle. In such a context, Kurt Streit's handsome and musically fine Tamino provided a challenge that was never resolved. As on previous occasions, the festival's successes were in areas that the place would not seem to suit so well. For example, nothing could be less in harmony with this relaxed, sunny, natural city than the music of Kurt Weill, and yet it was a double bill of pre-Brecht Weill - The Protagonist and The Tsar has his Photograph Taken, both to words by Georg Kaiser - that provided the Santa Fe Opera with both its novelty and its sharpest night. The director Jonathan Eaton and his designer Robert Perdziola set both pieces in the 1920s of their composition, and so neutralised the costume-drama tendencies in The Protagonist (as Mr Eaton rightly pointed out, the music speaks of Weimar Germany, not of the libretto's Elizabethan England) while availing themselves of opportunities for a comic-glamorous look just right for The Tsar. Both works ostensibly have to do with persons and personae. The protagonist of The Protagonist is an actor whose mood is swung by what he happens to be playing. His sister, who has been his sheet anchor to truth, finds him rehearsing a piece of slapstick, and judges this will be a good moment to introduce her secret lover. By the time she returns, however, the play has been changed, and she spills the news to a man wrapped up in a drama of sexual jealousy. In The Tsar people are clear about where roles end and reality begins; it is the situation that confuses them. The tsar, escaping from public duty for a moment, wants to flirt with the lady photographer whose studio he has entered. But the photographer is a disguised anarchist, and her camera is loaded with a pistol. All through both pieces, then, there is a weapon waiting to go off: the febrile actor's capacity to carry out in life the deeds of murderous revenge he executes on the stage, and the weapon in the photographic apparatus. What makes for catastrophe in The Protagonist is in The Tsar a joke. Yet musically the pieces are more similar than that might imply. Writing very much in the wake of Busoni and Hindemith, Weill shared their ideal of music moving over its own planes aside from the dramatic continuity, and the Santa Fe double bill pointed up how much of the familiar Brecht-Weill irony  -the ostinatos, marches and dances, the embittered harmony - came out of those musical exemplars and was in place before the composer met the playwright to match him. In accordance with the precedence of pure music - or rather of impure music - the chief glory of The Protagonist is its pair of mime sequences: spiky wind music for the farce, and ominously seductive hints from the cello of a slow uncurling line in the tragedy. The score was beautifully played here under George Manahan. On the vocal side this opera is, fittingly, a vehicle for the protagonist, and Jacque Trussel seized it with a fury of intensity. In The Tsar, David Malis offered a nice contrast of bluff jollity. He was also a ready Marcello in the charming revival of La Boheme that boasted too a bright Rodolfo from Martin Thompson and an excellent orchestral performance, perceptive and sophisticated, under John Keenan. John Crosby, moving spirit of this festival for 37 years and unashamed Strauss nut, conducted a luscious Capriccio that was elegantly presented by the director Willy Decker and designer Wolfgang Gussmann as a play of vivid facsimiles - 18th-century ladies and gentlemen in white, ivory and silver - within a blank space of effulgent blue. The frank realism of these people's behaviour - their evident belief in themselves - was thoroughly beguiling, and yet they were placed in a nowhere. They were clouds singing about clouds. As such they were the perfect creatures for this opera in which the audience is invited into a long, lingering enjoyment of knowing pretence. All that was wanted was more cream and radiance in the singing. Sheri Greenawald as the Countess had a potentially lustrous performance checked by the need to control flare and vibrato. Mark Thomsen and James Michael McGuire as the composer and poet were eager young blades, without suggesting that their music might exceed expressive need. But Richard Stilwell's amused urbanity was entirely enough for the Count, and Eric Halfvarson was ideal as the old pro La Roche, robustly in command of the interior theatre, the box within a box, where he offered his dancer and Italian duettists. Whether they all knew they were similarly on show - personae not persons - was a question left poised exquisitely in the air.</p>

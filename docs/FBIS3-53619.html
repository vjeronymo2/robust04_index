This implies that in  two weeks, when the period specified by the Algerian Ruling  Council expires, the Armed Forces may directly assume power.    Political observers say that the Algerian defense minister's  threatening remarks, even if they are put into practice, will  not have a very significant effect on the country's political  scene. Since the Boumedienne coup d'etat in the sixties, the  Algerian Armed Forces have held the reins of power and even now  are the power behind the Algerian Ruling Council. The threat  that the Armed Forces may enter the fray directly will change  little in the circumstances.    And the Algerian Armed Forces have a very (?defensive)  position in the crisis in the country and cannot become a very  active force in resolving the Algerian crisis. The Algerian  Armed Forces are not a homogeneous body and are politically  polarized between the government and the Islamists and are thus  plagued by an overt dichotomy of loyalties.    This issue, which has spilled out of the country, and the  imposition of conditions by international powers on the Algerian  Ruling Council, undermining its position, could be the real  reason behind the remarks by the Algerian defense minister. In  other words, his allegations seem to be more propaganda, aimed  at projecting the impression that the Algerian Armed Forces  enjoy a unified capability that can enable them to assume power  in the country.    Some political observers believe that the defense minister's  recent remarks relate to the resumption of the negotiations  between the government and the opposing factions on delegating  power and on the length of the tenure of the interim government.  These talks, which began months ago, have failed to achieve any  outcome. The Algerian Government has not extended an invitation  to the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) and by providing privileges  to other factions, it seeks to elicit support for the current  illegal government and thus forge a united front and an  extensive coalition of non-Islamic factions. Thus, it is  striving to replace the Ruling Council with a strong non-Islamic  coalition.    The threatening remarks of the Algerian defense minister a  few days before negotiations between the government and the  opposing factions resume may aim to motivate the opposition to  accept the government's wishes. By not including the FIS, the  key player in Algeria, which enjoys legitimacy and a popular  base, these talks are doomed to fail even before they begin.  The only development that has taken place with regard to these  talks is that by exposing the government's weakness and a  significant tilt in the balance between the government and the  Islamists, the non-Islamic factions are not ready to gamble away  their future.    The most important faction participating in the talks  between  the government and the opposition, the Socialist Front, recently  announced its abstention from these talks and other factions are  in the midst of deciding whether they should participate in the  upcoming talks. This has placed the Algerian Ruling Council in  a major political quandary, because it has invested much to  achieve even half-baked legitimacy by seeking to elicit the  support of the other secular factions. This hope is likely to  become chagrin.    If the Ruling Council is defeated on this path, it's only  choice will be to extend its tenure for a third time, without  recourse to the will of the people, or to think more  intelligently and delegate power to those who are popularly  elected.</p>

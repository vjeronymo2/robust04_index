			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 19 (XINHUA) -- China will continue  to keep a firm grip on the total credit supply this year to ease  the inflationary pressure that has been building up over the  past few months.    Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji, who is also the central bank  governor, told a national financial work conference which closed  Saturday [15 January] in Beijing that all the banks must observe  the "rules and discipline" enforced since July 1993 and control  the credit line as planned.    He said that every bank must limit its lending to fixed  assets investment projects and loans for major projects in  infrastructure and basic industries will be arranged in a  unified manner by the new state development bank.    Zhu said that banks will not provide loans to unauthorized  projects or projects beyond the credit line.    "The planned total credit line must not be exceeded even by  one yuan," the vice-premier stressed.    Zhu said that the macroeconomic control measures adopted by  the central government are "appropriate", helping avert an  excessive fluctuation of the national economy.    He said the over 99 percent of the key national projects  have  got the necessary funds; there have been no IOU's in purchasing  agricultural produce; and the strained situation in the working  capital of major production enterprises and foreign-funded firms  has been eased.    At the same time, Zhu said, the over-issue of money has been  curtailed; money supply has been controlled within bounds; the  market exchange rate has been stable; and the state foreign  exchange reserves have increased.    However, Zhu said that the macroeconomic control measures  have eased some of the problems only to some extent and problems  in the deeper part of the economy remain unsolved.    "We are still far from setting up a risk mechanism to  effectively restrain investment in fixed assets and the  inflationary pressure is likely to build up at any time." Zhu  said.    He warned banks against inter-bank lending in violation of  banking rules, raising interest rate without authorization or in  disguise or running economic entities.    The central bank governor asked the specialized state banks  to take a big pioneering step this year in their transition to  commercial banks.    He said that the branches of the People's Bank of China  should concentrate their efforts on stabilizing the currency and  supervising operations of financial bodies.    The bank governor called for particular attention to the  current task of preventing a resurgence of unauthorized lending  and raising of funds, saying that only by so doing, is it  possible to ease the inflationary pressure.</p>

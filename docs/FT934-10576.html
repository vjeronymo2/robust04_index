			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: Revson to pay Dollars 1.6m to settle SEC case MR Martin Revson, former chairman of US drugs and cosmetics group Del Laboratories and a former director of Revlon, agreed yesterday to pay Dollars 1.6m in fines and restitution to settle insider trading claims filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC said Mr Revson, without admitting or denying liability, would pay Dollars 1.25m in disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and just over Dollars 343,000 as a civil penalty under insider trading legislation. Both amounts related to the profits the SEC says the 84-year-old Mr Revson derived from his purchase of shares in the industrial conglomerate Kidde during the summer of 1987. The SEC's original complaint alleged that Mr Revson was part of a large insider trading ring led by Mr Edward Downe, a former director of New York broking house Bear Stearns, and that Mr Revson bought Kidde shares for himself and his daughter in June and July of 1987 after being given inside information by Mr Downe.</p>

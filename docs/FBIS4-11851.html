			<p>BFN     [Text] In Cairo, Israeli and Palestinian delegations led  by General 'Uzi Dayan and Dr. Nabil Sha'th today resumed  negotiations on Palestinian autonomy in Gaza and Jericho.    Gen. Dayan, who heads the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]  Planning Branch, told reporters that Israel hoped the  negotiations would be completed quickly.    Nabil Sha'th told Qol Yisra'el's correspondent in Cairo Arye  Gus the PLO want to conclude the agreement by the 13 April  deadline in the Declaration of Principles.    [Begin Sha'th recording] We are starting the negotiations on  the withdrawal plan from Gaza and Jericho, which is really the  completion of what we had started and stopped just because of  the massacre. We hope to finish as soon as possible the  withdrawal plan, the deployment of the Palestinian police force,  and the remaining factors of security in the Gaza and Jericho.  The entry of the Palestinian police force will start with first  a small group of maybe seven or eight people to go to make the  arrangements and then be followed by a larger number to take  over some of the camps and to start preparing within a week at  most, maybe Thursday. There will be a detailed schedule that  will coincide with gradual withdrawal of the Israeli Armed  Forces, so that by the end of this period the Palestinian police  force will be fully deployed.

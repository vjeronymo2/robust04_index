			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yevgeniy Pisarev: "Administration Orders </F> Stabilization"]    [Text] A state of emergency has been declared in Voronezh  Oblast in order to stabilize finances in the social sphere,  industry, and transport. In this connection Aleksandr Kovalev,  head of the oblast administration, has signed several decrees  instructing the financial administration to regulate the rayon  and city budgets and thus, it is planned, even out the oblast  budget deficit.    During the state of emergency period health care, education,  social security, culture, and managerial structures will be on  starvation rations -- they will be given the minimum funds  needed to survive. Proposals aimed at cutting spending in these  spheres are being given all kinds of backing.    The state tax inspectorate and the tax police have been  given  total carte-blanche. They have been ordered to step up checks  to ensure that the oblast and local budgets receive full and  timely revenue payments.    In effect Voronezh Oblast has decided to strengthen  financial  discipline by administrative means, tightening the screws in the  loose reform mechanisms. On the other hand, evening out the  budget deficit may be seen as a move toward retreat. I remember  that censored military reports used to refer to a retreat as  evening out the front line.</p>

City </F> Administration Backs Yuriy Shoykhet"]    [Text] Omsk Mayor Yuriy Shoykhet, dismissed by a recent  presidential edict, handed over his powers to his deputy,  Valeriy Roshchupkin, yesterday. The city administration  collegium, however, does not agree with Boris Yeltsin's decision  and intends to demand the creation of a special commission to  assess objectively the former mayor's work.    According to Nikolay Terekhov, head of the information  center  under the city administration, the president's edict on Mr.  Shoykhet's removal caused total bewilderment among the workers  of the city administration and supporters of democratic reforms  in Omsk. Yuriy Shoykhet was appointed to the post of mayor by  Boris Yeltsin in person right on the heels of the 1991 August  putsch largely because of his reputation as a firm opponent of  the putschists.    The wording of the reasons for the mayor's removal was more  than sharp. The edict points out that Yuriy Shoykhet  "systematically performed actions aimed at destabilization of  the political and economic situation in the city, and repeatedly  exceeded his powers."    In the meantime, according to information from sources close  to the city and oblast administrations, the edict on Shoykhet's  dismissal was signed by the president 40 minutes after Omsk  Oblast Governor Leonid Polezhayev, who is chairman of the  interregional "Siberian Agreement" association, had walked into  his office. Mr. Polezhayev was one of Yuriy Shoykhet's main  enemies. In particular, the mayor opposed in every way the  subsidy-based approach to the shaping of the city budget  preached by the oblast administration. Thanks to the oblast  administration's policy, food and essential goods prices,  subsidized from the local budget in Omsk, are being maintained  at a lower level than in the other oblasts in western Siberia.  Shoykhet insisted on targeting subsidies at the poor, which  would release considerable funds for city and oblast needs. The  mayor thought that the policy of the oblast governor had denied  the city the funds for civic improvements and the maintenance of  city utility systems. According to a staffer in the city  administration, "Omsk is choking for want of funds and simply  falling apart while low-priced goods are being swept out by  visitors from other oblasts."    On 27 January, the collegium of the city administration with  Yuriy Shoykhet's participation decided to pass a request to  Boris Yeltsin to appoint a competent commission of the  president's staff to conduct an expert assessment of the Omsk  mayor's work. The collegium voiced the hope that the edict may  be revoked.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Sarajevo, June 12 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Serb  parliamentary Speaker Momcilo Krajisnik has stated that the Serb  side has received assurances from the Moslems that they are  willing to exchange all remaining POWs as agreed on Saturday [11  June]. Krajisnik made the statement on Sunday after Bosnian  Serbs and Moslems had resumed talks at Sarajevo airport on  prisoner exchanges.    After the first round of talks on Saturday, the two sides  agreed to complete the lists of POWs held by the International  Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC] to include those captured in  the recent fighting on Mt. Ozren in the north and around Gorazde  in the southeast. The exchanges are to take place at Sarajevo  airport, in Gorazde and at Satorovici near Brcko in northern  Bosnia.    The two sides also agreed that a meeting be held on  Wednesday  by local representatives to exchange information about the  missing. At the next round of talks on Friday, the two sides  will negotiate dates for the exchanges.    An ICRC spokesman said in Geneva on Friday the organization  estimated that Bosnian Moslems and Croats were holding about 450  persons prisoner and that the Serbs were holding approximately  the same number of prisoners. The one-month truce which the  Bosnian Serb Republic and the Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia  signed on Wednesday envisages an immediate release of all  prisoners, including POWs. The truce came into effect at noon  on Friday.</p>

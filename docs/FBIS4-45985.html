			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Japan's Nuclear Ambition Dragged Into the Open" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 15 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  comments on the recent discovery of 70 kilograms of pure  plutonium enough for the manufacture of nine nuclear bombs at  reactors of the fissionable material producing processes in the  Tokaimura Atomic Industrial Centre, Japan.    The analyst says:    Japan has never let a chance pass by without saying the  production and stockpile of a large quantity of plutonium in the  country were for "a peaceful purpose" and it would not lead to  the conversion of Japan into a nuclear power. It has also  boastfully claimed that it is "a model" in accepting inspections  by the International Atomic Energy Agency. But it was fully  revealed this time that all this was a lie.    The analyst continues:    Pretending to open to the public the amount of stockpiled  plutonium, Japan has concealed a part of it. This proves that  it has invariably stepped up the design to turn itself into a  nuclear power under the cloak of "a peaceful purpose."    Broad public circles of the world have considered that  Japan's stockpile of plutonium more than necessary is related to  its design to become a nuclear power.    The Japanese authorities are now clamouring about  "investigation" and "removal of misgivings." This is, however, a  belated excuse.    Japan's nuclear design remains unchanged. It is racing  headlong toward nuclear armament.    Its nuclear armament poses a serious threat to the peace and  security in Asia and the rest of the world.</p>

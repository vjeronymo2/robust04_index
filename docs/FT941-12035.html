			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: HK newspaper publisher up 1.8% South China Morning Post Holdings, the publisher of Hong Kong's leading English language newspaper, yesterday reported a 1.8 per cent rise in net profits to HKDollars 258.36m (USDollars 33.45m) for the six months to December 31. The dividend is being maintained at 6 cents, writes Louise Lucas in Hong Kong. The results, the first to be reported since Malaysian millionaire Mr Robert Kuok paid USDollars 349m to Mr Rupert Murdoch for control of the Post, show earnings per share have risen to 17.22 HK cents from 16.92 cents a year ago. Last month, the group sold its loss-making Chinese language newspaper Wah Kiu Yat Po, two years after buying it, for HKDollars 20m. It retains a 19.8 per cent 'strategic interest'. The Post's impressive margins are likely to come under pressure with today's launch of the Eastern Express, the first new English language newspaper for more than a decade. Spawned by Oriental Press, the most profitable Chinese language publisher in Hong Kong, the Eastern Express has already hired a number of former Post editorial staff and undercut advertising rates.</p>

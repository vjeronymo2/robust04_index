			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Sudanese troops have arrested ousted Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi, an army  spokesman announced. Col. Hassan Dahawy said that Mahdi was arrested at a  friend's house in Khartoum, Sudan's capital, and taken to the armed forces  general command headquarters. The 53-year-old Madhi, who had ruled since he was  elected in May, 1986, was overthrown in a June 30 coup led by Lt. Gen. Omar  Hassan Ahmed Bashir. Bashir has said that Madhi and politicians associated with  his government will be tried before emergency tribunals. The new leader said  his first priority for reform is fighting corruption.  </P></p>

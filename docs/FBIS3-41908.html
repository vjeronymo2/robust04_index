[Selivanov over video of said operation captioned  ``13.12.1993, Ukraine''] A criminal gang specializing in  the export of enriched uranium produced at CIS countries'  nuclear industry facilities was detained during the operation.  A total of 240 capsules containing 1.5 kg of radioactive  material were confiscated.    Of late law-enforcement bodies are increasingly coming up  against criminal activities with a clearly pronounced nuclear  bias. The impression is that the protection of enterprises  producing nuclear components leaves much to be desired.    Lowering of the nuclear safety standards is fraught with the  most serious consequences in our time. The attempt to smuggle  out radioactive material which was foiled in Odessa is another  reminder of the urgent need to adopt prompt interstate measures  in this area.

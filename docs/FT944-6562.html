			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Observer: Blacked British Coal may be out of business by Christmas Eve but it still seems to have a few scores to settle. Gerard McCloskey, the editor of several Financial Times newsletters on coal, currently engaged in some acrimonious exchanges with RJB Mining, also seems to have upset Neil Clarke, British Coal's outgoing chairman. McCloskey has been dropped from the guest list for British Coal's last Christmas lunch for journalists. Come on lads, isn't it time to bury the hatchet?</p>

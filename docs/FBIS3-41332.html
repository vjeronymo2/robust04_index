			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lourdes Alonzo Parrao] </F>   [Text] Campeche, Camp., 26 January--The Office of the  Attorney General of the Republic [PGR] will reinforce its  surveillance activity along the state's highways, in order to  curb the drug traffic and various other federal crimes. This  announcement was made today by the agency's representative,  Antonio Tiro Sanchez.    He added that, as has been announced nationally, the PGR  plans to intensify its operations throughout the republic, and  on the Yucatan Peninsula in particular. Its aim is to cover  Campeche, Yucatan, and Quintana Roo States, where major federal  crimes have occurred during recent years: in other words, drug  trafficking.    He also remarked that the agency in Campeche has explained  its needs to the central authorities, and that a response is  expected at any moment, with reinforced action to combat the  drug traffic and other types of crime of concern to the Campeche  authorities.    He mentioned that one of the requests is for reinforcement  of  the surveillance along the state's federal highways being used  to transport alkaloids. He admitted that there is, in fact, a  highway checkpoint in Santa Adelayda, in the municipality of  Paliza, but claimed that it has proven insufficient.    He later asserted that the reinforced surveillance will be a  reality, adding that the critical sites detected by the PGR and  the Army would be covered, so as to arrest those committing  federal crimes.    He then stressed: "The PGR is continuing its various  activities to prevent the commission of federal crimes, and is  offering lectures to the citizens in general, and to teachers  and professional people, seeking their support for the action  being taken in this respect."    Finally, he reported that, during 1993, 711 kg of cocaine  had  been seized, plus another ounce, in Ciudad del Carmen. The Army  also succeeded in confiscating 727 kg of cocaine and destroyed  two marijuana plantations.</p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Trade deficit with non-EC countries widens BRITAIN'S visible trade gap with non-European Community countries widened in July as a fall in exports and a sharp increase in imports brought four months of improvement to an end. The Central Statistical Office reported yesterday that the deficit, which reflects just under half of UK trade, increased to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 778m last month from June's revised total of Pounds 599m. Imports rose by 2.4 per cent to Pounds 5.57bn between June and July while exports, which had increased sharply by 4.4 per cent between May and June, reversed part of that gain, falling 1 per cent to Pounds 4.79bn last month. Excluding oil and so-called erratic items, exports and imports hit records in value terms last month of Pounds 4.13bn and Pounds 4.84bn respectively. This may have partly reflected a sharp rise in the import and export prices of non-oil products in July. The visible trade gap was slightly worse than the Pounds 700m deficit foreshadowed in recent consensus forecasts from City analysts. But it had little effect on either sterling or the market for government gilt-edged securities yesterday. The City has been forecasting for some time that Britain's overall current account deficit for this year will be less than the Pounds 17.5bn forecast by the government in its March Budget. Yesterday's figures did not upset these expectations. The CSO said the figures indicated a flattening of the upward trend of the visible balance, although its latest estimates of the trend of non-EC trade show a rise of 0.5 per cent a month for exports with no change in imports. The Treasury said the underlying trend in trade was still favourable. It pointed out that in volume terms exports, excluding oil and erratics, were 2.5 per cent higher in the three months to July compared with the preceding three months and were growing at a faster pace than imports. CSO figures showed that volume imports, less oil and erratics, increased only 0.5 per cent in the latest three months compared with the February to April period. But last month's import volume, excluding oil and erratics, was a record. Yesterday's report showed that Britain was in deficit with the non-EC countries in all broad commodity categories last month. Trade in semi-manufactures showed a seasonally adjusted deficit (of Pounds 110m) for the first time this year. However, trade in finished manufactures has moved closer to balance in recent months with deficits of Pounds 284m in July and Pounds 250m in June. Britain's trade with North America was in the black for the fourth successive month, showing a small surplus of Pounds 65m in July. The UK also maintained its traditional surplus with the oil-exporting countries last month but ran deficits with other regions. The Confederation of British Industry said that yesterday's news on exports remained encouraging. But it noted that 'the majority of the UK's trade is with countries inside the EC and CBI surveys have suggested that weak European markets could be holding back overall export growth'. Figures for trade with the EC are not yet available on a monthly basis following the completion of the single market at the end of last year. Second-quarter trade figures covering the EC will be released on September 10.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- VALUE OF TRADE WITH NON-EC COUNTRIES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Balance of payments basis, seasonally adjusted (Pounds m)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                                ex oil and erratics*              Exports   Imports   Balance   Exports   Imports   Balance  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1991          44,477    53,883    -9,406    38,289    45,250    -6,961 1992          46,682    56,431    -9,749    40,624    48,097    -7,473 1992 Q1       11,306    13,605    -2,299     9,853    11,535    -1,682      Q2       11,665    13,856    -2,191    10,128    11,776    -1,648      Q3       11,577    13,675    -2,098    10,069    11,667    -1,598      Q4       12,134    15,295    -3,161    10,574    13,119    -2,545 1993 Q1       13,601    16,596    -2,995    11,693    13,855    -2,162      Q2       14,143    16,348    -2,205    11,972    14,098    -2,126      Jan       4,396     5,348      -952     3,806     4,493      -687      Feb       4,487     5,661    -1,174     3,844     4,686      -842      Mar       4,718     5,587      -869     4,043     4,676      -633      Apr       4,659     5,493      -834     3,955     4,693      -738      May       4,642     5,414      -772     3,902     4,737      -835      June      4,842     5,441      -599     4,115     4,668      -553      July      4,794     5,572      -778     4,129     4,842      -713  --------------------------------------------------------------------- *defined as ships, aircraft, precious stones and silver  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: What will you pay . . . - . . . And how much will you be able to save? / The government cut base rates to 9 per cent on Tuesday. Finance and the Family writers discuss the impact on your mortgage and savings MORTGAGE rates began moving steadily downward this week in the wake of Tuesday's 1 per cent cut in the banks' base rate, writes David Barchard. As usual, however, rates for new borrowers were cut quickest; existing borrowers will have to wait a month or so before seeing the benefit. The medium-sized societies led the way, establishing a norm of around 9.95 per cent for mortgage rates, while the largest lenders paused to consider their strategy. By the weekend, Abbey National and Nationwide, two of the top three lenders, had cut their basic mortgage interest rates to 9.95 per cent and the new rate was firmly established. Three banks, Royal Bank of Scotland, Midland and National Westminster, have now moved mortgage rates to under 10 per cent. Halifax and the other big lenders now look set to fall into line. There is one exception: the centralised lenders, whose rates, mostly at 11.5 per cent, are far above the norm. When they move, the chances are that most centralised lenders will cut their rates by a full percentage point. That will still leave them well above the building societies and banks, at least so far as their existing borrowers are concerned. Building society mortgage interest rates do not often fall below 10 per cent in the UK. May 1988 was the last time they fell below this threshold, and that did not last long. To find a period when mortgage rates stayed below 10 per cent for a considerable time one has to go back to 1977-78. This time may be different. Some economic pundits forecast a base rate as low as 6 per cent. Mortgage lenders are hoping that first-time buyers, and others who have been waiting before buying a home, will be tempted back into the market. Those who prefer certainty may opt for the 8.25 per cent fixed rate mortgages being offered this week by National &amp; Provincial and Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester. Northern Rock is offering 8.99 per cent fixed for two years. The C&amp;G offer, which lasts for two years, is particularly attractive because,unlike the others, it is not tied to the sale of property insurance and is available on an interest-only basis, as well as for repayment and endowment mortgages. Most striking in the latest round of cuts is that societies have not passed on the full 1 percentage point cut to customers. It shows that societies are beginning to structure their mortgage interest charges along new lines. For the last two or three years, customers with very large mortgages have done much better than those with average-sized loans. Abbey National's customers with mortgages over Pounds 100,000, for example, were being charged 9.99 per cent, when those with mortgages of Pounds 60,000 or below paid 10.7 per cent. This week, Abbey National customers with mortgages under Pounds 60,000 must have been delighted to learn that their rates had been cut by 0.75 percentage points to 9.95 per cent, while those with mortgages over Pounds 100,000 enjoyed a much less impressive reduction of only 0.5 percentage points to 9.49 per cent. It will take a good many years of low interest rates before lenders and homeowners forget the painful lessons of the last few years in the British housing market. Building societies are traditionally slower to announce changes in savings than mortgage rates, although cuts in savings returns are usually put more quickly into effect, writes Philip Coggan. A few institutions have started to lower savings rates already. At Nat West, for example, gross rates have fallen by a shade over 1 per cent with a Pounds 25,000-plus deposit in the Premium Plus account now offering 7.85 per cent, down from 8.91 per cent. The result is a fall in net rates by just over three quarters of a percentage point. It seems likely given the recent complaints by building societies about margin pressure, that savers will suffer the full percentage point decline in gross rates, whereas homeowners are only enjoying a 0.75 of percentage point cut in mortgage rates. The market for guaranteed income bonds has been in turmoil since the base rate change, which is why our Highest Rates table (page VI) excludes this category this week. Baronworth Investment Services cites one company, Providence Capitol, which cuts its one year GIB rates by 2.5 percentage points on Thursday. The best offers on three-year bonds are just over 7 per cent net (Prosperity Financial services is offering 7.5 per cent on sums of over Pounds 15,000); to get 8 per cent, one has to invest as much as Pounds 50,000 for five years with Aetna. The prospect for annuity rates is a matter of debate, since these depend not on base rates, but on the level of gilt yields. According to the Annuity Bureau, annuity rates are likely to rise. But William Burrows of Sage Financial consultants says: 'I cannot guess what the short term yields will do - but the general feeling is that long term rates will fall.' National Savings was quick to respond to this week's UK base rate change, with many of its products withdrawn from sale on Tuesday. The 38th issue of fixed interest certificates, the Series E Capital bonds, First Option bonds, Issue C Children's Bonus Bonds and the 7.5 per cent Yearly Plan are no longer on offer. New rates will be announced shortly. There will not necessarily be cuts of 1 per cent across the board, because of the tax-free nature of many of the products. Changes in variable rate accounts have already been announced. As from October 6, the rate on the investment account will fall from 8.25 per cent to 7.25 per cent. From November 5, the return on income bonds will drop from 9 per cent to 8 per cent. The 5th index-linked savings certificates, which pay a tax-free 4.5 per cent plus inflation if held for five years, remain on sale.</p>

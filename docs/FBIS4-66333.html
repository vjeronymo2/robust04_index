			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Shun Li [7311 0448]: ```Informationization' Is </F> the Road One Must Take for Social Development'']    [Summary] Legend Group Chief Engineer Ni Guangnan [0242  0342 0589] granted this writer an interview to comment on the  electronic information changes that are sweeping the nation. Ni  noted the ``National Economic Informationization'' slogan [for  the ``Golden Bridge Project''] now being proposed by various  authorities: it essentially refers to a debate on how to best  determine the influence of this [second] ``Information  Revolution'' on 2lst-century S&amp;T development. Ni said that  the  high-speed information networks now being developed worldwide  can bring into reality for mankind the type of things only  dreamed about in the past and incorporated in the science  fiction novels of the past few decades. In closing, Ni noted  that the ``Three Golden Projects'' now being implemented under  State direction are without question the proper direction that  China should take and will inevitably promote domestic S&amp;T  development into the next century.</p>

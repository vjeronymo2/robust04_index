			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Letters show a persistent Mates THE PUBLICATION of edited letters yesterday between Mr Michael Mates and the government's most senior law officers paints an extraordinary picture of a lone minister increasingly convinced of a conspiracy to damn Mr Asil Nadir. In representations to two attorneys-general over the past 18 months Mr Mates appeared to have become increasingly consumed with the alleged treatment of Mr Nadir and determined to expose what he believed to be a catalogue of abuse by the authorities. In spite of repeated denials from Sir Patrick Mayhew and Sir Nicholas Lyell, his successor as attorney-general, Mr Mates alleged numerous intimidatory and improper acts by the Serious Fraud Office and also claimed collusion between the SFO and the Inland Revenue. Throughout, Mr Mates suggested that Mr Nadir, in spite of his departure from the UK, remained anxious to return to the UK in order to clear his name. The most startling claim in his personal campaign to protect Mr Nadir's rights involved the suggestion that the fugitive businessman's empire, which dominates the economy of northern Cyprus, was at the centre of an intelligence service plot to destabilise the country. His fears on this front rose when he heard that similar allegations might be included in a proposed television programme. Much of the correspondence published yesterday covers ground covered in the statement which Mr Mates managed, in spite of the reluctance of the Speaker, to make earlier this week in the Commons. It omits, however, all reference to his allegations of a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice by bribing Mr Justice Tucker, the Nadir trial judge. The letters date from September 20 1991, following a meeting the previous day between Mr Mates and Sir Patrick. The MP complained that privileged documents removed from Mr Nadir's office were opened, contrary to an agreement, by the SFO and demanded that it 'tell the whole truth' about the matter. He also accused the SFO of arranging publicity for raids on Polly Peck International, Mr Nadir's company, and of excessive delays which continued to deny the businessman the chance to state his case in court. Sir Patrick rejected the idea of any improper motives and said that, on all the counts raised by Mr Mates, he was satisfied the SFO had acted carefully and responsibly. Last December Mr Mates met Sir Nicholas, now attorney-general, to press his case that Mr Nadir was being unjustly treated and first raised the possibility that intelligence services might be involved. He complained that the businessman had been arrested eight times without warning, in spite of meeting all his bail conditions. Sir Nicholas also categorically denied the assertion that police officers, SFO staff or anyone else connected with the Nadir investigation had gone to Cyprus. Mr Mates finally met the attorney-general on May 10, when Sir Nicholas assured the minister that each issue he had raised had been examined very carefully. Undeterred, Mr Mates pressed home his concerns about the conduct of the case. One June 8 Sir Nicholas made a further attempt to ease some of Mr Mates' concerns, re-emphasising that claims of collusion to undermine Polly Peck were unsupported by any evidence. Mr Mates, frustrated by his lack of progress but determined not to let the subject drop, was reaching the end of his ministerial career.</p>

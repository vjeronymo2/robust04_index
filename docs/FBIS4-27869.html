			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 4 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean  Government on Saturday [4 June] denounced as "an extremely  dangerous idea" the professed plan of North Korea to withdraw  from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and expand  nuclear activities.    North Korea said in a statement issued by Vice Foreign  Minister Kang Sok-chu on Friday that they would push ahead with  their withdrawal from the NPT and would expand "self-reliant  nuclear energy industry" under the present manner.    "This is an extremely dangerous idea that makes a mockery of  the hope of the international community and all the Korean  people for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula," the  government said in a statement.    The statement released by Yi Song-kon, Seoul-side chairman  of  the South-North Joint Nuclear Control Commission, said the  North's recent unilateral replacement of fuel rods at a  5-megawatt atomic reactor was an act of fundamentally shattering  the joint declaration of denuclearization.    "We in our part will continue to strive and take all  available steps to strictly implement the denuclearization  declaration under all circumstances," it said.</p>

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Observer: Tough nut Taking on entrenched interests is nothing new to Joel Joffe, the former Allied Dunbar executive who has launched an attack on his former life assurance industry pals. A South African by birth, he emigrated to the UK after accepting the brief to defend Nelson Mandela at the Rivonia trials in 1963. Very few white barristers were prepared to take part in the trial, and Joffe effectively ended his career at the Johannesburg Bar by doing so. He came to the UK instead of his original choice of Australia after the South African government confiscated his passport. Along with fellow South Africans Sir Mark Weinberg and Sir Sydney Lipworth, he set up one of the forerunners of Allied Dunbar. More recently, he has become a big wheel in Oxfam. Joffe hopes that his latest crusade has a better chance of success than some before. 'It's a lot less dangerous than defending Nelson Mandela', he says.</p>

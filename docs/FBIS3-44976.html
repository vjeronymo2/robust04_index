Full Text follows:    Since the CPC Central Committee and the State Council  announced an arrangement for anticorruption struggle in the near  future, various localities and departments have, by taking their  own reality into consideration, speedily adopted measures to  implement the arrangement. The momentum for the anticorruption  drive as a whole has been excellent and the development of the  anticorruption struggle has been healthy. Some results have  been achieved in the anticorruption struggle; varying degrees of  progress have been made in the three areas of anticorruption  work as set forth by the CPC Central Committee; and negative and  corrupt phenomena have been checked. But one must see to the  fact that a lack of balance has so far characterized localities'  and departments' progress in the anticorruption work; some  leading cadres have not been serious enough to tackle issues of  clean administration and to impose self-discipline on  themselves; some problems that have been exposed during in-house  checks have not been rectified; more force should be applied in  the work of investigating major and important cases; the results  of the drive to rectify unhealthy tendencies are not solid  enough; and some forms of unhealthy tendencies have not been  stopped. As the current task of anticorruption struggle remains  arduous, we should never slacken our vigilance.    To further step up and do an even better job in the three  areas of anticorruption work as demanded by the CPC Central  Committee and to achieve marked results in various stages, all  levels of party and government leading bodies, discipline  inspection, and supervision organs should review and check the  earlier stage of anticorruption work so as to discover remaining  shortcomings and weaknesses in the work, and to see if the  results so far achieved have met with the demands of the CPC  Central Committee and of the masses. They should, on that  basis, proceed with defining responsibility and adopting  measures to specifically implement the three areas of  anticorruption work. As the period between the present and next  year's Spring Festival is critical in achieving marked results  in the anticorruption struggle, localities and departments must  step up their work. It is necessary for leading cadres to  further consolidate and expand the results that they have  achieved in conducting clean administration and in imposing  self-discipline on themselves. Meetings to discuss democratic  life of leading bodies at and above county and bureau levels  should be appropriately reported and leading bodies should  accept the masses' evaluation and supervision. Problems  discovered through in-house checks should be properly handled  according to relevant stipulations. If departments and units  are found to have not properly done their in-house check and  self-rectification, or if the masses are not satisfied with the  results of their in-house check and self-rectification, they  must seriously make up for it. Verification and investigation  into the wrong-doing of a very small number of cadres, who incur  the wrath of the masses and who refuse to conduct  self-examination and self- rectification, should be conducted  and handled strictly if their wrong-doings are verified. More  efforts should be concentrated on investigating major and  important cases. It is necessary to speedily bring to a close  self-evident and irrefutable cases, particularly those involving  leading cadres. Cases which could have a major social impact  should be selectively made known to the public. It is necessary  to resolutely deal with those who obstruct investigation of  cases. We should resolutely stop unhealthy tendencies.  Continued efforts should be made to deal with problems related  to illegal collection of fees, and with cases involving those  who make overseas sightseeing tours at public expense. It is  important to make timely announcements on cancellation of  illegal fees collection. Personnel should be organized to check  and ensure that illegal fees that had been canceled are not  reintroduced. Leading organs responsible for management of  professions and trades should do a good job in rectifying  unhealthy tendencies in various professions and trades.    The current stage of anticorruption struggle happens to  fall during the two holidays of New Year and the Spring  Festival. The General Office of the CPC Central Committee issued  "A Circular on the Strict Banning of Feasting, Gift-Giving at  Public Expense and Waste and Extravagances During the Period of  1994 New Year and Spring Festival" and reiterated five  stipulations, which will greatly help promote the implementation  of the CPC Central Committee's three areas of anticorruption  work in the near future. All levels of party committees, and  government, discipline inspection, and supervision organs should  implement the circular by taking into consideration the reality  of various localities and various departments. The results of  the present stage of party- style and clean-administration  building and of the anticorruption struggle will put our ability  to spend a clean, joyous, and happy New Year and Spring Festival  to a real test. It is necessary for discipline inspection and  supervision organs to do a good job of publicizing the  "circular," enhancing supervision, and checking on enforcement.  Discipline must be strictly enforced on those who violate  discipline, and there should be no appeasement and leniency for  them. The deeds of those who seriously violate discipline and  have a very bad influence should be publicized. It is necessary  to closely integrate the implementation of the "circular's" five  stipulations with the implementation of the CPC Central  Committee's three areas of anticorruption work in the near  future. We must produce marked results in this stage of the  anticorruption struggle.    In addition to doing a good job of the above work, all  levels  of party committees and government discipline inspection and  supervision organs should, following the Spring Festival,  organize personnel to conduct investigation, study, and work out  plans for the next stage of the anticorruption work. Following  the Spring Festival, the Discipline Inspection Commission under  the CPC Central Committee and the Ministry of Supervision plan  to work out arrangements for the next stage of the  anticorruption struggle.</p>

			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JUNK BOND WRITE-DOWN RESPONSIBLE FOR ICA LOSS  </P> <P> Imperial Corp. of America's previously announced decision to write down the  value of its junk bond portfolio was the prime factor in a $103.1-million loss  for the quarter ended Sept. 30, the savings-and-loan holding company reported  Thursday.  </P> <P> The San Diego-based parent of Imperial Savings of California said before the  close of the third quarter that its $1.2-billion portfolio of high-yield,  high-risk bonds was worth $130 million less than what it had paid, after  accounting for previously taken loss reserves. The S&amp;L then said it would  be forced to write down the bonds to market value because of provisions of the  federal S&amp;L rescue bill passed last summer.  </P> <P> Before the third quarter ended, however, ICA's junk bonds deteriorated further,  and ICA ended up taking a write-off of $147 million, causing an after-tax loss  of $92.2 million attributable to the junk bonds, it said. The S&amp;L parent  had previously set aside loss provisions of $67 million for the bonds, bringing  total loss reserves to $214 million.  </P> <P> Included in the quarter's junk bond loss provisions was $11.8 million set aside  to cover losses on bonds issued by Integrated Resources, a troubled financial  services company. Combined with the $22 million in loss provisions set aside in  the second quarter, ICA now has written off $33.8 million of the $40-million  cost of its Integrated Resources bonds.  </P> <P> In addition, ICA set aside $33.5 million in third-quarter loan loss provisions,  a pretax charge. The provisions cover expected losses on real estate and  consumer loans, including auto loans serviced by Grand Wilshire Finance, which  declared bankruptcy last year.  </P> <P> The $103.1-million net loss for the quarter contrasts with net income of $11.8  million over the same three months last year. For the year to date, ICA's loss  stands at $136.2 million, contrasted with a profit of $27.7 million for the  comparable nine months last year.  </P> <P> In a bid to meet the S&amp;L rescue bill's tougher capital requirements, ICA  said previously that it planned to shrink assets by at least $2 billion in  coming quarters. As of Sept. 30, ICA total assets were down to $10.96 billion  from $12.3 billion Dec. 31.  </P></p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / France and Spain warn on Algeria France and Spain yesterday advised their nationals to leave Algeria after Moslem militants stabbed two Frenchmen to death in their Algiers home, writes Our Foreign Staff. Thirty-two foreigners have died in Algeria's civil strife since last September, eight of them French, but yesterday's killings were the first of foreigners inside their own homes. Only last month French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe refused to evacuate French nationals, saying it would 'play into the hands' of the extremists.</p>

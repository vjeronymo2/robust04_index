			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Aleksashenko: "Who Predicts a Collapse?"] </F>   [Text] At a recently held meeting with managers of  industrial enterprises the president said: "Unfortunately, the  economy is close to a collapse."    At first glance it is difficult to understand from where the  president took the information on a collapse. For example,  inflation confidently remains at between 8 to 10 percent per  month, which, as compared with last year's level, looks quite  proper. The dollar has risen so lazily that pictures, when the  "green" began even to dive down, are revived in the memory of  many people. One can enter a store (and not only in Moscow)  without fear and buy not only sprats in tomato sauce, but  something more appetizing. The population's income (officially  recorded by the State Committee for Statistics) is growing at  the rate of 10 to 12 percent. Of course, it is growing from a  low level, but it is really growing, that is, not merely in  rubles--the commodity content of these earned rubles is not  weakening.    Perhaps, the president possesses some additional  information?  Perhaps his advisers have at their disposal something that is  inaccessible to all the rest? However, as a result of my own  contacts with two directors of expert analytic groups in the  presidential administration, it is difficult to conclude that  they feel special pessimism.    Very likely, however, the president was not imbued with an  alarmist mood for nothing. He communicated with someone, someone  told him all this! Let us try to guess...    Managers of a number of the country's largest industrial  enterprises, for the most part, not the most successful, were  present at the meeting with the president. On the other hand,  almost all of them held the post of director for more than 1  year: under Leonid Ilich, under Yuriy Vladimirovich, under  Konstantin Ustinovich, under Mikhail Sergeyevich, and under  Boris Nikolayevich. Moreover, they were personally acquainted  with all of them and had entree to their offices. This is a  great deal for the protection of their interests in state  structures. I believe that the hitch lies in these very  interests.    The slow improvement in the economy places all enterprises  under new conditions, when it is necessary "to be in a whirl,"  to compete, and not to count on old contacts. Of course, it  would be much simpler to drop in to a familiar office and have  everything handed to you on a platter. However, today people  ask, but nothing is handed to them on a platter, or very rarely.  Perhaps this is a collapse? Perhaps, only not of the economy,  but of the vestiges of the old system.    Meanwhile, there is a sector in the economy, which does not  complain about nonpayments and does not ask the state for  preferential credit. If it asks for something, it is to lower  taxes a little bit (how can they be lowered if there is a whole  line of those wishing to have everything handed to them on a  platter!). This sector has a name--private business. Private not  only because it belongs to private individuals, but also because  it lives for private interests. It is not concerned with the  needs of an abstract "state"--it needs profit. But one obtains  profit only when one's products are bought.    However, people with entree to the president think "in a  state manner": "The country needs combines, trucks, tanks,  rockets, airplanes, cast iron, and steel." And it is not  important that no one wants to pay for these things. The people  do not understand their needs and, consequently, someone has to  think and decide for them.    For example, someone took it to his head "to add" something  for defense and to increase the defense order--it will be better  right away! We will spend on defense not every fifth ruble, as  last year, and not every fourth, as during the first quarter of  this year, but every third and, even better, every second! Even  if all these rubles will have to be printed in three shifts and  inflation will jump up to previous heights, it does not matter.  Why, of course, lads were taken out of tekhnikums without being  permitted to study for another 2 or 3 months in order to get the  diploma. Now they have to be fed, clothed, and armed and a  warrant officer and a captain over them have to be supported.  With regard to the fact that no one has said from where the  potential threat for us comes and how the army will cope with  this threat and with what arms--this is what a military secret  is for.    Nor is there a word about the fact that all these plants are  overloaded with mobilization capacities and with programs for  mobilization preparation, which for about 10 years (no less) no  one examined, but expenses must be borne. Free ZIL [Moscow Motor  Vehicle Plant imeni I.A. Likhachev] from this burden and perhaps  it will spread its wings. But for sure it will breathe more  freely and then will manufacture more refrigerators. In  addition, if one or two directors are removed, in order to teach  others not to run to offices, then perhaps in 3 or 4 years ZIL  motor vehicles will run not only on our, but also on foreign,  roads. Without anything being handed on a platter to anyone.</p>

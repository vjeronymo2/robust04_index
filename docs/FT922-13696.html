			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / People: Life cycles Scottish Legal Life Assurance Society, the Glasgow-based friendly society, has taken a big step into the 20th century by appointing its first chief executive in 142 years. Ron Baxter, 40, will join the society at the end of this month from Scottish Amicable, where he is assistant general manager of sales and marketing. Scottish Legal, a much smaller organisation with total assets of Pounds 130m, has only been able to appoint a chief executive since its constitution was changed last year. The move will also enable it to take advantage of the new opportunities for friendly societies created by the Friendly Societies Act, which was passed in the last week before the election campaign. At present, the society has 570 employees, and total income for last year was Pounds 19m. Like much of the Scottish life industry, it concentrates on selling regular premium with-profits savings policies. ***** National Westminster's insurance services division has a new managing director as the bank restructures its operations ahead of the new life assurance joint venture with Clerical Medical. Stephen Wells, 43, now takes over as managing director of National Westminster Insurance Services, while his predecessor, Stuart Frost, takes responsibility for integrating the new joint venture company with the bank's organisation. Wells joined NatWest in 1971, having gone to Royal Exchange Assurance when he left school. He is also a director of Ulster Bank Insurance Services. ***** Robert Gough becomes director of Sun Life Direct Marketing, and will be responsible for all the direct marketing which Sun Life does in conjunction with other companies. He has past experience with UDT, Save &amp; Prosper, and The Savings Corporation, which may come in useful in the direct marketing side of a company which traditionally sells through brokers. ***** Chris Davies, previously director of information technology at Fidelity International, is appointed general manager (information technology) at SUN LIFE. ***** Jonathon Baker is appointed director, SBJ MARINE REINSURANCE BROKERS. ***** John Ball has been promoted to information technology director, and Bill Rea to director for human resources of NATWEST LIFE. ***** Hugh McCoy has been appointed chairman of H CLARKSON; Tony Klima, Neil Freeland and Derek Hagger are retiring. Harry Weston is appointed a director of HORACE CLARKSON. ***** Richard Gough is appointed chief executive of SUN LIFE's new off-shore life assurance company based in the Isle of Man; he moves from ROYAL LIFE INTERNATIONAL. ***** David Wilson is appointed md of Personal Lines, in Caterham, part of BAIN CLARKSON. ***** Dennis Jenner is appointed to the board of ALEXANDER STENHOUSE UK. ***** AMEC, the construction and engineering group, is the latest to recruit Sir John Nott, the former defence secretary, as a non-executive director. His eclectic portfolio includes the chairmanship at Etam, the fashion retailer, and a directorship at Hillsdown Holdings, the food group. Bill Morgan, chairman from 1984 to 1988, Ray Mott, from Fairclough Building and on the main board since 1984, and Sir George Jefferson, former chairman of Matthew Hall taken over in 1988, have all retired from the board. ***** Allan Sutherland, director of finance of HERTZ UK, has died after a short illness ***** Tony Dignum, who became financial director of Dixons Retail Group in January, is to resign as financial director of Dixons Group from next month. This follows the recent decision to combine all retail activities into Dixons Retail Group. ***** Michael Boyle has been appointed finance director of COURTAULDS COATINGS. ***** Ian Phillips is appointed group estates director of JOHNSON GROUP CLEANERS. ***** Clive Line has been appointed finance director of CLUFF RESOURCES in place of Mark Ashley who is to take up another appointment overseas. ***** Christopher Varley, London-based managing director of Anheuser-Busch European Trade, has been appointed an executive vice-president of the US brewer's international division, ANHEUSER-BUSCH International, which was formed in 1981 to develop sales of its beer brands outside America. Varley joined A-B in 1989 from Grand Metropolitan. ***** Pizza Hut has added the final topping to its new layer of senior management with the announcement that David Donnelly is to become director of its UK restaurant operations. His appointment completes a new mix at Pizza Hut which has included the appointment of Steve Dunn as marketing director and Chris Martin as finance director. Pizza Hut UK, which has 280 outlets, is a joint venture between PepsiCo, its worldwide owners, and Whitbread, the sole British franchisee. Donnelly has been with Whitbread since 1983, latterly as managing director of TGI Friday's, the US-style bistros. ***** Christopher Stainforth, now rebuilding his City career following his acquittal in the Blue Arrow fraud trial, has been appointed a non-executive director of Bridgend, the industrial holding company. Stainforth, who was a senior corporate finance director with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew until his resignation over Blue Arrow, has also been acting as a financial consultant for a number of private and public companies.</p>

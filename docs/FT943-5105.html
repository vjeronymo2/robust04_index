			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Relaunch meets with general approval Union leaders yesterday congratulated themselves on a successful relaunch of the TUC, although some dissenters complained about aspects of the internal reforms and the change in style which has accompanied the move. Mr John Monks, the TUC general secretary, who has pushed through the relaunch, said it was about 'redirecting resources to where the action is, that means to Brussels and to the shopfloor'. The congress passed a composite motion broadly approving the relaunch, which stressed concentrating resources in fewer areas, reorganising the TUC committee system, and turning the TUC into a more effective lobbying organisation. However, Mr George Brumwell, general secretary of building union Ucatt, implicitly criticised Mr Monks' attempt to turn the TUC into a non-party-political lobbying organisation. 'It is futile lobbying in the corridors of power,' he said. There were also complaints about the smaller executive committee which now convenes between the quarterly meetings of the TUC general council. In addition, smaller unions believe some of the changes have been against their interests. Union officials say privately that the biggest test for the reforms will be whether the organisation can cease being a remote London-based body and can start to provide a useful service to local activists. Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, told congress that some of the Pounds 8.5m spent annually on the TUC goes on servicing local activists rather than union executives.</p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: NEXT ON 'OPRAHUE,' THAT WACKY IRAQI HIMSELF ...  </P> <P> "A.M. Los Angeles" arrived a little late on KABC-TV Channel 7 Friday because of  an ABC update from Peter Jennings on the Persian Gulf crisis.  </P> <P> When the show did come on, co-hosts Steve Edwards and Tawny Little briefly  discussed the news and Iraq President Saddam Hussein: "This bozo, this complete  idiot, this maniac!" said Little, angrily.  </P> <P> As it turned out, Hussein was a TV segue from heaven, for Little and Edwards  then proceeded to cite the just incredible similarities between the gulf crisis  and "Delta Force 2." That's the new Chuck Norris action movie ("The bad news .  . . America is losing another battle. The good news . . . the Delta Force is  going to war") that Norris was booked on the show to promote.  </P> <P> Well . . . Steve, Tawny and Chuck were all sort of open-mouthed: Hussein is  holding hostages; the Norris nemesis in "Delta Force 2," a drug czar, holds  Drug Enforcement Agency agents hostage. "In fact, it's sort of amazing," Norris  added later in his low-key way, "but in our film, the cocaine kingpin kills  people with chemicals . . . mustard gas."  </P> <P> You got the impression that this was either a coincidence or that Hussein had  an agent inside MGM and had gotten his ideas from the script for "Delta Force  2."  </P> <P> Edwards asked Norris what he thought President Bush should do about Hussein.  The actor wasn't really sure what to do about this Iraqi "nut case." Based on  its approving cheers and applause when one possible course of action was  suggested, however, the studio audience was absolutely sure what Bush should  do.  </P> <P> Send in Chuck Norris!  </P> <P> What an inspired tie-in to the gulf crisis. If only other shows were as smart  and inventive as "A.M. Los Angeles."  </P> <P> Perhaps they need some suggestions:  </P> <P> * "Donahue" -- Transvestite troops are the theme. Phil travels to Saudi Arabia  to personally check out rumors of widespread secret cross-dressing by Marines.  </P> <P> * "Geraldo" -- Appearing in silhouette, Mafia hit men tell how they would take  out Saddam Hussein.  </P> <P> * "Joan Rivers" -- Network anchors reporting on the Persian Gulf crisis: Do  they color their hair?  </P> <P> * "Oprah" -- Psychologists speculate on how many U.S. military officers were  child-abuse victims and whether their parents were overweight alcoholics.  </P> <P> * "Sally Jessy Raphael" -- Psychotic mothers of sailors talk about their love  affairs with men they tried to poison.  </P> <P> * "Donahue" -- Zsa Zsa Gabor tells Phil what she will do to Saddam Hussein if  he ever issues her a traffic ticket. Then six women tell Phil why they suspect  their bisexual husbands of being Iraqi spies.  </P> <P> * "Geraldo" -- Desert hookers with hearts of gold.  </P> <P> * "Joan Rivers" -- Desert gossip.  </P> <P> * "Oprah" -- What's really behind that veil? Beauty experts comment on the  possibility that the real reason some Arab women wear veils is to hide  skin-care problems.  </P> <P> * "Sally Jessy Raphael" -- The same beauty experts express alarm about  potential moisturizing problems faced by female military in the desert heat.  </P> <P> * "Donahue" -- Omar Sharif discusses Egypt's role in the gulf crisis.  </P> <P> * "Geraldo" -- After military underwear is modeled by Playboy centerfolds,  divorce attorneys give tips to U.S. servicemen whose wives decide to leave them  while they're serving in the Middle East. This is followed by Dr. Ruth's view  on war's impact on sex.  </P> <P> * "Joan Rivers" -- Mr. Blackwell presents his list of worst-dressed armies,  expressing utter disgust at the tackiness of American battle gear. "And those  drab gas masks!" he moans.  </P> <P> * "Oprah" -- An exclusive interview with seven people, including a tailor in  Philadelphia, who claim to be the real Saddam Hussein.  </P> <P> * "Sally Jessy Raphael" -- Mothers-in-law of six reservists reveal how their  sons-in-law turned their drug-addicted daughters against them before going on  active duty.  </P> <P> * "Entertainment Tonight" -- How They Would Have Done It: The producers of  "Married . . . With Children" critique the production values of Hussein's  hostage video.  </P> <P> * "A Current Affair" -- Do Saddam Hussein and Gen. Noriega have a special  relationship?  </P> <P> * "David Letterman" -- Stupid camel tricks.  </P></p>

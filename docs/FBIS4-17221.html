			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] 21 April TASS -- Moldovan Prime  Minister Andrei Sangheli said the Republic would settle its  debts for the gas supplied by Russia's Gasprom gas company by  the end of May.    Last week, the Russian state-run gas giant cut down  deliveries to Moldova by one third and threatened to cut off gas  supplies completely unless the Republic repaid its debt.    According to Sangheli, Moldova has already paid off part of  its gas debt. The point at issue now is 108 billion rubles owed  by Moldovan gas consumers, mostly from the Dniester region which  is suffering grave economic difficulties at the moment. The  Moldovan prime minister reported that Kishinev and Tiraspol  experts were presently considering possibilities of finding  money to urgently repay the republic's debt. He expressed hope  that the issue would be solved by joint efforts and supplies of  Russian gas would be resumed in the full volume.</p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Observer: Alan Wheatley On February 24, I criticised Alan Wheatley, former senior London partner of Price Waterhouse, for resigning as chairman of 3i and for declining to become a director and chairman of Tring. I accept that Mr Wheatley's reasons for both decisions were far removed from those suggested, and that my criticisms of Mr Wheatley as a company chairman were wholly unjustified. I am pleased to set the record straight.</p>

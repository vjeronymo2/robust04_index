			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 9/4/1994 -- Several leaders of  the opposition parties making up the Democratic Convention of  Romania [CDR] expressed at a press conference on Saturday, 9  April, their decision to use all possibilities offered by the  present political situation in order to prevent early elections.    Ion Diaconescu (National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party  -- PNTCD), Dinu Patriciu (Liberal Party '93 -- PL '93), Attila  Verestoy (Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania -- UDMR),  and Nicolae Taran (Civic Alliance Party -- PAC) maintained that  the time for theoretical discussions had passed and that  concrete solutions were necessary. They claimed the opposition  had these solutions to offer.    Dinu Patriciu said that the dialogue with the ruling party  [Social Democracy Party of Romania -- PDSR] could resume only if  the Vacaroiu cabinet resigned. The representatives of the CDR  member parties concluded that they could resume the dialogue  with the ruling party if PDSR understood "it is not the  country's master but its servant."    CDR leader Emil Constantinescu presented to the press  conference a "Manifesto for Romania's Salvation," whereby the  CDR suggests several measures termed as "simple and efficient,"  meant to boost Romania's recovery from the crisis caused by "a  incompetent and corrupt" government.    Considering themselves rightful to fight by any legal and  democratic means for the nation's rescue, the CDR member parties  call for: A "tough and fair" justice able to stop corruption;  the allotment to the local administration of at least 18 percent  of the taxes paid by the population; the cancellation of the  farm taxes and the finalization of the process of granting the  property title deeds; jobs to be created through investments and  privatization; social protection for the youth, unemployed, and  underprivileged; increased budgetary funds allotted to  education, health, and culture; the Armed Forces' endowment to  strengthen the defense capacity; and integration within the  Euro-Atlantic structures and a stop to the slide toward other  spheres of influence.</p>

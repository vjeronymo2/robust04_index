			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Scharping appeal on Stasi links Mr Rudolf Scharping, the leader of Germany's opposition Social Democrats, has called for a partial amnesty for those who co-operated with former east Germany's Stasi secret police. The plea re-opens an issue that has divided east and west Germans and has pitted east Germans against one another as they come to terms with one of the most hated and insidious institutions of the communist period. Mr Scharping said it was time to grant some partial amnesty for former Stasi employees on the grounds that it was preventing 'inner unification', and time to rehabilitate some of these people. An amnesty might also have the effect of diluting support for the PDS, the successor to the former east German Communist party, which contains former Stasi members. More than 109,000 people are estimated to have collaborated with the Stasi, one of the most efficient secret police forces in communist eastern Europe. A law was passed in December 1991 allowing east Germans access to their files. It also allows public and private institutions access, to screen employees. Mr Scharping's plea was supported by Mr Stefan Heym, the east German writer and member of the PDS who was recently elected to the Bundestag, or lower house. But Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democratic party and senior members of the Gauck Commission, the institution responsible for supervising the files, have opposed any amnesty. Mr Geiger said there were still more than 400,000 outstanding requests by individuals wishing to see their files and the commission was receiving about 500 requests a day. By last April more than 720,000, most of them east Germans, had applied to see whether their names had appeared on any of the files. The material remains politically explosive. Prominent east German politicians, including Mr Gregor Gysi, parliamentary head of the PDS, are alleged to have collaborated with the Stasi. Mr Gysi has vehemently denied these allegations. Opinion among east Germans remains divided about keeping the files open.</p>

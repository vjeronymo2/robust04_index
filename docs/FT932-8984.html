			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Travel: Gratified by the Gower - Snapshot / Jill James braves the rain to visit a Welsh haven of great beauty WE HAD to guess where the centre of the road lay. Up to our axles in muddy brown water with the rain beating down on our car, and apparently miles from anywhere, we were beginning to fret. The drive from Llanrhidian to Penclawdd, to take a look at birdlife on the marshes of the Gower coast, seemed a good way of spending a battleship-grey morning in south Wales on a family holiday. But we had not reckoned on the havoc a combination of spring tides and torrential rain would wreak on the peninsula's little roads. Away from the marshes, fields and roads alike were becoming lakes and drainage channels at roadside edges were turning into streams. Yet still we pressed on, taking the car inch by inch across flooded patches of road and praying that the carburettor and spark plugs would not be the first to drown. Unidentifiable birds flew arrow straight across the vast expanse of dull sky which met the misty green of marsh and reed in the far distance. Boats sat in fields waiting for the incoming tide to mop them up. The peninsula is a paradise for soul searchers, depressives, the intrepid and villains with bodies to dispose of (although you cannot move off the marsh roads because of the signs warning of unexploded bombs - leftovers from the area's use by the military). Above the marshes young lambs bullocked and bumped their way around the sodden fields while their mothers stood stolidly chewing the wet, green-growing grass, oblivious to us and the weather. Gower (Gwyr in Welsh) will appeal to those who want a simple break. There is no railway, no cinema and no smart restaurant. By way of compensation there is magnificent walking, golden, safe beaches (on the south side) and enough of historical and archaeological interest to feed fertile family interest for a fortnight. Local pubs serve good local beer (Felinfoel). Cockles, laverbread (boiled seaweed, a peculiarly Welsh delicacy) and warm welcomes are available almost everywhere. In August and on bank holiday weekends, the roads are choc-a-bloc with cars and caravans as holidaymakers seek out the castles, cromlechs, downs and - most of all - the vast sandy bays which are one of the glories of this peninsula, which dips its foot into the Bristol Channel just after you leave Swansea. The area has deservedly been declared one of outstanding natural beauty. Its climax is the 16 miles of sands, limestone headlands and cliffs that form its southern coast and which are topped by the village of Rhosili. Just a few houses, a shop and a hotel cluster around the church of St Mary, which contains a memorial to Edgar Evans, the Rhosili man who died with Captain Scott on the return from the South Pole. From the big National Trust car park there is a walk out to the Worms Head - a rock which winds out to sea like the serpent or dragon that the Norsemen are said to have named it after. Shipwrecks in the sands of Rhosili bay intrigue serious walkers and children alike. They may even tread in the footsteps of the old Celtic saints who have left their names all over the area's churches: Cattwg, Teilo, Madog, Cennydd and Dewi. My abiding memory will be looking out over the bay on a misty evening as the ghostly surf swept all before it. Getting there: There are no trains and we never saw a bus although we did see people waiting at shelters. Best way in is by car from the M4 motorway taking the B road down through Sketty on the outskirts of Swansea. Staying there: Bed and breakfast places are scattered around. A good traditional Welsh pub with a coal fire and friendly, child-tolerant staff is the Greyhound at Llanrhidian.</p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Survey of Personal and Portable Computers (20): IBM poised to compete - Personal Digital Assistants THE POINT about the computer of the future is that it is a phone. For the past 10 years the computer industry has been trying to sell computers to people who do not buy them. The sticking point has always been that people buy applications, not computers. There is no single application that the buyer who does not need a spreadsheet, database, word processor or games-playing machine views as a 'must'. So enter the Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), the phone, the entirely different model. Apple fired the first shot in the PDA wars about a year ago, announcing its Newton device would be on the way, but it looks as if the industrial muscle of IBM and AT&amp;T will make the running. Starting from the premise that the basic components of a computer - CPU, memory, screen and credit card expansion - can be boiled down into a cellphone-sized package, those companies can then work out sets of applications for them. Mr Paul Mugge, head of Entry Systems Technology, IBM's R&amp;D division, at Boca Raton, Florida, thinks of these as 'personality' modules. A credit card-sized wireless modem, for example, could be slotted in and used by a student to download information from the college library. Games modules could be fitted to turn it into a games machine, or it could be a portable TV or personal entertainment system. All of these could theoretically use a wireless modem - if it's a TV, for example, one might just download films from the local video library. Mr Mugge goes as far as to paint a picture of a 'virtual mall' where an entire computer-generated model of a shopping mall could be used by any number of people with any number of PDAs. His problem, however, is that he has to make at least some of these goals achievable by the end of the year, launching and selling what will probably be small quantities of PDAs into a definable market. AT&amp;T sees the PDA market as eventually being in the billions, 'basically the number of telephone handsets in the world if we're being modest, and the number of people in the world if we're not', and Mr Mugge himself accepts that for his dreams to come true, units have to sell at consumer prices, say Dollars 99 or Pounds 99, depending on which side of the Atlantic you're on. IBM spokesmen, however, speak of a substantially higher initial price, the Pounds 500-Pounds 1,000 being basically dictated by prices in the cellphone market, which is probably the PDA's first achievable target. The first IBM demonstration units indicate the type of machine that the company intends to test this summer. They are slightly larger and heavier than the current generation cellphones, but are of similar shape. Rather than a keypad or keyboard, they have a touch-screen and pen combination which allows different key or number layouts to be used, and also gives the computer-phone some note-taking capabilities. Instead of the new generation operating systems, such as Go's PenPoint, Microsoft's Pen Windows or IBM's own pen extensions to OS/2, they use a custom version of the PC-DOS operating system that has been running on desktop PCs for 10 years. Mr Lee Reiswig, IBM software president, sees DOS - which was developed to run on low-power computers - as the operating system to be used on machines with limited power, and IBM's PDA is one of the first examples in that kind of setting. Although its basic system is DOS, the machine uses what is described as a 'custom shell' sitting on top, and users need never see the systems that lie underneath. In this way, IBM should have a chance of establishing itself in the cellphone market, by offering basic phone services plus smart messaging, computer communications, notepad and personal organiser functions. As the cellular market itself grows out of its niche, PDA suppliers should be able to grow with, or even ahead of, it. Although IBM has historically been known for producing high-value machines, the company now looks well-geared to exploit the market for low-cost, hand-held devices. Along with Intel, IBM runs the Robert Noyce Center research project in Boca Raton. Its primary goal is to produce a super-integrated PC-on-a-chip based on Intel's x86 processor. This will provide brains for the PDAs, which will be compatible with current industry standards. IBM is also one of the few substantial memory manufacturers outside south - east Asia, and is investing heavily in the next generation, while it is also one of the few western companies involved in developing flat panel colour displays. Heavy research in multimedia, together with its alliance with Apple, may not have an effect on the first generation of IBM PDAs, but as the devices move from high-price specialist business tools to low-cost consumer toys, knowledge of how to handle sound and video will also become important.</p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Election '92: Lean team looks to the last lap - The Campaign Machine, Labour / How the party plans to avoid a re-run of the 1987 race FOUR times, or was it five? The talking point among Labour's spin doctors yesterday morning was how often broadcasters on Monday had referred to Mr John Smith as the chancellor. It is not difficult to see how the slips occured. Labour had teed up the shadow Budget to emulate the real thing. A Budget box and a walk with a borrowed dog in St James's Park were rejected as over the top. But it was launched in the Edwardian sobriety of the Institution of Civil Engineers and was intentionally free of the glitz, posters and slogans that characterise a normal Labour press conference. Details such as the Red Book and even the phrasing of Mr Smith's speech - 'I turn now to taxation . . . ' - were mobilised to maximum effect. The fruits emerged in Martyn Lewis's chancellor blunder to an audience of more than 8m viewers on BBC's Nine O'Clock News. How much does any of this matter? Labour's view is that, with the main parties level, every trick helps. Its switch of its Budget launch to Monday, for example, casually blasted Mr Ashdown's manifesto off the front pages and down the schedules. Buoyed by these successes, the campaign team makes some grander boasts. This week it argued that it had tricked Mr Lamont into the 20p tax band by hinting this was the course favoured by Labour. A 1p base-rate cut in the Tory Budget would, they say, have been politically more counter-productive. True? Who knows. But the claim seeks to feed the impression that the Opposition is hungrier and smarter than its opponents. The battle plan rests with a slimline inner team - the eight-strong campaign management committee - that meets at dawn and dusk to direct operations. These backroom generals will run the party as Mr Neil Kinnock zig-zags across the country. The publicly known faces are Mr Jack Cunningham, the affable, if sometimes brittle, campaign co-ordinator and Mr Bryan Gould, the camera-friendly shadow environment secretary, who headed the highly praised but unsuccessful 1987 effort. Less-known, but at least as important, are Mr David Hill, sitting in Mr Peter Mandelson's vacated chair as communications director, and Ms Patricia Hewitt, a one-time Kinnock press officer, architect of the new professionalism in 1987 and an author of the manifesto. They will have a decisive role with Mr Neil Stewart, a close aide from the leader's inner office, in selling any switch in strategy to Mr Kinnock. Other team members include Mr Larry Whitty, Labour general secretary, and Mr Philip Gould, chief of the ghostly Shadow Communications Agency that handles Labour's advertising and image. The group's strategy has long been mapped out. First, Labour confronted the Tories' tax and spending plans head-on with the shadow Budget. Second, at today's manifesto launch, it will tie its Budget proposals with its public investment priorities in an upbeat tone of Euro-social democracy, contrasted with a Toryism depicted as ideological, dry and out of touch. The second week must build a bridge between the party's plans for the economy and its offensive on its 'winning agenda' for the National Health Service and schools. For the final days, the party will wrap the package up with a big bow, inscribed: It's Time for Labour. That is the theory. Yet the strategists know that life is not so smoothly manipulable. They remember from 1987 that gaffes and the unexpected often spell the difference between success and failure. Mr Kinnock argues that it was lack of liaison over tax policy that undid the triumphs of 'Kinnock - The Movie', the much-praised party election broadcast, directed by Mr Hugh Hudson, and prevented the Tories being held to a majority of half the actual outcome. Elaborate precautions have been taken against a repetition; spokesmen are under strict instruction to consult before they comment. Unadorned with Vote Labour stickers, a nationwide team of assessors has been set up. They will monitor the regional media and check the hospitals for slip-ups or cutbacks to feed through to the grandly named Media Initiatives Unit as raw material for news stories. It sounds like something from a John le Carre novel. The team, originally dubbed the 10 Last Days committee, hopes to learn from the Tories' wobbly Thursday in 1987 when a panicked Mrs Thatcher stepped in to reorder the Conservative campaign. The assessors will provide objective data to allow headquarters an overview in case a different direction is needed as fatigue sets in on the last lap.</p>

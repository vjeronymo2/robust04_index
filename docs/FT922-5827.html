			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Arts: Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know On January 2 1815 Lord Byron awoke and found himself married: 'Good God, I am surely in Hell'. One feels the same watching Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know, the life of Byron at The Ambassadors Theatre. One is forced to be intimate with someone one does not recognise. This distillation of extracts from Byron's letters, table talk, diaries and poems is neither mad nor dangerous. Neither is it quintessential Byron, far from the pan-European hero, exile and archetype who died at Missolonghi in 1824. The author-director, Jane McCulloch, an experienced writer of theatre-biography, spreads the action too thinly across the available material. The enterprise courts superficiality: 36 years of hard living, facile writing and stormy friendships cannot be compassed in two hours on stage. The play's problem starts with its chronological approach. McCulloch rightly wants one to know the extraordinary life, but in finding sequence, the play loses focus and depth. Each scene closes neatly, but does not help our understanding of Byron; instead it offers where he was and when. The interventions arrive clumsily: 'So here I am at Cambridge' (Byron), 'I like being Lady in Waiting to Queen Charlotte' (lover) or 'He was well aware that Don Juan would cause a stir' (narrator). The difficulties continue by ignoring Byron's misanthropy and melancholy, 'the deep midnight of the mind,' the sense that Byron's life, like Keats's and Shelley's before him, became a Romantic way of dying. The play lacks the shadows and inwardness, those essentials of Byronic man. It rarely touches on the misogyny - 'Do you know? I hate women' - which drove Byron to devote himself so much to loving and leaving. It is even more disappointing that Mad, Bad has moments of achieved success, particularly in the interchanges between Byron and Lady Caroline Lamb, in 'She Walks in Beauty', and in Byron's letter of 1813 warning that pleasure can be anticipated or recalled, never experienced. These scenes generate intensity and demand concentration. They need refining and fashioning. The lighting and music conspire to be culpably anodyne. Both are well but wrongly done: few changes of lighting give little visual variety; and in a play about Byron, why not one glimmering taper or midnight study scene? The music (settings of Byron's poems) is shapely, and accurately sung; but why not one contemporary line from Schubert or Beethoven? Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know survives because of superb acting by both Derek Jacobi (Byron) and Isla Blair (the women and narrator). They redeem and carry what should be a much better show. Of course, Byron has a word for harsh reviewers: 'A man must serve his time to every trade Save censure - critics all are ready made.' Ambassadors Theatre, London. (071) 836 6111</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: Novo Nordisk sales up 14% Novo Nordisk, the Danish drugs and enzymes group, has increased pre-tax profits by 11 per cent, to DKr1.86bn (Dollars 277m), for 1993, on a 14 per cent rise in sales to DKr12.2bn. The company said the rising yen and strong sales of growth hormone to the Japanese market made a significant contribution to the performance. Earnings per share increased to DKr38.01 from DKr34.12, and return on equity was 12.7 per cent. An unchanged DKr4-a-share dividend was to be paid. The improved turnover stemmed party from a better product mix, Novo said. However, 40 per cent of the sales rise was attributed to Japan, to which sales improved 43 per cent. The figure takes into account a 23 per cent appreciation of the yen against the krone. The share of group sales going to Japan increased to 17 per cent from 14 per cent. Sales of human growth hormone to Japan were especially strong, the company said. The performance was in line with company forecasts. A year ago, Novo said pre-tax profits would fall below the 15 per cent annual growth which the group seeks to achieve. For 1994, Novo expects a larger increase in pre-tax profits than last year, assuming currencies remain stable and prices on securities markets remain unchanged. Health care division sales last year increased by 16 per cent to DKr8.22bn, with insulin and diabetes care sales ahead by 11 per cent. Sales of biopharmaceuticals products, including growth hormone, rose by 34 per cent, and other pharmaceuticals by 30 per cent, boosted by the introduction of a new anti-depressant in the Nordic markets. Sales of bio-industrial products, including enzymes, were up by 8 per cent to DKr3.34bn. Capital expenditure reached a record DKr2.39bn, where it is expected to remain in 1994.</p>

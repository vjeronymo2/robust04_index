			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> D. A. LOOKING AT MAYOR'S ACTIONS IN PROPERTY VOTE;  </P> <P> LANCASTER: THE CITY OFFICIAL HAS ACKNOWLEDGED GETTING A SUBSEQUENT $9,780  COMMISSION, BUT SAYS HE DID NOT KNOW HE WAS TO RECEIVE IT.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has opened a formal  investigation to determine whether Lancaster Mayor William Pursley should face  criminal conflict-of-interest charges for voting on a property from which he  later earned a nearly $10,000 sales commission.  </P> <P> County prosecutors have been informally reviewing Pursley's actions, which  appear to be in violation of state conflict-of-interest laws, since they were  disclosed last month in The Times.  </P> <P> "When we feel there may be something substantive to it, we open an  investigation and look into it more closely," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom  Wenke, a prosecutor in the special investigations division, which handles  criminal probes of official misconduct by politicians.  </P> <P> Pursley's attorney, Robert Berke, said he had not heard of the district  attorney's decision to intensify the inquiry and had no other comment. Pursley  has acknowledged his council vote and commission income, but insists that he  did not know at the time of the vote that he was to receive money from the  sale.  </P> <P> Wenke said he could not discuss how the inquiry will be conducted or how long  it will last. But in a similar case involving Lancaster officials from 1983 to  1985, district attorney investigators conducted scores of interviews, gathered  city records and served search warrants at two businesses.  </P> <P> The Pursley investigation will focus on the mayor's introduction of and vote on  a measure passed by the Lancaster council June 18, which reduced a city  easement on land owned by Clyde Golding, one of Pursley's business partners.  Golding said the council action was instrumental in clinching a pending sale of  the one-acre parcel. Pursley, his real estate agent, earned a $9,780  commission.  </P> <P> State law makes it illegal for public officials to vote on or participate in  decisions in which they have a foreseeable financial interest. Apart from the  criminal investigation, Pursley's case is also under review by the state's Fair  Political Practices Commission, which can fine violators.  </P> <P> Officials convicted of criminal conflict of interest, a misdemeanor charge, can  be barred from running for office for four years. Although offenders can face  jail time, such cases are rare and most violators are fined by the FPPC.  </P> <P> County prosecutors have only filed several such cases in recent years,  including one in which former Lancaster Councilman Louis Bozigian was acquitted  in 1986. Prosecutors had charged that Bozigian voted for a street map that  benefited property he was representing.  </P> <P> To obtain a conviction, the prosecution must prove its case beyond a reasonable  doubt and obtain a unanimous jury verdict.  </P></p>

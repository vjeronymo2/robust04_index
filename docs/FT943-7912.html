			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Hong Kong tycoons face property probe: Louise Lucas on claims of collusion at a sale In coming weeks, many of Hong Kong's rich and powerful will be paying a visit to the dingy offices of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), the government body charged with stamping out corruption in the colony. The subject matter, privately described as 'cheating the government out of HKDollars 2bn' (Pounds 167m) falls under the prevention of bribery ordinance. The investigation, sparked by public complaints, follows a land auction on May 26 at which developers are alleged to have colluded to secure two properties at bargain prices. The probe will seek to establish whether the auction was rigged: that is, to discover if any developers may have offered rival companies an option to share a stake in a particular property at a 'controlled' price rather than letting true competition take its course and allow the highest bid to win ownership. Investigators have spent several weeks talking to observers at the auction, including analysts and reporters, with the result that one Hong Kong newspaper, Ming Pao, is also now being investigated. The newspaper is alleged to have breached section 30 of the prevention of bribery ordinance, which makes it an offence to disclose the identity and details of persons being investigated. Ming Pao says the public had a right to know. A video tape played to millions of television viewers that evening shows clearly the movement of developers during the auction, which one analyst said was blatantly rigged. Another described the developers as 'buzzing around like besuited flies'. The two plots of land were subsequently snapped up at prices sharply below market expectations. The main site, a 233,000 sq ft plot in Fanling earmarked for luxury low-rise homes, went for HKDollars 2.04bn to a consortium including Sun Hung Kai Properties, Nan Fung Development, Sino Land, DBS Land, Cheung Kong, Paliburg Development, Hang Lung Development, Swire Properties, Henderson Land, Kerry Properties and New World Development. The price compared with expectations in the range of HKDollars 3bn to HKDollars 4bn. The second plot, 63,000 sq ft in Yuen Long, also in the New Territories, went for HKDollars 510m to a consortium of 14 developers, as against an expected HKDollars 700m to HKDollars 1bn. Earlier in the day, representatives of many of the same companies met at the City Hall coffee shop. All were Hang Seng Index constituent stocks and boasted a combined value of more than HKDollars 400bn. Auctions in Hong Kong are generally considered too important to leave in the hands of underlings, and those at the table were mostly tycoons such as Mr Thomas Kwok, managing director of Sun Hung Kai Properties and, with his family, the group's senior shareholder; Mr Albert Chow, deputy managing director of Mr Li Ka-shing's Cheung Kong; and Mr Ronnie Chan, chairman of Hang Lung Development. Technically, those found guilty of the Section 7 bribery in relation to auctions offences can face a maximum fine of HKDollars 500,000, a seven-year prison sentence, and an order to pay an amount, the equal or part of, the advantage received - which in this case could as high as HKDollars 2bn. In practice, this is a case with scant precedent. Of the handful of auction bribery cases that have come before the commission only one has resulted in a prosecution. That case, more than five years ago, involved hawkers who colluded at a government auction of market stalls and were fined a few hundred HK dollars. But property prices are a political minefield in Hong Kong at the moment. The developers' immediate reason for the jumbo consortium was that it was a means of spreading risk - the uncertain property environment, generated by the government's pledge to cool prices, prevented any one of them making such a sizeable investment on their own. Mr Chris Patten, the governor, signalled his intention to tackle property prices in March. In June, the government announced an increase in the supply of land for residential development and changes to the way builders bring properties to market. These measures slashed the proportion of flats allocated to insiders, such as staff and associates. Analysts doubt whether the measures will take much more than 10 to 20 per cent off property prices this year: a small cut given the 200 per cent leap that has driven the market in the past three years. However, at the time of the May auction the measures had not been announced, and the developers claimed caution was necessary. The probe also calls into question the government's own handling of the May 26 auction. While some believe the auction ought to have been nullified on the spot, given the mass of activity on the auction floor, the government's immediate response was to express satisfaction: the properties had, after all, gone for prices above the opening bids. Later came a promise to look into the auction, which resulted in some mild restrictions, mainly hampering movement around auction halls. When Mr Tony Eason, secretary for planning, environment and lands, briefed a select group of stock analysts and property agents on the measures, before presenting them to the Legislative Council, relief at their lack of severity sent the futures index soaring 200 points in the final 45 minutes of trading. This caused the government further embarrassment, as brokers not invited to the briefing complained that their more privileged peers had a chance to act on the news while the market was open. Mr Eason claimed the briefing had contained nothing which could be regarded as market sensitive. However, with the June property measures now announced, the May 26 auction has left the government having to address a whole new furore in the property market.</p>

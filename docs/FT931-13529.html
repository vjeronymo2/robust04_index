			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Letter: The real nature and scale of IBM's problems Sir, The FT's various commentaries on IBM and its record losses reflect widespread misunderstanding as to both the nature and the scale of the corporation's problems. IBM's troubles have been brewing for a very long time. For two decades, IBM has been suffering an erosion of relative market share. For nearly half of that time, under the chairmanship of John Akers, the profit-spinning mainframe side of the business has been virtually stagnant. In the computer industry, these are extremely long time-frames. IBM itself, not being entirely stupid, has been well aware of the trends. Yet, virtually nothing effective has been done to meet the changing world. The commonly cited issue of IBM's size is irrelevant. If IBM grew to be a certain size by meeting market requirements, it cannot follow that it is suddenly too big to meet the needs of what are by and large the same customers. Breaking IBM into smaller units, each with management even worse than that enjoyed by the corporation overall, will not solve the problem. The roots of IBM's problems have little to do with technology and everything to do with culture and ethics. By fostering a paternalistic, conformist culture which is light-years away from competitive capitalism, and by trying to tie customers for new types of items to old or proprietary products (in networking and operating systems, for example), IBM has magnified, not lessened, its grief. The corporation's inability to work well with new types of marketeers to distribute low-end products is part of this 'enclosed' mentality. IBM's future is indeed grim, but more accurate analysis by the press might help both computer users and the industry (including IBM) to see the issues more clearly.

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Serb president orders release of ailing opposition leader SERBIAN PRESIDENT Slobodan Milosevic yesterday ordered the release of jailed opposition leader Mr Vuk Draskovic and his wife Danica. Mr Draskovic had been on hunger strike for eight days in protest against his detention after a violent anti-government demonstration on June 1. The order for the couple's release came after intense international pressure and a warning from doctors treating Mr Draskovic in the main Belgrade hospital that he 'could die in a matter of hours'. While thousands gathered in Belgrade's central square to celebrate, Mr Draskovic had to stay overnight in the Belgrade hospital where he had been kept, too ill to be moved. Mr Milosevic said: 'The events accompanying the legal proceedings against Vuk Draskovic are creating a very ugly picture beneath the dignity of our nation.' Mr Draskovic was being freed because of 'a real political and media campaign against Serbia organised by some countries. . . .because of its battle for freedom and equality.' Mr Milosevic said Mrs Draskovic would also be freed in order to avoid 'humiliating' Mr Draskovic. 'The two people are extremely attached to one another and their feelings must be respected.' The Draskovices were arrested on June 1 after an anti-government protest in which a policeman died and 28 people were hurt. Police severely beat the couple while in jail. They later went to hospital, under heavy police guard, because of the injuries. Faced with the possibility of mass unrest if Mr Draskovic died, Mr Milosevic issued the order for his release. However, he made clear that Mr Draskovic, head of the Serbian Renewal party, the country's largest opposition group, would still face assault charges against a policeman. The order came only a few hours after the German government and US President Bill Clinton pressed for the release of the couple from prison. In Sarajevo, meanwhile, the first cases of typhus were reported yesterday as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees warned that the city was on the 'brink of disaster'. Bosnia radio reported an outbreak of seven cases of typhus and 700 cases of dysentery in the shattered capital. Bosnia's collective presidency voted against the ethnic division of Bosnia and called for a new London conference on the war-torn republic. Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediator, is due to meet eight of the 10 members of the rotating leadership today in Zagreb, the Croatian capital.</p>

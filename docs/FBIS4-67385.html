			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mykhaylo Kuzmenko, head of the Department of </F> Radioecology at the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences  Hydrobiological Institute: "How Do You Feel, Dnieper?]    [Text] The fate of the Dnieper River is in the fate of  Ukraine. The fate of Ukraine is in the fate of the Dnieper  River. From times immemorial, the Dnieper has been a source of  livelihood, a defender, and a savior for the people who lived in  its valley. Its banks became a cradle for the Ukrainian nation  and for the first human cereal-growing civilization -- the  Trypillya culture. The genius of Ukraine's great son T.G.  Shevchenko matured and derived inspiration on the banks of the  Dnieper. The immortal bard found his last refuge there, too....    For the majority of Ukraine's population -- 35 million  persons -- the Dnieper continues to be the indispensable source  of drinking water; it satisfies the needs of industry and  irrigated agriculture; it is also used as an economic transport  line. Not to mention the Dnieper's significance for the  spiritual world of the people as a source for literary and  artistic creativity!    Throughout its age-old history, the Slavutych [a poetic name  for the Dnieper] repeatedly suffered enfeebling droughts and  destructive floods. However, recent decades have become  particularly ominous for the great river. The epoch of  hydrological construction culminated in the creation of six  water reservoirs: Kiev, Kaniv, Kremenchuk, Dniprodzerzhynsk,  Zaporizhzhya, and Kakhovka. The semi-flowing water reservoirs,  created in the flat- country river, have lost their eternal  purity and the life-giving properties of the Dnieper water. The  yearly mass development of blue-green algae -- the algal bloom,  the formation of slime, the swamping of huge shallow-water  areas, the chemical pollution, and, as a result, the sharp  deterioration of the biological quality of the water -- this is  a very incomplete list of afflictions suffered by Ukraine's  life-giving artery.    Great changes have taken place in the qualitative  composition  of the ichthyofauna; valuable species of fish -- sturgeon, pike,  and carp -- have disappeared or decreased in number, whereas  fish of inferior value, such as clupeids, gudgeon, or rudd, have  multiplied.    However, the Chernobyl nuclear tornado has introduced the  most dreadful poison into the Dnieper. As a result of the  accident, the natural ecosystems in the Dnieper Basin have also  undergone wide- scale radioactive contamination. On the first  days after the catastrophe, fragments of uranium fissure were  driven by the wind in various directions and over huge distances  away from the Chernobyl Atomic Electric Power Plant,  contaminating woods, fields, water reservoirs and becoming  deposited in plant and animal organisms.    Prior to the accident, the background content of  radionuclides in the water of the Kiev Reservoir was as follows:  strontium-90, between 0.00407 and 0.00682 becquerels per liter;  cesium-137, between 0.00074 and 0.0037 becquerels per liter.  The radioecological situation in the Dnieper and in its  reservoirs largely took shape during the first weeks and months  following the accident, when the content of radionuclides in the  water reached between 0.04 and 1,332 becquerels per liter and up  to 800,000 becquerels per kilogram of natural moisture content  in bottom deposits.    Among the main tasks during the period that has passed after  the accident there was work associated with the protection of  water bodies, in particular, the building of dams and traps on  the path of the main flows of radionuclides and the fixation of  soil in the areas of drainage. Despite the considerable  expenditure and the large volume of work aimed at reducing the  travel of radionuclides from the 30-kilometer zone, the escape  of radionuclides to the Prypyat River, the Dnieper River, and  its reservoirs could not be appreciably reduced.    For example, at the end of 1993, the content of  radionuclides  in the Kiev Water Reservoir was as follows: in bottom  sediments, 26 becquerels per kilogram strontium-90 and 815  becquerels per kilogram cesium-137; in plants, respectively, 102  and 407; in mollusks, 138 and 195; and in fishes, 13 and 211. At  the present stage, the radioecological situation in the Dnieper  and its reservoirs remains unstable. The content of  radionuclides in the water is between 10 and 20 and in aqueous  organisms 30 to 1,500 times that prior to the accident. Some  carnivorous fishes in the Kiev Reservoir were found to contain  cesium-137 in quantities that were one and one-half times the  permissible level established in 1993 by the National Commission  for Radiation Protection.</p>

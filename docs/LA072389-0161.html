			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOY PROPELS HIMSELF INTO THE RECORD BOOK;  </P> <P> YOUNGEST PILOT EVER TO FLY AROUND THE WORLD TOUCHES DOWN IN ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> Eleven-year-old Tony Aliengena landed his plane at John Wayne Airport on  Saturday, after a sometimes treacherous 21,567-mile odyssey which made him the  youngest pilot to circumnavigate the globe.  </P> <P> The fourth-grader from San Juan Capistrano performed a low fly-by for a  welcoming crowd of about 100, then bought the borrowed Cessna 210 Centurion to  a landing by a red carpet on the airstrip where he and his family departed June  5.  </P> <P> Tony's 2:28 p.m. arrival brought applause and cheers from friends and  supporters who gathered on a balloon-festooned Tarmac outside Martin Aviation,  which helped sponsor Tony's trip.  </P> <P> With hordes of news people looking on, Tony taxied the single-engine plane to a  stop alongside the red carpet. But perhaps in a fitting denouement to the  obstacles he encountered on his trip, Tony's door jammed and he was forced to  crawl out the other side.  </P> <P> Emerging from the cramped cockpit after his final 950-mile leg from Seattle,  Tony -- accompanied by his mother, Susan, father, Gary, 10-year-old sister  Alaina and 11-year-old Soviet pen pal, Roman Tchermenykh -- appeared nonchalant  about his record-setting aviation accomplishment. "I'm glad to be home," he  said.  </P> <P> His mother was more ebullient. "It was wonderful. It was a great trip," she  said. "Tony did a great job."  </P> <P> In the half-hour ceremony that followed, more accolades were heaped upon Tony  by local dignitaries. Thomas F. Riley, chairman of the Orange County Board of  Supervisors, presented Tony with a resolution of congratulations. Eddie Martin,  the 87-year-old patriarch of Orange County aviation and founder of Martin  Aviation, welcomed the boy aviator with a smile and a hug.  </P> <P> "I'm real proud of you, real tickled to death," Martin said.  </P> <P> Stepping on a box so he could see over a podium, Tony answered reporters'  questions and said he had no immediate plans to match or surpass his  around-the-world flight.  </P> <P> "I might fly pole to pole," Tony joked. His father displayed an expression of  mock surprise.  </P> <P> In the ceremony, Gary Aliengena introduced and thanked all 14 members of Tony's  entourage, which included a four-member film crew from Los Angeles, a chase  plane pilot, a Times reporter and a Soviet journalist, who made a speech in  halting English.  </P> <P> "I think Tony is a brave pilot," said Aleksie Grinevich, correspondent for the  Moscow newspaper Soviet Culture. "He saw many cities (in the Soviet Union). He  saw our kids want to laugh and live in peace."  </P> <P> Completion of the grueling, 7-week voyage -- dubbed Friendship Flight '89  because of its international friendship theme -- earned Tony recognition by the  National Aeronautic Assn. as the youngest pilot ever to fly around the world.  </P> <P> The NAA, an aviation record-monitoring organization in Washington, had sent  observer Gunter Hagen along in Tony's plane to verify that the boy remained in  sole control of the aircraft. Hagen confirmed that Saturday, and said Tony  never had to repeat a flight leg, as he did last year in his record-breaking  flight as the youngest pilot to traverse the United States. Then, a flight  instructor riding in the co-pilot's seat grabbed the plane yoke during a  Tennessee thunderstorm, forcing Tony to redo the leg.  </P> <P> Tony's trans-global flight also earned him recognition as the first private  pilot to fly the 7,000-mile breadth of the Soviet Union. In so doing, Tony  traveled for days over terrain so inaccessible that he was not within radar  reach much of the time.  </P> <P> The night before the last leg home, the elder Aliengena, 39, a real estate  investor and trucking company entrepreneur, reminisced about the trip and said  the only thing left was a meeting with President Bush. Tony, he said, wants to  present the President with a "friendship scroll" signed by thousands of  children during the trip.  </P> <P> Tony's arrival in Orange County was marred somewhat by the crash that took  place last Tuesday night off a gravel airstrip in the tiny Eskimo village of  Golovin, Alaska, where Tony's father had brought Tony and his entourage for a  three-day fishing respite after their re-entry into the United States from the  Soviet Union.  </P> <P> While ferrying Tony and six other members of his entourage out of the village  that night, Aliengena lost control of the aircraft and it veered off a 50-foot  embankment down to a swamp below. The right wing caught fire on impact and the  plane suffered other major damage, but all eight occupants managed to escape  without serious injury.  </P> <P> The day after the crash, Gary Aliengena borrowed another Cessna 210 Centurion  from Alaskan businessman Ralph C. Meloon Jr. and sought to deflect attention  from the accident to his son's flight.  </P> <P> "This is about Friendship Flight '89, not a mistake by old dad," Aliengena said  as the family was readying to depart from Nome, Alaska.  </P> <P> Back home in Orange County, Tony looked forward to the prospect of playing  again with his own friends. One of them, 10-year-old David Turley, was on hand  at the airport to welcome Tony.  </P> <P> "We're gonna do lots of things," David grinned. "Like build rockets!"  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 6 TASS -- The conclusions of Aleksandr  Sobyanin's expert team on the results of the elections to the  Russian Parliament and of the December 12 referendum "smack of  an outright provocation", ITAR-TASS was told by Sergey Filatov,  chief of the presidential administration.    Commenting today on the article published by the newspaper  IZVESTIYA, which claims that the "results of the elections and  the referendum were rigged", Filatov said that the conclusions  of the team "play into the hands of the irreconcilable  opposition" at the time when the social concord agreement is  being signed.    As to the team itself, which the newspaper claims to be "a  team under the presidential administration", it is pertinent to  note that it "has nothing to do with the administration",  Filatov said.    "There is a team headed by Sobyanin, which used to analyse  the results of the elections, the voting in the supreme soviet,  etc., from the very first Congress of People's Deputies,"  Filatov stated. "Later, those people went into science," he  added. The head of the presidential administration said that he  was "most doubtful" about the methods they are using in their  calculations.    Filatov said that a denial of the article was drawn up and  would be handed over for publication to the newspaper IZVESTIYA.</p>

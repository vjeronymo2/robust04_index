			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Finnish banks downgraded by Moody's THE crisis in the Finnish banking industry prompted Moody's, the US rating agency, to downgrade the debt of three Finnish banks yesterday, despite the announcement last week of a rescue package from the government, designed to halt the crisis. Kansallis Osake Pankki, Okobank, and the Union Bank of Finland all had their debt ratings lowered yesterday, affecting Dollars 8.6bn of outstanding debt. KOP's senior debt was downgraded from Aa3 to A2, and its subordinated debt from A1 to A3; Okobank's senior debt rating fell from Aa2 to Aa3, while its subordinated debt dropped from Aa3 to A1; and Union Bank of Finland's senior debt was knocked from Aa3 to A1, and its subordinated debt from A1 to A2. The commercial paper of all three banks was not under review and is unchanged at Prime-1. Despite recent attempts by the government to stimulate the economy, 'the (Finnish) banking environment will remain under significant stress for the inter-mediate term,' according to Moody's. The rating agency attributed the problems in the banking industry in part to the over-expansion of credit during a period of rapid deregulation. 'Current levels of capital are likely to be eroded as core earnings contract and loan losses mount,' the agency said. Many Finnish banks reported large losses in 1991. However, proposed capital injections by the government and the establishment of a deposit guarantee mechanism were welcomed. On Wednesday, it was announced that Skopbank, which was rescued from collapse last autumn, is to receive a capital injection of FM1.5bn (Dollars 333.3m) from the Finnish central bank, its main shareholder.</p>

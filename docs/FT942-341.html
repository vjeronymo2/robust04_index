			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / International Company News: GMA to take over Mount Lyell leases Gold Mines of Australia (GMA), the Western Australian mining group currently in the throes of a contested takeover bid for Dominion Mining, is to take over the leases for the Mount Lyell copper mine in Tasmania when Renison Goldfields closes down its operations there later this year. Renison announced in March that the 101-year-old mine would close on December 15. In its time, Mount Lyell has been controversial, playing a significant role in the development of Tasmania's environmental movement, but more recently the authorities' emphasis has been on keeping the mine open for employment reasons. GMA is now expected to spend around ADollars 5m (USDollars 3.6m) evaluating resources in the area. It believes a resource of 17.5m tonnes grading 1.5 per cent copper and 0.5 grammes per tonne of gold exists within the leases. Broken Hill Proprietary is to sell up to 106m cubic feet of gas a day to Metrogas, the Buenos Aires utility. First sales will be made from the Sierra Chata field discovered last year on the Chihuidos block. BHP holds 35.9 per cent of the block, but has granted Central Puerto, a Buenos Aires-based electricity generator, an option to buy up to a 10 per cent working interest.</p>

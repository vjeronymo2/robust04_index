			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Brazilian ultimatum on inflation BRAZIL's President Itamar Franco has issued an ultimatum to his economy minister to bring down inflation within the next three months. In a interview at the weekend, Mr Franco hit out at remarks by Mr Paulo Haddad, the economy minister, that inflation would remain at current levels for the next three months. Alarmed at the latest inflation figures which show no respite from the 30 per cent-a-month level, Mr Franco said 'the people cannot tolerate more of this inflation'. Accusing Mr Haddad of 'giving a shock to the population,' he warned 'what brings down economy ministers is not presidents but inflation'. With no clear economic policy in force and inflation spiralling, expectation is growing that Mr Franco will resort to a shock plan and price freeze, something Mr Haddad has repeatedly ruled out. Mr Haddad says he is working on a stabilisation programme which cannot be implemented until late April as it requires structural changes to be made. But Mr Franco said yesterday: 'The public is fed up of hearing only that there won't be a new shock plan.' Although he stressed he had no intention of imposing price controls 'for the time being,' he said he was unsure whether inflation could be reduced without measures such as a freeze. Mr Franco's comments heightened speculation over the future of Mr Haddad, Brazil's fourth economy minister in three years. In the past few weeks the president has publicly criticised his minister and refused to authorise his request to devalue the cruzeiro, which is now selling at 21,000 to the dollar. The tension between the two men comes just as a mission from the International Monetary Fund is due to arrive in Brazil. The mission, arriving today, is to evaluate the economic situation as a preliminary to full negotiations on a new accord.</p>

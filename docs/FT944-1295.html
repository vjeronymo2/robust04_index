			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Development of biggest untapped gas field approved The government yesterday approved development of the UK's biggest remaining untapped natural gas field. Gas from the Pounds 1.5bn Britannia field, 130 miles north-west of Aberdeen, will be sold exclusively to independent gas marketing companies and power generators. It will be the first time that a big North Sea gas field has not included British Gas among its buyers. Some of Britannia's gas remains to be sold. But the list of initial buyers reflects the changing nature of the UK market, which is to be fully opened to competition by 1998, the year Britannia production will start. Kinetica, the natural gas joint venture between Conoco of the US and PowerGen of the UK, is thought by many analysts to be among the biggest buyers of Britannia gas. Others include Mobil of the US, National Power and Total of France. Mr Jim Briggs of Chevron, the US company which will operate Britannia with Conoco, said yesterday that buyers did not want details of the contracts to be divulged. In the past most gas contracts were on the long-term, 'take or pay' model, under which wholesale buyers had to pay for the gas even if they failed to sell it on to their customers. There has been industry speculation that some of the Britannia contracts may be more flexible. Observers note that a British spot market in surplus gas is likely to develop once competition is introduced by 1998. In addition the UK-Continent Interconnector, a pipeline linking the UK and European gas grids, is expected to be completed in 1998, opening up the prospect of large-scale exports of gas to European customers. Conoco, the biggest participant in Britannia, also has a big stake in the Interconnector. Britannia, which was discovered in 1975, has recoverable reserves of 2,600bn cu ft of natural gas and 140m barrels of condensate, a naturally occurring gasoline. The field's life is estimated at 30 years with a peak production plateau of six years. It will be the first North Sea field which will be operated jointly, with Chevron and Conoco sharing operational responsibilities. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said companies operating in Britain were likely to gain about 70 per cent of the value of total contracts connected with the field. The first big contract has gone to Trafalgar House Offshore Fabricators, which will build the Pounds 57m platform deck. Contracts to be awarded next year include the laying of a 195km (121 miles) gas pipeline to connect Britannia with the terminal at St Fergus in Scotland. A decision will be taken next year whether to expand the existing terminal, or build another nearby. A separate 45km pipeline will take up to 70,000 barrels a day of liquid condensate to the nearby Forties pipeline system. Letters, Page 14</p>

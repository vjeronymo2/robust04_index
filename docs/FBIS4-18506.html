			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Teoman Turan report: "Greek Cypriots Act With Ill Will" -- </F> punctuation as published]    [Text] In an exclusive statement to SABAH, TRNC [Turkish  Republic of Northern Cyprus] Foreign and Defense Minister Atay  Ahmet Rasit, who is one of the most influential Democratic Party  members in the coalition government in north Cyprus, assessed  relations between the Turkish and Greek Cypriots. Ahmet Rasit  said that cooperation between the Greek Cypriot side and the  Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] when talks are being held on the  confidence-building measures is inadmissible. He said: "The  Greek Cypriots have claimed that they are making an effort to  achieve a durable peace. However, they continue to support the  PKK, which the entire world regards as a terrorist organization.  How can that be equated with goodwill?"    Stressing that the Turkish Cypriot side has proved that it  has acted with goodwill as much as possible until now, Ahmet  Rasit said: "Taking into consideration the UN recommendations,  the Turkish Cypriot side indicated when the talks began that it  was prepared to trust the Greek Cypriots. However, they do not  wish to trust us at all. In view of that, it would be  meaningless for us to trust the Greek Cypriots who do not wish  to reciprocate."    Ahmet Rasit described Maras [Varosha] and Nicosia  International Airport, which has been closed for 20 years, as  two key issues in the Cyprus problem. He said: "The problem is  the question of access to Maras through Dherinia. According to  the package, travel through that area will be unrestricted  without any formality. We have agreed to that principle.  However, not satisfied with that, the Greek Cypriots have moved  to ask for more."    Stressing that the friction between the two sides was not  due  to disputes between individuals, Ahmet Rasit expressed the  conviction that the two communities, which have been forced by  history and geographic conditions to live together, can coexist  in peace by respecting each other's religion, language, and  origin.    Ahmet Rasit said that they may consider holding a referendum  on whether or not the Turkish Cypriot side should continue to  participate in the indirect talks if the UN secretary general  submits a report to the Security Council critical of the Turkish  Cypriot side. Furthermore, he stressed that more work has to be  done on the confidence-building measures package, and noted that  the Turkish Cypriot side will maintain its effort to find a  solution.    Ahmet Rasit also stressed that the coalition government in  north Cyprus, which came to power after the elections on 12  December 1993, is working together in harmony.</p>

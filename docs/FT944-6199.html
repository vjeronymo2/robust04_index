Politics: Conservative. Wanted: Stable interest rates. Tax changes to encourage investment in agriculture, and more generous capital allowances on investment in farm buildings and machinery. And a 'cry from the heart': Simpler capital gains tax. The complexity of the current system - particularly for dairy farmers grappling with milk quotas - costs a fortune in professional fees. Said yesterday: 'I have no quarrel with the Budget aim of sustainable growth but I'm disappointed on many of the specifics for agriculture. The failure to put in any tax incentives for let land, either through further inheritance tax relief or removing other tax burdens, means the new farm tenancy legislation will be very ineffective. We had to have tax reform for that to work.' He was disappointed there will be no increase in capital allowances. 'The chancellor hasn't grasped that the majority of farm businesses are run as partnerships or sole traders and haven't benefited from cuts in corporation tax. The removal of 25 per cent grants on farm waste handling facilities - for silage and slurry - is very shortsighted from a government intent on reducing pollution.

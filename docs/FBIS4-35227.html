			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Deputy Prime Ministers Taha Yasin Ramadan and  Tariq 'Aziz and the ministers took the constitutional oath today  before leader Saddam Husayn, president of the republic and prime  minister, may God preserve him.    The leader president, may God preserve him, chaired the  first  meeting of the new Council of Ministers which lasted  approximately four and a half hours. During this meeting, his  excellency delivered the following valuable and important speech:    First, we would like to thank brother Ahmad Husayn for  assuming the tasks of the prime minister over the past period.  He exerted his utmost in this field.    The statement of the Revolution Command Council was very  clear. Our assessment was that our circumstances require this  formula in terms of the presidency's relationship with the  Council of Ministers, despite the fact that it will increase our  burdens and cost us extra time. This, however, is required.    You will continue to assume your ministerial posts, except  the agriculture minister, who was previously a minister. Now,  he is a comrade in the party and a governor and knows our  course. The new thing, however, is the new situation.    The new thing is that, as you recall, we addressed the  Iraqis  on one occasion and told them: You are in the last 10 days of  Ramadan. Some people interpreted this by saying that these are  the last 10 days and that the blockade will be lifted on 'Id  al-Fitr. They also said that something would happen. I heard  these interpretations from some people.    Meanwhile, what we meant by the last 10 days is the fact  that  the largest period of time has passed and that the reward of the  whole month will be gained during the last 10 days. In other  words, man will either succeed or fail. The last 10 days need  additional patience and efforts so that man will gain the reward  of fasting during the month of Ramadan.    Addressing the members of the Council of Ministers, his  excellency said:    In the past, ministers might have taken their time and read  the newspapers before beginning work. But, now, the first thing  I will do is read the newspapers after dealing with the basic  components of the morning mail. As of now, every minister  should be in his office at 0800. This is the first measure to  be carried out by all, except the sick person, who should  telephone Dr. Khalil al-Ma'muri, secretary of the Council of  Ministers, to inform him that he cannot report to work at his  ministry. This will help us know that he is sick, to be  reassured about him, to wish him good health, and to follow up  his medical situation. Those who are not sick should be present  in their ministry at 0800. I do not want any other excuses.  [passage omitted]    What we want to discuss in this meeting -- which has no  agenda -- is the living conditions of our people and some  phenomena which I noticed in the state departments in general so  that the brother ministers will work toward overcoming these  phenomena once we reach agreement on them.    Regarding the people's standard of living, I will explain to  you how I see the prices so that you will not imagine that I am  not aware of the minor details and that I am not aware of minor  things in the life of the people, and consequently, I would ask  you for things that would appear illogical. [passage omitted]    I want to say to you that I follow up things and think them  over as much as I can. Do not imagine that I am unaware of  things. I follow up people's life. I want to say that we can  do something, but what is it?    I prefer that we hold a dialogue about this and that each of  you makes his suggestions. I hope that you make these  suggestions as brief and concise as possible.    The deputy prime ministers and the ministers presented a  number of ideas and proposals which were discussed.    The leader president then said:    The blockade will end just as any other issue. Wars have  ended and there are still other wars. The blockade started on a  certain day, and there must be a day when it will end. It is  clear that the remaining time is less than the time which has  elapsed. I believe that the expression we used before is  accurate. However, the basis which will end the blockade, keep  Iraq just as its sons want it to be, and end any strong storm  with the fewest losses or sacrifices, with the continuation of  the basic constants wished by its sons, the people of the  country, lies in the people of the country themselves. The basis  lies in the people of the country. The responsibility increases  gradually in accordance with the level of influence and center  of influence among the people of the country. It is natural  that the minister's responsibility of steadfastness differs from  the responsibility of others. This means that the minister's  sense of responsibility and the level and size of influence  differs from that of the ordinary employee or citizen in the  state of Iraq. Thus, this includes members of the leadership,  beginning with the ministry's under secretary, the director  general, and ends with the end of the job scale.    From the beginning we said that the basis that will fragment  or lift the blockade is you. Why you? Because the more you  increase your people's patience and ability to stand fast, the  more this will be in your favor to end the blockade in an  honorable way. Praise be to God that the country's  capabilities, its sons' capacity, and the level of their  awareness have remained as they are regardless of some  exceptions which occur as a result of a quick assessment or a  quick or hasty stand. I know the national essence of the people  of the country. They understand that they have no other choice.  This is how the situation can be decided the way we wish. The  ministers, when they increase their activity in their offices  and make their mental and organizational ability more efficient  and more effective, will play a role in increasing the patience  of the citizen, whether he is an employee or something else.    It seems that some sides mobilized the people in a way which  was interpreted as if the Iraqis should wait for good news, in a  dramatic sense, after the UN Security Council's meeting which  was held in May. This is wrong and is contrary to our policy.  Our policy says that we are working in the international arena  with all our capabilities and mental abilities. However, the  basis which changes the international approach is the Iraqis'  position. The Iraqis weaken their position in the international  arena when they grumble too much and when their balance of  patience is disrupted. They weaken their position in the  international community, which has a purpose. Even he who has  no purpose will no longer be enthusiastic about insisting on  shortening the time for lifting the blockade when he sees the  people's resistance against the blockade has become weak.  [passage omitted]    Our citizens have a nationalist nature. They can hear facts,  and therefore, we must clarify facts to them in order to be  balanced. They have been used to this issue since 1969. When  onions, potatoes, or tomatoes become scarce, they make an issue  out of this, and when we give them a solution by the available  means, all of them will stand in the right position. So, let's  do so and rely on God.    At the end of the meeting, specialized committees were  formed  to study some urgent issues. The results of their actions will  be presented to the Council of Ministers soon.</p>

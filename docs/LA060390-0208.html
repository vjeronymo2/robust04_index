			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWPORT SCHOOLS  </P> <P> I am writing as a parent concerned for the educational future of my children  and disillusioned with the lack of democratic process taking place at the  Newport-Mesa Unified District.  </P> <P> On April 17, the Newport-Mesa school board voted 4 to 3 to split the elementary  schools to a K-3/4-6 grade configuration, against strong parental and community  opposition.  </P> <P> Of over 200 parents who attended this meeting, not one spoke in favor of this  split.  </P> <P> We, as parents and homeowners, entrusted the board to represent us. Webster's  defines "democracy" as "government by the people; a form of government in which  the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised by them or by their  elected officials under a free electoral system." Democracy, the accepted  practice of the American people, is not taking place at the Newport-Mesa school  district.  </P> <P> JERRILYN KLINE  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P> <P>  A mechanical error caused Jerrilynn Kline's name to appear under a different  letter last Sunday.  </P> <P> </P></p>

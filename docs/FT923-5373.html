			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Tentative revival leaves Helsinki in wary mood - Robert Taylor peers through the Finnish gloom Over the past two years, the Helsinki bourse has been a serious casualty of Finland's deepest-ever recession, and the horrific damage sustained by the Nordic financial sector. It remains in a wary mood in spite of signs of an economic recovery. More than half of Finland's companies are experiencing an upturn, but this revival in the 'real' economy has not been reflected so far in share prices. Towards the end of last week Helsinki's forestry share index had dropped by some 20 per cent this year, and by 16.5 per cent in the previous 30 days. And while the metal sector had risen by as much as 40 per cent in the year to the end of May, it has fallen recently by a little more than its forestry counterpart. Last week the central bank was compelled to raise its tender rate from 15.5 per cent to 17 per cent, in a move designed to stem capital outflows and calm international financial markets. Ever since last November's 12.3 per cent devaluation of the markka, the Finnish money markets have been nervous due to an intermittent lack of confidence in the country's fragile centre-right coalition government's ability to stick firmly in future to a fixed exchange-rate policy. However, a fortnight ago, Mr Michel Camdessus, head of the International Monetary Fund, made some positive remarks about the economy. He pointed to signs of modest but still positive economic growth, an upturn in industrial output, low inflation and a clear improvement in industrial competitiveness. A similar note was struck last week in the authoritative annual report on Finland from the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The OECD forecast the likelihood of a 3.3 per cent increase in Finland's GDP in 1993, encouraging after two years of economic contraction. It also suggested a 5.5 per cent rise in industrial output next year after modest 1 per cent growth in 1992, as well as a strong export-led recovery. Unemployment may remain at around 11 per cent but the other main economic indicators provide some encouragement for the markets. Such outside opinion stems from the growing optimism in Helsinki in both the forestry and engineering sectors. Mr Pentti Vartia, head of ETLA, Finland's main independent economic forecasting institute, is encouraged by the fact that the country, in a remarkably short time, has managed to replace its lost markets in the former Soviet Union with new ones in the west. 'The recovery has been much faster than we expected,' he says. The real trouble hobbling the market is the continuing uncertainty about the future of Finland's fragile financial system. Bank shares have collapsed, weighing down the overall Hex average. The state has established a FM20bn (Dollars 5.2bn) guarantee fund to assist banks and other financial institutions in trouble with non-performing loans and credit losses. Few observers believe, however, that Finland has yet weathered the storm which has shaken the financial sector across the Nordic region in the past few years. Last year, listed Finnish companies made financial losses totalling FM16bn between them. This year, bourse analysts estimate that the deficit will narrow to FM9.7bn, with as much as FM6.5bn of that figure due to the lamentable position of the banks. As a result, Finnish shares are cheap by some standards. The book value of limited companies is FM123bn but this contrasts with a market value of FM52bn at the end of July. Mr Juhani Erma, head of the Helsinki bourse, is hopeful that the outlook will change next year with the removal of rules which prevent foreigners from acquiring more than 20 per cent of the voting rights, and 40 per cent of the equity, of a Finnish company without official authorisation from the state. The traditional distinction between restricted and free shares will also end. At present only around 12 per cent of shares traded in Helsinki are free. Last week the government proposed the lifting of foreign ownership restrictions from January 1, and parliament is expected to discuss the proposal in the autumn. These reforms are necessary as Finland becomes part of the 19-nation European Economic Area next year and they could stimulate a good deal of foreign interest in Finnish equities. It has been estimated that as much as FM16bn of new foreign investment could be attracted by the changes. The near-term outlook for the stock market, however, depends on the success of the government's economic strategy. And there are some anxieties for the autumn. First, there are doubts about the political situation and whether the present government can survive much longer. Many believe that it may have to be reconstructed after the October local government elections, which could bring heavy losses to the coalition partners. Secondly, there are worries about the next round of wage negotiations. The government and employers would like to see no rise in wages for the next three years; the unions can be expected to resist although, in the presently grim labour market, they might settle for some kind of cost-of-living protection and no real income improvements. There is also uncertainty about the forthcoming Finnish negotiations on membership of the European Community, due to begin formally early next year. The latest opinion polls suggest that a clear majority of Finns want their country to join the EC and it is possible that the markka may achieve associate membership of the European Monetary System.</p>

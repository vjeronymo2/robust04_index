			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Glaxo faces lawsuit by 400 dye patients Glaxo, the pharmaceuticals manufacturer, is being sued for more than Pounds 80m by about 400 former hospital patients in the first of a series of cases concerning the medical dye Myodil. Patients say Myodil, which was widely used in spinal X-rays between 1944 and 1987, damaged nerves, causing acute pain and even partial paralysis. They say Glaxo failed to issue adequate warnings about side effects. Glaxo denies negligence, saying that Myodil's risks were well documented. Solicitors say the group action, to be heard at the High Court in London in April, represents a test case for other Myodil claims. Lawyers are thought to be preparing cases in Scotland and Ireland. The dye was also used in Australia, Canada and South Africa. Myodil was discontinued seven years ago. Glaxo said demand had declined. Doctors injected the dye as part of a technique called myelography. Patients say the dye remained in the spine for several years, leading to the condition known as arachnoiditis - inflammation of the spinal column membrane. Glaxo says that the risks were highlighted in leaflets which accompanied the product. The company said: 'We supplied this product to meet the needs of a very knowledgeable medical profession. It was known for many years that myelography could be followed by arachnoiditis.' Mr Simon Gowler, of Alexander Harris, the solicitors who represent the patients, said: 'They said there was a risk of arachnoiditis, but that can mean many things to many people. There is a huge difference between arachnoiditis which can be seen on a myelography film, and those who develop symptoms.' The Myodil case would be the first group action for personal injury against a drug company to come to trial. Previous cases have been settled out of court after several years of litigation. About 90 per cent of the Myodil patients are supported by legal aid because of their disabilities.</p>

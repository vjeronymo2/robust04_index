			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Courtaulds plans Pounds 80m plant The board of Courtaulds, the chemicals and textiles group, is expected to approve in the next few days the spending of about Pounds 80m on a European plant to produce Tencel, its new synthetic fabric. The plant is to be sited either at Grimsby on Humberside or near Munich in Germany. The approval is expected almost to coincide with a long-delayed agreement by Courtaulds and Hoechst, the German chemicals company, to merge their European viscose and acrylic fibres operations under Courtaulds' control. Courtaulds said yesterday it hoped that the merger, first announced in May last year but delayed by competition-authority scrutiny, would be signed before the end of this week. A decision on where to locate the Tencel plant will follow soon. Courtaulds wants the plant running in 1996 to cater for what it says will be surging world demand for the material, which is made from wood pulp and said to combine the toughness of denim with the feel of silk. Courtaulds is supplying Tencel to all main markets, including Europe, from an 18,000 tonnes-a-year facility in Alabama, where a second plant to increase capacity to more than 40,000 tonnes a year is due to be operating soon. The European plant will increase capacity to well over 50,000 tonnes a year and supply some Far East markets as well as those in Europe. Because the production processes for Tencel are highly automated, employment at such a facility is likely to be measured in dozens rather than hundreds. The company said yesterday that the rival advantages of Grimsby and Munich had still to be fully weighed.</p>

			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> HARRELL, BRONFMAN, SETZER SIT IN AT INSTITUTE CONCERT  </P> <P> Some prodigiously talented, aspiring young players got some expert help Friday  night when members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute performed three  chamber works at Schoenberg Hall, UCLA. Three mentors supplemented the forces  -- artistic director and cellist Lynn Harrell, Emerson Quartet violinist Philip  Setzer and pianist Yefim Bronfman.  </P> <P> As one could have anticipated, the virtuosic collaboration of Harrell and  Setzer in Ravel's Sonata for Violin and Cello (1920-22) became the centerpiece  of the concert. Harrell's witty, bubbly style and Setzer's more serious, almost  brooding approach successfully blended and comprehensively explored each  carefully written nuance of the score.  </P> <P> A last-minute substitution of the Schubert Trio, Opus 99, for the Beethoven  Quartet Opus 95, yielded some pleasantly surprising results as well. Violinist  Helen Nightengale rose to the occasion with a commanding performance filled  with delicate but controlled lyricism.  </P> <P> The last piece on the program, Beethoven's Quintet for Piano and Winds, Opus  16, proved more problematic. Despite the spirited, polished accompaniment  provided by Bronfman, the wind players suffered myriad intonation problems, due  at times to overblowing, but also to a general lack of energy.GREGG WAGER  </P></p>

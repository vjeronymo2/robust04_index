			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAKESHITA SAYS JAPAN WILL HAVE TO OPEN RICE MARKET  </P> <P> Former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita says Japan will be unable to avoid  partly opening its rice market in a world looking for freer trade in  agriculture, two Japanese newspapers reported Friday.  </P> <P> "It would be impractical if Japan had to leave GATT (the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade) to keep its rice import ban," Yomiuri Shimbun quoted  Takeshita as saying.  </P> <P> Tokyo Shimbun quoted him as saying Japan should encourage rice farmers to raise  productivity while liberalizing the rice market.  </P> <P> Japanese pay about six times world prices for rice, and the government has come  under heavy pressure, especially from the United States, to end the import ban.  </P> <P> Japan bans all commercial imports of rice and last year spent $2.1 billion  subsidizing domestic production.  </P></p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Romania uplifted by win over Argentina Romania are looking for more World Cup scalps. And they say they have prepared carefully enough to go further in the competition, following their 3-2 win against Argentina that eliminated the two-time world champions. Against Sweden in the next round, the Romanians will be even stronger with the return of striker Florin Raducioiu, who had to sit out the game against Argentina because of suspension.</p>

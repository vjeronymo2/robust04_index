			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1300 GMT on 31 March carries in its  regular 34-minute newscast several reports updating the fighting  in the republic.    Gorazde correspondent Enes Musovic reports on the continued  fighting in the region and says that "the fierce fighting, with  periodic hand-to-hand fighting, has resulted in significant  losses for the aggressor side. Nevertheless, the (?drugged)  Chetniks are treading over the dead bodies of their criminal  colleagues and are themselves being killed. Exceptionally  fierce and frequent Chetnik infantry attacks are accompanied by  fierce fire from all types of artillery weapons [words  indistinct] in the region of (?Zigovi) and [name indistinct] is  in flames. Everything here is in flames. The Chetniks have  encircled Gorazde with 40 tanks. Despite heavy losses in  manpower, the mercenaries of the so-called Srpska republic are  relentlessly charging on. Some time after 1200 they crossed the  bridge on the (?Praca) River in Ustipraca with the aim of  infiltrating the region of Gojcevici and Surovi. They were  resolutely challenged by Gorazde's defenders. The fighting is  fierce, but we still have no information on the development of  these extremely [word indistinct] events."    Smajl Terzic reports from Doboj on the situation in the 7th  South Operative Group's theater of operations and says that "the  situation in this theater is extremely serious today. The  aggressor on three occasions attempted to [word indistinct]  artillery, but [words indistinct]. In the course of the morning  and the early afternoon, the aggressor has been regrouping his  manpower and equipment, and has been relentlessly targeting  civilian targets. Except for material damage, no casualties  have been reported."

This relentless shelling of the innocent civilian population  has resulted in the serious wounding of 10 people. No one has  been killed."    Olovo correspondent Amira Salihbasic reports that "the  aggressor today continued shelling the free Olovo territory with  long-range artillery. In the morning hours the enemy used PRAGA  [self-propelled antiaircraft artillery] and mortars to shell our  defenders' positions in the area of Bacici. The enemy also  intensified his antiaircraft gunfire. The residential areas of  the town were also shelled this morning, as were the residential  areas along the Krivaja River."    The studio announcer reads a report from the 1st Corps  Information Service and says that "the Chetniks today continued  their usual small arms' provocations from their positions in  Grbavica, Orlovac, Kromolj, and Sjenicka Kosa. Brekin Potok and  the area around Vrbanj Most were targeted by various types of  weaponry, while a rocket from a portable launcher landed on  Slatina. Enemy snipers were active in several places, so it is  necessary to exercise caution when moving around the city."</p>

			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> NO GINGRICH CASE, COUNSEL SAYS  </P> <P> After a three-month investigation, the outside counsel handling the ethics case  of Rep. Newt Gingrich, the House's No. 2 Republican leader, has found no reason  to pursue the case, congressional sources said today.  </P> <P> However, the law firm hired by the House Ethics Committee did come up with a  list of unanswered questions that the panel's staff will pursue with Gingrich  of Georgia before a final disposition of the case is made, the sources said.  </P> <P> The case stems from a complaint by Rep. Bill Alexander (D-Ark.) that Gingrich  violated House rules and federal campaign finance laws in the operation of a  limited partnership created in 1984 to promote "Window of Opportunity," a book  written by Gingrich and two others.  </P></p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Arts: The Tharp imagination - Dance There are three major pieces new to London in the second programme by Twyla Tharp's company at Riverside Studios. Each shows how a score sparks off the Tharp imagination: ideas and allusions burst out of the music into the dance  -clever, sometimes too clever by half, dazzlingly apt, always engaging our attention. The second book of Brahms' Paganini variations is, among other things, a commando course for the pianist. For Tharp, and for Jamie Bishton her prodigious soloist, it is a study in powerfully masculine stamina (Bishton gets his green beret) and no less compelling acuteness to rhythm and dance outline. There is an entourage of two couples in black who state certain associated ideas; Bishton, in white, is like the music's spirit, flying, cutting great shapes, in triumphant colloquy with Brahms. He, like the piece, is wonderful. As Time Goes By is 20 years old, and looks as fresh as if it were made this week. It is, I suppose, both 'about' baroque dance and about the idea of Haydn's Farewell symphony, whose last two movements it uses. And uses, in the best sense, as a way into how we may think about the dance of Haydn's time - courteous, quick, elegant - and about the music's mechanics. A small dance ensemble is augmented, the choreography becomes more complicated, then the numbers reduce until the gifted Daniel Chait is left alone, dancing as the light and the music fade, seeming to contemplate the choreography that has gone before, and an age that has gone forever. I think it a delight, and can even forgive the men's costumes - natty beige winter underwear. The most recent work is Octet (1991), which is Tharp allusive and analytical. The score is by Edgar Meyer; it sounds first like a jazz group enjoying a nervous breakdown, then switches to a study for 'cello surrounded by shimmering glissandi. The choreography, for eight dancers, proposes classicism sharing (unsurprising, with Tharp) the jazz group's neuroses - movement twitching, inverted, caught up in itself - then gaining in clarity with the music's development. The eye is constantly engaged, excited. Tharp gives a valid post-Balanchinian account of academic language, paying homage to the Master; above all she takes a penetrating look at dance, showing us what fascinates her - and hence fascinates us. The programme ends with the Nine Sinatra Songs, that cunning exercise in kitsch. The songs are stickily sentimental; Oscar de la Renta's dresses for the girls are a catalogue of fashion horrors (the chaps are in dinner jackets); seven couples plunge into cheap emotions like Olympic divers from the top board, and perform marvels on the way down. It is, in essence, the most fearful claptrap, but brilliantly made by Tharp and brilliantly danced by her artists. No-one, though, should be required to listen to nine Sinatra songs on the trot without danger money. As an added note about Riverside: prospective visitors are advised that seating is un-numbered and that, as at The Place, there can be an unholy, and surely unnecessary, scrum to get into the auditorium. But Tharp vaut le voyage. The Tharp Company is at Riverside Studios until March 12.</p>

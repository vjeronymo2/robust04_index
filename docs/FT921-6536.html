			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Australian funds and life group returns to the black TYNDALL Australia, the funds management and life insurance group, has emerged from a period of restructuring with a strong revenue and earnings performance for 1991. The company, in which Sir Ronald Brierley's London-based investment vehicle, GPG, acquired a large shareholding late last year, turned a ADollars 72.4m loss into an ADollars 8.6m (USDollars 6.5m) profit, on revenues of ADollars 24.1m against ADollars 19.7m. The previous result reflected large write-offs, particularly in life insurance operations. These have became the company's profit mainstay in 1991, earning ADollars 9.4m pre-tax. Mr Ron Hunwick, Tyndall managing director, said the company's disability and term life products had recorded growth of 46 per cent. The company yesterday also launched a previously-announced ADollars 7.5m rights issue, fully-underwritten by GPG, with the proceeds earmarked for debt reduction. The result followed a ADollars 151,000 tax credit, against ADollars 86,000 previously. Interest provision eased from ADollars 5.6m to ADollars 4.8m. Dividend has again been omitted. Clutha, the New South Wales coal producer, turned a ADollars 345,000 loss into a ADollars 2.5m profit in the half-year to December.</p>

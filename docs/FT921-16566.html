			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Aviation insurers face crash claims TWO AIR crashes over Christmas have left London aviation insurers with multi-million dollar claims, aggravating losses in the market and adding to pressure for increases in aviation insurance rates, Richard Lapper writes. Premiums have been rising steadily over the past three months after reaching their lowest level since the early 1980s earlier this year. Mr Jonathan Palmer-Brown, an aviation insurance broker at Nicholson Chamberlain Colls, said the claims 'will increase the pressure for rate rises'. He added: 'A lot of cash will come out of the market.' The crash on Sunday of a Boeing 747-200F jet freighter, operated by China Airlines, followed hard on the heels of the loss of a Swedish airliner on Boxing Day. The Chinese aircraft, en route to Anchorage, Alaska, plunged into a mountain soon after taking off from the Taiwanese capital, Taipei. Nicholson Chamberlain Colls expects claims for the aircraft's hull to be at least Dollars 60m (Pounds 32m). On Friday a McDonnell Douglas MD81 jet airliner, operated by Scandinavian Airlines Systems, broke up when it crash landed after both its engines failed on take off from Stockholm's Arlanda airport. It was insured for Dollars 35m.</p>

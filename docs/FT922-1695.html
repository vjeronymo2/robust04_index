			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Irish voters give strong backing to Maastricht treaty THE IRISH people have over-whelmingly approved the Maastricht treaty, giving the kiss of life to closer European union. The two-to-one 'yes' vote in Thursday's referendum was welcomed yesterday by European Community governments. They felt it showed that the treaty's goals of political and economic union were still on track in spite of their rejection in a referendum in Denmark earlier this month. Welcoming the result, Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, said: 'It is a great day for Ireland and a great day for Europe . . . Our decision will give renewed momentum to the ratification of the treaty across Europe.' The decision lifts some of the atmosphere of crisis from the EC summit meeting in Lisbon next week. Following telephone conversations with Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, and other European Community leaders, Mr Reynolds said: 'There is a lot of relief in the cabinets of Europe today.' Had the treaty been voted down as some had feared, it would have had to be reneg-otiated from scratch. Yesterday's result improves the odds on what will still be a very difficult passage for the treaty in the rest of the Community. With a 'yes' vote of 69 per cent on a 57 per cent turnout, the Irish ratified what the Danes had rejected by a narrow margin. Mr Delors praised Ireland for choosing 'active participation in the construction of Europe rather than isolation without perspective'. Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, said: 'For the first time since the Danish referendum a positive signal for Europe has been given.' Mr David Andrews, the Irish foreign minister, said: 'Ireland can now hold its head up very high in Europe in a leadership role. This vote not only saves European union, it strengthens it. It will give a lead to other European countries that may have had doubts about Europe.' EC foreign ministers gather in Luxembourg today to prepare the agenda for the Lisbon summit. This is expected to focus on further EC financing, choosing sites for institutions like the European Monetary Institute and a progress report on developing a common foreign and security policy. Portugal confirmed yesterday that, at the summit, it would propose Mr Delors' re-election for a further two-year term as head of the Commission. The Irish vote was a defeat for a coalition of environmentalists, supporters of Ireland's neutrality and anti-abortion groups. Rural areas in Ireland voted heavily for the treaty, while working class urban areas had a lower turnout and higher 'no' vote. Maastricht supporters were worried that the vote came in the wake of EC disagreement about Mr Delors' plans for a larger community budget. They feared that Ireland - which already gets much more from Brussels than it puts into EC coffers itself - might vote 'no' because it seemed less likely to get a big anticipated increase in regional aid funds. In the event, it appears voters were swayed more by longer-term economic benefits than what Mr Reynolds called 'irrelevant and scaremongering issues'. Robert Mauthner adds from Bonn: Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, at a meeting of the Western European Union, described the Irish result as 'good for Britain and good for Europe'. Two uncertainties, however, remained: the French referendum, which will probably be held in the autumn, and the need to know how the Danes intended to use the time given to them.

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Bio-technology offers a safer, more secure world - Widespread fears that safeguards already in place are inadequate are probably based on ignorance Bio-technology designed to produce genetically-modified organisms via the manipulation of deoxyribonucleic acid is not just a mouthful - it is beyond the wit of most people to comprehend. Reduce that acid to its initials, DNA, and its meaning becomes slightly more accessible to the average person. DNA is, after all, constantly being quoted as a means of solving violent crime through genetic fingerprinting. And most of us, I suppose, are vaguely aware that it has something to do with our bodily make-up and with food and farming. But multi-syllabic words and scientific jargon are a big turn-off for most people, and as we do not understand them we tend to fear the techniques they describe. They conjure-up images of bespectacled boffins in white coats and dangerous-looking laboratories. I confess to having had some of those same fears until the commonplace nature of bio-technology in everyday foods was explained to me. I am assured, for instance, that it is possible to extract the DNA from an onion using table salt, washing-up liquid, a normal household liquidiser, a coffee filter and very little else. Furthermore, it can be done in any kitchen or, as is already happening, in third-form school chemistry classes. Not all of those people who defy concern over cholesterol and eat cheese may be aware that the traditional way to promote the initial curdling of milk is to add a small quantity of rennet, an enzyme extracted from a calf's stomach. Bio-technology has now made it possible to produce an exact copy of chymosin, the necessary enzyme, which is indistinguishable from the original in both make-up and function, and, following approval by the UK government's Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes, it is increasingly being used in cheese-making, much to the delight, I imagine, of the animal welfare lobby. Other foods and drinks whose production involves the use of living organisms, like yeast - such things as bread and beer - will also soon benefit from improved versions of raw material that are the result of bio-technology. My own particular interest, however, is in the field of plant breeding. In the past - and it has been going on for centuries - the development of improved varieties has been done by the selection of desirable characteristics in individual plants and crossing them with one another in the hope that the result would be favourable. In recent years, however, it has become possible to identify the qualities required from DNA analysis and achieve more accuracy in the breeding process. Plant breeders can now select far more specifically than before for such things as milling quality in wheat; resistance to debilitating fungal disease; tolerance to certain pests; and the ability to yield well with lower levels of fertiliser. Ultimately, for it still takes many years for these characteristics to be fixed and for the resulting seed to be multiplied to sufficient quantity for it to be made widely available, this work will lead to crop varieties that will require lower inputs of chemicals and fertilisers and therefore be more environmentally friendly. It will also open new doors for agriculture. Take oilseed rape, for instance. Genetic manipulation, which will make it one of the most versatile crops in the world, is well advanced. By modifying the gene mix for different purposes, scientists are already confident that the oils produced by the different strains they are developing can become general purpose, environment-friendly, feed stocks for industry. It could not only be used for cooking and lubrication, as at present, but also for the manufacture of plastics, polymers, pharmaceuticals, inks, detergents, nylon, cosmetics and probably many more. And, unlike the mainly fossil-based raw materials used for those processes at present, oilseed rape would amount to a renewable resource. Scientists say that bio-technology will be our only hope as the population of the world doubles during the next 50 years. That to have any chance of putting food into those new mouths and to be able to continue to enjoy the conveniences of modern life, it is vital that the developments they can foresee continue to be introduced. But 20th century successors to the Luddites see dangers. Their fears, as mine were, are probably based on ignorance. They are not satisfied that the mass of safeguards already in place will protect them from some horror being released into the environment - fears which I have been persuaded are groundless. The government's response is to organise a Consensus Conference of interested but uninvolved people to assess the evidence during the coming autumn and come to conclusions in November. It is a welcome and appropriate step, which I for one hope will promote a public debate in which some of the mystique and misunderstanding about bio-technology will be dispelled. Given proper regulation and controls, the new technology is likely to produce a safer, more secure and more environment-friendly world.</p>

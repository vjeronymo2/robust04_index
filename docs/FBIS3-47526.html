Government panel member  Eduardo Ermita made this announcement after receiving hints from  the MILF headed by Hashem Salamat. Earlier, government panel  Chairman Manuel Yan disclosed that the government will hold  separate peace talks with the MILF after the negotiation with  the MNLF [Moro National Liberation Front] headed by Nur Misuari.    [Begin recording, in English, in progress] [Ermita] ... and  MNLF.    [Unidentified reporter] But what about the cease-fire  processes?    [Ermita] When we came from Jakarta, we got word that they  [MILF] are considering signing a separate cease-fire agreement,  but we have never been able to confirm that.    [Reporter] Will the cease-fire agreement depend on what took  place during the talks with MNLF?    [Ermita] No, it is independent of the MNLF. We are still  awaiting, lahat eh.... [changes thought], we have not gotten any  final word from the MILF whether indeed they will sign a  separate cease-fire agreement with the Philippine Government.  [end recording]</p>

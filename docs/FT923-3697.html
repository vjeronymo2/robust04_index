			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / International Company News: BBL directors discuss strategy DIRECTORS of Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL) yesterday met for an unscheduled discussion of the Belgian bank's future strategy, amid continuing speculation about the company's unstable shareholder structure. BBL refused to comment on the substance or outcome of the meeting, but said it would release a statement today. Belgian newspaper reports yesterday suggested that the meeting would focus on the intention of Internationale Nederlanden Groep, the Dutch banking and insurance group, to increase its 10 per cent stake. ING, which is seeking some form of collaboration with BBL, also declined to comment yesterday. Over the past few months, market hopes of a significant development have frequently been raised ahead of BBL board meetings only to be dashed by bland statements from the bank afterwards. Brussels brokers cautioned against reading too much into yesterday's meeting, but pointed out that it was exceptional - coming a week ahead of the scheduled meeting - and that a number of executive directors had been called back from their holidays to attend. The future of BBL revolves around the attitude of Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, the Belgian holding company which controls 24 per cent of BBL. Mr Albert Frere, who heads the holding company, is believed to want to reduce the stake. ING last month turned down a 5.2 per cent stake offered by the Italian holding company Union Nazionale de Participazioni, on the grounds that the price was too high.</p>

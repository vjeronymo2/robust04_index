			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Doubts on south Wales initiative The value of the initiative launched by the government in 1988 to regenerate the south Wales valleys is cast into doubt by a report published yesterday by the Government Statistical Service. It shows that manufacturing employment in the area has fallen faster than in Wales as a whole, and that for every factory opened almost two have closed. The first five years of the Programme for the Valleys saw Pounds 770m of funding from the government and European Community. A second five-year programme was launched in April with grants increased to Pounds 350m a year. About 700,000 people live in the area and the initial programme aimed to repair environmental damage caused by the coal industry, strengthen the social fabric and build a new economy. However the report says that manufacturing employment decreased by nearly 6,400 between 1988 and 1992, a fall of 11 per cent, compared with 7 per cent in Wales as a whole. The report says that although 12,000 jobs were created between 73 new plants and 203 growing plants, 'all of these new jobs have now been more than offset by job losses'. It adds: '138 plants employing 8,600 people in 1988 have subsequently closed and 205 plants, though still in production, have lost 9,800 jobs.' The biggest losses have been in electrical and electronic engineering, with 4,300 jobs lost. About 40 per cent of manufacturing employment is by foreign-owned companies, up from 31 per cent in 1988. There has been only a small improvement in overall unemployment relative to the rest of the principality. The jobless rate in the valleys was 14.8 per cent in March 1988, 3.6 percentage points above that for Wales as a whole. By June this year the local unemployment rate was 13.2 per cent, still 3.3 percentage points higher. The Welsh Office yesterday defended the initiative. 'The Programme for the Valleys is an ambitious attempt to end decades of decline and nobody thought it could be done within a few years,' it said. Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, said in October that the first programme had drawn in Pounds 700m of extra private-sector investment, 2.6m sq ft of industrial floorspace had been provided, over 2,000 acres of derelict land cleared and more than 7,000 homes improved.

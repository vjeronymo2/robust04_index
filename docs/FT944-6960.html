			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / How To Spend It (The Electronic Age): More and more complex  -A variety of fads are catching on around the world. FT writers report on what is happening where Sales clerks in Japan's vast electronics stores have a lot of learning to do these days. Just a few years ago, they could persuade their customers to buy the latest stereo or television set on the merits of better sound quality or clearer pictures. Now, consumers want to know much more about complicated functions such as memory storage and software compatibility. A short-list of the best-selling electronic products in Japan reflects a definite trend away from conventional audio-visual equipment, although there are some exceptions. Sharp's Viewcam - a video camera with a liquid crystal display view-finder that allows the user to watch what is being filmed on the spot - is one rare example of continuing success in a tried-and-tested product sector. Another is wide-screen television sets. These have been on the market for only two years but have claimed a large slice of the market already. Sony says they will represent 30 per cent of overall television sales this year. Yet, while wide-screens have been enormously successful, some companies wonder if they will ever become a block-buster hit on the same scale as the Walkman or video recorders, rather than simply being replacements for old sets. Most of the present hits in the Japanese electronics market reflect the blurring of the old boundaries between consumer electronics and information technology. One of the most popular new products is the car navigation system - a global positioner that is installed in the car boot with a screen containing a digital map on the dash-board. These do not fall easily into the conventional definition of consumer electronic products; indeed, they can more accurately be described as information tools. Other successful examples of these are the new wave of personal digital assistants, such as Sharp's pen-based Zaurus system, and increasingly popular cellular telephones. This trend has led many Japanese companies to concentrate more of their resources on information technologies that will let consumers receive entertainment software or information through communications networks, or keep large amounts of information in digital storage media. Pioneer plans to link with two other companies to provide karaoke services down the telephone line, while Sony is focusing its energy on products merging information with entertainment. These include Telnavi, which allows the user to access a car navigation system through a CD-ROM drive incorporated into a television unit that also plays regular music discs.</p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Mobile phone sales soar to record levels The cellular phone, until recently regarded as a yuppie toy, appears to be on the verge of breaking through to the mass market. Mobile phone sales are at record levels in the run-up to Christmas as the better-off hunt for fashionable stocking fillers. Cellnet, the UK's second largest mobile phone operator, will connect nearly as many new subscribers to its network this month as in the whole of 1992. By the end of the year, the UK's three mobile phone operators will have nearly 2m subscribers between them. The tally was 1.4m at the start of the year, built up over eight years. Cellnet expects a net increase of more than 50,000 subscribers in December, compared with 67,000 in 1992. Last December the company made a net gain of 15,000 customers. Mr William Ostrom, Cellnet's director of corporate affairs, said: 'The market seems to have reached the point of take-off; price is ceasing to be regarded as a barrier.' The pre-Christmas sales rise comes after two months of rapid growth. In November, Cellnet made a net gain of 35,000 subscribers, and in October, 25,000. In November 1992, its net gain was 8,300. Vodafone and Mercury One-2-One, the other two network operators, have not disclosed their December subscriber numbers. But last month Vodafone, the largest operator, made a net gain of 29,382 subscribers, the highest monthly increase since its service opened in 1985. Mercury One-2-One is estimated by analysts to have about 35,000 subscribers in the London area, all gained since the launch of its network in September. Cellnet and Vodafone opened up the market a year ago with lower tariffs for occasional users, now at Pounds 25 for connection and a Pounds 12.77 monthly subscription. But Mercury One-2-One's launch, featuring free local calls in the evenings and at weekends for residential users and off-peak tariffs for business users down to 8p a minute, is widely credited with forging the breakthrough. Mr Robin Meakin, mobile communications analyst with CIT Research, a London consultancy, said cellular telephony was 'set to become far more competitive next year, as handset prices fall and a fourth network is launched by Hutchison Microtel'. CIT forecasts 7m mobile phone subscribers by 2003, about 12 per cent of the population. The Financial Times' mobile communications newsletter says subscriber numbers in western Europe rose by 45 per cent in the year to December 1, with strong growth in Germany and Spain.

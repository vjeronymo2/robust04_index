			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Record Lautro fine for Legal &amp; General A widespread and systematic failure to comply with regulatory requirements yesterday cost Legal &amp; General, one of the UK's leading life and general insurance companies, a total of Pounds 400,000, including a record fine. Lautro, the UK life insurance industry's self-regulating organisation, ordered L&amp;G to pay a fine of Pounds 180,000 as well as Pounds 220,000 in investigation costs. The charges, which were admitted by L&amp;G, stem from its failure to keep proper control of its direct sales agents. The charges highlight the way in which compliance responsibilities were delegated to branch management and staff without enough central control. L&amp;G said yesterday it remained committed to the philosophy behind its system  -that compliance had to be an integral part of the sales process and so was a matter for every sales agent, but had introduced central checking of all customer information from its sales force. The three breaches of Lautro rules were: failing to ensure that the company had a satisfactory compliance system; failing to ensure that sales agents complied with Lautro's rules; and failing to keep records showing adequately that the sales agents' duty to give the customer 'best advice' had been fulfilled. Lautro said the failure was 'across the board' and covered the period from July 1991 to October 1992. Among the concerns was that the company did not act effectively to monitor how many policies sold lapsed early - the persistency rate. That is seen as a significant indicator of whether people are being sold products that do not suit them. Although one charge included difficulties in the arrangements for handling client money, L&amp;G said it was confident that no client money had been in jeopardy. It said also that no instance of mis-selling had been identified. Mr David Prosser, group chief executive, said yesterday: 'Since the problems were identified, we have implemented significant changes to our systems with the intention of achieving best practice standards of compliance.'

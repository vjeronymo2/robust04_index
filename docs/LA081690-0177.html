			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Mexico Guilty of 'Dumping' Cement: The U.S. International Trade Commission has  imposed higher import duties on Mexican cement after finding that Cementos  Mexicanos (Cemex) and other manufacturers were guilty of "dumping" cement on  the U.S. market at artificially low prices. According to government estimates,  Mexico exported $111 million in gray portland cement and clinker, the two  concrete components covered by the ruling. Cemex has said it will appeal the  decision.  </P></p>

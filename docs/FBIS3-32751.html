			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Live relay] </F>   [Text] [Announcer] Our reporter Dario Hoyos is talking with  President Cesar Gaviria at the presidential building. Come in,  Dario.    [Hoyos] President Gaviria, I can see you are very upset with  the Council of State. In light of the ongoing political  campaign, don't you think that this issue, which could turn into  a confrontation between the executive and the judicial branches,  will prove detrimental for the country? In addition, could it  be that your election plans for the OAS are being thwarted?    [Gaviria] I will not discuss the last portion of your  question. I know the State Council does not think along those  lines. Anyway, we did not discuss it. I am concerned about  what the Council of State did and the lack of specific legal  documentation. If we were talking about a judicial ruling, it  would be easier to study and consider the scope of what  happened. But we are dealing with an opinion, a simple  statement. I am not looking for trouble but I (?stick) to my  convictions and do not allow myself to be intimidated by any  decision or argument. I fight for the things I believe in. But  I am not upset. I normally do not get upset, but my convictions  are strong. What you are hearing indicates firmness of  conviction. I think the legal arguments that we sent to the  Council of State are valid.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jonathon Rees] </F>   [Text] Welkom April 6 SAPA -- There could be no free and  fair elections in the Orange Free State [OFS], the National  Party [NP] said on Wednesday [6 April], citing alleged  intimidation by supporters of the African National Congress as  the reason.    The NP further accused the Independent Electoral Commission  (IEC) of siding with the ANC and not being interested in  levelling the political playing field. "They are absolutely  useless and their operation access means nothing," said Mr Flip  Nel, former NP MP for Welkom and number three on the party's  Free State election list. "The ANC is making sure the voice of  the NP is not being heard," he said at the end of the first day  of an election sweep through the northern Free State goldfields.    A complaint would be laid with the IEC on Thursday charging  that the ANC was preventing the NP from entering townships to  canvass for votes and support, Mr Nel said.    An NP campaign truck toured several townships on Wednesday,  handing out pamphlets and badges but choosing to skirt the edges  of each rather than risk going in too deep. Organisers said  this was a security measure as many townships were considered  too dangerous, and that too much time spent in them gave the  NP's opponents a chance to organise resistance to the party's  presence.    In Henneman's Phomolong township on Wednesday, groups of  children and a few adults ran alongside the NP truck, gathering  and destroying party pamphlets as they were distributed. By the  time the NP left the area after a 20-minute visit, about 20  adults had gathererd at the township entrance chanting "Viva  ANC, down with NP". Similar scenes were witnessed in other  black townships, though a more favourable response was seen in  Welkom's coloured Bronville township.    Mr Nel described international observers travelling with the  NP roadshow as "a nuisance" because the NP had to take their  safety into account when deciding whether or not to enter a  township. Recent weeks have seen a number of incidents of  harassment of National Party roadshows in the Free State,  particularly on or near the goldfields.    The NP last week was granted an interdict stopping ANC  supporters from threatening or assaulting NP members in Parys.</p>

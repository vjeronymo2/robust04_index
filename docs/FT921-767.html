			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: Probe will not hold up Nestle bid for Perrier NESTLE, the Swiss food group bidding for Perrier, made clear yesterday it would not be prevented from buying shares in the French mineral water group during the European Commission's four-month investigation into the bid. The Swiss company expects to launch its FFr15.46bn (Dollars 2.76bn) bid officially in the next few days. Technically, the merger will be suspended during the EC's investigation, announced two days ago, but Nestle is allowed to go ahead with the public offer. Under EC rules, the group will be unable to exercise the voting rights attached to any Perrier shares it buys, except to 'maintain the full value' of its investment. If the Commission decides the bid is anti-competitive, it can ask Nestle to unwind the merger. However, it seems more likely that Brussels will try to amend the deal - for example, by asking Nestle to sell some mineral water brands. Since new rules came into force in September 1990, the Commission has only once outlawed a merger - the Franco-Italian bid for de Havilland, the Canadian aircraft maker - and has never quashed a public offer.</p>

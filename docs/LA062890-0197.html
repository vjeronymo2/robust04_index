			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> POLICE PRESS CAMPAIGNS FOR RECRUITS  </P> <P> Santa Ana Police Chief Paul M. Walters on Wednesday introduced a campaign to  recruit more local applicants for some of the toughest jobs on the streets.  </P> <P> Billboards portraying a smiling Officer John Aguilar and a slogan, "Earn Our  Academy Award," will be installed around Santa Ana as part of the city's  $50,000 advertising effort to recruit police applicants.  </P> <P> The first billboard went up Wednesday at 3rd and Bristol streets, just three  blocks from where Aguilar grew up -- a point not lost on Walters, who wants to  attract local Latino applicants.  </P> <P> "We're hoping that he'll make an influence on the young people in our community  to grow up and become police officers," Walters said.  </P> <P> Over the next year, 25 billboards and 25 bus shelter advertisements will be  installed at various places in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Other Orange County cities are also turning to advertising and other promotions  to recruit applicants. Recruiting Officer Dave Hill of the Orange Police  Department said he has had to flood the advertising market to fill police  positions.  </P> <P> "We also advertise in newspapers and trade journals -- I was even on a game  show (Classic Concentration) and put in a plug," said Hill, adding that Orange  has five police openings. "We even got a call from Toronto."  </P> <P> Santa Ana has openings for 17 patrol officers and hopes to add another 10  investigator jobs when the city adopts its new budget, Walters said.  </P> <P> Applicants must pass exhaustive tests and a background check that includes  credit history and driving records, said Lt. Marty Shirey, investigator.  </P> <P> "We look at the person's total background," she said.  </P> <P> Although standards have not been lowered in an effort to find more recruits,  the city has removed some of the obstacles to applying for the jobs, she said.  </P> <P> For example, in three months the department will replace an old test with a  general knowledge test that will require less study to pass. The city now  issues a book concerning laws and police procedure that applicants must study  to pass the test, Shirey said.  </P> <P> "We get liars and people who have been fired from three or four jobs," she  said. "What we're looking for is sound judgement, maturity and that they show  some responsibility and honesty."  </P> <P> The problem isn't in finding enough applicants, Walters said, but in finding  people who will survive the screening.  </P> <P> "Out of every 100 applicants, we only hire one," he said. "We just want to  maintain the highest standards."  </P> <P> Walters said Aguilar was chosen to be a Police Department spokesman because of  his ties to the community, his cultural background and his career achievements.  </P> <P> "Growing up in this town, I have a little more sincere feeling about this city  and this community," Aguilar said.  </P> <P> He joined the Orange Police Department in 1977 and was named officer of the  year in 1980. He has worked in law enforcement on the federal level and is now  assigned as an investigator of sexual assault crimes in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> The job pool has changed over the last few years, said Lt. Greg Cooper, who  recruits and trains officers for Santa Ana. For example, out of 212 people who  applied for police positions in June, 60% failed to show up for the initial  written test. There's also an agility test, medical examination, oral test,  psychological test and background check.  </P> <P> In the end, Cooper expects to hire two or three potential officers from the 212  applications. These few will attend the police academy for more than three  months, then take 16 weeks of field training.  </P> <P> In Irvine, where there are two unfilled police jobs, Sgt. Jeff Kermode says he  has seen a change in the job force.  </P> <P> "There is a different work ethic now. People are into 9-to-5," he said. "They  want to do their job, earn their pay, and leave."  </P> <P> Huntington Beach also has five openings on its police staff and the Tustin  Police Department has four.

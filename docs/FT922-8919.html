			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Management: A little extra self-help at the Halifax John Teasdale, who manages a corporate health programme for Halifax Building Society, says his company introduced a number of changes following a 30 per cent increase in premiums last year. Halifax, which employs more than 24,000 people, is typical of the white collar employers who have begun to offer healthcare in the last 20 years. The company's scheme which offers Bupa care to employees and a discounted rate to spouses and dependents began in 1980. Last year's increase 'forced us to look closely at what we were doing,' says Teasdale. Halifax introduced 'excesses', making their staff liable for the first Pounds 50 of any claim. The company also took action to change the attitudes of its staff towards the scheme. 'We found that people regarded the scheme as an alternative to the National Health Service. But the society sees the scheme as complementary. We had to make sure that they understood a claim on the scheme was a claim on the society, says Teasdale.' Halifax is having claims forms reprinted to show the its logo to press home the point. The measures had an immediate impact. and Bupa increased its premiums by only 5 per cent at the 1992 renewal. 'That speaks for itself,' says Teasdale, who adds that charging has limited use of the service by employees suffering, for example, sports injuries. Halifax has also taken more measures to save costs. It encourages Halifax-based employees to use the local Bupa-Elland hospital, with which it has negotiated discounts, rather than others in the locality.</p>

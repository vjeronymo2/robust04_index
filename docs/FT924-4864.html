			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / UK Gilts: Differing views on prospects for prices GILTS moved slightly lower as the market digested the implications of the Bank of England's plan this Wednesday to auction Pounds 2.5bn of a new 10-year benchmark bond. The sale of the 8 per cent stock due 2003 is expected to proceed reasonably smoothly, after some reports last week that foreign investors were showing enthusiasm for the securities on offer. However, the auction is likely to ram home in the minds of many investors the large volumes of gilts due to go on sale over the next two years due to the need to fund Britain's burgeoning public sector borrowing requirement. The admission from Mr Alan Budd, the Treasury's chief economic adviser, that it would be 'many years' before the government's finances returned to surplus did little to damp concern about funding. Mr Budd told a Commons select committee, that because of the depth of the recession the proportion of total UK output accounted for by the government deficit would rise 'for some years'. This marks a change in the Treasury's thinking about the PSBR. In last month's Autumn Statement, the Treasury said the proportion would be about 7 per cent of GDP in 1993-94, amounting to roughly Pounds 44bn. Many gilt specialists have come round to the view that yearly deficits of this size will continue during the mid to late 1990s. However, as to the Treasury's thinking about the profile for the deficit later in the 1990s, the gilt market has little to go on other than figures set out in the March Budget. According to this, the PSBR as a proportion of GDP was due to peak in 1993-94 at 4.75 per cent and then come down to 3.5 per cent in 1994-95. While gilt yields moved up along the yield curve by a few basis points on the week, there were differing views as to how prices will change over the next few weeks. Mr Nigel Richardson, a gilt specialist at SG Warburg Securities, reckons demand will be subdued on account of the funding problems and indications that weak inflationary pressures may be starting to exert themselves. Indications of this sort came with latest figures for the volume of banknotes in circulation, which suggested that M0, the narrow measure of the money supply which is a good guide to overall demand, rose during November by about 3 per cent compared with November last year. If confirmed when the Bank issues official M0 figures on December 18, that would be the biggest year-on-year rise for M0 in any month this year. Echoing Mr Richardson's concerns about a recovery and its likely impact on inflation, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research said that the Treasury's target of keeping underlying inflation at less than 4 per cent could be exceeded during 1993. More positive about the future for gilts is Mr Malcolm Roberts, a bond analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. He reckons that investors in longer-dated securities will take heart from indications that the UK will be in no hurry for further cuts in base rates, now at 7 per cent. That should put a floor under prices at this end of the curve, and cause significant buying of securities of longer maturities, particularly from overseas investors, giving the overall gilt market a boost.</p>

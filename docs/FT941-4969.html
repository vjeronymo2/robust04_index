			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Cadbury auditing proposal attacked The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales yesterday attacked a central recommendation of the Cadbury committee on corporate governance that companies should report publicly on internal controls, Andrew Jack writes. The institute's financial reporting and auditing group called instead for a much reduced statement in companies' annual reports and a separate private report from auditors to audit committees. It also called for company accounts to include an internal control statement by directors and a declaration that their responsibilities have been met.</p>

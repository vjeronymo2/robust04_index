			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lagos, 2 Feb (NAN/PANA) -- Only 641 of the 649  heroin wraps which had been seized by the Nigerian National Drug  Law Agency (NDLEA) last December have been accounted for in a  court in Lagos. The seized heroin, allegedly imported by one Joe  Brown Ekubueze, were seized by the anti-narcotics agency at  Apapa Port and had been stored at warehouses in Buxton and Shaw  Roads, Ikoyi in Lagos.    The discrepancy was raised Tuesday by an unidentified state  witness, who claimed to be a narcotic superintendent with NDLEA.  He said the discrepancy was only discovered when the drugs  actually seized were counted by a team from the miscellaneous  offences tribunal, which has started hearing the case. He  claimed that there was overestimation of the wraps which were  seized last December. He said the total wraps of heroin,  excluding one wrap presented as exhibit in the court, was 289.    Retracting from his earlier testimony, the agent said the  total number of seized heroin wraps was 290 and not 302 [as]  were found by the tribunal's inspection team. He added that  another 87 pouches of heroin were seized 30 December, each  containing two wraps, plus the one tendered as [an] exhibit in  the tribunal. This brought the number of wraps to 351 and not  347, said the witness, who was only referred to as "Mr W".  Asked by Justice Olufunmilayo One-Okpaku to explain the  discrepancy, the agent said "I am not competent to explain the  discrepancy in the number of wraps counted because I am not the  exhibit keeper."</p>

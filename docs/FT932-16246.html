			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Second Shuttle launch aborted THE US National Aeronautics and Space Administration yesterday had to abort its second space shuttle launch in two weeks after a last-minute malfunction, creating more frustration for an agency struggling to scale its ambitions and its overheads down to meet budget realities. The launch of the shuttle Discovery was halted 11 seconds before lift-off after a warning that a valve had not closed. A fortnight ago, the shuttle Columbia's engines were shut off just 3 seconds before lift-off. While the malfunction appeared to be relatively minor - another launch attempt has been tentatively scheduled for tomorrow - it follows a series of setbacks to the shuttle programme. In addition, a faulty launch two weeks ago by General Dynamics' Atlas Centaur rocket, its third failure in eight attempts, has prompted the industry magazine Space News to warn of a 'launch crisis on the horizon' if the government does not start serious work soon on a new launch system. Nasa's 1994 budget, due to be published tomorrow, is expected to show an increase of around Dollars 1bn over this year's Dollars 14.3bn. However, the agency has been ordered by President Bill Clinton to redesign the costly space station to save money. Administration officials say Nasa has for years been overambitious.</p>

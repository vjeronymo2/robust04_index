			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DARYL GATES' COURT FINE  </P> <P> As I reflect back on the past year, it seems that 1988 may be remembered for  the violence that accompanied it. The gang violence that continues to plague  Los Angeles County stands out most, probably because it is so close to home.  One of the tragic offshoots of this gang violence is the miscarriage of justice  in the decision of Larez vs. Gates and select officers of the LAPD. I have  spent almost 20 years working in the criminal justice system. I have seen some  perverse decisions but this one is certainly among the worst.  </P> <P> I am familiar with the rigorous procedures of law governing the issuance of a  warrant. These officers developed and presented evidence before a judge that  this family, a family with gang associations, had possession of a gun that was  used in a gang murder. A warrant was issued by the judge who reviewed the facts  and evidence of this case. This search warrant was served by uniformed  officers. Consistent with the disrespect of legitimate authority and the enmity  which "gang" families have for law enforcement, Jessie Larez attacked the  officers.  </P> <P> Faced with this unprovoked attack, the officers exercised a reasonable and  prudent amount of force to overcome the resistance. There were neither  extensive nor multiple injuries inflicted on anyone that would have been  consistent with excessive force. It was unfortunate that Larez received a  broken nose, however, this is one of the possible consequences of a struggle.  </P> <P> What is unfortunate in this instance are the actions of Judge Robert Takasugi  and this jury. Takasugi should have had the courage to recognize this suit as  the frivolous action it was and to treat it as such, but this is a stand few  judges have the courage to take. Jury members in the sterile environment of  their chamber exercised a self-righteous pomposity not uncommon to take a slap  at established authority.  </P> <P> The message this judge and jury has sent out to the men and women in law  enforcement is this: It is not enough that you put your life on the line for us  daily. Your financial security and that of your families is now on the line  too. It doesn't matter how rigorously you adhere to the law and to department  procedures. If you offend some suspect, be prepared to lose everything you  have. Neither does the First Amendment to the Constitution apply to you people  in law enforcement. You are not entitled to voice personal opinions or  feelings.  </P> <P> Yes, this judge and jury may feel good about themselves. They have taken a  significant step forward to take some of the risk out of gang activity and to  promote future gang violence in our communities.  </P> <P> J. P.

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Food: Braised oxtails: the glory that was Rome . . . - Chef Franco Taruschio explains some Italian regional food fads ROMAN FOOD is less well known than that of some other regions of Italy, notably Tuscany, Piedmont, Emilia Romagna and Milan. The region is hotter and the countryside poorer; covered with the same ragged sheep which appear in the landscapes of Guido Reni or Claude Lorraine. There are few star winemakers to give encouragement to the chefs, but this does not mean that Roman food lacks a distinctive flavour or that the Romans do not have strong opinions about what they like. This became clear in a simple Roman cafe one morning. The owner and his wife were decrying the culinary innovations which threatened the 'good old' food of the city. 'We were quite happy with our braised oxtails,' they said, 'and sausages with polenta.' They lost me, however, when they began speaking of a notable treat: the intestines of 30-day-old lambs, still filled with their mothers' milk, and served on a bed of gnocchi. Fortunately I had the best of interpreters in Franco Taruschio, of the Walnut Tree in Abergavenny. Franco comes from the Marches on the Adriatic coast, which is near enough to Rome to allow him some understanding of the city's gastronomic predilections. We had just come from the market in the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II, where we had examined piles of expensive ceps looking distinctly ropey at the end of the season; stalls selling every conceivable variety of flour, from rice and potato to chick pea; huge piles of pecorino cheese made from the milk of Sardinian and Roman sheep (and rather larger stacks of Parmigiano Reggiano from Emilia Romagna); live carp and eels, their gills quivering; swordfish and one-eyed scampi from the Adriatic; dingy and aqueous lumps of meat enlivened by half-shaved haunches of boar, thrushes and, of course, oxtail. The day before, Franco had hunted down a couple of up and coming Roman restaurants. Da Paris (Piazza S. Calisto, 7A. Tel: 585378) is in Trastevere. The name celebrates a former owner, and has nothing to do with Paris, France; in fact the cooking is a tribute to the Jewish Roman tradition - the old ghetto is about a kilometre away. An excellent bresaola made from beef topside formed a simple antipasto with some fresh anchovies marinated in lemon juice. Chick peas replaced the usual beans in the pasta soup; a shellfish risotto came with big pieces of fish. I braved the tripe alla romana which came with grated pecorino cheese rather than the usual parmesan. (The guts had been well cleaned, and the meat was less pungent and more delicate than most.) The others ate a selection of fried food which was billed as quintessentially Roman. Deep fried food is one of the hallmarks of Roman cooking; as it was once that of both Lyon and Paris. Da Paris did an interesting mixture of different things cooked in a light batter: artichokes, delicious marrow flowers and dried cod or bacala. The pudding, too, was deep fried: palle or balls of ricotta. Originally these were called St Calisto's Balls, but in deference to the dedicatee of the church opposite, this title has been dropped. The deep fried ricotta was filled with chocolate and cinnamon, with a little sambuca. Da Paris is highly recommended to anyone visiting Rome. Per head with good wine: Pounds 40. Our second choice, Il Cardinale near the Pantheon (Via delle Carcere 6. Tel: 686-93-36) was a bit of a busted flush. Adriana Montellanico's cooking started out promisingly, but began to falter halfway through the meal. Brioche was served with a little mousse of mascarpone cheese and anchovies; this was followed by some artichokes stewed in olive oil (alla romana) and a salad of pigs' trotters. Dried cod was again the principal ingredient of ravioli alla bacala, which was excellent under its rich tomato sauce. Also good was a roulade of pasta stuffed with ceps, parmigiano reggiano and cream cheese. The main courses proved disappointing: rabbit fillet in a sauce of rosemary, garlic and wild fennel seemed to lack texture, while some dried cod in a sauce with grapes proved, I thought, a mistake. The puddings were better, especially my crostata, which looked somewhat like a Linzertorte of candied orange peel, a typically Roman dish. A sort of soup of mille-feuilles was not so exciting. The meal cost about Pounds 40 a head, including wine.</p>

			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / UK Company News: C&amp;W creates cables venture with Beijing Cable and Wireless, the telecommunications group, and the Chinese government yesterday announced in Beijing a joint venture to develop, install and maintain international submarine telecommunications cables. The venture, Sino-British Submarine Systems, is capitalised at Dollars 27m (Pounds 18m). The directorate general, telecommunications, of the China Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications will hold a 51 per cent stake. The balance will be held by Great Eastern Telecommunications, a joint venture between C&amp;W and Hongkong Telecom. The new company is the first cable venture of its kind between a UK company and China and underlines C&amp;W's commitment to the Asia Pacific region as its prime focus for investment over the next decade. Hongkong Telecom, owned 57.5 per cent by C&amp;W, is the most profitable part of the group accounting for Pounds 554m of its Pounds 829m operating profit last year. Earlier this year Mr James Ross, chief executive, said HKT's free cash flow would be devoted to investments in Asia-Pacific. The deal also reinforces the growing relationship between the Chinese authorities and C&amp;W. The agreement was signed by Lord Young, executive chairman of C&amp;W Group, and Mr Luen Zhengxi of the Chinese telecommunications directorate general. The intention is to acquire a deep ocean submarine cable installation and maintenance ship, the Flexservice 3, at present used by C&amp;W Marine. The venture will acquire a smaller cable ship and support vessels owned by the Chinese. S-BSS will own and operate an 11-acre port area in Shanghai. The immediate objective is to allow China to maintain the new China-Japan fibre optic cable system inaugurated in December 1993.</p>

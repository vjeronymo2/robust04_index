			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Gao Jian (7559 1017)] </F>   [Text] United Nations, 21 Jan (XINHUA) -- A Chinese  representative said here today that only by making a definite  commitment to the complete prohibition and thorough destruction  of nuclear weapons and by adopting appropriate and resolute  steps to that end will the measures of nuclear states to prevent  the proliferation of nuclear weapons have a genuine significance.    The second session of the preparatory committee for the 1995  conference of parties to the Treaty on Nonproliferation of  Nuclear Weapons was convened this week at the United Nations  Headquarters in New York. Sha Zukang, head of the Chinese  delegation to the session expounded China's views on how to  effectively prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons.    Sha Zukang said China recognizes the importance of the  prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons as well as  the maintenance of an effective international legal mechanism  for that purpose. At the same time, China also believes that  nonproliferation by itself is not the ultimate goal that the  mankind should pursue, and that the real objective should be  complete prohibition, thorough destruction of nuclear weapons,  and realization of a nuclear-free world.    Sha Zukang believes that only by making a definite  commitment  and by adopting appropriate and resolute steps to that end will  the measures of nuclear states to prevent the proliferation of  nuclear weapons have a genuine significance. He said failure to  do that will perpetuate the defect of the existing imbalance in  the treaty in the rights and obligations between the nuclear and  nonnuclear states. To realize quickly the objective of the  total prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, a  large number of nonnuclear countries have given up the option of  acquiring and developing nuclear weapons; however, their demand  for security guarantees has not been fundamentally satisfied.    Sha Zukang said the Chinese Government believes that  conditions are ripe for all nuclear states to make the  commitment of not being the first to use nuclear weapons and not  to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against nonnuclear  states and nuclear free zones.    Sha Zukang criticized some big nuclear powers for a lack of  sincerity for peace in this respect. He said if nuclear  states, particularly the big nuclear powers with global nuclear  attack capability, are unable to take even the limited step of  guaranteeing that they will not be the first to use nuclear  weapons and not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons  against nonnuclear states and nuclear free zones, how can they  expect the large number of nonnuclear states to trust their  sincerity for peace.    He pointed out that it will be difficult to ensure  universality and enduring effectiveness for the international  nuclear nonproliferation mechanism if nuclear states only make  one-sided emphasis on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons  and if they only emphasize their own absolute security to the  neglect of the nonnuclear states' legitimate security concerns.</p>

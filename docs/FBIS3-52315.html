			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The IDF has removed most of  the permanent roadblocks which were set up in the West Bank  following the imposition of the closure on the territories a  year ago. Senior military sources have said that more than 20  roadblocks were removed. The IDF forces in the West Bank  currently employ a method of placing ad hoc roadblocks. The  permanent roadblocks in Jerusalem were left in place. [passage  omitted]    [A report by ITIM correspondent Dani Zaqen on page 1 of Tel  Aviv HATZOFE in Hebrew on 2 January adds: "Political sources in  Jerusalem and the PLO leadership have officially confirmed an  ITIM report from last week according to which the security  forces completely ceased hunting Fatah terrorists in the  territories, including those who committed murders of Israelis  and Palestinians." The report goes on to say that "senior  military elements" have expressed opposition to this move,  saying that "it delivers a death blow to the IDF deterrence  power." HATZOFE adds that "this opposition has been relayed to  the IDF command and through it to the prime minister, and it has  been learned that Rabin is currently considering rejecting or  postponing the move."]</p>

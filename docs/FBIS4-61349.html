			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 26, RIA -- "We are carrying with us  new ideas as to how feed and intensify the political direction  of Bosnian settlement," Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said in  an exclusive interview before his flight to Geneva to discuss  Yugoslav problems with US Secretary of State Warren Christopher.    "The military tendency is now looming quite distinctly due  to  irresponsible activities of Serbian commandos, but, let us hope,  they won't go so far as to realise their plans," said Kozyrev.    In his words, the Security Council is busy reviewing all the  apsects of likely military measures on the part of NATO. "We  have succeeded in preventing nato from having a free hand in any  such action, it is the Security Council which is now to follow  it very intently". Kozyrev expressed the hope that the Serbs  will continue performing their obligations before the UN and,  correspondingly, the UN will not be confronted with the need to  decide on NATO strikes. "But all will depend on the Bosnian  Serbs' conduct," stressed Kozyrev, noting that, despite the  possibility of military measures, the right decision should be  sought on the political plane.    The minister reported that he was in touch with Serbian  President Slobodan Milosevic and received from him today an  answer to his message, in which Milosevic expresses the desire  to sustain constructive cooperation with Russia, he showed  understanding of the Russian position.    In the words of Kozyrev, he was going in the next two-three  days to meet French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and, perhaps,  foreign ministers of a number of other Western states to discuss  the same problems. "The next two-three days will see intensive  diplomatic arrangements, which, as I think, should open a way  toward the closing stage--a summit for rounding off all this  tragic episode," said Kozyrev.</p>

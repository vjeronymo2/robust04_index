			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Australia raises rates to squeeze inflation: Move by Willis decouples the country's policy from that of the US The Australian government yesterday instigated a one-percentage-point rise in short-term interest rates, a larger-than-expected move that represents a significant change of heart for monetary policy. The Reserve Bank, the central bank, raised its official money market interest rates to 6.5 per cent, the second rise in two months. Just four months ago, Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, was berating bond market traders for punting on a rise in Australian rates. Both he and Mr Ralph Willis, the Australian treasurer, were insistent that with little sign of inflationary pressure in the economy low rates were necessary to stimulate business confidence. But Mr Willis, urged on by the Reserve Bank, now appears to have been swayed by the growing fashion to hit inflation, currently only 1.7 per cent, before it has a chance to take off. The move also decouples Australian policy from that of the US. The full-point rise was large enough to spare the Reserve Bank from immediate pressure to follow any tightening by the US in coming weeks. The decision was a 'judicious use of monetary policy', Mr Willis said yesterday. In the 1980s, inflation was running at 7 per cent before the government started to tighten monetary policy. 'With continuing evidence of robust growth, any delay now in increasing cash rates would risk larger and more prolonged increases in interest rates later in the cycle,' he said. Monetary policy was also a more flexible instrument than changes in fiscal policy, he added. Pressure on interest rates has come from a strong economic recovery compared with the rest of the industrialised world. The annual growth rate reached 4.3 per cent during the June quarter. Mr Willis said the government had been shaving its official forecast for the current financial year, which began in July, down to 4.25 per cent from 4.5 per cent. In the past three months, 140,000 new jobs were created and analysts predict the 3 per cent growth in employment forecast in the government's 1994-95 budget will be exceeded. New capital expenditure in the three months to June rose 7.7 per cent in constant prices, the best figure since the September quarter of 1990. Spending on plant and equipment in the period rose 14 per cent in real terms. One of the key assumptions underlying the 1994 federal budget was that business investment would rise by about 14.5 per cent in the current financial year. Until recently, however, this had remained sluggish, and manufacturers and analysts alike were sceptical that the target could be reached. Australian economists still say the strength and durability of the investment recovery remains uncertain. Over Australia's winter months, a number of developments have occurred. First, the country's drought, which is affecting important agricultural areas on the east coast, has worsened and persisted through key planting seasons. Economists point out that this has a mixed immediate impact on domestic prices, with grain and feedstock prices rising, but the slaughter of livestock pushing down meat prices. Longer-term, however, the climatic conditions will almost certainly depress exports (wheat, for example, is a significant export category) and could have inflationary implications if future stocks are squeezed. Overall, the drought has been reckoned to knock about half a percentage point off Australia's annual growth. Second, Australia's current account situation has looked increasingly problematic, even before the drought considerations. The ADollars 2.14bn (Pounds 993m) deficit notched up in August was the worst monthly figure for almost four years. Analysts and government officials pointed out that 'special items' on the import side explained some of the deterioration. Nevertheless, the data added support to the argument that Australia risks seeing business investment surge all at once, sucking in imported investment goods, machinery and the like. So with drought depressing some export categories and tough bargaining from Japanese customers for coal and iron ore leading to lower orders this year, the need to act sooner rather than later may have become imperative. Most analysts are expecting more rises, with the next one coming around February. One forecast that short-term rates would peak at about 9 per cent, half the 18 per cent high in January 1990. While the markets welcomed the tightening of monetary policy, they are also putting pressure on the government to accelerate the reduction of its budget deficit. The government's budget deficit plan aims to reduce the shortfall to 1 per cent of gross domestic product by 1996-97. The 1994-95 deficit is forecast to reach ADollars 11.7bn, representing 2.5 per cent of GDP. Mr Bernie Fraser, Reserve Bank governor, has also put pressure on the government, saying it should do more to reduce the deficit. Although Mr Willis does not rule out spending cuts in next year's budget, Mr Keating has been saying there is no need to cut expenditure while the economy is growing. 'This doesn't mean fiscal policy can't be changed,' he told businessmen yesterday. 'On the contrary, if economic circumstances change fundamentally, sound economic management dictates that a fiscal strategy may need to be modified. But this isn't the case now.'</p>

			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Pakistan urged to help find bombers MR P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister, has demanded help from Mr Nawaz Sharif, prime minister of Pakistan, in finding the men held responsible for the terrorist blasts which last month rocked Bombay. Mr Rao and Mr Sharif met at the weekend during a regional summit in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It was their first encounter since the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque in December set off a wave of Hindu-Moslem violence in India and damaged relations between India and Pakistan. Bilateral ties were further strained by the Bombay blasts, which India believes were carried out with the support of groups in Pakistan. Mr Rao asked Mr Sharif to co-operate in tracing members of a family involved in organised crime in Bombay, whom Indian investigators suspect of having planned the bombings. Indian officials believe the family fled from Bombay to Dubai and may have subsequently gone to Pakistan. Mr Sharif promised to help in the search. Indian police probing the blasts, which left about 300 dead and around 1,000 injured, have arrested about 50 people. Many of them are suspected of having worked for the accused family. Police said they had found a further 800kg of explosives, taking the total since the blasts to over 4,500kg, in addition to the estimated 300kg used in the blasts. Meanwhile, the Dhaka summit agreed to establish a preferential trading zone of the six member countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation - Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Violence yesterday hit Srinagar and other towns in Kashmir for the fourth day in succession. About 100 people have been killed in fighting between Indian security forces and supporters of groups battling for independence or union with Pakistan.</p>

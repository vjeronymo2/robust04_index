			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: Market watches Bundesbank council - Currencies Foreign exchanges will focus this week on Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting which will help investors decide on the outlook for European interest rates. The feeling prior to the last meeting on August 18 was that the council, if it wanted to cut rates, would do so either then, or at this week's meeting on September 1. Rates were left unchanged after the last meeting. Elsewhere, the dollar will be closely watched. Last Friday it rose sharply on the back of a rally in the bond market, helped by reports that short-term, speculative funds might have started buying the currency. But most analysts continue to believe that the dollar remains subject to a bear trend. The US market will not be short of data, with at least a dozen releases scheduled. Most important will be the non-farm payroll, which is released on Friday, but Mr Dave Munro, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics in New York, said the 'hot button' statistics would be the inflation indices and retail sales, which come later. Although market expectations are for a fairly modest payroll number, the inflation data have the potential to unsettle the bond market, and hence the dollar. Some analysts are predicting that they will show price pressures rising, as the output gap closes. Expectations of a further cut in German rates have dampened recently, following comments last week from senior Bundesbank officials. Analysts at IBJ International in London, commented: 'Although domestic factors should ensure inflation continues to decelerate along with monetary growth, these arguments in favour of a 4 per cent Discount rate are finely balanced against the economy's surprisingly buoyant recovery . . . the desire to avoid any move too close to election dates and disturbing, early noises ahead of the next pay round.' The Bundesbank's decision will have important ramifications for other European currencies. If the perception takes hold that German rates have bottomed, this will make it more difficult for other European countries to cut rates and will lend support to the D-Mark. In the UK, traders will focus on Wednesday's purchasing managers' index for signs of cost pressures in the economy. Opinion is sharply split as to whether rates should be left untouched, or whether the Bank is moving too slowly to combat inflation. Higher rates would probably help sterling, but for the time being the currency's fate continues to lie in the hands of the dollar.</p>

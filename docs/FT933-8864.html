			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / DSS may face Pounds 67m bill over tax relief THE Department of Social Services said yesterday it may have to pay up to Pounds 67m in retroactive national insurance contribution rebates to personal pension holders whose applications for tax relief went missing up to four years ago, Norma Cohen writes. The DSS said it had reached agreement with the Association of British Insurers on some 32,000 personal pension plans for which original applications for tax relief cannot be found. Under terms of the agreement, ABI member companies could have to pay Pounds 6m to Pounds 7m to clients to bring investment returns into line with what they would have been had the tax rebates been received on time.</p>

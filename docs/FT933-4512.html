			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt falls by 1.3% in low turnover DOUBTS began to emerge that the Bundesbank may not move on rates tomorrow, and some bourses took this as a signal to move lower, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT fell below the 1,900 level although turnover remained low throughout the session, only spiking in the car sector. The DAX index ended off 24.32 or 1.3 per cent at 1,885.96 in turnover of DM6.3bn. In the post-bourse the index slipped back further to 1,878.84. Some analysts noted that most investors were unwilling to take positions ahead of tomorrow's Buba meeting, particularly as a view was beginning to take hold that there might not be a significant reduction in interest rates, or that the council members might wait until their next meeting on September 23. The car sector remained active with Volkswagen sliding a further DM10.50 to DM361.50 and Daimler down DM10.60 at DM730.50. The correction in PARIS continued, with a fall in the CAC-40 index of 20.67 to 2,137.29. Turnover was a low FFr2.8bn. Lafarge Coppee, the cement group, was among the heaviest losers on the day, closing down FFr17.80 at FFr409.50 after reports that the company was to consider a capital increase at its board meeting next week. Elsewhere, Carrefour continued to perform well after interim results, rising FFr31 to FFr3,111. In the media sector, Canal Plus put on another FFr20 to FFr1,324 following the announcement of reorganisation plans for the television sector, while Generale des Eaux, a shareholder in Canal Plus, added FFr34 to FFr2,640. The latter has recently attracted an upgrade from Hoare Govett from hold to buy. There have been reports that Generale des Eaux might realise a capital gain from swapping all or part of its 20 per cent holding in Canal Plus for a stake in Havas. Total fell FFr5.10 to FFr304.10 ahead of today's results. MILAN remained under pressure, the Comit index falling 7.15 to 609.75 in volatile conditions, amid worries about rights issues and expectations of some movement on German interest rates on Thursday. Mediobanca, the merchant bank, shed L864 or 5 per cent to L16,434 in response to its planned rights issue, announced late on Monday. The move prompted speculation yesterday that it might be planning to use the cash as part of a consortium to buy BCI, the privatisation candidate. Fiat continued to lose ground on continuing worries that it might be planning a capital raising exercise, the shares falling L178 or 2.7 per cent to L6,409. Ferruzzi's continued advance, up L37.2 to L411.7, prompted speculation that the banks preparing a rescue package were building stakes. ZURICH made up some of the ground lost on Monday, the SMI index rising 10.9 to 2,403.4, although there was concern that further profit-taking could emerge in the absence of clear-cut moves towards lower European interest rates. STOCKHOLM saw Volvo Bs down SKr25 at SKr458 following Monday's news of its merger with Renault. Unibank Securities, in an initial comment on the deal, said that negative factors for Volvo included the fact that the Swedish car group was to lose 'absolute control over its industrial core', while the positive elements included long term development funding. The Affarsvarlden general index fell 6.3 to 1,284.4 in turnover of SKr1.2bn. AMSTERDAM slipped back, assisted by a loss in Ahold of Fl 1.80 to Fl 91.20, after reporting interim results which disappointed some investors. The CBS Tendency index fell 0.9 to 126.4. ATHENS was put under pressure by fears that the government might be forced into holding early elections. The general index, which was marked 5 per cent lower at one stage, erased some of the loss to close 25.81 or 3 per cent easier on the day at 820.90. WARSAW, which has also been testing record highs recently, was another of Europe's smaller markets to fall back, the WIG index shedding 420 or 5.6 per cent to 7,141.3. Turnover was a record 1,360bn zloty. TEL AVIV retreated on profit-taking after six consecutive sessions of gains. The Mishtanim index fell 7.54 to 221.50.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- September 7                                         THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes             Open      10.30     11.00     12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1287.08   1286.32   1286.96   1285.44 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1371.02   1371.43   1372.00   1370.67  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             13.00     14.00     15.00     Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       1282.31   1283.71   1279.94   1277.38 FT-SE Eurotrack 200       1366.93   1369.19   1366.61   1365.81  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Sep 6     Sep 3     Sep 2     Sep 1     Aug 31  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1284.01   1293.60   1302.75   1305.63   1319.96 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1371.90   1384.27   1385.48   1385.51   1396.45  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1287.50 ; 200 - 1373.59 Low/day: 100 - 1276.99 200 - 1364.55.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

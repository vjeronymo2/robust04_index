			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'THE ART WORLD IS RIPE FOR ME';  </P> <P> JEFF KOONS' HIGH-PROFILE MARKETING AND MEDIA MANIPULATION MAKES HIS TALENT SEEM  SECONDARY  </P> <P> Every so often an artist comes along who really seems to bug people and Jeff  Koons is this year's model. A former publicist for the Museum of Modern Art who  spent five years on Wall Street selling bonds and futures, the 34-year-old  Koons is so adept at deal-making and manipulating the media that his artworks  are so much icing on the cake of his career.  </P> <P> Whereas artists have traditionally been highly discreet about marketing  strategies, Koons brandishes his like a revolver, and though this bracing slap  in the face has collectors clamoring for the opportunity to fork over a few  hundred grand for the privilege of owning one of his pieces, (he interviews  potential buyers before allowing them the honor), many observers find the  artist to be symptomatic of all that is currently wrong with the art world.  </P> <P> "In the late '80s the art world is dominated more than ever by the almighty  buck and no artist is more informed by this climate than Koons," comments New  York Times art critic Michael Brenson. "At a time when artists have become  known for their entrepreneurial skills, he's brazen in his entrepreneurial  ambition and seems to want more money than any artist his age has ever made for  art."  </P> <P> Koons is getting more money too. A recent series of work unveiled last December  was executed in an edition of three so that the same exhibition could  simultaneously take place in New York, Chicago and Cologne, West Germany. If  all the shows sold out (and by now they surely have) Koons stands to take in  more than $5 million. Adding insult to injury, Koons promoted the show with a  series of glossy ads (shot by glamour photographer Greg Gorman) starring Jeff  Koons, made up like a male model and posed at the center of six different  scenarios, one of which depicted the artist perched on a throne, proclaiming  himself king of the art world.  </P> <P> Shameless grandstanding of this sort doesn't hit the art world too often so it  does tend to make people sit up and take notice. "This is a fabulous time to be  an artist, " crows Koons. "The art world is absolutely ripe for someone like  me."  </P> <P> With his career best described as a series of carefully executed advertising  campaigns, Koons has done a masterful job of fabricating an easily identifiable  persona for himself, however, his high profile doesn't necessarily mean he's  well-loved.  </P> <P> "Jeff knows the mechanisms of advertising and media extremely well and that  seems to disturb a lot of people," observes Ann Goldstein, a curator for MOCA  who selected Koons as one of 30 artists to be included in "Forest of Signs," an  eagerly anticipated show that opens in May. "His knowledge of those fields is  an integral part of his work, which explores the power of representation in the  mass media."  </P> <P> And what do Koons' explorations of the power of mass media look like? His  recent show included "Popples," a porcelain knock-off of a stuffed rabbit with  blue nose and yellow hair ($50,000); a life-sized polychromed wood replica of  Buster Keaton on a donkey ($100,000); and a gilded Rococo mirror in the shape  of Christ ($150,000). In short, the sort of stuff you'd expect to find in  Liberace's garage. Ostensibly an inquiry into the hidden life of objects and  how we relate to our possessions, Koons' oversized Hummel figures vibrate with  the garish, hysterical cheerfulness we associate with shopping malls and  amusement parks.  </P> <P> The Koonsian sales pitch that accompanies this bizarre melange of stuffed  animals, pop stars and lawn statuary goes something like this:  </P> <P> "My pieces are very bourgeois -- in fact, I want them to be the epitome of  bourgeois because that is the rallying call of the middle class," Koons said in  an interview at a Beverly Hills hotel. An impeccably mannered man whose  unctuous manner leaves a grease stain on every sentence he utters, Koons goes  on to explain that "right now I'm very interested in banality and see banality  as a savior. The bourgeoisie feels tremendous guilt about their moral position  in the world today, but I say to them, embrace your guilt, embrace your  banality and move forward. I want to remove the guilt we feel for responding to  banality."  </P> <P> Fed on mass media, Koons is big fan of the advertising industry and has  formulated the ideas about class struggle, desire and manipulation that inform  his work simply by being a child of his times. His hotel room is littered with  popular magazines like Spin, Rolling Stone and the Face, and he confesses that  when he watches television, he constantly flips through all 35 channels. Asked  what's currently inspiring him, he mentions rock group Guns N' Roses. "I like  their tattoos and the way they've marketed themselves," he explains. He admits  to having been influenced by the ideas of Marcel Duchamp and Andy Warhol,  however, his real hero is Michael Jackson. "The responsibility of the artist is  to seduce, manipulate and win his negotiations and Michael Jackson is a great  negotiator," he said, glowing with admiration.  </P> <P> Koons' unique blend of juvenile fantasy and messianic quest is what separates  him from the Appropriationist movement with which he was originally associated.  Though both Koons and Appropriationism are steeped in irony, Koons' unbridled  lust for attention and the coarse sexuality of his work signal a naivete one  isn't likely to find in work by Appropriationist artists Barbara Kruger or  Richard Prince.  </P> <P> "For me, Koons' work gives off an incredibly powerful feeling of adolescence in  its smutty sexuality and desire to shock," observes New Yorker art critic Adam  Gopnik. "His stuff is rebellious in a very adolescent way, and though everyone  talks about how shrewdly he's handled his career, he's actually done it very  crudely. He's not a very good advertising guy. The striking thing about the ads  he recently ran in the art magazines is that they don't look like ads -- they  look like a 12-year-old boy's idea of an ad; me, sexy girls and a lot of stuff.  That's not the way advertising people think. Real ads tend to be much more  elliptical and artful."  </P> <P> Koons lives in New York with his girlfriend of five years, Lizz Lambert, in a  full-service hotel near Wall Street. The telephone is his primary creative tool  and he doesn't have a studio because he neither draws nor paints. Rather, he  harvests the trends, beliefs and desires that he detects floating through the  collective consciousness and selects objects that embody those things. He then  takes these objects to fabricators in Northern Italy who reproduce them, thus  converting them into exorbitantly expensive avant-garde art.  </P> <P> Expanding on the Duchampian tradition of the ready-made, Koons previous series  involved vacuum cleaners encased in plexiglass, basketballs suspended in tanks  of water, sports equipment cast in bronze and kitsch bar accessories fabricated  in stainless steel. Each of these suites of objects came accompanied by a set  of related posters and a new bit of sloganeering (luxury, entropy, degradation  and equilibrium are Koons' favored buzzwords). Keeping a low profile in  Manhattan throughout the early '80s, Koons emerged as a more or less mature  artist in 1985 when he had his first one-man show at the now defunct  International With Monument Gallery in New York.  </P> <P> "When I saw Jeff's first show it was an epiphanous experience," recalls L.A.  dealer Dan Weinberg, an early supporter of Koons' work. "Here was a guy making  sculpture that I had not seen before and my response was immediate and very  strong. His work is brilliantly inventive and, treading that fine line between  kitsch and fine art as it does, really changes the way we look at sculpture.  Whether or not you like his posturing, Jeff has to be taken seriously and if I  were making bets on artists today I'd certainly say he's going to be around for  a while."  </P> <P> Born in York, Pa., Koons has been confident of his talent from the time he was  a small child.  </P> <P> "From the time I was 4, I felt like an artist," he recalls with a warm chuckle.  "I have a photo of myself when I was 5 sitting with my crayons just displaying  this integrity of being an artist.  </P> <P> "I grew up in a family that moved through the middle-class mobility structure  very rapidly," he continues. "My father was an interior decorator who also sold  furniture and he had a store in York. We lived in a small home until I was 5,  then we moved to an extremely large house -- the largest home in the area in  fact. My parents always lived a little beyond their means, but money was never  a source of worry in the house, and they joined the local country club and we  had horses and kennels. My grandfather was a politician who had a large farm  and he collected carriages -- kind of elitist, royal, monarchical type  carriages, and we'd ride in them in the local parades. I felt like a little  prince when I was growing up and I still feel that way today."  </P> <P> While describing himself as a little prince, Koons insists that his work is,  nonetheless, selflessly egalitarian and wholly committed to social change.  </P> <P> "The freedoms that are fought for by art are never fought in the streets," he  says, feverishly smoking a Marlboro. "My work is absolutely Populist. It  functions on a wide basis which means it affects all of society, satisfying the  needs of everyone and encouraging a leveling of class differentiation."  </P> <P> "If Jeff Koons' work is about class struggle, I am Maria of Romania," counters  Time magazine art critic Robert Hughes with a hearty laugh. "Only a fool could  believe his work has anything to do with class struggle -- he probably knows as  much about the subject as Clem Greenberg knows about the history of fly tying  in Scotland in the 1890s. Koons' work has no real aesthetic dimension and is  essentially about jargon and hype. It's making an impact because he's extremely  good at promoting himself, and the art world is grievously ill at the moment."  </P> <P> That might be the one thing Koons and Hughes agree about. Art's  ever-diminishing power to effect social change is one of Koons' pet peeves.  </P> <P> "It used to be that if you weren't good enough to make it in the art world,  you'd go into advertising, but now it's the other way around," Koons said,  launching into one of his favorite raps. "Advertising is much more politically  effective than art at this point. As to why I haven't gone into advertising, I  try to incorporate the tools used in advertising and the entertainment industry  in my work. Artists must incorporate these things, otherwise we'll become a  completely impotent profession. And right now, art is impotent and totally  non-threatening, and that's why it's commanding the prices we've been seeing  lately. Its political statement is almost blank, so corporations can buy it  without worrying that it will alter anything at all. Artists used to be the  ones who knew how to manipulate, control and meet the needs of the masses, but  we've lost our power. And I want to bring the power back."  </P> <P> Exactly how a polychrome wood statue of Michael Jackson cuddling his pet  chimpanzee (a Koons' work titled "Michael Jackson and Bubbles") is going to  revitalize the avant-garde remains to be seen. Koons, however, explains his  game plan thus;  </P> <P> "A lot of people have prenotions (sic) about what is good and what is bad, and  my work operates in that area between good and bad. Consequently, it challenges  their notions about things and hopefully will help them rethink the situation.  </P> <P> "Beyond that, the statuary pieces are fake luxury and they make people feel  economically secure when they look at them. The church has always insisted that  artworks are for the glory of God, but they also fill the function of making  people feel secure, and my objects function in a similar way. We work and  sacrifice so that we can accumulate luxury objects which work as support  systems for the individual. Our treasured objects fulfill our desires and  express them."  </P> <P> So, what sort of security-inducing objects might one find in Koons' home?  </P> <P> "I live very simply and don't keep objects in my home," he sniffs disdainfully.  "The dialogue of consumerism is not something I'm deeply involved with. I've  been through it and have already digested it."  </P> <P> Not a particularly Populist point of view, but then Koons is nothing if not a  mass of contradictions. He is, however, at all times an astute businessman, and  the theoretical fissures that run like a fault line through his work don't seem  to faze the collectors who are currently converting the art world into a  speculators' paradise.  </P> <P> "Koons has been quite open about his abilities as a businessman and of course,  that doesn't bother dealers or collectors at all," observes New Criterion  editor Hilton Kramer. "They love dealing with artists who are businessmen  because they talk the same language. Koons' work is about making money and I  find it totally cynical. He's making an impact because, at the moment, there's  a very low standard of taste in the art world. This presents a tremendous  opportunity for people whose only way of making an impact is to lower the  standard even further. As for his career longevity, I think he'll prosper until  the next dip in the stock market."  </P> <P> The New Yorker's Gopnik disagrees: "Koons may be a very unpleasant talent, but  he's an interesting one and there's a gleam of true fanaticism about his work.  He does what he does at full throttle, he's invented a language of his own and  he's able to compose sentences in it. I don't agree with Koons as far as I can  understand what his work is claiming, but if you take 20th Century art  seriously, one of the things it teaches you is that you have to pay great  attention to the disagreeable, the bizarre and offensive as a source of some  kind of perverted wisdom. I think this is work in that tradition. That's not to  say Koons is Michelangelo, but I don't think he's a charlatan either."  </P> <P> Koons work may indeed have unplumbed depths, but it will be hard to tell until  Koons begins to allow the work to speak for itself; at this point, his art is  being upstaged by the sideshow of his career. Koons himself admits with  uncharacteristic modesty that he doesn't have all the bugs out yet.  </P> <P> "I haven't reached greatness yet but I'm getting close," he said. "I'm a very  good artist -- in fact, I'm the best hope for American art and have absolutely  assumed the leadership of the art world. I've been given the opportunity by our  culture to do something great and I want that opportunity -- I more than want  it, I demand it. Like the people in advertising and entertainment, I'm willing  to assume the responsibility of simultaneously meeting the needs and creating  the needs. I desire leadership and I'm trying to help set a direction for  people."  </P> <P> What a sales pitch! In parting, one has to ask; how do you feel about the fact  that you're often criticized for your slick sales skills?  </P> <P> "I feel very good about my sales skills because everything is based on sales,"  he concludes with pride. "Sales is the front line and no matter what your  problem or desire, there's a sales pitch designed for it. And if, in fact, your  product is nothing more than pure salesmanship -- that is a fabulous product!"  </P></p>

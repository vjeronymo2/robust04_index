			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Arts: The great fame drain - British cinema talent is being colonised by a predatory Hollywood. But, argues Nigel Andrews, we should simply lie back and enjoy it Colin Welland, waving that famous statuette, said 'the British are coming'. But the Chariots Of Fire Oscar triumph was 15 years ago. More recently, the British have indeed been coming, all over the movie landscape, but not quite in the way envisaged by Welland. A select committee of British MPs on a fact-finding visit last week to Hollywood were reported to have been told by Steven Spielberg: 'There is no British film industry.' Half a generation after our cinema thought it would conquer the world by sitting tight and making home-bred history epics, we have replaced a dominion movie culture with a diaspora movie culture. Many British films, directors and actors now find themselves in the position of being lucrative exports without any early life in a British factory or warehouse. Look at yesterday's key players. Richard Attenborough has returned to his acting roots to make Jurassic Park and the forthcoming Christmas film Miracle On 34th Street, after falling gently down the ladder of directorial bankability from Cry Freedom to Shadowlands. And the Chariots writer-producer duo of Colin Welland and David Puttnam have released a humble childrens' comedy, The War Of The Buttons, with about as much Oscar potential as an episode of Jackanory. Meanwhile two of British cinema's one-time traitors and fugitives have returned to become its all-hailed messiahs. The gone-Hollywood brothers Ridley and Tony Scott (Alien, Blade Runner, Top Gun, True Romance) have bought Shepperton Studios, with the aim of turning it into an England-based blast kiln for international cinema. With luck this move - and its symbolic imprimatur for anti-nationalist adventurism - will see the end of siege mentality cinema forever in this country. By free movement in and out of other nations and cultures, British cinema is creating a virtual new renaissance. In many cases individual British movies and actors find that by going to America first - followed by the rest of the world - they can make an international impact almost before home audiences have heard of them. Four Weddings And A Funeral, which opened in the US several weeks before its UK release, has just become the most commercially successful British film of all time. Why the jackpot? Because the film jumped straight into a foreign market, rightly suspecting that selling itself to an outsiders' view of Britain was better than selling itself direct to Britain herself. If Weddings had opened first at home we might have dismissed it - knowing our country too well - as a frothy piece of anyone-for-tennis comedy romance. America and other countries, allowed a first glimpse, decided to see it as quintessential Britain: as a mini-genre - the silly ass comedy - gone mythic. What director Mike Newell had done, much as Ridley and Tony Scott and other Anglos had done to Hollywood's own action thrillers or sci-fi films, was to raise the style stakes so that a little timeless archetypalism (even a little post-modern preposterousness) upstaged or transcended the realism. It is not just British films and directors, it is British actors that America - and a world movie public following America - are now picking off the remaindered shelves of British indifference. For years Hugh Grant, formerly of Maurice (1987) and A Handful Of Dust (1988), ranked nowhere as a movie presence. His comic potential was ignored by most fellow Brits even in Bitter Moon, a highly promising trial run for Four Weddings. In America, after Weddings opened, Grant's face launched a thousand popularity polls and graced a dozen magazine covers. Once again foreign eyes and ears had sensed a distilled and perfect 'Britishness' that we were deaf and blind to. It is part of a swelling tide of Anglophilia to which British cinema would be foolish to play Canute, or to complain that we are 'selling out' to other people's caricaturing vision of us. Grant is rare only in being a nice chap in a British casting directory - nay, an entire export industry - largely dominated by nasty chaps. Hollywood comes to us for its villains. These have included Alan Rickman (Die Hard, Robin Hood), Anthony Hopkins (Silence Of The Lambs), Jeremy Irons (Reversal Of Fortune, The Lion King), Charles Dance (Last Action Hero) and Stuart Wilson (No Escape), to name but the vanguard. (Actresses, nice or nasty, export more slowly. But Emma Thompson is currently up there above-the-title with Arnie, Danny De Vito and company.). Why are the foreigners going for this new improved Brit pack? Partly because our actors, theatre-honed, offer a performance panache increasingly unavailable among American stars, who are either riddled with late-generation Method tics (Hoffman, De Niro, Pacino) or branded with I for Iconic Inanition (Schwarzenegger, Stallone). But it may also be because Britain today is a uniquely placed buffer culture. These pedigree toffs of ours, moving between suave villainy and lovable silliness, belong to a country itself poised, in the dangerous days of Gatt, between the moustache-twirlers of Europe and the honest folk back in America. In an age when the US is terrified of being left behind in the Great Classiness Handicap, with Europe's countries banding together to cock a high-culture snook at the new world, a love-hate romance is growing in Hollywood with the one common-language country that US movies can recruit to represent the old world's values for the new. Euro-awareness may also be why Scorsese in The Age Of Innocence and Coppola in Dracula and Spielberg in Schindler's List are increasingly turning to Euro-tinged subjects. So while Hollywood seizes on British actors as special messengers of erudition, elocution or patrician charm, audiences have flocked to Four Weddings And A Funeral, believing there is a lost world out there, somewhere near Europe, where fluffy, lovable, rambling human stories can happen: stories that have no resemblance to America's own fast-food cinema of car chases, cop action and ravening dinosaurs. A decade and a half after we took 'Britishness' so seriously, after winning that bunch of Oscars, that we thought the future lay in exporting UK pageantry for ever and ever, we discover that the future for British cinema  -its popular cinema at least - does not really lie with us at all. It lies with those who better judge our charms and international selling-points and have better equipment for marketing it. Our turn to be colonised and exploited? If so, we should lie back and enjoy it.</p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / International Company News: Profits fall moderated by hidden reserves NET GROUP earnings at Daimler-Benz fell by 25 per cent last year and by more than 40 per cent at the German parent company. Although the slump had been well signalled, the vehicles, aerospace and engineering group's shares lost DM9 on the Frankfurt stock exchange after the formal announcement yesterday, closing at DM610.50. Consolidated group profits of DM1.45bn (Dollars 907m), compared with DM1.94bn in 1991, were in line with warnings from the company of a result around DM1.5bn, following an unexpected slump in the third quarter of the year. The proposed dividend was confirmed at an unchanged DM13. Income at Daimler-Benz AG, the holding parent, was artificially inflated to DM5.19bn by extraordinary 'earnings' of DM4.49bn. These were previously hidden reserves stemming from the adjusted valuation of group pension provisions and inventories. They have now been revealed as part of a recent disclosure agreement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which allows Daimler shares to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Excluding this figure, profits were just DM703m, compared with DM1.194bn. The group has proposed that the once-hidden reserves be used to strengthen its debt-to-equity ratio and paid into its paid-up equity. The SEC had demanded more transparency and disclosure as part of the compromise deal which will make Daimler the first German company to gain NYSE listing. The deal, after negotiations lasting around four years, is expected to encourage other German companies which had previously been discouraged by disclosure requirements. Although Daimler had made concessions to the SEC, it was not a question of 'unconditional surrender', according to Mr Gerhard Liener, group finance director. Explaining the commission's acceptance of the deal, he said it was the SEC's job not to stand in the way but to help new business. Mr Liener stressed the advantages of a listing in an investment market worth around Dollars 50bn a year compared with Germany, which he expected to be burdened in future by privatisation plans.</p>

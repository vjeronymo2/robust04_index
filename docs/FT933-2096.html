			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Liberal Democrats at Torquay: Party to temper its enthusiasm for Europe LIBERAL DEMOCRATS are to tone down their fervent pro-Europeanism in an attempt to maximise their party's appeal to disgruntled Conservatives in next summer's elections for the European parliament. Mr Paddy Ashdown hopes to treat the elections principally as a referendum on Mr John Major's government, changing the focus from specifically European policies. In a calculated shift in the party's approach to Europe, its strategists signalled yesterday that the Liberal Democrat manifesto would address the concerns of an electorate which had become increasingly sceptical about European integration. Charging that the Conservatives were seeking to 'misrepresent' the party's views, they said that the word 'federalist' would not appear in the final manifesto. Lord Holme of Cheltenham signalled the change of tone by stressing that the party would not allow itself to be painted as an 'uncritical admirer of everything that is done in Europe'. Lord Holme, a key figure on the Liberal Democrats' policymaking group, was echoed by Mr Roger Liddle, the co-ordinator for the European manifesto. In an address to candidates for the Strasbourg parliament Mr Liddle said that it was 'ludicrous' to suggest that the party favoured a 'United States of Europe', warning that it needed to distance itself from 'grandiose federalist rhetoric' which might lay candidates open to that charge. Instead, the party needed to reflect the reality that Europe was in a phase of consolidation. It should also avoid talk which implied that a 'single currency is our only firm idea on economic policy'. The injection of a Euro-sceptic tinge into the traditionally unalloyed enthusiasm for Europe reflects the judgment that the party's best hopes of success in the European elections is to defeat Tories in the south-west.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] While waiting for the decision by the UN  Security Council that is to be made this evening, France is  still determined to intervene in Rwanda. [passage omitted]    The subject was naturally raised this afternoon at the  Assembly during a session of questions to the government on  current issues. The prime minister insisted on coming in person  to explain France's position. Edouard Balladur said:    [Begin Balladur recording] This is an operation where force  can be used, but with a solely humanitarian aim. This force--I  repeat clearly--is not a buffer force, but a force to protect  civilians. We will act together with the forces joining with us  in such a way that we can contribute from the borders to the  security of the people under threat and can enable them to  receive help from aid organizations.    Under no circumstances will our forces intervene deep inside  Rwandan territory, and the operation will be of limited  duration. It will end at the end of July. Humanitarian  intervention by France in Rwanda is a difficult operation. No  one is pretending otherwise--the government least of all.    This decision is a serious one. Everything will be done to  ensure that French soldiers will not be put in situations where  they do not have the means to ensure their own safety. [end  recording]    So France has really and truly decided to intervene in  Rwanda. Defense Minister Francois Leotard even announced this  evening-- without waiting for the decision of the UN Security  Council--that the operation is to start tomorrow. And, Luc  Lemonnier, preparations have been continuing throughout the day:    [Correspondent Lemonnier] Yes, Defense Minister Francois  Leotard confirmed a few moments ago that the operation would  start tomorrow, implying by the same token that the vote of the  UN Security Council was a foregone conclusion. This is  certainly not jumping the gun, since it is true that it is hard  to see how-- despite the reticence of the OAU--the Council could  refuse to support Paris' humanitarian commitment, and even less  that one of the five permanent members would use its veto.    So we already know that Operation Turquoise--that is its  code  name--will mobilize 2,500 men: 1,000 from France and 1,500 from  contingents already stationed in Gabon and Djibouti. It is  known that experts have been studying routes between Zaire and  Rwanda for more than 24 hours, especially landing possibilities.    Two Russian cargo planes arrived in Bangui today, in the  Central African Republic, with French military equipment, and  sand-colored military vehicles were seen on the runway of the  airport, as well as a refueling plane.    Finally, the French defense ministere was keen this  afternoon  to deny reports claiming that French troops entrusted with  preparing the mission had already arrived in Rwanda. For the  moment, everything is happening on the borders while the UN  Security Council vote is awaited.</p>

Ordzhonikidze,  Moscow]    [Abstract] Algorithms for determining (recognizing) types  of service objects have been shown to contain three levels. At  the first level of recognition (i.e., selecting or sorting  images), a set of lines of sight corresponding to one service  object is isolated at each moment of observation. In view of the  inexactness of information about the positions of the  information spacecrafts' own positions, the presence of random  errors in on-board measurements, and the density of service  objects in space, the problem of isolating this set of lines of  sight is not trivial. At the second level of recognition, a  correspondence must be established between the spatial positions  of the service objects determined in the first stage of  observation at each moment in the observation process and the  trajectories of the service objects plotted on the basis of  results of previous observations and representing a set of  spatial positions of the service object in the previous moments  of the observation process. Thus, at the second level of  recognition, a spatiotemporal picture of the motion of a set of  service objects is formed that encompasses a time interval  culminating at the moment of the last observation. The third  level of recognition entails determining the type of service  object represented by a set of observed points along its  trajectory in accordance with the respective probability  criteria. In other words, the third level of recognition  requires determining whether an object (trajectory) belongs to a  given class. The characteristic features of the algorithms  required for performing each of these three levels of the object  recognition process are discussed. The next stages in the  process of predicting the motion of service objects involves  estimating the vector of the initial conditions of their motion  and then predicting their future position under conditions of  random disturbances based on angular optical stereo  observations. The algorithms required for making such  predictions are based on the use of proximity functions and the  least squares method and are constructed in accordance with  mathematical models and singular criteria. The problem of  determining the error in predicting a service object's movement  is solved by using information about typical profiles of service  objects' trajectories and by hypothesizing that a service  object's movement after the last observation made proceeds along  that typical trajectory that best conforms to all existing  observations of the given service object's movement. The problem  of predicting the service object's future movement is thus  reduced to modeling its reference motion by using input data to  solve the least squares problem presented. The operability of  the proposed algorithms is demonstrated through statistical  modeling of the process of the information interaction of groups  of service objects and information spacecraft. After analyzing  the example presented, the authors concluded that by decomposing  the problem under consideration and using very simple geometric  relationships and determinate threshold algorithms, it is indeed  possible to recognize types of service objects with a frequency  of at least 0.7 based on data from angular optical measurements  or 0.99 when integral radiation density is used. Furthermore,  the proposed algorithms permit recognition of service objects  with acceptable reliability and speed by using general-purpose  computers. The algorithms presented are recommended as a  methodological foundation for creating an information service  subsystem for use in detection systems and in the event of  accidental, unauthorized, provocative, and terrorist launches of  objects with space-based components.

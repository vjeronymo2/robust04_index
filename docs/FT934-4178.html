			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: An identical taste for cakes Around Christmas there is a change in our eating habits. The beginning of each lunch is a little more leisurely and there is a tendency to linger over dessert. But in the pastry sections of hotel and restaurant kitchens there is organised chaos around mid-afternoon as mince pies are served and Christmas puddings warmed. However, for Michel Bourdin, chef de cuisine at The Connaught, there is no such panic. His seven-strong pastry section is in the calm and capable hands of Carolyn and Deborah Power, joint chef patissiers and identical twins. They have been cooking together since they were nine when their father sold his business and took the family on a boat for year. There was a brief period when art school beckoned but the twins opted for catering college in Southampton, Hampshire, and, keen to open their own restaurant, followed that up with a management course. In 1978, aged 21, they opened The Hour Glass at Fordingbridge, in the New Forest, which they ran successfully for ten years. Their ambition as restaurateurs realised, they sold the restaurant and moved on to patisserie, working in a family-run chocolate factory in Switzerland and in a patisserie near Lyon, in southern France. With their skills honed it was time to move back to London. They felt drawn to The Connaught but, having spent Christmas 1989 on trial icing Christmas cakes for Michel Bourdin, they were told there was no room for both of them. They did not want to work apart so in early 1990 they went around the kitchens of London's other top hotels, returning to The Connaught for a second interview. To their relief, positions were found for them both. Since, they have studied hard. For two years they spent days off on an advanced patisserie course taught by John Huber, England's 'professor' of patisserie. They followed that with a course on petits gateaux at Lenotre in Paris and a visit to Jean Thuries, an expert with spun sugar, in Cordes, south west France. Talent, application and hard work led to their appointment as joint chef patissiers at The Connaught in April. Ironically, that new position meant that the Power sisters have been forced to work apart for the first time in their lives. In an hotel open seven days a week, in which they are responsible for their section's total production - croissants, Danish pastries, scones, desserts, petits fours, the lunchtime buffet, ice-creams and sorbets - they often have to work different shifts. In June, Carolyn went to Canada to represent Great Britain as pastry chef in an international culinary contest. She returned with a string of gold medals. Deborah retaliated by going to South Africa on the fund-raising World Cooks Tour for Hunger. In the short term their concentration is fixed on Christmas. Producing 1,500 mince tarts, Christmas cakes and puddings, Yule logs, chocolate Santas on chocolate sleighs and the chocolate centrepiece for the hotel's reception will keep them busy. After that it is on to truffles and chocolate for New Year's Eve. They are both convinced that the future lies in setting up their own business again, perhaps owning their own tea room and patisserie and reviving old English recipes for cakes, tarts and sweets.</p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: Loss reductions at mine help Anglovaal advance A REDUCTION in losses at the Loraine mine and an improved performance from flagship Hartebeestfontein helped the Anglovaal group record increased profits from its gold mines in the three months to the end of March. Loraine, which has recorded losses for nearly three years, reduced its net losses to R2m (Dollars 600,000m) from R2.9m in the December quarter. The mine has received permission to operate on Sundays, and the management says this should boost the June quarter result. Hartebeestfontein lifted after-tax profits to R36.4m from R32m in December. This improvement was the result of lower costs and increased production at the low-grade gold plant, as well as from the main underground operations. Here an increased milling rate and better grade boosted gold recoveries to 6,906kg from 6,525 the previous quarter.</p>

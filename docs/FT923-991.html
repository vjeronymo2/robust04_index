			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Rolls-Royce sheds 950 more car jobs ROLLS-ROYCE Motor Cars is cutting a further 950 jobs, or nearly a third of the workforce, at its plant at Crewe, Cheshire. The heavily loss-making luxury car subsidiary of Vickers, the UK engineering group, said sales of its Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars had fallen by 65 per cent in the past 18 months. The company said the drop in sales, under the impact of the 'unprecedented length and depth of economic recession', had taken place in all its main markets. The latest round of redundancies should be completed during December, and will have cut the workforce of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars UK to 2,100 from 4,850 at the end of 1990. The company said compulsory redundancies appeared inevitable. Sir Colin Chandler, Vickers chief executive, said yesterday that the latest cuts would cost about Pounds 12m in exceptional charges during the second half of the year. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars would make a 'substantial trading loss' this year, Sir Colin said. The trading loss in the first half of the year was Pounds 10m to Pounds 15m against just below break-even in the first half of last year. In the whole of last year it made a trading loss of about Pounds 30m as well as suffering exceptional losses of about Pounds 32m for the re-structuring and last year's job cuts. The remaining Rolls-Royce Motor Cars workforce worldwide of about 2,400 has been cut from 5,300 18 months ago, said Sir Colin. The latest jobs reduction was 'required for the future of the business' and was 'designed to reduce operating costs during a time of continuing uncertainty and difficult trading in all major markets'. Sir Colin claimed that the break-even level of the beleaguered Rolls-Royce and Bentley car business will have been cut to about 1,400 cars a year by the end of the year from 2,800 in 1990. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars sales have plunged from a peak of 3,300 in 1990 to 1,723 last year, and Sir Colin forecast sales for the whole of this year at just 1,250 and 1,350. Retail sales worldwide dropped in the first six months of this year to 681 from 890 in the first half of last year. The company's market in Japan in particular has collapsed this year.

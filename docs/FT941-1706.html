			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Mercury raises fears on BT 'superhighway' Mercury, the main competitor to British Telecommunications, yesterday opposed construction of a national fibre-optic 'superhighway'. However, it supported lifting the ban on BT providing entertainment services in return for a more favourable regulatory regime. Lord Young, chairman of Cable &amp; Wireless, Mercury's parent company, told the Commons trade and industry committee that he favoured the development of competing local networks to deliver services rather than a BT fibre-optic monopoly at local level. In the most detailed explanation yet of Mercury's plans to deploy wireless technology to by-pass BT at the local level, Lord Young said Mercury expected to have between 3m and 5m customers accessing its long-distance network through radio links 'in a few years'. The radio networks would be able to carry broadcast channels in addition to telephony. Lord Young told the committee, which is examining the case for a national fibre-optic grid, that a grid 'would not bring any additional benefits for business and residential customers'. Instead there should be 'a range of competing technologies and competing operators'. He added: 'Britain has advanced too far down the competitive road to revert to a utility-style single national grid.' Lord Young renewed Mer-cury's call for a regulatory regime more favourable to it, claiming the company would support a lifting of the ban on BT carrying entertainment over its network before 1998 'provided we have economic access to the BT network'. Mercury is locked in a legal dispute with Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, about terms for inter-connection to the BT network, which it believes are unduly restrictive. The Cable Television Association also opposed a national fibre grid. It represents the - mostly US - cable companies building combined cable TV and telephone networks in urban areas.</p>

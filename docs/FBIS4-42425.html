			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Military Probably Will Be Sent to </F> Rwanda"]    [Text] If the security situation in Rwanda improves, the  Netherlands Government is after all prepared to contribute a  unit of 20 military police to UN missions in the country.    A previous UN request was refused by the government, because  the Netherlands had already provided enough soldiers for UN  peacekeeping operations. The situation in Rwanda is also too  dangerous, as Netherlands soldiers are likely to be mistaken for  Belgians. Belgian soldiers have already been killed in Rwanda.  The Second Chamber found the latter argument unconvincing.</p>

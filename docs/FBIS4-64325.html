			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Boris Johnson article: "Should We Stay, Should We Go?"] </F>   [Text] At last, the taboo is over. The gloves are off.  The wonder of it is that the question was not asked earlier.  Let us cut ourselves off, voices are saying within the  Government, and have done with it. The European Community was  founded in 1957, at the height of the Cold War. Its core  policy, agricultural subsidy, was devised at a time when hunger  was not unknown in Europe. The Cold War is over. Free trade is  now enshrined in the GATT treaty. Agricultural surpluses tower  to heaven. Why not get out?    There should be no embarrassment now in questioning the  point  of the whole European construction. Indeed, British Euro  sceptics might have attracted wider sympathy during the  Maastricht debate if they had drawn the logical conclusion of  their own arguments.    The Foreign Office was yesterday active with the sand  bucket,  fighting the spread of speculation. "Complete rubbish," it said.  But it was clear last night that the extraordinary words imputed  to John Major -- "I'll pull out of Europe" -- emanate from a  clique which has the support of some senior members of the  Government and a widening section of the parliamentary party.    They are casting their eyes ahead to the 1996 negotiations,  which could begin as early as this autumn; and their objective  is to bounce Mr Major into an extreme position. They wish him  to fight federalism with a threat: that any further incursions  upon national sovereignty would cause Britain to uproot the tent  pegs in Brussels and depart.    As a serious proposition, from serious members of the  establishment, it has no precedent since the referendum of 1975.    After so many humiliations, the mood in Westminster is  lightheaded, nihilistic. Exasperated by detail, befuddled by  its defeats, parts of the Government, or at least the Tory  party, are prepared to debate the question of Europe from first  principles.    They are right to do so. The mere threat of withdrawal would  change the way the Government is viewed, both abroad and at  home. Too often, other countries have been able to drive Britain  into a corner because they know, or have hitherto assumed, that  Britain would never be so anarchic, so mad, as to deploy the  doomsday weapon. The threat could serve the Government well,  moreover, in the Euro election campaigns. Both Labour and  Liberal Democrats have left themselves badly exposed on the Euro  sceptical flank.    But if such a threat is to carry weight for long, there must  be a serious intention behind it. Could it ever be in Britain's  interests to depart? I know of only one reason for staying in  the Common Market. It is, however, quite a good one: If Britain  extricated herself from the pact she joined in 1973, the balance  of probability is that the remaining 11 would not disintegrate.    The Eurocrats would reel. The recriminations would be  shrill. But the organisation would not explode. The EC  Commission would continue to promulgate screeds of legislation.  These would cease to be directly applicable to Britain. But  the writ of Brussels would run through an ever wider dominion,  as first the Scandinavians and then the East Europeans joined.  With more than half our exports going to the Community, British  firms would have no choice but to conform with the standards,  weights, sizes, dimensions determined by the continentals. The  only difference would be that, out side, Britain would have no  way of influencing those standards to its advantage. Excluded  from the corridors of power, Britain would be unable to  safeguard her interests.    That is a good reason for staying in the EC. But as the  debate gathers way, as it seems likely to do, we will hear  plenty of bad reasons, not least from the Government. Some will  say we are now so intimately bound in that we could not  physically excise ourselves, that the union was now beyond  surgery.    In reality, withdrawal presents few practical difficulties.  Parliament would simply have to abrogate the Treaty of Rome, as  amended by the Single European Act and Maastricht. British MEPs  [Members of the European Parliament] would easily find  employment as "consultants" in Strasbourg or Brussels and  British ministers would no longer have to fly in for  interminable meetings in the Charlemagne building. Britain  would not even need to disengage its diplomatic representation  to Brussels, the 40 or so diplomats. Most of them would stay,  though as observers rather than negotiators.    Euro-enthusiasts of an old fashioned cast of mind, such as  Sir Edward Heath, might lament the offence caused to our  "partners" in Europe. On the other hand they perhaps exaggerate  the need to be polite to foreigners. They are not especially  polite to us.    Some, especially the Labour party, will feel we have to stay  on the inside if we wish to share in the defences of a giant  trading bloc, able to project its will in the face of Japan and  America, and the challenge of cut price labour from the Third  World. In fact, the opposite is true. If there is a commercial  reason for Britain staying in, it is to prevent such a fortress  Europe from being created.    Britain's farmers and John Gummer, former Agriculture  minister, are likely to say that departure would damage our  agricultural interests; and it is true that we have become  junkies of the Common Agricultural Policy as much as any other  EC country. Pump-primed by Brussels subsidies, British exports  of agricultural products rose by 7 percent per year during the  early 1980's. But the cost has been absurdly high, in food  prices and in the tax burden.    Local councils might protest that they would be cut off from  all those Brussels hand-outs from the regional and social funds.  It is true that the 12-star emblem would vanish from the signs  on inner-city developments and bypasses in Scotland. But we  could fund our own roads, schools and hospitals ourselves and  plough back, moreover, the billions that we contribute to the EC  budget.    The worst reason of all for remaining inside is the  widespread assumption that Brussels, "Europe," would save us  from ourselves. It is a common middle-class sentiment that  Government, or Mr Major, is so lacking in direction that some  kind of Euro-government could scarcely be worse. On the  contrary, one could argue that is the EC's very tentacles which  undermine confidence in British institutions.    My own hunch is that pulling out of Europe might, at least  in  the first few years, cause an immense feeling of national  renewal. It would be intoxicating to cast off the incubus of  Brussels. It would end the wearisome arguments about  sovereignty, the confusion about who governs Britain. It would  be like winning the World Cup, or the wave of national unity at  the beginning of the Second World War.    But I think it would not last, for the one big reason I have  mentioned. British businessmen would face discrimination.  Investors in Britain would be deterred. As long as the Community  exists, we are better off making trouble from the inside. In  any case, the question is unlikely to present itself in those  terms.    In 1996, the issue will not be in or out. With so many new  countries presenting themselves for membership, it will be the  end of the old all-or-nothing EC compact. For the first time,  Britain will be able to choose from a menu of options. Some may  want tighter integration. Others may be able to content  themselves with little more than free trade. It is at that  point that battle will be joined in earnest between Europhiles  and Eurosceptics.</p>

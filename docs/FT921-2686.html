			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Israel may target world Jewry for loan funds ISRAELI ministers, apparently resigned to failing to secure Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.6bn) in loan guarantees from the US, said yesterday they would try to raise funds elsewhere, mainly from world Jewry, to finance the absorption of immigrants from the former Soviet Union. The government reacted bitterly to reports that the US administration had turned down a Congressional compromise that would have advanced some guarantees while talks continued on Washington's demand that Israel freeze Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. President George Bush last night told the two Congressmen behind the compromise that their proposal did not give enough assurances that Israel would not use the money to build settlements in occupied Arab lands. 'The president told them he would veto their bill on loan guarantees for Israel,' said Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman. He said Mr Bush countered with a compromise proposal of his own that would give the president more control over payment of the guarantees to Israel. 'We still want to negotiate it with Congress,' he said. The dispute has caused a deep rift between Israel and Washington. The gulf widened over the past week as the US alleged Israel had illegally sold US weapons technology to China, South Africa and other countries in Asia, Africa and South America. Mr Moshe Arens, the defence minister who is visiting Washington, said the US was imposing 'impossible terms' on the loan guarantees. Israel had made the guarantees a central part of its economic strategy for absorbing 1m immigrants over the next five years. 'We will not crawl or beg for help,' he told an audience of US Jews. Israel would turn to world Jewry to bridge the gap. Mr Yitzhak Moda'i, the finance minister, is understood to have visited Geneva last week to canvass support from European Jewry as a step towards substituting the US guarantees. Mr Moda'i suggested there was merit in the US decision if it forced Israel to end its dependence on US aid of about Dollars 3bn a year. Finance Ministry officials said the lack of US guarantees would not have a serious effect on the economy this year. A slowdown in immigration has eased budgetary pressures and Israel's foreign reserves stand at more than Dollars 6bn. But the damage lies in the difficulty Israel can expect to encounter in raising loans on world markets, after what will be seen as a US vote of no-confidence. Israel will also have to pay a higher price for the loans. The country has scheduled more than Dollars 20bn in foreign borrowing over the next few years to cope with immigration, a sum most officials say the already heavily tapped Jewish diaspora cannot meet. Meanwhile, a US team is to visit Israel to investigate the allegations that Israel has re-exported weapons based on US technology contrary to strict technology transfer agreements. The government, which has denied the allegations, said it was happy to co-operate. Israeli experts say systems with similar characteristics to US products, such as the Python air-to-air missile and the Mapatz anti-tank missile, have been sold to China and South Africa and other countries. Although Israeli-made, their development often draws heavily on expertise gained from foreign-supplied weapons. The issue is likely to turn on the difficult question of what counts as a straight - and thereby illegal  - copy of US technology and what qualifies as a genuine new development.</p>

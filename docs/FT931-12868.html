			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / People: Millman - md at Merrydown Paul Millman has been appointed managing director of Merrydown, the cider, fruit drinks and natural foods group, following a decision to split the roles of chairman and managing director. Richard Purdey, who continues as chairman, says that the move will better serve the development of the group, now enlarged by the acquisition of Shloer and PLJ from SmithKline Beecham. Millman, 46, joined the group as sales and marketing director in 1990 from Guinness where he had been sales manager for Harp lager. He will continue to oversee the sales and marketing department until a new sales director is appointed. Purdey, 50, will concentrate on the group's overall strategy.</p>

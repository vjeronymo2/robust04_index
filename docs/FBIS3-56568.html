Greetings Eduard; a Georgian official state  delegation last week visited Turkey. What do you think are the  most important results of this visit? And another question;  Turkey was brought out of the political and economic crisis by  the so-called Turkish wonder, as well as the will of the whole  nation. To what extent is Georgia ready to share this  experience? Because the instability in Georgia today was  earlier no less alien for Turkey.    [Shevardnadze] Good morning. I spoke widely about the  results at the meeting of the Tbilisi branch of the Citizens'  Union of Georgia, and therefore, I will not dwell on them. The  results, both political and economic, are quite impressive.  Many contracts and agreements are to be signed. We have signed  many agreements. Batoni Chikvaidze, who stayed on in Turkey and  phoned me yesterday, told me that the issue of credits is being  resolved positively. Other prospects have been mapped out,  among them being cooperation in the field of science and  culture, and many others.    One important result is our mutual understanding, good  mutual  understanding, of the processes which are under way in the  Caucasus, and, in particular, in Georgia, and on a wider scale,  in Europe and the world. From this standpoint, the visit was  undoubtedly a success.    The second question, which is of no less interest for us  all,  our citizens -- how did Turkey achieve success with its economy  and in developing democracy and political life? Your question  in effect implied the answer. I may reiterate it, but I will be  brief. It achieved it by being patient; by declaring and  setting genuinely national and state interests as the highest  goal; by integrating into the European and world economy. It  did not refuse it. [as heard] From the very beginning it  refused the policy of being shut out and living in isolation,  which brought Georgia to this dead-end. Unlike Georgia, Turkey  followed a completely different course, which has brought it  tremendous success; it could be called a wonder. At the meeting  with business circles, where unique dialogues and conversations  were held with about 200 businessmen and bank representatives of  Turkey, and where you [Oniani] were not allowed, we saw a  20-minute movie about Turkey's wonder -- if we call it this.  Having seen this movie I have drawn a conclusion for myself as  to how Turkey managed to achieve such success in a comparatively  short span of history. Turks have tried may forms of rule over  the last 20 years. You know there has been a coup d'etat and  military dictatorship. The ruling democracy, as I would call  it, proved to be the best. There is quite a strong opposition,  there is political pluralism, but there is the most important  thing, which you can feel everywhere -- the people's wish, their  disposition. Common state interests and party interests do not  damage state interests. I think that if we are to learn  anything -- and there is much that we must learn -- it is  establishing this kind of attitude in Georgia.    [Oniani] Mr. Shevardnadze, Suleyman Demirel, in an  interview with us, said that Georgia and Turkey have a lot in  common and that a lot of Georgians live in Turkey and are very  good citizens. You met some of them; among them the minister of  agriculture, Refaettin Sahin, was always with our delegation.  There were others as well. You were given Georgian magazines  which are published in Turkey, including CHVENEBURI magazine.  There were warm contacts there. What can you say about them?  How important was it to you as the head of state to meet these  Georgians?    [Shevardnadze] To say that I was indifferent to them and  looking at them casually would not be true. I have always met  these people this way. [as heard] In this respect -- about the  Georgians there -- I would like to say, and we in Georgia must  comprehend it well, that first they are honorable citizens of  their own country, as Demirel said and you just repeated. They  are honorable citizens of their country, Turkey. Therefore, for  honesty and faithfulness to the state, the Turkish Government  values them greatly, and trusts and respects them. By playing  such a role they will also play the role of a bridge of  friendship between Georgia and Turkey. They will do a very good  service also to Georgia by being faithful to their adopted  country, being devoted, honest and being good citizens and, as I  said, they can also play a role as a bridge of friendship.    [Oniani] In Turkey you put forward the idea of the  commonwealth of commonwealths, that is the CIS plus the alliance  of the Black Sea basin countries plus the CSCE. What is it? Is  it a continuation of the process of integration or one more  mechanism of self-defense for Georgia, and not only Georgia?    [Shevardnadze] This is what I would call objective  processes,  which are under way in today's world. Countries on their own,  even gigantic countries will not be able to resolve the issues  they are facing, and integration is one of the most important  characteristic events of this epoch. Such form of integration  as the CIS must be reckoned with within the limits of the vast  general process of integration. But the processes in the south,  that is, in the Black Sea basin countries, the economic alliance  of the Black Sea countries, which is making its first steps and  which is just starting to function realistically, must also be  taken into consideration. Whatever has already happened in  Europe must all the more be reckoned with -- the European  Community has taken 30 years to form, and it has reached  definite standards and a high level. Generally speaking, when I  was talking about the commonwealth of commonwealths, what I mean  by the commonwealth of commonwealths is that this commonwealth  is not directed against anyone, and must be viewed as a  constituent part of the general process of integration. The  commonwealth of commonwealths, as you have just said, is the  road leading to a space of a single economic or military  security which can assume either European, Euro-Asian or  finally, a world scale. The commonwealth of commonwealths is  the road leading to a space of a single security.    [Oniani] Turkey, which has not yet managed to join the  European Community, must have been interested in this idea.    [Shevardnadze] Many ideas voiced by us or the Turkish  authorities have a lot in common. And one more thing, the  commonwealth of commonwealths responds to NATO's latest  initiatives and Clinton's address -- Partnership for Peace. I  view it as a single complex leading to a vast single space.    [Oniani] Mr. Shevardnadze, at the meeting with President  Demirel and Husamettin Cindoruk, chairman of the Turkish Grand  National Assembly, your suggestion that the meeting of the  presidents of the countries of the alliance [Black Sea basin  countries] be held in Tbilisi, was approved. You said that  judging from this, you believed that order would be established  in Tbilisi and Georgia. Establishing order on the highways was  discussed at the meeting with businessmen. Enforcement of order  was the main theme at the conference of the Tbilisi branch of  the Citizens' Union of Georgia, yet rumors circulate that there  is a pressure from the high echelons of either authorities or  the government, and that these measures will stop halfway and  will never be continued.    [Shevardnadze] I announced at the meeting the day before  yesterday that those who oppose the will of the people,  irrespective of what post they may occupy, will not remain in  their posts. Order will be established by all means. We cannot  stop halfway and we will not stop; this movement making the the  country healthier and clearing the atmosphere will not be  stopped. If it is stopped, then people will sweep away  everybody and everything that prevents them from achieving the  set goal.    [Oniani] At the Citizens' Union of Georgia conference it  was noted that the union's youth organization had been formed.  This was announced by Giorgi Maisuradze and Giorgi Baramidze.  What is your attitude toward this fact and how do you assess it?    [Shevardnadze] I am proud of the youths who are joining the  Citizens' Union and those who decided to set up a youth  satellite organization having the orientation of the Citizens'  Union. They are wonderful youths. I would say one more thing:  That the Citizens' Union is an organization for young people --  not only of young people, but for them, as well. This  initiative was raised at one of the sessions of the board of the  Union, and we all supported it actively. It is a brilliant  generation, and they will undoubtedly make our union and the  country too, more beautiful, richer, and they will mature, grow  up and take over tommorow's Georgia.    [Oniani] You said at the conference that the process of  Russia's change has begun; and later you said that we would  resolve the issue of returning to Abkhazia. We already know  about the activities of our delegation in Geneva; a paragraph on  the inviolability of the Caucasian borders was contained in a  Brussels declaration at a NATO meeting, where Americans raised a  peace initiative. In the immediate future, President Yeltsin is  to visit Georgia. Judging from all these events, how  advantageous are the circumsatnces for resolving the Abkhaz  issue and how will Russia participate in this pocess?    [Shevardnadze] Resolving the Abkhaz issue without Russia's  active participation is impossible. However, anegative role by  Russia at different stages may have been, still, today it is  such a palpable reality that one should be blind not to be able  to see it. [sentence as heard] Therefore, I would say that  Russia's participation in peace-keeping initiatives and in  resolving the Abkhaz issue in a peaceful manner is a decisive  role -- of course, together with and under the auspices of, and  not contradictory to the United Nations. Some people are trying  to juxtapose them and find a definite contradiction between  them. There are no contradictins here. We must also consider  Russia's realistic interests when we are talking about securing  Georgia's interests in Abkhazia, and not only in Abkhazia. If  we understand each other so well -- and I think we should  understand each other well and that we will take into  consideration each other's interests -- then I believe that the  Abkhaz issue will soon be resolved and the refugees will soon  return to their homes. Therefore, I repeat, if we want Russia  to understand us, then we must understand Russia, the aches,  difficulties and contradictions which the Russian state is faced  with now. I think that this process of mutual understanding and  of building good-neighborly and friendly relations is going well.    Now, as for a very important stage in the life of our two  countries, President Yeltsin's forthcoming visit -- it is still  early days to talk about dates -- will be a great event. I am  sure that our citizens welcome his visit. The Tbilisi branch of  the Citizens' Union, when I asked them how our capital would  receive him, everyone unanimously expressed their feelings and  attitude by saying that we must receive him as an honored guest,  a representative of a great country, our great neighbor, the  president of a great country.    At the same time, I would like to remind you of several  things that have to be mentioned before his visit. President  Yeltsin will be a desired guest for Georgia, among other reasons  because -- Georgians know it well, and those who do not, must  know -- it is necessary to take into consideration his role in  dismantling the empire. Yeltsin is one of the most impressive  and distinguished figures, who has taken decisive steps,  especially after the August putsch, when he took a course of  dismantling the empire, and on the ruins of the empire is  building a new form of relations and cooperation which we today  call the CIS. It would be a little difficult to talk about  Yeltsin without this role; his role was undoubtedly an  historical one.    Many citizens of Tbilisi remember that after 9 April  [massacre of demonstrators in Tbilisi by Soviet Army troops],  Yeltsin, who was in the opposition, was one of the first people  to visit Tbilisi to express his condolences. I think this must  not be forgotten. There is one more thing I wish to recall for  the population in Tbilisi and throughout Georgia: When, at a  union congress of deputies, Army prosecutor Katushev accused and  started to press charges against Georgia, Yeltsin was the first  man to leave the hall as a sign of protest. He was then  followed by several hundreds of deputies who also left as a sign  of protest. Thus, I have always considered him to be Georgia's  friend and I would like that the Georgian people receive him as  our friend, a great neighbor and friend.    [Oniani] The document signed during the meeting between  Clinton and Yeltsin, when Clinton arrived in the post-Soviet  territory, was viewed as one of the full stops at the end of the  Cold War. What can be done about real wars, either in Georgia,  the Balkans, or Nagorno-Karabakh, which assumed a horrendous  scale?    [Shevardnadze] I think that the Clinton-Yeltsin meeting is  an  important stage, the most important stage for creating a new  world strategy since the end of the Cold War, in the same way as  the NATO meeting. These are not contradictory events as some  people claim by explaining that if NATO becomes stronger and its  influence widens, then Russia will die. On the contrary, work  will be directed toward creating and forming the single  strategic space, to be more accurate, the single security space.  I think that we must go even more assiduously toward creating a  new world strategy, a new space for security in the world -- of  course, including its guarantees, security guarantees for the  world.    Clinton's visit was one of these steps. If we continue more  assiduously, I am sure that every conflict will be resolved. I  think that the experience accumulated in the United Nations  about the Abkhaz and Samachablo issues...[pauses] if we end the  work which we started it will be a good precedent of how the  United Nations, the CSCE and great individual countries like the  United States of America, Russia, France, the Federal Republic  of Germany, England can combine their efforts in order to  resolve these local conflicts so that they do not spread. Thus,  these conflicts will be resolved and settled in the process of  creating this common space.    [Oniani] You mentioned at the news conference held before  you  left Turkey that Abkhazia will be a test case for the United  Nations and Russia.    [Shevardnadze] When I said that I meant that the conflict in  Abkhazia is not of such a vast scale that large states and the  United Nations could not resolve it, it is at the same time a  potentially very dangerous conflict and resolving it will be a  classical example of how a conflict could be settled by means of  joint efforts by many states and such a great international  organization.    [Oniani] Thank you. It was announced on Georgian television  yesterday that some persons guilty of finance and credit  breaches had been exposed. Then it was announced that the  Caucasus Concern, the Caucasus Exchange was a founder of  noncommodity operations in Georgia. It begs a natural question  -- the leader of this organization today is a vice premier of  Georgia [Amiran Kadagishvili].    [Shevardnadze] In principle, I do not wish to jump to  conclusions before the investigation is over. I knew that it  would be mentioned yesterday -- not this particular fact, but  that 12 criminal cases had been instituted. As for drawing the  conclusion that the Exchange is mainly to blame, and that it  caused everything -- I think it is a little hasty and a  premature decision. I think that a wide-scale investigation  must be carried out; 12 cases have been instituted, but there  may be cases coming up. The fact is that cases have been  instituted, and the beginning of an investigation does not  define guilt as yet. It will be a complex case and will have to  go through complex stages; the process of investigation, then  everything must be examined in the prosecutor's office and the  prosecutor's conclusion must be confirmed, then court of law  follows, and nobody knows what the court will decide.  Therefore, let us not jump the gun; let the investigation carry  out the task delegated to it by the head of state. I think that  everything will be clarified, among other things, the role of  the previous government, which imposed the premature  introduction of the coupon on parliament and the head of state.  Instead of finding a common language with Russia, we made haste  and introduced the so-called national currency, to be more  accurate, a transitional form of the national currency. The  coupon had to be devalued, however unpalatable it may be to say  it, and so it did. I do not want to usurp the name of  soothsayer, but right from the beginning of the parliamentary  sessions I made no secret of it, and I said then that  devaluation was imminent. Then I said that it was a forceful  step, and not a natural one toward a national currency that is  slightly different -- like it was chosen by other countries,  among them our neighbors -- a parallel existence of two  currencies which painlessly settled the transition to a new  feature. [sentence as heard] Much has to be said about the  coupon. The issue of whether we will be able to save it or not  is problematic. We must try to save it. Once we have made this  step and parliament and the executive authorities have made this  decision, we must do everything in order to save it, but not in  the way they suggest.    I watch television and often we are told to forbid selling  everything in rubles or dollars and so on. Any kind of ban will  result in repercussions and will lead us to the condition  whereby products will not be imported; there will be nothing.  Therefore, the way of introducing a ban is not the way to  strengthen the coupon and we made a mistake when we stated in  parliament that it was the sole means of payment. The coupon  cannot be strengthened by force; therefore, we must seek other  ways, and the authorities are assessing this today.    [Oniani] And yet, our entry into the ruble zone is much  talked about. How important and useful is it for Georgia if the  entry means handing gold mines over to Russia, refusing  independent finance and credit emission, annulling economic laws  on the Georgian territory for the benefit of Russia, Russia's  appointing one of the vice presidents of the National Bank, and  so on? There are many demands from the Russian side.    [Shevardnadze] Regarding talks and, moreover, a decision  about joining the ruble zone -- this issue is unripe. It was  probably right that talks and discussions have been started, and  Vakhtang Goguadze was right to have raised this issue that has  become a topic for discussion. But it does not mean at all that  we are to make a decision in the immediate future on joining the  ruble zone. It was hasty to have left the zone -- it was still  early in the game -- unprepared and unripe in the same way as  the issue of joining the zone is unripe today. This problem has  not been studied deeply and substantively by scientists and  specialists. Yesterday I noticed the opinion poll carried out  in the street, and there were terrific responses. Ask  specialists -- I am a consumer, a common consumer -- call  specialists and let them tell us what the ruble zone is, what we  shall gain, and what we shall lose. Once again, I repeat, we  must study this issue as one of the solutions to the problem,  not the only one. We must seek other ways also. I may say that  I do not rule out that another more effective way may be found.    One more thing: Now that people are insulting Goguadze,  practically calling him the anti-Christ, and wondering how he  could have said such a thing, nobody is asking if Russia will  accept us in the ruble zone. I think it is a problematic issue.  In his statement yesterday, Gaydar spoke about his disagreement  over Belarus joining the ruble zone. Russia knows very well  that such a poor country as Georgia joining the ruble zone would  mean more of a burden, expenses, additional expenses -- she  knows it very well. It is not right to kill each other over  arguments on whether to join this zone not knowing Russia's  stance.    I must say that our political culture is on such a level  that  we must beat each other up for having a different view. It has  become a custom unfortunately.    A lot is being said about gold deposits. I do not want to  say how many kilos we are talking about. The Russians have a  saying that translated in Georgian sounds approximately like:  Weight of a cat's tear. This is what our gold deposits equal  to compared with our rights. It is not significant, it may last  us 10-15 days, giving us a temporary respite. We have no more  gold deposits. If we had had a lot of gold then we would have  been a different country and state, and the coupon would have  had a different value. Now, this is how I see it. When am I  going to express my view on whether it is going to be the ruble  zone, lari [name of the planned Georgian currency], or the  coupon, or anything else? I shall probably express my views  after my visits in Paris.    [Oniani] It will probably be held this week, will it not?    [Shevardnadze] Hopefully. What does the status of a  developed country, which we have just attained, have in store  for us? It means a lot. I shall have contacts with those heads  and directors-general who know this business very well and what  it would mean for us economically, financially, and so on.    I can answer this question more definitely after I meet the  World Bank and its management, the management of the  International Monetary Fund, and the U.S. Administration --  especially the international organizations like the IMF and the  World Bank. I must carry out a special investigation and  account for those $200 million that Sigua says Shevardnadze has  hidden away. I do not know where it has been hidden, and if  Christopher Columbus was trying to discover America, I, too,  shall set off looking for the $200 million and maybe I shall  discover it. [laughs] God help me, I may find it. After I have  done all this, I shall be able to say what might happen with the  coupon and what are the ways out from this state.    [Oniani] Your visit to France begins later this week. What  do you expect from this visit?    [Shevardnadze] I am going to France with great hopes. Not  because I am going to bring back suitcases of dollars and francs  and so on...    [Oniani, interrupting] I hope you will not bring coupons  with  you.    [Shevardnadze, continuing] ...not only for this. Although  there may be something interesting in this regard as well.    France has traditionally been Georgia's friend. It has  always been so and that is still the case today. It is  especially tangible now that the Abkhaz issue is so acute.  France is one of the initiators of a group called the Group of  Georgia's Friends, which together with the United Nations is  aspiring to establish peace in Abkhazia and peacefully resolve  the conflict there. This envisages the return of refugees,  restoring the economy of Abkhazia, and so on.    It would not be right for a young democratic and independent  country not to have a legal basis with such a great country as  France -- a country that has a great reputation and weight.    A wonderful treaty on cooperation, friendship, and  understanding between the two countries has been prepared, and  President Mitterrand and I will sign it. After that, intensive  relations between our two countries will start.    We are to join the Paris Charter in France. Since the end of  the Cold War this charter has been regulating relations in  Europe and not only in Europe. The United States and Canada  have joined it. This is a charter recognized all over the world.    Of course, I am looking forward to a meeting with President  Mitterrand, who is one the most remarkable politicians of our  times. Many other interesting and useful meetings are awaiting  us in Paris, including meetings with UNESCO and other  international organizations, various parties, government  leaders, and so on.    I think that close ties with Paris and a process of  establishing closer ties, which is now starting and which lays  the foundation of our new relations, will undoubtedly help us  emerge from the crisis as soon as possible. I am leaving for  Paris with these hopes.    [Oniani] Thank you very much. You have been listening to the  head of state and Supreme Council chairman, Eduard Shevardnadze.</p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Planning to counter the budget crunch Financial advisers have in recent weeks noticed a strong surge in interest in pension planning ahead of the Budget in 11 days. But they are urging caution against hasty action, writes Andrew Jack. If Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, announces immediate changes to tax relief on pensions, it may be worthwhile to accelerate pension contributions before the changes come into effect - which could be from December 1, the day after the Budget. Topping up pensions could help if Mr Clarke reduces tax relief on pension contributions, which is currently available at the higher rate up to certain limits. If this option were adopted - in line with declining limits on other concessions, such as tax relief on mortgage interest - it could be worthwhile to accelerate pension payments before the Budget. But this would be most beneficial only if any changes were effective immediately. The risk is that the chancellor could also increase the upper rate of income tax. Anyone liable for tax at the higher rate who had made accelerated pension payments would then be unable to take advantage of relief at the higher level. However, there is a danger that any hasty action to start or change a pension plan could trigger administrative costs and might lock people into an undesirable option.</p>

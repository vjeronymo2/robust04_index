			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Tribunal's pension ruling to face appeal HICK HARGREAVES, the Bolton-based engineering company, is to appeal against the decision of Manchester industrial tribunal that Mr Alan Roscoe, a former company employee, had suffered unlawful discrimination on grounds of sex by being given a reduced pension. The decision to appeal opens the way for the case to be referred to the European Court of Justice for clarification of the retrospection aspects of the Barber v Guardian Royal Exchange judgment nearly a year ago. The European Court ruled in its Barber judgment that pensions counted as pay under Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome. But it also stated that to avoid upsetting the financial balance of schemes, equalisation would apply only to pension entitlements arising after the date of the judgment - May 17 1990. That has led to confusion over the definition of pension entitlements. Mr John Bellis, a chairman of the Manchester industrial tribunal, upheld Mr Roscoe's contention that as he retired after the date of the judgment he should have received a full pension at the same level as that of a woman. Mr Bellis disagreed with Hick Hargreaves, which took the view that it need only equalise pension benefits accruing from the date of the judgment and reduced his pension by 27 per cent compared with that of a woman. Mr Roscoe retired at 60, five years earlier than the company's normal retirement age for men. The Equal Opportunities Commission, which is backing Mr Roscoe, hopes to secure an early hearing in the Employment Appeals Tribunal and will ask it to refer the case to the European Court. This is the second test case being put forward to clarify the Barber judgment. Last week, the independent trustees of the Coloroll Group Pension Schemes announced that they were seeking guidance from the High Court on winding up the schemes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Addis Ababa, April 14 (AFP) -- The Organisation of  African Unity (OAU) on Thursday [14 April] called for an  immediate end to the "senseless violence" in Rwanda to enable  relief and medical assistance to reach the wounded and refugees  displaced by the ethnic bloodshed.    In a statement, issued after a meeting of its Central Organ  Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution,  the OAU urged the international community to provide increased  resources to cater for the urgent humanitarian needs of the  Rwandan people.    It also called for an immediate start to negotiations  between  government forces and Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) rebels,  scheduled for Thursday, which would "lead to the establishment,  without delay, of transitional institutions as provided for  under the Arusha peace agreement" of August last year.    The OAU reaffirmed that the Arusha Accord remained the only  viable framework for the resolution of the Rwandan conflict and  served as the basis for peace, national unity and reconciliation  in the country.    It appealed for continued involvement of the United Nations,  including the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) as an  essential element in the restoration of peace in the country and  the implementation of the Arusha peace agreement.    "We are conscious of the security and humanitarian  implications of events in Rwanda for the sub-region", the  statement said, appealing to the UN Security Council  representatives in the region and Tanzanian President Ali Hassan  Mwinyi to persevere and intensify their ongoing efforts to bring  peace to Rwanda and neighbouring Burundi.</p>

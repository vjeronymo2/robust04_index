			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Kohl rejects 'poison' of tax increases to help the east CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday again rejected opposition calls for immediate tax rises to help rebuild eastern Germany and reduce the budget deficit, but promised a decision early next year on a tax increase from January 1, 1995. Departing from his prepared text in a speech to parliament, Mr Kohl said: 'In this phase of recession it would be poison to introduce new tax burdens.' His statement came amid new indications that both government and opposition are keen to agree on a 'solidarity pact' to stop the collapse of the east German economy. Mr Kohl spelt out a little more of his ideas about such a pact, insisting on the one hand that he had no intention of 'bashing the trade unions' in the negotiations for wage restraint, and that he expected German industry to contribute 'billions of D-Marks to retraining and youth programmes in the new Lander' as their side of the bargain. Leaders of the opposition Social Democrats repeated their desire to reach agreement on a deal, which would include a more directly interventionist industrial policy, to save key sectors of east German industry, wage restraint on the part of the unions, and some agreement on future financing. It is the last element, on how to reduce the budget deficit and the future debt burden, which still appears to be the most difficult part of the negotiations. Mr Kohl said he had every intention of reaching an agreement on the pact by Christmas, although he warned that simultaneous negotiations between the central government and the 16 Lander on the future division of the financial burden of subsidies to the east could delay a deal. He said agreement had to be reached on the financial burden-sharing before the size and shape of the 1995 tax rise could be fixed. The increase in revenue was essential to pay for an estimated annual DM40bn (Pounds 16.5bn) in debt servicing on all the accumulated debts of east Germany, including the forecast DM250bn to be handed on by the Treuhand privatisation agency in 1995. All the debts should be brought together in a single fund for 'burdens of the past', he said, and the tax rise dedicated solely to financing it. Both the Social Democrat opposition, and many economists, have urged the government to introduce earlier tax measures, both to raise finance and to make burden-sharing in the west more equitable.</p>

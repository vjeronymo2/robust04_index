			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Mihaly Bihari, political scientist and </F> parliamentary candidate of the Hungarian Socialist Party, by  Ferenc Gazso; place and date not given]    [Text] In the long term, the rotation of two alternative  economies will be characteristic of Hungary: a new type of  social democratic course, and a modernized conservative one.  Liberalism might also remain a considerable factor in shaping  policies but not in the form of mass parties; rather, through  its intellectual force. The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] can  be regarded as a new type of social democratic party, with  extremely varied internal subdivisions. This is what we  discussed with political scientist Mihaly Bihari, who was at one  time connected to the Social Democrats and is now running in the  election on the MSZP ticket.    [Gazso] Reports are increasing about the chances of victory  for the Socialists. Is this anticipated election success due to  the spread of social democratic ideas or to "nostalgia," the  personal charisma of individual politicians, or some skillful  tactic in party politics?    [Bihari] It can be attributed primarily to the failure of  the  Christian-conservative alternative that the demand for the other  two alternatives--the liberal and the social democratic  one--increased in Hungarian society. In the 1990 elections the  country voted for a conservative, modernizing political course.  However, the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] failed for several  reasons. The content of the modernization it proposed was not  clear, the coalition sent the country in an economic  catastrophe, and moreover, it operated the otherwise functioning  political democracy in the wrong way. All of these factors  resulted in the temporary failure of the conservative  alternative.    In our region, the new left appears in the form of socialist  democracy: It is not communism, not reform communism, it does  not represent a kind of old-fashioned "new left;" it intends to  operate not merely in the spirit of reform, but not in an  agrarian-plebeian spirit, either. Due to these features, this  left can become a factor that can shape history and society in  the long term. From this point of view, I consider the MSZP an  accomplished social democratic party. Thus, in the history of  Hungary these two alternatives--the social democratic and the  conservative one--will alternate regularly, competing with each  other, just as is customary in Western Europe.    [Gazso] Many people say about the MSZP that it is a  collective party of several trends and if it comes into power,  these trends can easily conflict with each other. Is the danger  realistic?    [Bihari] According to the polls, the party might receive as  much as 30-40 percent of the votes; this means more than 1  million voters. The political composition of these voters is  extremely varied. Among them there are obviously people who have  a nostalgia for the Kadar regime of the seventies, but they are  not the ones who constitute the mass of supporters. Most of them  spontaneously share the values of the left, reject too great  social differences, consider the establishment of a social net  and the efficient handling of unemployment important, and feel  solidarity with the groups of society which are left behind and  are forced to the periphery.    Thus, in view of the political constitution of its voters,  the MSZP is indeed a collective party, just like every other  modern party. At any rate, the sociological composition of the  voters gives a more truthful picture of internal subdivisions  than the interviews given by certain politicians, or the  position of certain individuals within the organization. It is  another question altogether that concrete professional disputes  can arise within the party. In the beginning there was indeed a  difference between the economic policy draft put together by  Laszlo Bekesi and the advertisement published last August and  signed by the party chairman, but this difference of opinion was  laid to rest in the course of the discussions in the fall, and  today the party has only one program concerning this issue.    [Gazso] How can governing social democratic parties work  together with trade unions?    [Bihari] There are examples of this cooperation going back  several decades; let us consider, for example, the Scandinavian  countries, the British Labor Party, the German Social Democrats,  or the Spanish Socialist Party. These relations are hardly  without conflict. The cooperation does not mean that the party  rules the trade union or that the trade union rules the party.  Both of them are forced to negotiate. Afterwards, the party must  make other parties accept its position, and in the same way, the  trade union must fight with other trade unions for the  recognition of its position, and finally, all of this must be  coordinated with the employers, as well. The participants of the  modern "tripartyism," that is to say, the triparty negotiating  system (government, employers, employees), coordinate their  positions at a separate forum. Thus, the National Federation of  Hungarian Trade Unions [MSZOSZ] as a factor in the parliamentary  group and the MSZP as governing party are not the ones to say  the last word. After all, we are not dealing with a state party.    [Gazso] Can the victory of the MSZP, or an eventual  coalition  between the MSZP and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ],  have an effect on the party structure? Is it conceivable that  the tripolar political system will become a bipolar one?    [Bihari] Historically there is a chance that a  left/left-center "party family" (MSZP, SZDSZ) will be formed on  the one hand, and on the other, a right/right center group of  parties (for instance, Association of Young Democrats [Fidesz],  Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], Christian Democratic People's  Party [KDNP], Smallholder parties). This chance is too slight.  In Hungary, liberalism has always been a very serious factor in  forming political aspects, even if it was not expressed in mass  parties. Thinking back on a 70-80 year history, I dare claim  that various aspects of liberalism (a trend toward collectivism,  modernized liberalism, or radical liberalism) do have a future,  but liberalism has no chance of becoming a mass party. Liberals  who want to express the concept of liberalism in the form of a  mass party are sooner or later faced with a dilemma: Should they  organize themselves like the parties on the left, or like the  parties on the right? However, liberals who accept that liberal  parties can have an effect primarily through their social  sensitivity and high intellectual capability, and not as a  mass-based party, will feel comfortable in a smaller party or in  several civilian organizations of intellectuals. For Hungarian  liberals, this is a realistic role. If they accept it, the three  political centers will remain.</p>

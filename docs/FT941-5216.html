			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Maxwell pension ruling fought A Pounds 235m legal dispute between the Maxwell pensioners and the administrators of Maxwell Communication Corporation was taken to the Court of Appeal yesterday. The liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management, the former manager of the Maxwell pension funds, are arguing that the pensioners should have the right in principle to receive all proceeds up to Pounds 235m resulting from the sales of businesses that were part of MCC. MCC was the largest of the quoted companies run by Robert Maxwell. If successful, the challenge would lead to a significant change in insolvency case law and could fundamentally alter how the MCC administrators repay creditors. A further hearing would be necessary for BIM to prove its entitlement to the Pounds 235m. If this were successful, it would reduce the amount available to other unsecured creditors. At present, the administrators propose treating BIM in the same manner as other creditors, through the payment of dividends raised by the sale of MCC businesses. Total assets available for distribution to unsecured creditors was said by the administrators last month to exceed Pounds 680m. Unsecured claims exceed Pounds 2.1bn. The bulk of unsecured creditors are banks and other financial institutions. In December, a High Court judge sitting in closed court rejected the arguments of BIM lawyers and ruled that the scheme proposed by the administrators could continue. Yesterday, Mr Philip Heslop QC, for BIM, argued for the decision of Mr Justice Vinelott to be overturned. Although BIM was unable to fully trace the pension fund money concerned, it should still have a proprietary claim to the MCC assets that would have to be met before those of other unsecured creditors, he said. He argued that since MCC benefited from the alleged misappropriation of pension fund assets, unsecured creditors had benefited from a 'swelling' of the company's assets and that any payments to them would amount to 'windfalls'. The hearing is due to end this week. Judgment is expected to be reserved. It is thought the issue may go to the House of Lords for a final decision.</p>

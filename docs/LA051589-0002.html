			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A stock clerk who was believed to be among the hostages held by a gunman at a K  mart store in San Leandro was arrested for investigation of stealing electronic  equipment from the store, police said. Darnell Marshall Oliver, 28, was  arrested after police went to his apartment in their investigation of the  hostage drama and found several items -- including a video camera and a  telephone answering machine -- with serial numbers of goods stolen from the K  mart, said Lt. Tom Hull. A masked gunman hid in the store, shot one employee  and tied and gagged the manager before police arrived and foiled the robbery  attempt. The gunman fled and is still at large, police said.  </P></p>

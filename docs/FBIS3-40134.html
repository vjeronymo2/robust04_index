			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhan Shiliang (6124 0013 0081): "The </F> Asia-Pacific Situation and China's `Good Neighbor' Policy"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted]  <H6>  II. </H6>   With the conclusion of the Cold War, Asian-Pacific hot spots  began to cool down. The peace process sped up in Kampuchea,  South Korea and North Korea strengthened their negotiations, and  each of the East Asian nations began paying more attention to  their own economic construction, with mutual friendly  cooperation and closer relationships. A new pattern of  multilateral force which was both competitive and cooperative  emerged gradually in the Asia-Pacific area, and the situation in  the entire region tended to be more relaxed.    The relative stability and economic development in the  Asia-Pacific region doesn't mean there are no negative factors  which could affect stability and development. Power politics and  hegemonism are still the major barriers to peace and development  in the whole world and in this region; economic factors play a  prominent role in international relationships, while economic  development throughout the world is unbalanced, trade  protectionism is growing stronger, and the conflicts between  some nations (especially between the United States and Japan) is  increasing. The former hot spot Korean peninsula remains in a  very unstable situation, and the Kampuchea question has not been  completely resolved, with new outbreaks of clashes still a  possibility. Russia is in a turbulent state. There also exist in  East Asia territorial disputes and ethnic and religious  conflicts which could also interfere with the stability of the  situation. In addition, it is still difficult to predice the  future development of Japanese-U.S. relations, or Chinese-U.S.  relations. Some countries still harbor suspicions about Japan  developing into a military power. It is precisely because of  these unstable and uncertain factors that we should pay  sufficient attention to questions of Asia-Pacific security.    All Asia-Pacific nations strongly demand the further  economic  development of their own countries, and experience has proven  that this will only be accomplished under conditions of  continued peace and stability in the region. Peace and stability  are related to the fundmental interests of each nation; if  contradictions and disputes arise among them, the only correct  course of action is to seek a means of resolution through  peaceful negotiations, avoiding antagonism giving way to  outbreaks of violence.    In varying degrees, economic development will create  competition and conflict, but if we are talking about East Asia  itself, these will be more compensatory in nature. Due to  differences in economic base, development level, and situation,  the East Asian nations are establishing a multilevel  developmental structure, with closer, more cooperative economic  and trade relations. The whole of East Asia has formed into a  constantly expanding, huge market, and is on the steady path to  regional cooperation and development. Although mutual  competition will develop, mutual cooperation and benefit will be  the chief aspect of this.    As mentioned before, the Asia-Pacific region already had a  multipolar tendency early on, and this tendency will grow even  stronger. It would be impossible for one or two countries, or a  group of countries, to control the entire region. The  multi-power co-existence of China, Japan, United States, and  Russia as well as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  (ASEAN), and Australia will serve to restrict, control, and  balance the overall situation. The rise of developing countries  like China and ASEAN will be positive factors in curbing great  powers from fighting over this region.    The situation and conditions in the Asia-Pacific region  differs considerably from that of Europe, so it would be  difficult to build a regional peace organ here modeled on a  European model peace alliance. We have to study enthusiastically  how to establish a regional peace organ which will gradually  suit the region's specific factors. Based on the current  situation, we should pay more attention to open up various  bilateral peace negotiations and talks, while also carrying out  appropriate multilateral activities, holding multiple type,  multilevel, multichannel conversations, to increase  understanding, communicate knowledge, and increase trust.    In the 1990s, the Asia-Pacific region will be in a  transitional phase toward a new, multipolar pattern. It is  possible there will be tensions and crises in some areas or some  individual problems, due to sharpened contradictions. However,  looking at the entire entity, the Asia-Pacific region could  possibly remain very stable for the next decase. Meanwhile, it  will continue to attract the whole world's attention with the  rapidity of its economic development.  <H6>  III. </H6>   The backwards, disunified, old China was the frequent target  of invasions by the great powers. The great powers' battles in  China was one important reason for past instability, or constant  disorder, and even war in the East Asia region. After the  People's Republic of China was founded, it conducted a peaceful  diplomatic policy of independence and self-determination. China  initiated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and has  always taken as the basic principle of its foreign affairs the  establishment and development of friendly cooperative relations  with all the world's nations. Now, China has become an important  pillar of stability and development in the Asia-Pacific region.    Striving for a peaceful and stable territorial environment  is  a focal point in China's foreign affairs. China pays special  attention to developing relationships with nations in  neighboring territory, always conducting a good neighbor policy.  Now, China's relationships with these territorial neighbors are  in a totally fine situation. Leaders visit each other  constantly, while economic and trade cooperative relationships  are growing closer and closer.    Last year was the 20th anniversary of the normalization of  relations between China and Japan, with widespread and deeply  felt ceremonies held in both nations. In April, General  Secretary Jiang Zemin visited Japan, taking relations between  China and Japan to a new stage of developing friendship. In  October, Japanese Emperor Akihito paid a six-day historical  visit to China. Not long after China and South Korea established  relations, President Roh Tae Woo visited China, and the  governments of the two countries signed four agreements on  trade, investment protection and other issues. In November of  last year, Premier Li Peng made a formal visit to Vietnam in  response to a invitation, the first visit to Vietnam by a  Chinese premier in 21 years. In the first half of the year,  Philippine President Ramos, Malaysian Premier Mahathir, and  Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong all visited China, while  Thailand Premier Chuan Leepai visited China in late August; not  long ago, Central Committee Chairman Qiao Shi visited Indonesia,  Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines. These  important mutual visits strongly promoted the development of  relations between China and ASEAN. Meanwhile, a delegation from  the party and government, led by standing members of the  Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese  Communist Party, visited North Korea to foster friendly and  cooperative relations between China and that nation.    These good political relations provide considerable impetus  to the development of economic and trade relations. In 1991,  trade between China and Japan grossed nearly $23 billion, 10  times what it was prior to the establishment of diplomatic  relations between the two nations. In 1991, trade between China  and South Korea was up to $5.8 billion, and in 1992, it was up  to $8.2 billion. This year, it is expected to reach $10 billion.  In 1978, trade between China and the ASEAN countries was only  $859 million; in 1988, it increased to $3.818 billion, a  3.4-fold increase for the decade. There have been further large  increases in recent years, reaching $8.466 billion in 1992, 15  times again what it was in 1975. There is still tremendous  potential for future development: At present, trade between  China and ASEAN constitutes only about 5 percent of China's  total foreign trade and just a little over 2 percent of that of  ASEAN.    There are terrorital questions which remain between China  and  some nations, legacies of history. China has always taken a very  cautious attitute concerning these matters. Early in 1957,  former Premier Zhou Enlai fully laid out for the National  People's Congress China's principal considerations in resolving  terrorital issues, saying that, "We want to resolve terrorital  questions, with the goal of stabilizing our borders, to  alleviate the international situation in a way that is  beneficial to modernization, but without making our relationship  with our neighbors tense." He went on to say that resolution  of territorial questions must be linked with expanding the Five  Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; we should seek resolution of  these questions on a basis of treating both sides as equals,  favorable to each other and to friendship. The Chinese  Government has conscientiously implemented the above principles  and policies, treating each situation differently while being  practical and realistic. It has resolved terrorital questions  with some neighboring countries fairly and reasonably, while  some problems are currently being negotiated and there has been  some progress. At the beginning of this year, when Foreign  Minister Qian Qichen visited Laos, the two sides signed a  "Terrorital Agreement Between China and Laos." Concerning the  issue of the Spratly Islands, the sovereign rights or which  belong to China, the Chinese Government expressed the idea of  "putting dispute aside, and developing together," and the  positive response to this from relevant nations is growing by  the day.    China was subjected to endless bullying and humiliation  under  hegemonism, so it will always oppose hegemonism and power  politics. China will never seek hegemony for itself, never  engage in expansionism or threaten other countries with military  force, nor will China fill any so-called "vacuum" either,  setting aside the fact that no "vacuum of power" exists in the  Asia-Pacific region. On a per capita basis, China's military  expenditure is only about $6 at present, while the United  States' is $1,100 and Japan's is $300; does this not make it  clear that China's military expenditures are very low? China's  military forces are completely used for defense, and it holds no  military advantage in the region. The "China threat theory" is  purely fictitious.    China is a developing nation with one-fifth of the world's  population, and its present focus is on building its domestic  economy. For over a decade, China has adhered to a basic  national policy of reform and opening up to the outside world,  with considerable achievements. China's opening up to the world  is establishing a new pattern of multi-level, multi-channel  opening in all directions. This requires the development of  closer economic and trade relationships with every nation in the  Asia-Pacific region, as well as the long term maintainence of  peace, stability, and development throughout the region. China  has a weak economic base spread over a vast area. Regional  development is very unbalanced throughout the country, and the  average GNP still puts it among the world's low income nations.  In the livelihood of the people, the problem of getting  sufficient food and clothing for everyone has just been  resolved, so the common standard of living will not reach the  point of being comfortably well off before the end of this  century. Furthermore, achieving the planned strategic goal of  bringing China up to the level of a medium developed country is  still a long way off, and will take several decades of hard  work. Even if it is a rich and strong nation at that time, China  will still strive for continual improvement and prosperity in  the people's standard of living, so will still need peace and  stability in the Asia-Pacific region and throughout the world.    In summary, China's security and benefit are linked closely  with the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region. China  will work with each country in the Asia-Pacific region to  achieve regional peace and development, moving forward hand in  hand to promote greater stability and prosperity throughout the  world.</p>

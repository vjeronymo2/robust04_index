			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABOUT WINE: A CAVEAT ABOUT BLIND TASTINGS: SOME VINTAGES WORK WELL WITH FOODS  </P> <P> The best wine in a blind tasting is often the best wine to buy. At least it has  passed a quality test.  </P> <P> In a blind tasting, the evaluators have no knowledge of the label and therefore  can't be prejudiced for or against a particular wine because of past  experiences with it, or with other wines from the same winery.  </P> <P> Blind tasting levels the playing field for wines of widely divergent prices  too. This is significant because price is not a major factor in determining  quality.  </P> <P> For example, a winery that bought its vineyard in 1934 and makes its Chardonnay  from grapes growing on that vineyard can sell the wine for $8 a bottle and make  a fair profit. That's because the cost of the raw material, the grapes, is  little more than the cost to farm the vineyard plus the cost of oak barrels to  age the wine.  </P> <P> On the other hand, the winery that buys grapes at $1,800 a ton is paying nearly  $3 for the juice inside each bottle, and with salaries, processing, oak barrels  and other cost factors, the wine must sell for more than $8 -- considerably  more.  </P> <P> (It has been estimated that the cost of a bottle of wine should equal the cost  of a ton of grapes for the wine times .01, which would make the Chardonnay from  $1,800-a-ton grapes sell for $18 a bottle.)  </P> <P> Blind tasting also eliminates the bias we all feel against wines from unknown  wine regions. Seeing he'll be tasting a Chardonnay from New Mexico, a judge  might wince, yet in a blind tasting, the only thing that matters is wine  quality. (And New Mexico has a thriving and improving wine industry.)  </P> <P> On the other hand, blind tasting of wine is really only one element to the  ultimate goal of enjoyment of wine. The other is simply: how does the wine go  with food?  </P> <P> It is an area of no precise answers because of the obvious drawbacks. Look at  the pitfalls in logistics alone:  </P> <P> A fine Chardonnay wins a blind tasting. It is perfectly made and harmonious,  offering fine flavors and good balance. Then someone brings to the dinner table  two dishes, a salad with rice wine vinegar and baked salmon. The wine tastes  awful with the salad (of course), but superb with the fish.  </P> <P> Even though it is not a science and the hazards are obvious, exploring the  great wine and food combinations is a quest of loads of people. Books have been  written on the subject, people have made careers out of lecturing on it, and it  is so fascinating that chefs around the world have recently doted on the idea  that a dish once thought classic might well be improved to match better with  wine.  </P> <P> Joshua Wesson, a master sommelier and co-author (with David Rosengarten) of  "Red Wine With Fish," explored wine and food combinations in his book and in  his newsletter, the Wine and Food Companion.  </P> <P> He notes that just because a dish goes with a particular Chardonnay doesn't  mean it goes with all Chardonnays.  </P> <P> "Three wines made from the same grape could lead people to three different  conclusions about their food affinity," he said. One wine may enhance the dish,  one may diminish it and a third may make no statement whatever.  </P> <P> He said, however, that just tasting the wine, by itself, is often not a good  clue to how it will match with certain foods.  </P> <P> "I look at wine the way I look at people," he said. "We're all equal but some  are more equal than others. Every wine will have one element that makes it  stand out. It's rare to find three Chardonnays that taste so similar to one  another that you would be hard-pressed to differentiate one from another.  </P> <P> "And some wines that taste good without food don't work very well with food."  </P> <P> In researching their book, Wesson and Rosengarten evaluated the wines first,  without food. Then the wines were paired with food.  </P> <P> "Sometimes you can predict accurately a wine and food match in your head, but  more often than not, we found that although we came close, we didn't hit the  nail on the head until we tried many wines to find an ideal match."  </P> <P> The quest is not incidental, by the way, especially for the person who has a  great (and expensive) wine that he wants to pour with dinner and he wants the  dinner to enhance the wine, and vice versa.  </P> <P> "You can have wines that are ennobled by a dish, and you can have wines that  are diminished by a dish," said Wesson, and there are combinations that make  both the food and the wine better.  </P> <P> "And you can't really put a pleasure quotient on any of this. Matches come in  different shapes and styles . . . but obviously it's better to have a modest  wine ennobled. I hate having my Montrachet stepped on."  </P> <P> A problem in using blind-tasting evaluations as a sole guide to what wines will  go with food is that blind tastings almost never are done with food on the  table. And, said Wesson, "The biggest wines often win wine tastings and these  are not usually the best wines for food."  </P> <P> To that end, Wesson and Rosengarten, in their newsletter, taste specific wines  with specific dishes, usually at well-regarded restaurants. They list the  ingredients of the dishes and, using wit to make the text readable, rank the  wines on how well they felt they went with the dishes.  </P> <P> Exploring this further, Wine Country International Magazine, based in northern  California, stages a series of tastings that it publishes six times a year  looking into the question of wine and food pairings. A recent adventure into  this format was most interesting.  </P> <P> Four judges were invited to the elegant Lodge at Pebble Beach and its newer  sister property, the Inn at Spanish Bay, to evaluate Chardonnays and Cabernets  in a standard blind tasting.  </P> <P> All the wines were scored, then all the winners -- 10 Chardonnays and 10  Cabernets -- were poured later in the day, again blind, before an amazing array  of food prepared by the chefs of the two inns.  </P> <P> The goal was to select the best wine-food matches to create a four-course  summer meal.  </P> <P> The interesting thing was that the top-rated wines in terms of raw scores in  the blind tasting were not the wines favored by the panel members when it came  time to pair wines with food. Indeed, a 1988 Louis Martini Chardonnay ($9.50)  went beautifully with a number of the dishes even though it wasn't ranked above  fifth in the overall tasting portion of the event.  </P> <P> The other day I was chatting with Julie Garvey, co-owner of Flora Springs  winery in the Napa Valley. Flora Springs wine maker Ken Deis makes a stylish  Chardonnay that accents complexity and richness and offers less in the way of  overt tutti-frutti aromas.  </P> <P> The 1988 Flora Springs Chardonnay ($23.50) is a truly elegant and beautifully  structured wine that is clearly suited to be served with food. It should not be  well-chilled either. It's best to serve it at cellar temperature, no cooler  than 55 degrees, to experience the nuance in the wine.  </P> <P> "As we have matured in the last decade," said Garvey, rather wistfully the  other day, "we are getting fewer gold medals for our wines, but we are making  wines that are better than ever."  </P> <P> Deis noted that showy wines often win medals and may be served with food and no  one will complain, but "balanced wines like this go better with food. The wine  tastes better and the food tastes better"  </P> <P> Subscriptions to the Wine and Food Companion, $36 a year (six issues), may be  obtained by writing to Context Communications Inc., 250 East 73rd St., Suite  14-H, New York, N.Y. 10021.  </P> <P> Subscriptions to Wine Country International are $16 a year (six issues).

None of the vegetal characteristics that  pervade so many Central Coast Pinot Noirs. Wine maker Gale Sysock has made  great strides with Pinot Noir in the last few years, and this wine is his  latest winner.  </P></p>

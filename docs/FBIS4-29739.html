			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report; from the "NHK News" program] </F>   [Text] At today's meeting of the House of Councillors'  Budget Committee, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata explained his  recent remark during a public speech on the street that he  believed North Korea did not possess nuclear weapons. He said  that was more an expression of his hope.    At the House of Councillors' Budget Committee today, Minao  Hattori of the Liberal Democratic Party and others questioned  Hata's remark during a wayside speech on 18 June that he  believed North Korea did not actually possess nuclear arms and  had no intention to produce them. They said this is in conflict  with the government's official view so far.    In reply, Hata explained that since North Korea claims that  it has neither the capability, nor the intention to manufacture  nuclear arms, his remark was really an expression of his hope.  He also said he regretted that his statement could lead to  misunderstanding. He indicated the government's consensus on  this matter is that North Korea may have produced more plutonium  than it has declared, and it would be a serious matter if such  plutonium is being used to manufacture nuclear weapons.</p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Concession over fishing limit THE GOVERNMENT last night bowed to Tory backbench pressure over plans to limit fishermen's days at sea, promising parliamentary consultations on fishing quotas. The Commons announcement of the concession from Mr David Curry, fisheries minister, averted a threatened rebellion by Conservative MPs opposed to the proposals in the Sea Fish (Conservation) Bill. There was cross-party support for an amendment introduced during the report stage by Mr Neville Trotter (Cons, Tynemouth), demanding that the government should return annually to parliament for approval of the days-at-sea limits it intended to set. But Mr Curry gave MPs an assurance that the Commons and the Lords would be consulted before any reductions in days at sea were introduced after 1993. The Bill was later given a third reading by 311 votes to 282, a government majority of 29. It now goes to the House of Lords.</p>

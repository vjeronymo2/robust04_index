			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by the Price Research Institute's Forecasting Group </F> (Principal researcher: Chen Dejun (7115 1795 1415); co-drafters:  Cao Jianjun (2580 1696 6511), Liu Xuming (0491 2485 2494) and  Ling Bin (0407 1755)): "Basic Estimates of Price Trend in 1994"]    [Text] I. Basic Situation in Economic Growth and  Price Trends in 1993    In 1993, China achieved notable results in economic  construction: compared to 1992, GNP increased by 13 percent, per  capita GNP exceeded 2,500 yuan, estimated increase in  agricultural output value in constant price increased by 3.7  percent, total grain production reached 456.4 billion kilo and  total oil production 176.1 billion tons. Total industrial output  value in constant price increased by 19.5 percent. Citizens  income also increased. Adjusted for the price factor, the  estimated annual per capita income of urban residents increased  by 10 percent, and of peasants by about 2 percent. Total  personal savings exceeded 300 billion yuan. The market was  active, and the total value of consumer goods retail sales,  adjusted for price rises, increased by 9 percent in real terms.  The total value of 1993 exports approached $190 billion, an  increase of around 15 percent over 1992.    Despite the favorable figures cited above, China's economy  also contains numerous salient contradictions, and the newly  created contradictions combined with the long-standing ones have  led to sharp rise in the overall price level in 1993, exerting a  great impact on functions of the economy in 1994. In 1993, the  national retail price index increased by 13 percent over the  prior year, with increases in prices of a range of consumer  products including import products, in costs of labor and in  production materials. After mid-July as a result of the  macroeconomic controls exercised by the Central Government, the  overall price level and prices of some important production  materials began to show some decline. But after November, the  inflationary trend was again strengthened. The fourth quarter  price situation was particularly serious. With the living cost  index rising in the large and medium cities, reaction of  low-income citizens and university and middle school students  was particularly adverse. Increase in prices of agricultural  production materials exceeded prices of agricultural products,  creating unfavorable conditions for agricultural exchanges in  the rural areas. Given the overall price increases, however,  price levels of energy, rail transportation, certain basic  products and infrastructure facilities were still low.    The main reasons this type of situation has developed are as  follows:    1. Development of infrastructure enterprises is  sluggish and out of step with general economic development.    Development in China's infrastructure enterprises, energy,  transport and transportation has been lagging, and the situation  still had not improved by 1993. Year-end 1993 statistics  indicate that rail transport capacity increased by only 3  percent over the prior year. Basically no new rail lines have  been put in service in 1994, and inadequate rail transport has  been one of the most critical areas in the last several years.  The Electric Power Ministry estimates that China at present  suffers an overall 20 percent shortfall in electricity supply,  with shortage in the Beijing, Tianjin and Tangshan area of 8  billion watts, the Northeast region 3-5 billion watts, while  East China historically has a shortage of electricity. Based on  China's realistic needs, the elasticity coefficient for  electricity should be greater than 1.2, but in actuality it  averages only 0.95. Although the overall quantitative supply of  coal and charcoal can be considered in equilibrium relative to  demand, but affected by transportation shortfall, the coal  supply for economically developed areas in East China and South  China is still tight. The demand for steel can only be met by  large imports and by the importing enterprises bearing added  transshipment costs. Rapid economic development has created  strong demands for basic products and infrastructure facilities  which led directly to increased market prices of basic products;  and because higher cost of supplies add to costs of production,  it provides strong impetus for overall price increase.    2. Supply-demand dislocation as a result of imperfect  market structure and inefficient circulation channels.    Circulation of commercial products in China is disjointed  often because of sluggish information flow, monopoly,  territorial division and untimely supply organization. For  example, in late November 1993, Guangdong led off with major  grain price increases, which gradually affected prices in areas  such as Hubei, Hunan, Anhui and Jiangxi, and soon enough the  North, producing grain price fluctuations over a large area. In  reality, China's total grain supply was adequate and reserves  also ample, but supply shortage in grain trading departments in  some areas and untimely grain transport to meet shortfalls in  other areas resulted in grain supply-demand disequilibrium in  various markets which could not be remedied [with supplies  distributed] in a timely way.    3. Inadequate supply to meet market demand is  underlying anxiety of an active market economy.    Rapid economic growth and significant price increases  demonstrate that demand is strong and the market active. But the  underlying situation is one of lagging market supply to meet  demand for certain products; for example, the demand for textile  products is sluggish while demand for household electrical  products well satisfied, or the supply of cement is such that  reserves for a whole year amount to some 210 billion tons.  Warehousing of products by state-owned large and medium-sized  enterprises continues to increase, and the total warehouse  reserves by year end is estimated to increase by over 12 percent  compared to the prior year. In particular, because peasants  income increase has lagged in recent years, sales in rural  markets of agricultural production materials have been sluggish,  and low demands for products of rural industries will affect the  latter's ability to recover from the slump. In terms of the  projected expanding scope of industrial production, this is an  underlying danger.    4. While money in circulation is already excessive, a  situation of inadequate liquidity to settle accounts still  exists.    Since 1992, money in circulation has increased by close to  40  percent in each of the two succeeding years. In this same  period, the economy grew by 27 percent, and prices increased by  19 percent. The rate of increase in money supply is almost  greater than the above two rates combined. Yet in many areas,  liquidity is still quite a problem, and triangular debts of  enterprises appear to be rising. Excessive amount of money in  circulation is a serious threat in that it leads to further  price inflation while inadequate liquidity for settling accounts  generates pressure for additional infusion of money supply.  <H5>  II. Analysis and Projection of Price Situation in the First </H5> Half of 1994    Based on operating condition of the national economy in 1993  and factoring in economic development and reform in 1994, it is  estimated that the scenario in the first half of 1994 will still  be one of high growth and high inflation, with the economic  growth rate basically keeping in step with rate of price  increase, both at probably more than 10 percent, but the  possibility exists that the latter may increase faster than the  former. The reasons for prices increasing faster are:    1. Tail-end effect of 1993 price inflation.    While the economic growth rate stayed at 13 percent in 1993,  the overall urban living costs index reached 15 percent, while  the index for 35 large and medium-sized cities exceeded 20  percent. Based on calculations, the residual effect of last  year's price inflation on this year's retail price level amounts  to 4-5 percentage points.    2. Large infusion of money supply creating underlying  inflationary pressure.    The out-of-control infusion of money supply in the first  half  of 1993 was curbed by macroeconomic coordination measures  applied after July, but money in circulation was still  excessive, and with further infusion of large amounts of money  supply in the second half of 1993, the year-end monetary  reserves of specialized banks reached a total of around 180  billion yuan; at present, money on deposits in banks has doubled  compared to the amount in July last year, a substantial amount  of liquidity which fuels demands. By the end of 1993, the total  amount of money in circulation had increased four-fold compared  to the end of 1992. In 1994, the Peoples' Bank of China's policy  on new money supply is based on the projection of a rather high  economic growth rate of 9 percent and new money of some 470  billion yuan, an increase of 17.8 percent. Therefore, the  projected supply of new money will generate great pressure on  market prices.    3. Imbalance in large-scale investments and enterprise  structure remains a major impetus for price inflation.    Although the total of China's fixed assets investments has  declined somewhat after "macroeconomic coordination," but the  rate of increase in 1993 was still over 46 percent. It is  estimated that with the changing production focus, state-owned  enterprises will have a surplus capacity of some 1,440 billion  yuan this year, a 40 percent increase over the year before;  furthermore, due to regulations designed to facilitate  development of the "bottleneck" enterprises, plans made to  substantially increase investments in newly defined key projects  and to utilize foreign capital investment in domestic  facilities, it is projected that this year's total fixed assets  investments will reach 1,300 billion yuan, an increase of 13  percent over the year before, and very possibly exceeding the  1993 total amount. Along with imbalance in large-scale  investments, China's enterprise structure also lacks balance; in  particular, infrastructure enterprises are thinly capitalized  and weak, restraining increase in supplies of energy and  resource materials, and contributing to widening the  supply-demand gap. Therefore, a rising price level becomes  necessary to generate increase in supplies.    4. Economic structural reform and its underlying effect  on price reform.    Among the numerous economic structural reforms carried out  this year, the most important ones which potentially impact on  the overall price level include reforms of the systems of  exchange rate, taxation and price structure. Regularization of  exchange rate has facilitated foreign exchange access for  domestic enterprises, but for the same reason can generate  greater imports into China this year and lead to increase in the  cost basis of the enterprise products. Although in reforming the  tax system, efforts are made not to increase the tax burden of  enterprises, but changes in the tax structure will inevitably  bring about changes in the tax burdens of individual enterprise.  The value added tax [VAT] will add to the tax burden of  wholesale enterprises, but lessen the tax burden of retail  enterprises. In addition, the VAT will be collected this year  from previously untaxed trades such as grain, chemical  fertilizers, medicine, hogs and energy resources. Structural  adjustments of prices will concentrate mainly in grain, oil,  rail transportation etc., which will undoubtedly and directly  result in market price increases.    5. Structural changes in salaries, wages and  consumptions will also lead to rise in the consumers price  index.    In recent years, citizens income level has risen  considerably. Statistics indicate that in January-November 1993,  the total value of all wages and salaries nationally increased  by 21.8 percent over the same period of the year before; of the  total, wages paid by people's work units increased by 21.9  percent, rural or collective economic entities by 15.1 percent,  and other economic entities by 73.5 percent which represents an  all-time high in historical terms. Non-wage income of workers  and employees also reached a considerably high level. And the  increased cost of labor is another important factor which drives  up the cost of production and leads to price increase. Even more  serious is the structural change in income. A typical study  shows that at present 2 percent of the citizens have 30 percent  of all income. Correspondingly, the market for consumer products  is leaning toward the higher priced luxury products. A 2,000  yuan leather jacket is no longer considered a rarity. Demands of  soap and cosmetic are for the imports or high-class products of  foreign-funded enterprises; hot-selling products and others  items rapidly becoming hot-selling products include motorcycle,  air-conditioner, video-camcorder, camera, computer, stereo audio  system, multi-feature color TV, refrigerator, telephone and  other communications devices. These high-price consumers  products are also setting the standard and exerting strong  attraction for the middle and lower income groups. Therefore,  although the overall market demand of consumers goods will not  produce great changes, changes in the income structure and the  structure of consumer goods market will exert upward pressure on  consumers product prices.    6. Imperfect organization of market enables some  products to create market and price fluctuation at any time    Markets in China are small-scale and loosely organized;  supply and sales channels of many important commercial products  are uncoordinated and disjointed, and monopolies in some markets  and regional barriers are also rather serious problems.  Therefore, in terms of maintaining overall market equilibrium in  supply and demand for products, responses to certain policy  measures or changes in psychological expectation can lead to a  certain amount of market and price fluctuations. If such  fluctuations occur regularly, prices will naturally react by  strong upward movement.  <H5>  III. Analysis of Whole-Year Price Trend in 1994 and Policy </H5> Recommendations    Viewed in the context of current economic condition and  reform and opening in China, it is inevitable that the overall  price level will rise substantially in 1994. Examined in terms  of how the trend may develop, two scenarios in the latter half  of 1994 are possible: 1) Given intensification of economic  structural reform and strengthening of macroeconomic controls,  abnormal price fluctuations and price increases will be  effectively controlled, and the overall rate of price increase  will be kept in line with the national economic growth rate. 2)  With the economy growing rapidly and double-digit inflation  continuing its upward climb which lead to forceful adjustment in  the economy, the result will be slowing down the rate of  economic growth, but the two factors accounting for price rise  have not been eliminated and prices will continue to rise  creating the so-called slow growth with high inflation scenario.  The effect of slow growth on prices is very serious; the effect  of high inflation is also dangerous.    In order to prevent more serious inflation from taking  place,  controlling the overall price level should be one of the  objectives of macroeconomic policy; therefore, the following  policy or reform measures are recommended for consideration:    1. Maintain stable growth of the money supply.    China's monetary policy should strive to stabilize the money  supply. Considering the fact that money in circulation is  already excessive, the rate of increasing the money supply  should be kept within the range of the combined rates of  economic growth and planned price increases; at the most, the  rate should not exceed last year's rate of increasing the money  supply.    2. Strictly control increased supply and demand for  investment capital    Controlling the demand for investment capital ultimately is  done by reforming the investment and other economic systems. The  current reform has not reached that stage, and government  administrative coordination is still required. It is important  that investment projects of different kinds or types be governed  by different fiscal and taxation policies; commercially  competitive projects with relatively high rate of returns should  be required to pay higher market interest rates and higher tax  rates; infrastructure projects requiring a longer time frame to  yield relatively low returns should be given lower interest  rates for commercial loans and paying lower taxes; for  investments in public interest projects with low or no returns,  the government should not only extend low interest special  loans, but also encourage such investments through preferential  policy treatments. In addition, the government should guide and  coordinate the level of investments by various enterprises in  different localities on the basis of the latter's developmental  status.    3. Establish and perfect macroeconomic market  coordination including tactics for indirect coordination.    To prevent abnormally large fluctuations in the commercial  market, the government should focus on establishing a series of  wholesale markets for agricultural sideline products and  materials for industrial productions in the large and  medium-sized cities and localities where such products and  materials are usually assembled and distributed. On the basis of  such a foundation, the government should target products with  different special characteristics and apply different direct or  indirect macroeconomic coordinating measures. (1) Products with  limited supply-demand elasticity such as grain, cotton, sugar,  salt, agricultural pesticides and plastic film covering, the  government should apply macroeconomic policy with a "guarantee  supply" objective. The government must resolutely set up, in  stages and by category, a storage and reserves system for  important products, and realistically put into effect a fund for  adjustment of special projects. The sales of these products and  their stable supply in the market should be linked to  enterprises being required to maintain reserves at a level  within the range of government stipulated highest and lowest  levels of reserves, and to follow government guidance in times  of market fluctuations. (2) For industrial products with more  flexible supply-demand elasticity, the government should  emphasize establishment and standardization of wholesale  markets, and as much as possible utilize economic measures to  limit price fluctuations and, when necessary, reactivate the  system of registering quoted prices. (3) Where industrial  production materials dictate market supply and demand, the  government should regularly fine tune macroeconomic measures  such as monetary, fiscal and taxation policies, and exercise  macroeconomic coordination as planned or when required.    4. Vigorously develop and expand rural markets.    In developing rural markets, in addition to leading  enterprises to produce products which will sell in rural areas,  the most important objective is to raise the peasants income. On  the one hand, the government should adopt the policy of  protecting and supporting agricultural product prices, but on  the other hand, it needs to continue to encourage and foster  development of rural enterprises and speed up the transfer of  agricultural surplus labor to other pursuits. At the same time,  we should give overall preferential treatment to agricultural  investment.    5. Open up multiple investment channels and lead  citizens to increase savings for various investments, and reduce  demand pressure for hot-selling consumer products on the  market.    At present, the most important step is to create conditions  for citizens to save and invest in housing. The Government  should further open up areas of financial investment so that  citizens can channel their money from consumption into  productive investment. Real estate reform should quickly help  implement the objective of facilitating citizens buying their  homes.</p>

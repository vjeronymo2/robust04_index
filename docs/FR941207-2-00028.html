(WIC) filed a Motion To Place Rates Into Effect accompanied by revised tariff sheets incorporating the new rates as revised to reflect a December 1, 1994 effective date and a revised Annual Charge Adjustment (ACA) rate previously effective October 1, 1994. WIC states that on June 29, 1994, the Commission accepted WIC's rate filing, and suspended its effectiveness until December 1, 1994 (67 FERC &para; 61,390). WIC's motion places those higher rates into effect on December 1, 1994, subject to refund and other conditions, and its revised tariff sheets include those which were suspended and with respect to which no compliance changes were required by the Commission's June 29, 1994 order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> WIC states that copies of this filing have been served on WIC's jurisdictional customers and public bodies, and the filing is available for public inspection at WIC's offices in Colorado Springs, Colorado. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections 385.211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR Section 385.211). All such protests should be filed on or before December 8, 1994.

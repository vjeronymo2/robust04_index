			<p>BFN     [Text] The central bank, the Bank of the Republic of Haiti,  has frozen nearly 15 million Haitian dollars belonging to the  resigning government of Mr. Robert Malval. The funds, which  have been blocked since the arrival on the scene of the  provisional government of attorney Jonassaint, are for social  and humanitarian programs. It should be noted that this money  was provided by the U.S. Agency for International Development  [USAID] and was aimed at financing USAID humanitarian projects  and food and work programs for the impoverished.</p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / International Company News: Digital revises shake-up plan Digital Equipment is not ready to unveil a broad restructuring this month as planned. Instead, the struggling computer company will announce cost reductions as they occur over the coming months. Mr Robert Palmer, president and chief executive, has told senior managers in a memo 'that some work remains to be done, so it is premature to discuss our detailed plans and subsequent actions. We will make announcements when we are ready to do so.' Last month he said that about 20 per cent of the company's workforce, or about 20,000 jobs, had to be cut if the company was to become cost competitive in the computer industry. His statement followed Digital's third-quarter results with heavier-than-expected losses that revealed weaknesses in management systems and a continuing decline in profit margins. Losses widened to Dollars 183m, from Dollars 30m in the same period last year. Revenues for the quarter declined 6 per cent to Dollars 3.26bn. Yesterday, Digital said that the scale of the downsizing reduction plan was unchanged. 'This is a complex process and it will be conducted in an orderly fashion,' the company said. In his letter to senior managers, Mr Palmer said the board of directors 'unanimously supports our direction and progress'. However, the delay in announcing detailed restructuring plans appears likely to increase concern both within the company and among investors about future cuts.</p>

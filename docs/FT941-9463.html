			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Major stonewalls simmering debate on Back to Basics Mr John Major signalled last night a new determination not to allow controversy over domestic policy issues to hijack the media's agenda on his overseas trips. As he arrived in Moscow for talks with President Boris Yeltsin, Mr Major's aides told travelling journalists that the prime minister would not answer questions later today on the controversy engulfing his Back to Basics campaign. As Mr Hartley Booth, the latest Conservative MP to attract unwelcome media attention, stood by a refusal to comment on his resignation, Mr Major's move was seen as a determined effort to avoid a repeat public relations disaster on an overseas visit. Such trips have frequently been dominated by political controversy at home. Downing Street said Back to Basics would continue to figure prominent in ministerial speeches. A senior government official even provided a list of 14 occasions on which Mr Major has made substantial references to the campaign since it was launched at the Conservative party conference in October. The official said there was 'absolutely no question' of dumping Back to Basics. 'The prime minister has made it clear that it carries a moral dimension, but is not a matter of personal sexual morality.' Cabinet ministers rallied to support the prime minister. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, said Back to Basics was 'an approach which, if properly understood, has wide application in the field of law and order, of education and of the economy'. Lord Archer, a former deputy chairman of the Conservative party, told ITN: 'If we have a weakness in our party it is our inability to get over to the country what has been achieved in 15 years and what a disaster it would be to have the Labour party back.' But Downing Street's sensitivity about the future of Back to Basics reflects backbench unease about the wisdom of continuing the campaign in the face of repeated disclosures. Mr Booth, MP for Finchley, made no comment yesterday on his resignation as a minister's political assistant at the weekend following the disclosure of his close friendship with a female Commons researcher. Mr Ron Thurlow, chairman of the local Conservative Association, said Mr Booth had the full support of local officials. However, he said Back to Basics was 'a gimmick' which should be abandoned. 'It's got a bit ridiculous.'</p>

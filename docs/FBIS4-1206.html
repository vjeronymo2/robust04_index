			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Accord on Afrikaner Self-Determination signed by the </F> Freedom Front, the African National Congress, and the South  African Government/National Party; issued by Ministry of  Constitutional Development and Communication 23 April on the  SAPA PR Wire Service]    [Text] Taking note:    of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Act  200 of 1993 as amended; and    Taking note:    of the unsigned memorandum of agreement between the  African National Congress (ANC) and the Afrikaner Volksfront  (AVF) [Afrikaner National Front], dated December 21, 1993; and    Taking note:    of Constitutional Principle XXXIV, dealing with the issue  of self-determination; and    Subsequent to the discussions between the delegations of the  ANC, the AVF, the South African Government and eventually the  Freedom Front (FF)    The parties represented by these delegations record the  following agreement:    1. The parties agree to address, through a process of  negotiations, the idea of Afrikaner self-determination,  including the concept of a volkstaat [homeland].    2. The parties further agree that in the consideration of  these matters, they shall not exclude the possibility of local  and/or regional and other forms of expression of such  self-determination.    3. They agree that their negotiations shall be guided by the  need to be consistent with and shall be governed by the  requirement to pay due consideration to Constitutional Principle  XXXIV, other provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of  South Africa, Act 200 of 1993 as amended, and that the parties  take note of the memorandum of agreement, as referred to above.  (The appendix to this accord contains copies of these documents  perused by the delegations.)    3.1 Such consideration shall therefore include matters such  as:    3.1.1 Substantial proven support for the idea of  self-determination including the concept of a volkstaat;    3.1.2 the principles of democracy, non-racialism and  fundamental rights; and    3.1.3 the promotion of peace and national reconciliation.    4. The parties further agree that in pursuit of 3.1.1 above,  the support for the idea of self-determination in a volkstaat  will be indicated by the electoral support which parties with a  specific mandate to pursue the realisation of a volkstaat, will  gain in the forthcoming election.    4.1 The parties also agree that, to facilitate the  consideration of the idea of a volkstaat after the elections,  such electoral support should be measured not only nationally,  but also by counting the provincial votes at the level of:    4.1.1 the electoral district; and    4.1.2 where ever practical the polling stations as indicated  by the parties to, and agreed to, by the Independent Electoral  Commission.    5. The parties agree that the task of the Volkstaatraad  [Volkstaat Council] shall be to investigate and report to the  constitutional assembly and the commission on the provincial  government on measures which can give effect to the idea of  Afrikaner self-determination, including the concept of the  volkstaat.    6. The parties further agree that the volkstaatraad shall  form such advisory bodies as it may determine.    7. In addition to the issue of self-determination, the  parties also undertake to discuss among themselves and reach  agreement on matters relating to matters affecting stability in  the agricultural sector and the impact of the process of  transition on this sector, and also matters of stability  including the issue of indemnity inasmuch as the matter has not  been resolved.    8. The parties further agree that they will address all  matters of concern to them through negotiations and that this  shall not exclude the possibility of international mediation to  help resolve such matters as may be in dispute and/or difficult  to conclude.    8.1 The parties also agree that paragraph 8.0 shall not be  read to mean that any of the deliberations of the constitutional  assembly are subject to international mediation, unless the  constitutional assembly duly amends the constitution to enable  this to happen.    8.2 the parties also affirm that, where this accord refers  to  the South African Government, it refers to the South African  Government which will rule South Africa until the April  1994-elections.

This schedule and the recognition therein of the right of  the South African people as a whole to self-determination, shall  not be construed as precluding, within the framework of the said  right, constitutional provision for a notion of the right to  self-determination by any community sharing a common cultural  and language heritage, whether in a territorial entity within  the republic or in any other recognised way.    2. The constitution may give expression to any particular  form of self-determination provided there is substantial proven  support within the community concerned for such a form of  self-determination.    3. If a territorial entity referred to in paragraph 1 is  established in terms of this constitution before the new  constitutional text is adopted, the new constitution shall  entrench the continuation of such territorial entity, including  its structures, powers and functions.  <H8>  Chapter 2 </H8> <H5>  Chapter 11a: Volkstaat Council </H5>   Provision for establishment of a Volkstaat Council. 184a.    (1) The establishment of a Volkstaat Council is hereby  authorised.    (2) The council shall consist of 20 members elected by  members of Parliament who support the establishment of a  volkstaat for those who want it.    (3) The council shall conduct its affairs according to rules  made by the council.    Functions of council 184(b)    (1) The council shall serve as a constitutional mechanism to  enable proponents of the idea of a volkstaat to constitutionally  pursue the establishment of such a volkstaat, and shall for this  purpose be competent    (a) To gather, process and make available information with  regard to possible boundaries, powers and functions and  legislative, executive and other structures of such a volkstaat,  its suggested constitutional relationship with government at  national and provincial level, and any other matter directly  relevant to the establishment of such a volkstaat;    (b) To make feasibility and other relevant studies with  regard to the matters referred to in paragraph (a);    (c) To submit representations and recommendations to the  constitutional assembly and the commission on provincial  government with regard to the possible establishment of a  volkstaat and any matter in connection therewith; and    (d) To perform such other functions as may be prescribed by  an act of Parliament.    (2) The procedures to be followed by the council in the  performance of its functions under subsection (1), shall be  prescribed by an act of Parliament.

These discussions have resulted in the following  agreements of understanding:    1.1 Both parties are committed to the development of a  non-racial democracy. They both accept that many Afrikaners also  have a commitment to the ideal of self-determination in a  volkstaat and that this ideal should be addressed expeditiously,  without delaying the current process of transition.    Both parties reject any political suggestions which would  embody racism and failed apartheid policies.    Proceeding from its perception of the balance of political  forces, the AVF has been unambiguous in its rejection of  communism as an acceptable political system.    1.2 Both parties believe that the objectives stated above  are  attainable, and that a suitable political solution can be found  through a process of negotiations. The formulation of this  solution demands commitment founded on a new vision for the  future South Africa, supported by its leadership. Both parties  seek constructive engagement in the constitutional process. This  is a crucial commitment which will help in addressing the  entrenched mistrust and antagonism which exists between the  supporters of the Afrikaner Volksfont and the African National  Congress.    1.3 Both parties recognise the danger of serious conflict  between members of their respective constituencies, and the  destructive impact such conflict would have on the future  development and property of South Africa. Furthermore, both  parties have expressed their concern about the unstable social  and political environment in the country, the unacceptable  levels of political violence in particular regions, and the  levels of crime and general crisis in the maintenance of law and  order. All these matters, including the continuing spate of  murders of farmers in rural areas, must be addressed  collectively as a matter of urgency.    1.4 Though the two parties do not share a common position on  the proposed schedule for the transitional process they have  agreed that a strategic agreement, addressing matters of mutual  concern, ought to be entered into. This will facilitate the  implementation of the transitional process and the conduct of  the elections on 27 April 1994.    2. Therefore, given the above mentioned concerns and  considerations, the following agreements are now registered:    2.1 South Africa should be the home to all its inhabitants  who share a common future, based on peaceful coexistence,  economic interdependence and constitutional governance.    2.2 The two parties are determined to find an acceptable and  sustainable accommodation for all In South africa, bearing in  mind the aspirations of the two parties, their constituencies,  and other political formations in the country.    2.3 Recognising the role both parties can play in restoring  peace and stability, they have agreed on the need to establish  an inclusive security system as determined by the working group.  The purpose of this will be to address all matters of security  and stability. They further agree that similar structures could  be established for agriculture and other relevant groupings.    2.4 They agree that the aspirations of many Afrikaners to  govern themselves in their own territory should be addressed.  Accordingly they agreed that a joint working group be  established for this purpose, bearing in mind the call made by  Dr Mandela, Dr Hartzenberg and General Viljoen for a solution  which entrenches reconciliation, prevents conflict, and  facilitates co-operation among all people. This working group  should complete its task and report back to its principals by 20  January 1994.    The working group should examine, among others, the  following  issues:     -  financial and economic viability of such a region and its  monitory and fiscal relationship to the rest of the country;    -  civil rights of Afrikaners outside the volkstaat;    -  civil rights of non-Afrikaners inside the volkstaat;    -  the nature of the relationship between the volkstaat and  other  local, regional and central government/administrative structures;    -  the timetable and process of establishing such a volkstaat in  the light of the existing transitional process; and    -  the method of determining support on a geographical basis for  the idea of a volkstaat.       Matters of mutual concern should be discussed and addressed  in detail for the purpose of formulating recommendations and  solutions.    2.5 The parties agreed, as part of this process, to send a  joint delegation to Switzerland and Belgium to study how the  political systems of these two countries work, and to determine  whether aspects of these systems may be helpful in the  resolution of the South African conflict.    2.6 The AVF, having accepted the ANC's good faith, has  undertaken to actively discourage any action calculated to  destabilise the transitional process. The culmination of this  strategic agreement into a final settlement before the end of  January 1994 will enable the AVF and its affiliates to consider  participation in the transitional structures and process, as  well as in the elections as scheduled to be held on 17 April  1994.    2.7 The ANC, having accepted the bona fides of the AVF,  gives  its commitment to promote agreements entered into with the AVF,  including such constitutional and legislative agreements which  may be required for their implementation.    2.8 Should any party to this agreement at any stage consider  the whole or the specifics of the agreement to have been  violated, an attempt at mutual conciliation will be made through  the facilitators of the process before any unilateral action is  taken.    2.9 It was decided that a meeting at leadership level will  be  convened as soon as possible with the view to:     -  ratification of this agreement;    -  deciding on the time frame for the above proposed actions,  and  on a way of achieving legitimacy;    -  mandating and monitoring the task of the proposed working  committee;    -  public release of the strategic agreement; and    -  deciding on ways of marketing these agreements, and publicly  confirming all undertakings.  <H8>  Chapter 4 </H8> <H5>  Guidelines for the deliberations of the Volkstaat Council </H5>   The following guidelines for the deliberations of the  Volkstaat Council were discussed by the delegations:  self-determination:    The investigation of the different modes of  self-determination and the concept of a volkstaat. This  investigation will be reported to the constitutional assembly  and the Commission on Provincial Government, including manners  in which effect can be given to the different modes of  self-determination.    The accommodation of demands for self-determination on a  provincial basis, through sub-regional structures within a  province as now sanctioned by the amendments to Section 160(3)  of the constitution, should also be explored.    Proposals for self-determination of local communities  through  community councils or structures modelled along the lines of  similar structures and processes in other parts of the world  could be considered. Citizenship:    Any form of derived citizenship intended for persons  residing  in a possible volkstaat will not be racially based and shall be  compatible with internationally accepted norms. Advisory bodies:    A national advisory body attached to the Volkstaat Council  and constituted by twenty five representatives elected by local  communities in the different provinces, supporting the ideal of  self-determination in a volkstaat, could be established. In the  event of the realisation of a concept of the volkstaat, this  body will represent the respective communities within the  volksraad of such a volkstaat.  <H8>  Chapter 5 </H8>   Unmandated defining statement on the principle of  self-determination with reference to the central concept of  self-determination used in the Memorandum of Agreements  Constitutional Principle XXXIV and the accord.    The delegations at this stage suffice with the following  defining statement, although unmandated:    1. The concept shall in no way be construed as to give  support to those fatal racist ideologies of the Twentieth  Century that was based on chauvinistic excessive escalation of  identities or even ethnocentrism which bred discrimination,  racism and prejudices which on their part brought war, misery  and death to many.    Legitimate self-determination instead should be consonant  with and indeed flows from the concept of fundamental rights and  the constitutional state.    2. The concept of self-determination we therefore could  endorse is the universally accepted one that has been expressed  in the Charter of the United Nations which serves the purpose of  peaceful co-operation between peoples on the basis of mutual  respect and recognition of fundamental freedom and basic human  rights for all.    3. The legitimate concept of self-determination to us  relates  to the expressed desire of a substantial community or a people,  who has attained through the prolonged experience of a common  history, language, culture and often also of land, a sense of  cohesion and belonging that universally constitutes the sense of  nationhood.    The concept therefore relates to the need expressed by such  a  community or people to determine its own destiny and to  excercise the right to decide policy and practise with regard to  political, constitutional, economic, social, religious and  educational matters in a way that is consistent with the  peculiar expectations and value systems of such people.    4. We have assumed that the desire for the exercise of  self-determination with such a people must be a popular demand  beyond reasonable doubt, a fact which may require substantial  proven support through an agreed democratic process.    5. Self-determination within a complex pluralistic society  based on inclusive democracy has to be negotiated and  implemented with due regard to the rights of other citizens  sharing the same territory on a permanent basis. Wider  democratic processes must also be recognised.    A balance should be negotiated between the desire of such a  people for self-determination and the ideal of peaceful  wellbeing of the larger whole of society.    Self-determination will serve the purpose of building the  state and not cause the dislocation of the state. It should  facilitate peace and not cause conflict.    6. At the same time self-determination for a people  constituting a minority should be considered with due regard to  and in full recognition of the legitimate expressed expectations  of such a people so as to avoid a type of majority domination  that may in itself cause conflict or even the disintegration of  the state.    7. In our considerations we have recognised various modes of  self-determination. It may involve the negotiation of a  territorial entity which may have various degrees of autonomy.  This may be augmented by constitutional devices securing various  degrees of autonomy over the specific affairs of that community  at one or more of the levels of government. We have agreed that  the principle of self-determination could be negotiated and  applied to suit the demands of each unique situation.    8. The introduction of any form of self-determination  through  negotiations will need to be accompanied by extensive public  information and a raised level of trust.</p>

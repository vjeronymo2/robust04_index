			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 23 TASS -- The Russian State Duma  voted on Wednesday to declare amnesty to organisers of two  hard-line coups and a demonstration all which resulted in  bloodshed in Moscow.    Lawmakers voted 253-67 for the resolution on amnesty which  comes into effect at the moment of publication and is to be  implemented in six months.    The amnesty covers, besides businessmen convicted in Soviet  years, also organisers of the 1991 abortive Soviet coup, the  leaders of hard-line opposition revolt last October in Moscow,  as well as organisers of the hard-line demonstration last May  which clashed with police. The leaders in question include  former Soviet top officials now facing trial, arrested former  parliament chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov and former Vice-President  Aleksandr Rutskoy, as well as diehard opposition members Viktor  Anpilov, Ilya Konstantinov and others.    "This is the beginning of a civil war in Russia", Sergey  Yushchenkov, chairman of the Duma Committee on Defence commented.    He accused Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin of promoting such a vote  by ignoring many lawmakers who wanted to speak against it.    Rybkin told the Duma before the vote that the amnesty was  necessary to "escape from suspicion, gloating expectations of  certain changes and possible settling of accounts".    "We are destined to accord to get out of the crisis", he  said.    "The Duma is firmly convinced that Russia needs civic peace,  accord and construction to get out of the crisis. Russians  await from us such an accord and interaction between the  president, the Federation Council, the State Duma and the  Constitutional Court", he added.</p>

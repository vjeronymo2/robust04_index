			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are no new information collection requirements in this ANPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Questions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The RSPA is issuing this ANPRM to solicit data from the public through a series of questions as the means of conducting the survey mandated in the 1992 Act. The response from the public to these questions will aid in developing proposals on what circumstances and criteria operators must install EFRDs and other equipment to limit product release from hazardous liquid pipelines. The failures discussed above suggest that releases can be reduced when EFRDs and well-designed leak detection systems are installed on hazardous liquid pipelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assessing the data received from the questions in the ANPRM should accelerate the rulemaking process required by the 1992 Act. The data gathered by this ANPRM, the findings from earlier reports on the subject of EFRDs, including the Department's March 1991 EFRD study, and the work accomplished so far in the SCADA contract with the VNTSC could form the basis for any notice of proposed rulemaking concerning the proposed placement of EFRDs and criteria for leak detection systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The RSPA is considering a systems approach to reducing spills from hazardous liquid pipelines. The system involved includes equipment, personnel, software and procedures to accomplish three tasks: (1) Detect that a failure and resultant spill has occurred; (2) Identify the location of the spill; and (3) Shut the pipeline down in order to reduce the amount of the spill. The first two tasks involve computerized leak detection systems, while the third task involves the installation of EFRDs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many of the following questions are directed to the operators of hazardous liquid pipelines. They relate to pipeline system operational data in addition to the physical location of pipeline facilities in relation to geographical and topographical features which can only be obtained from pipeline operators. However, the RSPA solicits comments to questions which do not involve data on a particular hazardous liquid pipeline from other members of the public including State agencies, trade associations, and environmental organizations, both private and public. The RSPA believes that State pipeline safety agencies can contribute significantly to this rulemaking because of the States' unique experience with regulating intrastate hazardous liquid pipelines and as the Department's agent on interstate hazardous liquid pipelines. Questions 18 and 19 are directed to the nonregulated public. These commenters are requested also to suggest additional questions, including clarification questions, which may emerge from reviewing this ANPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To aid in analysis of the responses, commenters are requested to respond using the same numbering system which is used in this ANPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> SCADA-based Leak Detection System Sensitivity and Reliability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The RSPA needs data on which to base decisions on what should be proposed for SCADA-based leak detection systems. The RSPA is starting from the premise that most if not all hazardous liquid pipeline operators have installed a SCADA system which is used for the everyday efficient operation of the pipeline. The SCADA study by the VNTSC has, so far, found this to be true. (Commenters are requested to indicate if this premise is true.) The RSPA must decide whether to propose: (1) A specific type of leak detection system; (2) whether to propose requiring certain criteria which would embody the attributes of all of the presently recognized computerized leak detection systems; (3) a combination of (1) and (2); or (4) some other leak detection system requirement which at present is unknown to the RSPA but which may emerge from comments to this ANPRM.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The questions are intended to obtain responses which relate to operational data that a hazardous liquid operator has concerning the SCADA-based leak detection system installed on its pipeline system including the sensitivity and reliability of that system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Questions 1 through 6 primarily relate to the experience on a segment of the operator's hazardous liquid pipeline system which is covered by a SCADA-based leak detection system. If the operator has segments of its hazardous liquid pipeline system covered by more than one SCADA-based leak detection system, please submit responses to the series of questions 1 through 6 for each segment of the covered pipeline system. For instance, a SCADA-based leak detection system may be installed on a 400 mile segment of an interstate pipeline in Texas and another SCADA-based leak detection system on a 200 mile segment in Virginia. The RSPA requests a separate set of responses for each segment, not aggregate responses for all of the SCADA-based leak detection systems for all parts of the operator's pipeline system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several topics will be addressed in the set of questions below. These are: (1) The method(s) of leak detection in use on the segment described in the data submission; (2) leak detection alarms which occur at the hazardous liquid pipeline systems operating center; (3) the leak detection and SCADA system availability; and (4) the actual performance of leak detection systems in identifying and locating leaks on an operational hazardous liquid pipeline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the operator does not presently have this data, we encourage the operator to gather the data for at least one month and then submit it to the RSPA. System alarms history should be provided to the RSPA as a log and may be submitted either as a computer printout or on a diskette using standard ASCII format as long as the segment identifying information is clearly noted on the data. Experimental (or simulation-based) data may be provided as well as operational data which only reflect actual operational experience.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

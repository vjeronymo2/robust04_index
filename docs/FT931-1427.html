			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: Argentaria issues details of sell-off ARGENTARIA, the state-owned Spanish banking corporation, yesterday said that 60 per cent of the shares in the group which are to be privatised will be sold to domestic buyers. Mr Francisco Luzon, the group's chairman, said this tranche would come from a total of between 15 and 25 per cent of the capital to be sold off. No details on pricing were given, but the offering could raise up to Pta150bn (Dollars 1.29bn). Argentaria's consolidated book value on December 31 1991 was Pta528bn, and its current market capitalisation is conservatively estimated at Pta600bn. Mr Luzon said Spanish retail investors would receive preferential treatment in the offering and be able to acquire Argentaria shares for a minimum outlay of Pta25,000 (Dollars 215) and a maximum one of Pta8m. He said he would like to place 20 per cent of the banking group but would raise the offering to 25 per cent, the maximum authorised by the government, if domestic demand proved strong enough. 'I want 200,000 shareholders,' he said. The weighting towards the retail domestic market follows the pattern established by the state-controlled energy group Repsol.</p>

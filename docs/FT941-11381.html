			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Observer: Invesco veritas The CV can sometimes be an inglorious document, puffing this and concealing that. The one released to announce that Sir John Morgan is joining the European regional board of Invesco, the fund management group, is strangely silent on two points. Who's Who shows that Sir John was managing director (international relations) of Maxwell Communications Corporation in 1989-90, and also on the board of The European, the late Robert Maxwell's most ambitious newspaper venture. But perhaps Invesco is trying to learn from its mistakes; last year it was fined a record Pounds 750,000 by Imro, the investment management regulator - for a range of regulatory breaches in connection with the Maxwell affair.</p>

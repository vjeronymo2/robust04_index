			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEMO: SCREEN WRITING  </P> <P> Ever wonder how long it takes a typist to type up a screenplay?  </P> <P> Those in the business say it requires at least 10 hours to professionally type  a 100-page screenplay. It takes at least another three hours to proof the  script. And typing screenplays that are handwritten can take at least twice as  long, experts say.  </P> <P> Another Hollywood industry that relies on screenwriters -- and which  screenwriters depend upon heavily -- is the agency business.  </P> <P> Agents try to make contacts with studio executives who may be interested in  screenplays. The standard fee for agents: 10% of the selling price of the  script.  </P> <P> How much should a screenwriter pay for computer equipment?  </P> <P> That depends, of course, on the writer -- and the store. But the Writer's  Computer Store in West Los Angeles sells complete hardware and software  packages for $1,800 to $6,000, said co-owner Gabriele Zinke. "After $6,000,"  said Zinke, "I'd really have to think hard to figure out anything else to add  on." BRUCE HOROVITZ  </P></p>

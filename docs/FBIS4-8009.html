			<p>BFN     [Text] Trebinje, 7 April (TANJUG) -- Srpska republic  President Radovan Karadzic said in Trebinje today that he was  increasingly optimistic and hopeful of a speedy and peaceful  solution to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Karadzic bases his modest optimism on the fact that, as he  said, the orientation toward peace has prevailed in the world  and also because of the superiority of the Srpska army.    Karadzic added that the Muslim side would eventually have to  sit at the negotiating table because it cannot achieve anything  on the battlefield.    The international community is tired of the war and is  afraid  of a Balkan war, Karadzic said addressing journalists.    In connection with the situation in Gorazde, Karadzic said  that the Serb side had earlier warned of the planned Muslim  spring offensive, saying that it would respond with all  available forces.    If the Muslims do not stop attacking, we will launch a  counteroffensive and then let the Security Council save them,  Karadzic said in Trebinje where he inaugurated the festival of  Ducic's Evenings of Poetry. He was presented the festival's  award.</p>

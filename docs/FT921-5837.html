			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / US Money and Credit: Jobs news still the dominant factor THE NEXT five days will test the strength of the US Treasury market's recent rally. After a difficult February, bond investors enjoyed a good run over the second half of last week on the heels of bad consumer confidence data and an unexpected revival in retail demand for new Treasury stock. From Tuesday to Friday, the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond fell from more than 8 per cent to below 7.8 per cent. The 20 basis-point decline was welcome, not least for those who feared higher market rates would stifle the modest revival in the housing economy since the beginning of the year. Whether the more upbeat mood of the market can hold this week, however, is another matter. As is almost always the case, employment news holds the key, in the shape of this Friday's jobs report for February. The state of the labour market remains a dominant influence on economic trends. The steady rise in the number out of work, and concern about personal job prospects, has spooked consumers, so much so that spending and confidence have remained stuck at worryingly low levels, despite the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate cuts. This is why Friday's employment report is so important. Most market estimates call for little change in payroll numbers and a slight rise in the unemployment rate, probably from 7.1 per cent to 7.2 per cent. The weekly jobless claims reports for February so far have been up and down, which suggests the overall number out of work may have held steady during the month. A bad set of figures, however, such as a big fall in civilian payrolls and/or a rise in the jobless rate of more than 0.1 percentage point, could persuade the Fed to cut interest rates again, which would be good news for bonds, at least in the short-term. While no one can be sure how the employment report will fall, there is one certain factor working in the market's favour over the coming weeks: supply. The next auction of medium and long-term securities is not due until mid-April, which gives the market six weeks' breathing space to construct a decent rally. The influence of supply on recent market movements has been substantial. Bond prices fell sharply during the first three weeks of February because dealers had difficulty offloading billions of dollars of new Treasury debt. Not only did the market suffer from the continued absence of Japanese investors, but until the middle of last week (when the five-year note auction went well) domestic retail investors were also staying away from new Treasury issues. Their caution was partly the result of uncertainty about the outlook for the economy - recent data has provided an inconsistent guide to the future - and partly because of concern the Fed and the government will over-stimulate the economy and bring back inflation. Investors fear over-stimulation on two fronts. They worry that election-year pressure will produce an over-aggressive tax-cutting package that inflates the budget deficit and loads extra supply on the market. This, of course, assumes President George Bush and Congress can come to an agreement over where to cut taxes and how to pay for it. Some bond investors are also worried the Fed, scared by the depressed state of consumer confidence and the continued deterioration of the labour market, will overdo the interest rate cuts, accelerating the growth of money and eventually pushing up inflation. Judging whether the Fed will cut rates again proving difficult, thanks mostly to Fed chairman Mr Alan Greenspan's muddled Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to Congress. Although he was upbeat about the economic outlook, he also described last Tuesday's dreadful consumer confidence figures as 'quite disturbing', and later left the impression that rates would come down again if the employment numbers this week were bad. Mr Greenspan's apparent willingness to ease again has drawn its fair share of criticism. The inflation hawks' position was perhaps best summed up last week by a comment from Ms Amanda Grantham-Hill, US economist with Paribas Capital Markets in London, who said a rate cut would do little to enhance the Fed's credibility. She continued, in stinging style: 'Although guaranteeing a second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve, his recent performance suggests Mr Greenspan wouldn't be offered a second interview at the Bundesbank.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     US MONEY MARKET RATES (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Last   1 week   4 wks   12-month   12-month                           Friday   ago     ago       High       Low Fed Funds (weekly average)  4.19   3.75   3.62      11.00      2.00 Three-month Treasury bills  4.02   4.02   3.82       8.29      3.76 Six-month Treasury bills    4.12   4.18   3.89       7.70      3.89 Three-month prime CDs       4.18   4.25   4.02       7.17      4.01 30-day Commercial Paper     4.15   4.20   3.90       7.12      3.90 90-day Commercial Paper     4.15   4.20   4.00       7.02      3.92  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   US BOND PRICES AND YIELDS (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Last   Change            1 week   4 wk.

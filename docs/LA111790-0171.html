			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> L.A. AND O.C. OFFICIALS CLASH OVER CONTROL OF COMMUTER RAIL SYSTEM;  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION: AT ISSUE IS WHETHER A REGIONAL, JOINT-POWERS AGENCY SHOULD  OPERATE THE PROPOSED 300-MILE NETWORK OR EACH CORRIDOR SHOULD BE RUN  SEPARATELY.  </P> <P> A clash erupted Friday over who should control the commuter rail system planned  for Southern California beginning in 1992, with a representative of the Los  Angeles County Transportation Commission objecting to a regional agency and the  chairman of the Orange County Transportation Commission supporting one.  </P> <P> Mike Lewis, an alternate for County Supervisor Pete Schabarum on the Los  Angeles commission, said he opposes any "SCAG for commuter rail," a reference  to the Southern California Assn. of Governments.  </P> <P> Lewis told a meeting of transportation officials from four Southland counties,  who gathered to consider how the commuter rail system will be run, that he  fears an administrative morass in which, he contended, San Bernardino commuters  finding that something was wrong would have to call Orange County for help.  </P> <P> But Dana Reed, the Orange County commission chairman, said he disagreed and  hopes that a joint-powers agency will be created as early as next month by Los  Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties to operate the proposed  300-mile system.  </P> <P> "We're talking about 100 or so trains a day," Reed said. "We are going to have  to switch equipment between San Bernardino and Orange, if necessary, or Ventura  and Orange. We're going to have to share a common maintenance facility. We  certainly don't need four or five operating agencies."  </P> <P> "Who answers the phone? That's what I want to know," Lewis rejoined.  </P> <P> "We need to have common authority," Reed answered. "One of the problems we have  in Southern California now is so many agencies running things like the buses.  If we set up five separate agencies to run commuter rail, it won't work."  </P> <P> "There's no proof there is an advantage in having a single operator," Lewis  argued. He said that each proposed corridor, such as Los Angeles-San  Bernardino, should be controlled separately.  </P> <P> Afterward, a member of the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission who was  also present, Jacki Bacharach, a Rancho Palos Verdes city councilwoman, said  that despite Lewis' statements at the meeting, the Los Angeles commission has,  as yet, taken no position on who should control the commuter rail system.  </P> <P> "My personal opinion is we are on the brink of an opportunity to establish a  unified network," she said.  </P> <P> If a joint-powers agency is established, Ventura County is unlikely to be part  of it, officials at the meeting said, since that county has no available  transit funds to contribute to the system, even though there are plans for  trains to Moorpark and possibly Oxnard.  </P> <P> Reed said that if a joint-powers agency is formed, there must first be an  agreement on representation. If it is by population, he said, Los Angeles  County would have majority control, which might not be acceptable to the other  counties. Perhaps, he said, representation could be allocated on the basis of  track mileage or another standard.  </P> <P> Among the commuter links proposed as part of the system, besides those to  Ventura County, are lines radiating from Los Angeles to Santa Clarita, points  in Orange County, San Bernardino and Riverside. There would also be service  between San Bernardino and Riverside and Orange County.  </P> <P> Participants in Friday's meeting also heard a cautiously optimistic report on  the status of negotiations to buy public control of at least 177 miles of Santa  Fe right of way and rights to run trains on another 70 miles.  </P></p>

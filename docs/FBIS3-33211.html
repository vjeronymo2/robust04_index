			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "As of Today" column] </F>   [Text] There is a constant in Panamanian-U.S. relations,  perhaps as a result of the superficial visits to which U.S.  congressmen are so addicted and the prejudices that abound in  the State Department, the Pentagon, the CIA, the DEA, and all  the apparently countless agencies that gather, process, and  analyze information on almost anything imaginable.    Another reason for this could be the intervention of  "experts," who frequently visit our country for two or three  days during which they attend dinners, receptions, cocktail  parties, and then feel they have the authority to talk about the  past, understand the present, and anticipate the future of the  entire region. Despite all their efforts, they have accomplished  very little.    Panama is not what they imagined under the Torrijos, Flores,  Paredes, or Noriega dictatorships. It is not what is conceived  through the talent of one limited bureaucrat or another. There  are certainly many limitations in our country: the burden of  public debt is unbearable, the administration of justice is not  perfect, the Legislative Assembly is far from being truly  representative, the differences within the government coalition  have made it difficult to effectively conduct public  administration, and the political class is not precisely  knowledgeable.    Nevertheless, in Panama today, human rights are respected,  the economy is developing, unemployment has decreased, and  public security has improved. There is a democratic government  system and significant progress has been made in the fight  against drug trafficking, gunrunning, and our country is no  longer a haven for guerrillas and all kinds of criminals. Please  understand this!</p>

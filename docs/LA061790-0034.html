			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HANDYMAN Q &amp; A: PULL-CORD BRUSH WILL SCRUB CREOSOTE AWAY  </P> <P> QUESTION: When I was installing a wood stove in my fireplace, I discovered the  smoke chamber above the damper was covered with creosote.  </P> <P> The damper opening is too small to reach up into this space from below. A  chimney cleaning brush pushed down from above will not reach the area. Do you  have any suggestions?  </P> <P> ANSWER: If you can't remove the damper plate (almost all damper plates can be  removed or pushed aside once the handle is removed), then do the job with a  "pull-cord chimney brush," which has a cord attached at its top and bottom.  </P> <P> One person stands on the roof and, while holding one end of the cord, drops the  brush down to a person by the fireplace hearth.  </P> <P> Make sure to drop enough cord down so the brush is positioned in the smoke  chamber. Then, alternately pull from the top and bottom to brush away the  creosote.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Large Wall Crack Keeps Reappearing  </P> <P> Q: I've repainted the plaster walls of my living room several times, filling a  large crack that starts at the corner of a finished opening with joint  compound. Shortly after each paint job, the crack reappears. How can I repair  it permanently?  </P> <P> A: The position of that crack is a sign that the framing is inadequate. The  best solution would be to beef up the header or top plate of the bearing wall  -- the sooner the better.  </P> <P> If you're not prepared for such an extensive repair presently, chip out all  loose plaster and clean the crack out thoroughly. Lay an ample bed of compound  about 3 inches wide over the crack.  </P> <P> Place wallboard tape down with a 4-inch taping knife, squeezing out the excess  compound and making sure there are no air bubbles underneath the tape. When the  compound dries (in a day or so), apply a second coat over the tape, feathering  the edges flush with the wall surface.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fix Plasterboard Hole With 1-by-2s, Drywall  </P> <P> Q: We have a rather large plaster hole, about 4-by-4 inches in the plasterboard  wall of our home. I want to repair it before repainting. Can I do it without  replacing the entire panel?  </P> <P> A: Cut a couple of 1-by-2x, about 6 inches long. Insert them through the hole  and position them to create a fastening cleat against the back of the existing  plasterboard. Use 1 1/4-inch drywall screws applied to the face of the  plasterboard to mount the 1-by-2s parallel on opposite sides of the hole,  leaving a three-quarter-inch-wide flat showing for each. then, cut a piece of  drywall to fill the hole. Fasten it to the 1-by-2s with drywall screws. Tape  and compound the seams to conceal the patch.  </P></p>

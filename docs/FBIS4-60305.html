			<p>BFN     [Text] The Yemeni Revolutionary Democratic Party [RDP] has  condemned al-Bid's secession declaration. The party said in a  statement that it is considered a blatant violation of the  Constitution of our Republic of Yemen and the legitimacy  announced on 27 April 1993. The statement notes the RDP's  rejection of all calls for secession and its support for and  call on the forces of constitutional legitimacy not to be  lenient with this rancorous separatist clique. The party said  that its support for the forces of constitutional legitimacy  stems from the party's adherence to Yemeni unity, which is  considered the result of the efforts and struggle of all honest  Yemeni strugglers. The party stressed that its stand is firm  and clear in terms of safeguarding the national constants,  particularly unity, democracy, and the achievements of the 16  September and 24 October revolutions.    The RDP's statement urges brothers and friends to stand at  the side of the legitimate leadership to preserve these  achievements, particularly Yemeni unity. The statement notes  that al-Bid's criminal attempts to destroy Aden and some  southern and eastern governorates are a continuation of the  destruction inflicted on brave Aden in the January events  [reference to 13 January 1986] to satisfy his destructive whims  and those of his clique.    The statement urges all national and political forces and  our  masses to stand at the side of constitutional legitimacy and its  leadership and to render all support for this leadership.    This was issued by the Revolutionary Democratic Party.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Smuggled Russian diamonds stoke upset in market DIAMOND SMUGGLING from Russia is adding to the turmoil in the market for the precious stone, De Beers admitted yesterday, but the group, which controls 80 per cent of world trade in rough (uncut) diamonds, said it had no clear idea of the extent of the leakage. Mr Gary Ralfe, the De Beers director responsible for liaison with the Russians, said it was impossible to tell how many diamonds were being smuggled from the former Soviet Union. He believed the smuggling was taking place without the sanction of the government authorities and that the Russian problem was nothing compared with the illicit flood of diamonds out of Angola where an estimated Dollars 1m worth a day are being smuggled to Antwerp. He said he understood some rough gems were being smuggled out by joint ventures which only had the right to export polished stones. Mr Ralfe said he could not disclose official figures for Russian diamond output but denied one suggestion that production had fallen from 11m to 4m carats. 'We sell well in excess of 4m carats a year.' It also became clear yesterday De Beers faces competition from Japan in Yakutia, where 99 per cent of Russian diamonds are mined and where it hopes to help set up a cutting centre. In any case, the South African group is not confident of its grip on the Russian diamonds business and therefore wants to reconfirm its existing five-year contract which gives it a virtual monopoly of Russia's rough diamond exports. De Beers concluded an agreement in 1990 which gives its Central Selling Organisation exclusive rights to sell Russian rough diamonds exports until 1995. It advanced a Dollars 1bn loan to the former Soviet Union against stockpiled diamonds which were moved to London. Though Russia has continued to abide by the terms of the deal the agreement has often been called into question. Mr Nicky Oppenheimer, De Beers deputy chairman, said: 'We hope that uncertainty in the diamond market will be ended by a pronouncement of the diamond commission which should show that CSO is Russia's best opportunity.'</p>

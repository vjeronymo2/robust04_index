			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA;  </P> <P> NEIGHBORING CITIES VETO PARK RESTAURANT  </P> <P> Opposition from the Fullerton and Placentia city councils has virtually killed  plans to build a restaurant in Tri City Park that had the support of the city  of Brea.  </P> <P> The 40-acre park, which is actually within the city of Placentia, is managed by  the three cities. A proposal such as one to develop a restaurant must be  supported by at least two of the cities.  </P> <P> Brea Councilman Wayne Wedin said the dissenting cities are missing out on a  rare opportunity to get the land for the restaurant.  </P> <P> The park is supported through federal funds, and commercial development of any  portion within its boundaries is allowed only when an equal amount of land can  be added to the park.  </P> <P> Unocal, which owns the Imperial Golf Course adjacent to Tri City Park, plans to  develop its property into a residential neighborhood. Wedin said he is  confident that Unocal, which must receive approval for the development from  both Brea and Fullerton, would agree to deed to the park authority the two  acres required by federal guidelines.  </P> <P> Because there is no other adjacent property that would be suitable for park  use, the Unocal property represents the only opportunity for fulfilling the  federal requirement, he said.  </P> <P> "All Brea asked was, 'Should we look into this opportunity?' " Wedin said.  </P> <P> Fullerton Councilwoman Molly McClanahan, who also serves on the Tri City Park  Authority, said the authority put out an invitation for restaurant proposals in  1987 but received no response.  </P> <P> "It was worth exploring once and we did," she said.  </P> <P> McClanahan said Fullerton was also concerned that asking Unocal to donate land  might jeopardize negotiations between Fullerton and Unocal on development of  the golf course property.  </P> <P> The concept of a restaurant at Tri City Park is an old one. An artist's  rendering of the master plan shows a red circle designating a future restaurant  site in the park's northeast corner.  </P> <P> Wedin was Brea's city manager when the restaurant was included in the master  plan about 10 years ago. At that time, all three cities supported the idea of a  commercial activity consistent with the park that would generate income for  park maintainance.  </P> <P> What was envisioned for the site was a "family-oriented supper house"  overlooking the lake in the center of the park. The site is now a grassy area  that receives little use, Wedin said.  </P> <P> Wedin, who also works as an assets management consultant for various public  agencies, said commercial use of public property is becoming a popular way for  cities to raise money without taxing its residents.

			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CBS' STRINGER DEFENDS RE-ENACTMENTS, PLANS A FIX ON 'SAJAK'  </P> <P> CBS Broadcast Group president Howard Stringer, speaking at a news conference in  Universal City on Sunday, defended the networks' use of re-creations on Connie  Chung's prime-time news program. He said that audiences can recognize the  difference between "hard news" stories and re-enactments of events used  responsibly in public affairs programs such as Chung's.  </P> <P> "We didn't set out to 'out-tabloid' anybody," he said.  </P> <P> Stringer also said the network is hard at work fixing its faltering Johnny  Carson competitor, "The Pat Sajak Show," and defended himself and CBS president  Laurence A. Tisch for taking part in creative decision-making for the  prime-time schedule.  </P> <P> Stringer said that "The Pat Sajak Show," rumored to be headed for cancellation,  would bring Sajak out from behind the desk in attempts to inject some new  energy. "We're not going to stay 'pat,' if you'll pardon the expression," he  said.  </P> <P> Shortly after Jeff Sagansky's hiring as president of CBS Entertainment,  Stringer denied rumors that Sagansky had been reluctant to take the job because  of possible creative interference from himself and Tisch and said Sagansky  would have free rein to do his work. But, Sunday, Stringer said that the issue  of creative control was not part of the negotiations and that Sagansky's hiring  was delayed only by difficulties terminating Sagansky's Tri-Star contract.  </P> <P> "I run the company, and Tisch runs the network -- it's a collaboration. . . .  I've got every right to spend time out here (in Hollywood) and make the  collaboration work for the network," Stringer said. DIANE HAITHMAN  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- A government advisory panel  asked the Finance Ministry on Tuesday [31 May] to compile  additional estimates on planned tax reform, the panel head said.    Kan Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission, an advisory forum  to the prime minister, also stressed again that the ministry's  estimates are just "mechanical calculations" for the panel to  scrap and paste the conditions for its own models of tax reform,  including permanent tax cuts and a consumption tax hike.    But panel members were inclined to accept the 10-year  maturity presented by the ministry in its estimates last Friday  for stopgap bonds slated to be floated to fund the planned  three-year time lag between tax cuts and hikes, Kato told a news  conference after a panel meeting.    "There are arguments the longest maturity (stipulated in  law)  is 60 years, but many members described the 10-year redemption  as a responsible stance for the financial authorities," he said.    Kato said the ministry agreed to compile estimates for a tax  hike of 4 percent to 6 percent at the next meeting, but he noted  the 4-6 percent tax hikes do not comply with requests made to  the panel by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata.    Hata's requests called for a net revenue increase through  tax  reform to fund an expected heavier burden on social welfare  because of Japan's aging society.    The ministry report, submitted last Friday upon request to  the panel and the ruling parties, estimates net revenues in  fiscal 2000 after the 6.2 trillion yen in tax cuts are extended  and the current 3 percent consumption tax is raised to 7 percent  to 10 percent in April 1997.    But the ministry faced criticism over the estimates, which  failed to include a tax hike to below 7 percent, a "natural" tax  revenue increase, and possible effects from fiscal and  administrative overhauls.    It also met criticism by setting conditions of redeeming  stopgap bonds in 10 years and financing the expected increase in  welfare spending entirely with the tax hike. The stopgap bonds  are to fund the three-year time lag between tax cuts and the  hike.    Kato said the panel also discussed the possibility of  including estimates for boosting public works spending,  squeezing the government burden on welfare spending, including a  "natural" tax revenue increase and the effects of fiscal and  administrative reforms.    But the panel found too many uncertainties to decide on  anything yet, he said.    On administrative reform, Kato said he will meet Hata on  Friday to confirm the government's policy.    Meanwhile, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii said at an  earlier  news conference that the estimates had no "policy implications"  by the ministry, particularly in guiding decisions on a tax hike  to 7 percent at least.    Fujii said the estimates omitted all items that require  policy decisions.    The panel chairman said the Friday meeting also covered the  issue of regional tax revenue sources with members agreeing on  the need for independent taxes by local governments.    But with the panel citing technical problems in adopting  regional consumption, Kato said some "political decision" is  necessary.    Under the current consumption tax system, the central  government levies the entire 3 percent tax and distributes 39.2  percent of the revenue to local governments.    The Ministry of Home Affairs submitted to the panel and the  ruling parties its revenue estimates for local governments,  featuring a revenue deficit of 5.4 trillion yen to 12.5 trillion  yen in fiscal 2000 when funding heavier welfare spending under  the current tax system.    The same estimates compiled by the Finance Ministry last  Tuesday for the central government showed a deficit of 8.9  trillion yen to 12.7 trillion yen.    The estimates do not include the planned tax reform.</p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Election 1992: Tabloids suffer pollster's droop - Media Watch THE IDEAL Home Exhibition. What a piquant setting for a tiff between the Tory party and the Daily Mail, sponsor of this very English festival of household gadgets and aids to better living. Mr Major arrived at the exhibition on Thursday to find that he was not, as he supposed, to be welcomed by Sir David English, editor of the normally loyal Mail. Party officials anxiously recalled Sir David's stern leading article of the previous Saturday, in which he warned the Conservatives they would deserve to lose if they did not 'raise their game'. Thus has the matchless barometer of the Tory tabloids lodged at stormy for most of the week. Central Office's leak of the week was a dull economic tract written for Labour two years ago by an Oxford don. The Mail, putting aside hurt feelings, gave the story 'exclusive' front page treatment. When Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, tried to push the story along the next day, the assembled reporters, I am sorry to report, laughed. Then their news editors consigned the story to oblivion. Indeed, the tabloids have shown distinct signs of pollster's droop this week. Of the 41 editions published in the last seven days, only 15 made politics the day's main story. The distractions have been royalty - more on Fergie, then the death of Princess Di's father - and would-be aristocracy; 'Lady' Rosemary Aberdour, who diverted Pounds 3m of her employer's money towards maintaining her fantasy life. This unaccustomed uncertainty of tone in the Tory papers refects the muddle which has so far characterised Mr Major's campaign. Somehow even the Sun's offerings this week - revelations about the residences of Mr Jack Straw, Labour's Education spokesman, and the claim that Labour's Harriet Harman takes her children swimming at Dulwich College  -have lacked conviction. Meanwhile, the Mail's Anne Leslie was reduced to likening Mr Kinnock to Mrs Imelda Marcos and Mr Paul Johnson in the Sunday Telegraph concluded a piece entitled 'Labour: the party that hates England' with the thought that under a Labour government 'real English culture - the culture of Chaucer and Dickens and Turner and Elgar - will have to go underground for the duration, with the risk that it might never re-emerge'. Alas, on the same page, Sir Peregrine Worsthorne, former editor of the newspaper, opined that beneath Labour's surface lay 'its Ernest Bevin English patriotism, its honest-to-God Englishness'. In a week when Mr Kinnock waltzed through three big TV interviews, these are confusing times for Conservatives. Yesterday's Economist, in its last issue before polling, could only muster as a 'best reason' for voting Conservative that if Labour loses, the party will be forced to merge with the Liberals and so pave the way for electoral reform. It may have been this arresting, if superficial proposition which brought out the contrarian in me. Yesterday morning, on Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Major sounded more confident and positive than in any of his numerous previous broadcasts. Only the previous evening, he had blown a News at Ten interview by repeatedly insisting on the importance of his positive message, while omitting to describe it. Then I turned to yesterday's Sun, which bold as brass had a front page editorial, urging its readers to swallow their recessionary sufferings and back Mr Major. The argument, not unlike the Economist's, is that 'it would have been a hell of a lot worse' under Labour. Perhaps the Tories are rallying. But if you see Paul Johnson on the Bakerloo line listening to Elgar on his CD-Walkman, you'll know it's all over.</p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MOVIN NORTH THE FILLY TO BEAT AT LOS ALAMITOS  </P> <P> The La Jolla Handicap and the Huntington Beach Stakes, both at 350 yards, will  spotlight 2-year-old fillies and 3-year-old Cal-breds on Friday night's 12-race  card at Los Alamitos.  </P> <P> Movin North has never been off the board in five races and figures to be the  filly to beat in the field of 10 for the La Jolla. The 2-year-old filly by Easy  Dozen finished third in her first two starts. In her third start she showed  amazing speed winning her trial for the Breeders Classic Far West Futurity in  17.61 seconds, fastest qualifying time for the Futurity.  </P> <P> Movin North was purchased privately by Bob and Frances Wieland. Movin North  went on to win the Far West, and in her last start, the trials for the Ed Burke  Memorial Futurity, she finished second by a nose but failed to qualify for the  finals.  </P> <P> Movin North worked 12.4 seconds in preparation for the La Jolla and will have  regular rider Jim Lewis up for the $10,000-added sprint.  </P> <P> The David Payne's entry of Miss Missile Bug and Puppy Tac figure to receive  strong support off their excellent form since joining all-time leading female  trainer Connie Hall's barn. Puppy Tac and Miss Missile Bug arrived in  California as maidens, after six and seven starts respectively.  </P> <P> Puppy Tac was first to break her maiden and did it in style winning her  qualifying heat for the Governor's Cup Futurity in 17.69 seconds, qualifying  for the finals. The daughter of Tolltac finished fifth in the finale and since  has won the Pacific Handicap and finished second in the Ed Burke Memorial  Futurity trials. She didn't make the finals of the Ed Burke and has been idle  since Oct. 10.  </P> <P> Miss Missile Bug made her West Coast debut a little over a month later than  Puppy Tac with the same result, an impressive win. Miss Missile Bug ran away  from a maiden field, sprinting 350 yards in 17.63 seconds. In two starts since  she has a fifth and a second, both in futurity trials.  </P> <P> The Huntington Beach is restricted to Cal-breds and will have recent stakes  winners Collectors Series and Bedadoc in the field of 10.  </P> <P> Collectors Series, one of the most consistent 3-year-olds on the grounds with  four wins, three seconds and two thirds in 10 starts, defeated Bedadoc in the  California Sires Derby on Oct. 27.  </P> <P> In the California Sires Derby, Collectors Series was all out at 400 yards to  hold off the fast-charging Bedadoc. Tonight's 350-yard distance could give the  edge to the fast-breaking Collectors Series.  </P> <P> Bedadoc has a record of one win, seven seconds and two thirds in 13 starts. The  son of Merridoc didn't break his maiden until his victory in the San Luis  Obispo on Nov. 4. The Dennis Ekins-trained roan is extra sharp right now and  must be given strong consideration as he shoots for his second straight stakes  win.  </P></p>

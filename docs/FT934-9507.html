			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Mercury Asset expands 42% to Pounds 50.4m MERCURY Asset Management, the UK's largest fund management company, yesterday reported a 42 per cent rise from Pounds 35.5m to Pounds 50.4m in pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 1993. The company, which is 75 per cent owned by SG Warburg, also raised its interim dividend to 4p per share compared with 3p. Total funds under management rose 11.7 per cent in the period to Pounds 55.5bn, although the increase in net new money, after effects of ris-ing securities prices, was Pounds 1.1bn. Mr Hugh Stevenson, chairman, said of that amount roughly Pounds 350m was on behalf of the company's retail fund management businesses including private client and unit trust activities. A further Pounds 500m to Pounds 600m is growth in its core UK pension fund institutional fund management business. Operating costs were also up sharply from Pounds 45.8m to Pounds 56.8m, which partly reflect-ed higher staff compensat-ion costs, the directors stated. However, analysts noted that the company's ratio of revenues to funds under management had slipped marginally to 0.37 per cent against 0.38 per cent. This reflected the declining fee scales offered to larger sums under management. Mr Stevenson said that while the retail businesses were growing more quickly than the institutional side, which had dominated MAM's stable of clients, he believed there was further room for expansion in the UK pension fund market. MAM had also picked up significant new business managing international bond portfolios for US pension fund clients and had gained new Japanese pension fund clients.</p>

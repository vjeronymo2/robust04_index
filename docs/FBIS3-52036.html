Elias, and Facundo Landivar  on 27 December; place not given]    [Text] [LA NACION] The fate of the constitutional reform  will be decided today in the Senate but there is a feeling that  the subject of the reduction of mandates has reached a  stalemate. What will happen if the senators do not approve the  draft bill?    [Menem] Well, there will be no reform, what can we do...    [LA NACION] And if the draft bill is approved without the  reduction of the terms to four years?    [Menem] The draft bill will have to go back to be reviewed  by  the Chamber of Deputies.    [LA NACION] Would this jeopardize the pact you signed with  Alfonsin...?    [Menem] There is nothing we can do about it. We will try to  see that the agreement is respected but that is as much as we  can do. Alfonsin will give his representative instructions to  respect the pact and we will follow suit. This method worked  with the Chamber of Deputies.    [LA NACION] You maintain that what happens now is not up to  you. With that same criteria some may believe that not even the  conventioneers have the duty to flatly respect the pact.    [Menem] I believe the conventioneers will abide by the  constitutional reform law. A pact between political parties,  which is important, cannot prevail over the law.    [LA NACION] Is there any possibility that the conventioneers  may go beyond what was agreed?    [Menem] There is no problem unless they distort the essence  of the pact. Their actions will fall within the framework of a  law approved by Congress.    [LA NACION] How much authority will a cabinet chief take  away  from the president?    [Menem] It is hard to talk about that figure until it has  been completely defined. For a start, the president will loose  no authority. If you look at the draft bill the Chamber of  Deputies sent to the Senate you will see that the chief of  state's power remains untouched.    [LA NACION] However, Alfonsin convinced radicalism of the  advantages of the pact by arguing it would weaken the  presidential power...    [Menem] I do not think this is the case. It is a matter of  interpretation. If you look closely at the draft bill you will  see that presidential power is not altered.    [LA NACION] Who do you think is the best candidate for  cabinet chief?    [Menem] Sorry, but I cannot mention any names now.    [LA NACION] Could you describe the profile of person you  would like.    [Menem] If I describe the profile you will publish it  tomorrow. I already have a candidate in mind.    [LA NACION] Important business sectors fear the cabinet  chief  may curtail [Economy Minister Domingo] Cavallo's power...    [Menem] No, please, there is no such chance.    [LA NACION] Based on what you are saying, the function of  that new post is just operational, administrative.    [Menem] That is the idea. The reform states that the  president is the chief of state and the chief of the public  administration.    [LA NACION] In other words, the cabinet chief will be  another  secretary general of the presidency...    [Menem] You are trying to get me to say that Eduardo Bauza  will be chosen, but I will not. We must wait for the reform to  be approved, it will still take some time.    [LA NACION] In conclusion, if the post will not help either  above or below its own level, if it will not change the powers  of ministers, and if it will merely fulfill functions that are  already being fulfilled, why is it being included in the new  Constitution?    [Menem] That is your interpretation, Dr. Alfonsin has his.    [LA NACION] What about yours?    [Menem] I believe it is advantageous. We have to wait and  see how it works.    [LA NACION] Advantageous, but not necessary...    [Menem] Advantageous and necessary are more or less the  same.  I have managed so far, but I could do better with a cabinet  chief.    [LA NACION] What will be the next steps in the reform?    [Menem] If things work, we will implement the new  Constitution at the end of 1994 or at the beginning of 1995.  The initial date for the election of constituent assembly  delegates will be 20 March    [LA NACION] The Radicals were thinking of the end of April  as  the most advantageous date. Is this being negotiated?    [Menem] I suppose it is, but that is the date that I deem  most advantageous, in order to gain time.    [LA NACION] If after the reform you are reelected, your term  will last until 1999. Have you thought about what you will do  after that?    [Menem] Well, I am not going to live for ever, but I will  wait four years and I will run again. I will be 73, and I will  be able to run.    [LA NACION] Is the impossibility of being reelected in 1999  -- as you have repeatedly maintained -- a proscription?    [Menem] We would otherwise be thinking of permanent  reelection.    [LA NACION] Like in La Rioja...    [Menem] But not at a national level. France, Spain, and  several other countries, however, do allow it.    [LA NACION] Aside from personal interest, what do you think  of permanent reelection?    [Menem] It is very difficult to say, but large countries  have  their reasons for adopting it. It cannot be dangerous, because  it is not dangerous for those nations.    [LA NACION] Some sectors fear that after the reform is  approved, people will insist that you can again run in 1999.    [Menem] No, please. The pact is very clear. I don't think  anyone will insist on it in 1999.    [LA NACION] What is your opinion of 1993.    [Menem] Compared to other years this has been the best. Not  just because I say so, but because of what the great majority in  the country thinks so and because of the place Argentina has  conquered internationally. According to budget predictions, we  will also see excellent growth in 1994.    Resources will increase for basic areas in which the state  must be present: education, culture, justice, safety, and public  health. There is a good chance that investments will also  continue to grow, that greater credits may be granted to the  productive sector -- especially for medium-sized and small  enterprises. There is also the new social security law. The  national government is constantly searching, based on a sound  law, to lower production costs -- a task in which some private  sectors are also involved. The 1994 panorama is really  promising.    Moreover, people should also be aware that never in the  history of the Argentine Republic has the cabinet of the  president of the Nation successfully fulfilled the task of  reforming the state apparatus, with a punctuality only  interrupted by my trips abroad. We meet once a week. I think  this has never happened since Argentina became institutionalized  in 1853. The cabinet meets weekly either in the Federal Capital  or in the provinces.    [LA NACION] Will the efforts of the government in 1994 be  focused on any specific area?    [Menem] Yes. In cultural, educational, scientific, and  technological areas.    [LA NACION] Any special reason?    [Menem] If we do not step up government actions in the  cultural field, like great countries do, we will probably be  unable to maintain the growth rate that has made Argentina the  country with the greatest growth, together with China and  Thailand, in the world. Argentina has the greatest growth in the  Western hemisphere but this must be matched with education,  culture, science, and technology.    As [President Domingo] Sarmiento used to say: Argentina's  problems are mainly of an educational nature.    [LA NACION] Are there any specific projects for this field?    [Menem] They are being elaborated. People are constantly  working in this direction. The education sector will soon  disclose the achievements of the past few years, especially of  1993. Comparing the 1992 and 1993 budgets, the cultural sector's  funds increased by 60 percent. For 1994 we are calculating a  27-percent increase of resources for this field.    [LA NACION] Will there be a cabinet reshuffle in the near  future? It has been said time and again that [Health] Minister  [Alberto] Mazza may leave.    [Menem] He has not yet told me anything about that and he is  busily engaged in many activities. I reiterate what I have  always said: Those who do not agree with the president are not  obliged to remain in their posts. The cabinet continues for the  time being unchanged.    [LA NACION] Apart from Justice Minister Jorge Maiorano, who  could become the next ombudsman.    [Menem] That has yet to be settled, but the ombudsman is  nominated by the Senate not by the president. If this  appointment does not materialize, Dr. Maiorano will continue at  the head of the Justice Ministry.    [LA NACION] What will you say to pensioners at the start of  the year?    [Menem] The same old answer; namely that there are no  financial resources and that we cannot make empty promises.  Besides, how many are going to demonstrate against the  government? There are 4 million pensioners who receive health  allowances, free medicines, dental prostheses, and tourism  trips. There are 4 million of them compared with the 100 or 200  who demonstrate, strike blows, and hit policemen...    [LA NACION] With regard to the expenditures incurred to  refurbish the Olivos presidential residence...    [Menem] Now, now, there are other more important things to  publish. We had to refurbish the house so as to be able to move  there. It was redone as was appropriate. Besides, this is not  for me, personally, it belongs to the federal government.    We had to have the house redone because it was in a shocking  state of repair -- the kitchen, bathrooms, laundry, and guard  quarters. Let us make it clear, however, that the house is not  being added to, we are only refurbishing it. The only addition  -- the tennis court -- was donated.    [LA NACION] An important query about the 1995 elections is  who will be your running mate. Would you like to have the same  ticket as in 1989?    [Menem] That is a possibility among the many that are open  to  us. A profile like that of Duhalde is excellent.    [LA NACION] Which one is more appealing to you; a politician  or a technocrat?    [Menem] I will always take a politician over a technocrat  because when the president is on leave or travels abroad, his  duties must be handled by a politician. A technocrat may hold  other posts, but not as a running mate.    [LA NACION] How about your brother Eduardo, is he a  technocrat or a politician?    [Menem] He is both a technocrat and a politician. He has  always been engaged in his profession, studying and, at the same  time, growing into a politician. Nobody can question his skills  in the field of law as well as in politics.    [LA NACION] Could he be your running mate?    [Menem] No, no. One should at all costs avoid making  mistakes.    [LA NACION] Within the framework of the constitutional  reform, much has been said about changing the number of  ministries. Does this idea still hold good?    [Menem] I think that the number of ministries ought to be  increased from eight to at least 12. We are thinking about  creating a Science and Technology Ministry, an Environment  Ministry, and two others.    [LA NACION] Like the Production Ministry, for example?    [Menem] Yes, we are discussing the possibility of dividing  the Economy Ministry into the Economy Ministry and the  Production Ministry. We have not yet ruled out this possibility.    [LA NACION] Does the appointment of Caro Figueroa as labor  minister hint that the government will encourage the passing of  the labor reform?    [Menem] Yes, that is a subject on which the new minister has  already been working.    [LA NACION] The president blamed leftist groups for the  outbreak in Santiago del Estero. He was quick to say: "Not all  are leftists but there are some radical sectors who are  obviously involved in this game."    During the interview, Carlos Menem gave an example when he  said: "Some of the graffiti in Buenos Aires states: Yesterday  the Santiago outbreak, today the Argentine outbreak. This is  signed by the MAS [Movement Toward Socialism]. Well... no one  in his right mind would set Government House, the legislature,  or the justice building on fire just to demand his salary  payment. What interest could there be for a demonstrator to  destroy historic buildings? This was not the work of the people  of Santiago del Estero but of agitators, of subversives. [no  closing quotation marks as published]    So, what is your interpretation?    [Menem] I saw people with their faces completely covered. No  ones goes like that to a public demonstration. At a one time a  pick-up was overturned and set on fire, and the people said that  they were not part of the demonstration. They asked the police  to stop them but the police, acting in a hurry or for some other  reason, reacted against the people. There were agitators or  infiltrators who took advantage of the situation.    [LA NACION] Do you have any indication who they may be?    [Menem] It is being investigated.    [LA NACION] The impression is that they took advantage of a  favorable situation.    [Menem] That is right, but who is provoking them. They are  the ones with their faces covered. This cannot be justified.  Like that, maybe tomorrow or the day after they can burn  another city.    [LA NACION] Does the government fear that this may happen in  another province?    [Menem] No, no. We will completely prevent this type of  situation.    [LA NACION] What is your opinion on a confidential report by  the Side [Secretariat for State Intelligence] that was made  public indicating the lack of infrastructure in the provinces to  stop possible outbreaks?    [Menem] It is completely inaccurate. I would even say that  the legitimacy of that report can be discarded. What are the  words you reporters use in this case? Rotten, right? I would  rather say it is a false report.    [LA NACION] Who released it?    [Menem] I have no idea. It is always good to look for the  reasons for publishing a report like that. What good would a  false report do to the government? Nothing.    [LA NACION] Apart from reducing social security  contributions  for management staff, is the government planning other measures  to reduce labor cost?    [Menem] Reductions should also be made by the private  sector.  It is not right for the government to do it alone. For example,  private banks should lower their operational costs.    [LA NACION] Will the state help provinces that have major  problems?    [Menem] Of course. We are already providing money for  severance pay based on funds obtained from international  organizations.    [LA NACION] Is there a determined amount?    [Menem] There is no determined amount but we are talking  about 150 to 200 million pesos. The Inter-American Development  Bank gave about $3 billion this year for different areas,  especially for projects against floods in Corrientes, Misiones  and Entre Rios, and other zones.    [LA NACION] What will happen with the provinces that oppose  the Fiscal Pact?    [Menem] They will not have the benefits of the Fiscal Pact.    [LA NACION] Do you plan to meet with the governors?    [Menem] Between 18 and 20 January in Mar del Plata.</p>

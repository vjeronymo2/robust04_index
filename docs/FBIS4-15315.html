			<p>BFN     [Text] Presidential spokesman Imankadyr Rysaliyev in a  statement in Bishkek on Thursday has praised the pace of  Kyrgystan's [Kyrgyzstan's] economic reforms.    He said the rate of inflation in March ran at 5 percent. Low  inflation and stable currency, he said, are setting conditions  for economic growth.    The statement says if the policy of economic reforms and  financial austerity is maintained "for the next six months at  least," good incentives will be created for the inflow of  foreign investment and Kyrgyzstan is justified in expecting an  upsurge of economic activity soon. Rysaliyev believes "now is  the time to think of how to sell what is produced and to avert  any possible glut in the domestic market."</p>

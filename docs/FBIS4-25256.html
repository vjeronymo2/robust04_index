			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ma Chenguang: "Inventions by Inmates To Help Society"] </F>   [Text] Talented inmates in China's prisons and labour camps  are being encouraged to develop inventions and technological  innovations.    The move is to increase the social responsibility of  prisoners and turn them into useful citizens, said Zhang Yuhua,  spokeswoman for the Ministry of Justice yesterday.    The inventions and innovations will be used to help prison  work or sold to enterprises outside the jails, said Zhang.    Some of the inventions have already received Chinese patent  rights, she added.    And in return for their creations, many inventors will have  their prison sentences reduced.    The move is part of the prison reforms and aims to encourage  inmates to contribute more to the national economic drive and  better prepare them for life after prison.    A large number of talented inmates are former managers and  technicians who committed economic crimes.    At the moment there are 1.25 million prisoners in China's  680  jails and labour camps.    In Shanghai, prisoners in the Municipal Prison have been  taking part in the invention and technical innovation drive  since 1992.    Last year, eleven inventions and 56 of the technical  innovations developed by inmates from the prison were given  State and municipal prizes.    And five inventions received State patents.    In East China's Shandong Province, the No. 1 Provincial  Prison located in Jinan also embarked on a drive to develop  prisoners' inventions.    Over the past few years, the jail has conferred the title of  senior engineer to one prisoner, and named 56 others engineers,  assistant engineers and technicians.    The senior engineer was the first in the province to get  such  a title.    He is now developing further technical innovations in the  prison's workshop together with several apprentices.</p>

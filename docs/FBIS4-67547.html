			<p>BFN     [Text] Port Moresby, May 17 (AFP) -- A Swiss firm, SGS, has  been hired by the Papua New Guinea [PNG] Government to monitor  timber exports out of the country in the face of what are seen  as unscrupulous deals by Asian timber companies, officials said  Tuesday.    It comes as pressure mounts for effective action against  foreign companies, many said to be part of a huge Malaysian  operation accused of plundering Papua New Guinea's rain forests  for huge profits.    The 5.5-million-dollar contract is aimed at tightening  scrutiny and inspection of logging and timber exports to  maximise government revenue from log sales.    SGS will also guard against transfer-pricing and illegal  sale  of logs in a deal which Forestry Minister Tim Neville said would  pull unscrupulous companies into line.    Neville said in an Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)  television program Monday that he had been offered bribes of up  to 20 million dollars and threats were made on his life because  of his strong drive for reform of the timber industry.    He told the ABC the threats and offers of bribes were  serious  and those responsible faced criminal charges, but did not not  name the companies responsible.    Following a visit to logging areas of the country with  Neville, the program highlighted what it termed as the  "wholesale devastation" of PNG's forests.    SGS, based in Geneva, has been engaged in the business of  trade surveillance since 1878.    "We will be present at all loading ports to check the volume  of timber loaded and do species identification," SGS general  manager Len Cordiner said Tuesday.    "We will also be checking all the contract documents and  setting up a computerised data base for keeping records on all  of the concessions and timber going out from these concessions."    Cordiner said the principal objective was to obtain precise  figures and facts on how much timber was being exported from  Papua New Guinea so that the government had more effective  control over the forest industry.    "At the moment there is a belief that a lot of logs are  going  out of the country without being declared," he said.    "There's also a belief that the revenue the government is  collecting is well below what it should be.    "So the objective is to control the industry and to make  sure  that the loggers are doing the right thing; that the correct  value is being declared; and that the government is getting the  correct income.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Opposition leader Lim Kit Siang (DAP-Tanjong)  [Democratic Action Party member of parliament from Tanjong] said  the "colossal forex [foreign exchange] losses in the last two  years had knocked out a big black hole in Bank Negara [Central  Bank], not only making it insolvent but also destroying its  credibility and authority as a banker and guardian of banks in  Malaysia".    He said when Bank Negara's 1992 report was released last  year, its Governor Tan Sri Jaffar Hussein denied there was any  hole in the bank.    "The report was prepared to admit that the [Malaysian  ringgit] RM9.3 billion forex losses were mere 'paper losses' and  that Bank Negara's loss was the nation's gain," he said when  debating the motion of thanks on the Royal address.    Lim claimed that when Bank Negara's 1993 report was released  two weeks ago, there was another exercise to cover up the fact  the "hole in Bank Negara had become bigger, and it still denied  that there was any hole at all".    Lim said there was a conspiracy of disinformation and  misinformation to cover up the real nature, cause and magnitude  of Bank Negara's forex losses in the past two years.    "It is not only the greatest financial scandal in Malaysia  but also a world-class financial scandal."    Elaborating on his motion which was allowed this afternoon,  Lim said the 1992 forex losses were not RM1O.1 billion but  likely to be RM13.1 billion.    "In 1993, Bank Negara suffered RM5.7 billion in forex losses  and RM711 million in net operating loss. Taking into account  the RM6.1 billion loss that could be hidden by the revaluation  of quoted investments, Bank Negara losses could range from RM6.4  billion to RM12.5 billion."    Taking both years together, he said, Bank Negara could have  suffered forex losses ranging from RM16.5 billion to RM25.6  billion. Lim said Finance Minister Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim  should not be misled by Bank Negara officials that it could  afford up to RM25.6 billion losses in two years because its  assets exceeded RM100 billion.    "It is such wrong advice that caused Anwar to come out  openly  to state last year that the RM10.1 billion in foreign exchange  losses suffered by Bank Negara in 1992 were paper losses.    "The additional RM6.4 billion to RM12.5 billion losses  suffered by Bank Negara in 1993 have proven Anwar to be wrong  that the RM10.1 billion losses are not 'paper losses' but real  losses."    Lim called for a Royal Commission of Inquiry to be set up to  inquire whether the total Bank Negara forex losses since 1992  could exceed RM30 billion.    He said there was an urgent need for the appointment of a  Public Accounts Committee chairman, who should be an opposition  Member of Parliament, to inquire into Bank Negara's forex losses.</p>

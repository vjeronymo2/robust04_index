			<p>BFN     [Text] His Majesty King Husayn has said that Jordan's  democratic course is an irrevocable option and that Jordan,  despite the facts in the current Arab situation, insists on  continuing that course because it is linked with the Arab  citizen's honor, freedom, and right to take part in building his  present and future.    His majesty also stressed the constant principles of  Jordan's  march, while it faces challenges and builds an exemplary Jordan  through the democratic and social changes.    His majesty's statements came when he met at the Royal  Hashemite Court today with the House of Representatives speaker,  the members of the permanent and temporary committees, the  spokesmen for the parliamentary blocs, and the representatives  of the House's Permanent Bureau.    His majesty called for further distinguished performance by  the deputies in the fields of control and legislation and for  clarifying relations between the three authorities, stressing  the democratic traditions and bases of a meaningful dialogue  that enriches the march and enables it to achieve its noble  goals.    His majesty briefed the deputies on the latest developments  in the peace process, as well as Arab relations, stressing that  Jordan insists on achieving a comprehensive, just, and lasting  peace in the region.    House Speaker Tahir al-Masir and the chairmen and  rapporteurs  of the parliamentary committees expressed their thanks to his  majesty for giving them the opportunity to meet him and listen  to his instructions. They also stressed the importance of such  meetings as they add momentum to the democratic march. His  majesty also listened to the deputies' observations and opinions  on various local issues and the democratic march. The meeting  was attended by Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, Royal  Hashemite Court Chief His Excellency al-Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir,  Chief Chamberlain His Highness Ra'd Bin-Zayd, and his majesty's  advisers.</p>

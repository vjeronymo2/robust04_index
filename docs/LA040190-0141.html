			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FICTION IN BRIEF: ROOM TEMPERATURE BY NICHOLSON BAKER GROVE WEIDENFELD: $16.95;  144 PP.  </P> <P> Many look but few observe, as Sherlock Holmes noted to Dr. Watson, and a  technical writer named Mike, the narrator of this short second novel by  Nicholson Baker (the first was "Mezzanine"), is definitely one of the  observers. Bottle-feeding his six-month-old daughter, nicknamed "the Bug," on a  fall afternoon in Quincy, Mass., in the apartment he shares with his working  wife, Patty, he asserts that "with a little concentration one's whole life  could be reconstructed from any single 20-minute period randomly or almost  randomly selected." He then proceeds to prove it.  </P> <P> Without leaving his rocking chair, Mike shuttles back and forth between his  past as a precocious kid and college-dorm Romeo and his present as an awed new  parent. His mode of travel is the long, intricate sentence, which he views as  indispensable for the "careful interpretation and weighing" of "novelties of  social and technological life." His fuel consists of details so fine, and so  finely observed (whether of nose-picking or model airplanes, the taste of Bic  pens or the mutual sounding-out talk of newlyweds, the clucking noises the Bug  makes or the shape of a spoonful of peanut butter, which leads him to imagine  impishly what his wife, when pregnant, would have looked like in a wind  tunnel), that they give off propulsive heat and spurt the reader along with  delicious little jolts of recognition.  </P> <P> True, Mike's life is a sheltered one, and Baker is blatantly showing off (like  a teen-ager solving quadratic equations while winning a bubble-gum-blowing  contest). "Room Temperature" has a smug, tour de force-y quality to it. But it  also includes some of the most tender, most delicate interaction between  husband and wife, adult and infant, in modern fiction, demonstrating what John  Updike, no mean observer himself, meant when he wrote of artists who imitate  God: "Details are the giant's fingers. He seizes the stick and strips the bark  and shows, burning beneath, the moist white wood of joy." Michael Harris  </P></p>

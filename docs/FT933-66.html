			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee prices dive despite approach of export curbs COFFEE PRICES plunged in London yesterday, almost on the eve of the commencement of the producers' export retention scheme that had helped to drive the market to recent 2 1/2 -year highs. As doubts crept in about the impact and longevity of the scheme to withhold 20 per cent of output, which comes into operation tomorrow, the November futures price at the London Commodity Exchange tumbled to Dollars 1,186 a tonne, down Dollars 59 on the day and nearly Dollars 150 below the late-August high. But it was still some Dollars 270 above the level ruling when the rally took off in July. The problem was that there had, until now, been no significant setback to the rally, explained Mr Lawrence Eagles, commodities analyst at GNI, the London trade house. And he noted that the sustained advance had taken place in very thin market volume. Heavy technically-inspired selling in New York yesterday had revealed a lack of buying interest, he said, which suggested that there might be further losses to come. 'The retention plan's positive implications have been fully absorbed,' said Mr Eagles, 'and investors are now beginning to wonder how effective it will be and how long it will last.' For his own part, he thought the producers' resolve was strong and that the scheme would operate 'for a few years at least'. At the London headquarters of the International Coffee Organisation delegates continued to debate how to make up financial for the withdrawal, announced at the weekend, of the US, the biggest coffee imports and main contributor to the ICO budget. It had already been proposed that the budget be reduced by 31 per cent but yesterday Germany called for a further 5 to 7 per cent cut, said Mr Nestor Osorio, chairman of the organisation's finance committee. It had originally been suggested that the US's Dollars 600,000 contribution could be shared among other consumers. But that was opposed by some, notably the EC. The ICO's market stabilisation efforts were suspended in 1989 and it now operates merely as an international coffee forum and data base.</p>

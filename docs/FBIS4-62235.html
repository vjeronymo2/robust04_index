			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Special Report" feature] </F>   [Text] The Soyuz defense enterprise today [11 May] secretly  tested underground missiles [podzemnye rakety] at the Moscow  region aviation systems testing ground. So why is all this  called an underground missile?    [Vyacheslav Kuriolvich, section head of Soyuz scientific and  production association, identified by screen caption] Because it  moves through the ground like other missiles do through the air.    [Correspondent] Underground missiles can travel deep  underground, even in areas which are inaccessible for other  equipment. There are three reasons why defense specialists have  developed this underground apparatus.    First, a critical mass of used missiles has built up in  Defense Ministry stores. This fitting [ustanovka] gives them a  second life. The people who developed it made it in such a way  that once the missile has burrowed into the earth, it comes back  up again, and can be used 10 more times.    The second reason: Over the past 10 years, four explosions  have taken place in military stores, as a result of which people  were killed. So....    [Kurilovich] This is one of the best ways of getting rid of  weapons. If they just lie around, somebody will use them.    [Correspondent] And the third reason, also important: In the  context of conversion, which has begun in Russia, and the  related possibility of unemployment for defense industry  workers. The (?Grab) underground missile promises new work.    But the (?Grab) underground missile is not the first  development of this kind. Even during his first visit to  America, Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev boasted to the Americans  that Russia had developed an underground vessel which burrowed  through the earth at a speed of 60 meters per hour. But all the  tests were secret, because the military laid down secret  communication lines with the aid of this apparatus.    The basis of today's underground missile system is the Grad  multiple launch rocket system [MLRS]. Grad is a weapon of mass  destruction with a 20-square kilometer destruction zone.    The service life of a Grad launcher is 15-20 years. The  military think the underground Grad can be used for economic  purposes, in particular for laying down electricity lines in  inaccessible mountainous areas.    [Vyacheslav Vlasov, section head at aviation systems testing  ground -- identified by screen caption] It is not only the Grad  rockets, but certain types of air-to-air missiles [AAM] that can  also be used for these purposes.    [Correspondent] Incidentally, it is not only the military  that is developing uses for underground missile systems. The  Moscow Aviation Institute has thought of an original (?Grab)  system for burying radioactive fuel underground.    The Soyuz scientific and production association [NPO] takes  the missiles to the testing ground in the Moscow region in  armored trucks under guard.  The military parts are detached from the barrel of the missile  and replaced by a steel drilling head at the testing ground.  The head weighs five to seven kilos, and just as in a normal  surface missile there are 20 kilos of powder [porokh] in the  underground missile.    So, the same safety rules as for testing surface missiles  apply when testing underground missiles. Everybody on the  testing ground during the explosion must be in a secure shelter.  The shock wave throws huge lumps of earth many meters, and this  is not safe. But an exception was made for NTV.    [Kurilovich] It's your risk, it's your life. [Words  indistinct] the real shell flies 30 kms.    [Correspondent] The missile travels at 4 meters per second.  The depth of the shaft can be up to 30 meters, with a diameter  of up to 150 centimers. Isn't all this offensive for somebody  who has worked a long time?    [Vlasov] Well, in theory of course it's offensive. But it  would be even worse if they were to use these things for their  original purpose.</p>

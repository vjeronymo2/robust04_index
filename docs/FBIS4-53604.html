			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo -- At a House of Councillors Budget Committee  meeting on 20 May, Minoru Tanba, treaties bureau chief at the  Foreign Ministry, commented on the allegation that during  negotiations on Okinawa's reversion to Japanese control, Japan  and the United States concluded a "secret agreement" that allows  the United States to reintroduce nuclear weapons to Okinawa in  case of an emergency. Tanba expressed a negative view about the  binding power of the secret accord even if it actually exists.  He said: "The Japan-U.S. Joint Communique signed by then Prime  Minister Eisaku Sato and President Richard Nixon was a political  document on Okinawa's reversion to Japan. It is unthinkable  that they also issued agreed minutes to the communique. Even if  such documents exist, they are not binding because they were not  compiled by administrative organizations in accord with law."  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata also stressed that the government's  policy of "refusing reentry of nuclear weapons to Okinawa or  other parts of Japan" would not change even if an emergency does  take place. Both Tanba and Hata made these remarks in answering  questions from Japan Communist Party members Koichiro Ueda and  Yoshinori Yoshioka.    Referring to the allegation in a book authored by Kei  Wakaizumi, Ueda asserted that it is now evident that the secret  agreement was signed, saying: "Can't you still deny (the  existence of the secret agreement)? I want the government to  investigate the allegation because this is an issue that affects  the fate of the nation."    In response, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said:  "Negotiations on Okinawa's reversion were made through official  diplomatic channels and as a result, the two governments agreed  on the reversion. There were no private channels." He added:  "Granting that there were private channels, I do not think they  affected the final result of the negotiations."    In a question related to this issue, Yoshioka asked "whether  the secret agreement, made in the form of agreed minutes, would  be binding on Japanese cabinets." Treaties Bureau Chief Tanba  and Foreign Minister Kakizawa answered his question on the  assumption that the secret agreement exists. Tanabe said: "Its  secret nature does not invalidate the agreement. At any rate,  (the agreed minutes in question) were not made in accord with  law." Kakizawa also stressed: "The agreement is invalid, so  you do not have to worry."    In answering a question on the need to investigate the  allegation and ascertain the facts about the secret agreement,  Prime Minister Hata said: "Former Prime Minister Sato is  already dead. So I have no idea about how we should  investigate." Asked about the need to notify the United States  of the invalidity of the agreement, Foreign Minister Kakizawa  said: "It is unnecessary because the government does not admit  its existence."</p>

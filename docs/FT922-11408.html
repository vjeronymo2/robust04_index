			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Travel: Mexican mix that works - Snapshot / Why San Miguel is a good base for a break AFTER the Second World War, 800 American GIs were sent to San Miguel de Allende, four hours north of Mexico City. Many of them married Mexicans, establishing the core of what has become the most successful mix of Mexicans and Americans in the country. The mix works because they genuinely like each other, whereas in other parts of Mexico Americans are often envied and resented. The town has had its ups and downs. Built in 1542, San Miguel was a day's walk from the silver mines in Guanajuato. The countryside roundabout was fertile and had numerous hot springs, so many of the mine owners lived in San Miguel and built themselves fine houses. To walk down a street is to gain little idea of the beauty of these houses. It is only when you pass through a door into gardens full of blue plumbago and bougainvilia and see lofty courtyards filled with hanging ferns that you glimpse something of the grandeur within. Emperor Maximilian greeted the crowds from the balcony of the house where I was staying. The streets are cobbled and round every corner there are chuches with bells which chime in strange sequences throughout the night but which are oddly silent during the day. Much of the day-time noise comes from the sprawling market in the centre of town. It is very much a working market. From the surrounding countryside, people bring their produce - tomatoes, radishes, carrots, potatoes, perhaps two or three avocadoes, a mass of gaudy gladioli, pinks, chrysanthemums. Cheap plastic toys jostle for place with imitation jewellry, leather shoes, embroidered cotton dresses. There are many religious processions. The statue of the saint of the day is dressed in clothes and carried around the town by eight women, of all ages, dressed in black, who wear the label Virgen on their shoulders. When the statue returns to its church, it is greeted by Indian drums and Andean-sounding flutes, fireworks and firecrackers. The mixture of Catholicism and Indian culture makes everything seem alive and vibrant. However, the real hub of the town is focussed around the zocalo, the Plaza Allende, which is shaded by bay trees. There is a small bandstand but mostly people come here to talk, to watch, and to court. In 1938 a Peruvian set up an art school, Bellas Artes, in the convent which had been built for Josefina de la Canal in 1775. Josefina was the daughter of a man made rich by silver. At the age of 17 she decided to become a nun, so her father built her a convent, part of which still houses the Concepcionistas, an enclosed order. San Miguel makes an extremely good base from which to visit other parts of the state of Guanajuanto. Ten miles away is the village of Atotonilco, which has a huge church. Adjoining it is a vast building where 4,000 penitents undertake eight-day retreats. Very few outsiders see this spooky place: when the penitents are there (50 weeks of the year) no one is allowed in. Conversely, once the penitents have committed themselves, they are not allowed out. In the dusk, bats swoop and stray dogs roam the huge, damp, dank concrete passages which are the sleeping quarters and which contain nothing but an iron bar for hanging clothes. Complete silence is required; reading is not allowed. Men and women come at separate times. There are two meals a day. Beans, coffee and tortillas are cooked in black cauldrons by volunteers. As a further enticement, self-flagellation is recommended.</p>

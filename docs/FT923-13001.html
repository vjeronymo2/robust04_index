			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Lecs payments faulted: Watchdog qualifies Scottish Enterprise's first annual accounts THE National Audit Office, the government's spending watchdog, has qualified the first annual accounts of Scottish Enterprise, the body that replaced the Scottish Development Agency last year, saying there is 'a risk of error which could be material'. The qualification in the statement on the accounts from Sir John Bourn, comptroller and auditor-general, relates to payments made by Scottish Enterprise to the 13 Local Enterprise Companies (Lecs) under its control which they passed on to training providers. Lecs are the Scottish equivalent of the Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) in England and Wales. Sir John says that at five of the Lecs, financial appraisal and monitoring systems for the disbursal of training funds were not in place for the whole of the 1991-92 financial year. One did not implement them until last November. He says that the appraisal and monitoring systems at one Lec were 'giving Scottish Enterprise concern at the end of the financial year' and that 11 Lecs had not arranged for an internal audit to be carried out in the form required by the rules. The qualified NAO statement is a source of deep embarrassment to Scottish Enterprise after it indicated its satisfaction at the progress made so far by the network of Lecs. Scottish Enterprise is likely to be called to give evidence to the Commons public accounts committee. Sir David Nickson, Scottish Enterprise chairman, said yesterday: 'I think any qualification has to be taken seriously. It's an extremely mild qualification.' He said there had been 'no suggestion whatever that there has been any misuse or misallocation of funds at all and none has been found'. Last year Scottish Enterprise handed out Pounds 329m of its Pounds 446m budget to the Lecs. Of this about Pounds 200m went on training programmes. Annual Report and Accounts 1991-92.

V. No. 3 Slope (I.D. No. 36&hyph;08405) located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to examine each seal for physical damage from the slope gunboat during the preshift examination after an air quantity reading is taken in by the intake portal and to test for the quantity and quality of air at the intake air split locations off the slope in the gangway portion of the working section. The petitioner proposes to physically examine the entire length of the slope once a month. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 11.

V. No. 3 Slope (I.D. No. 36&hyph;08405) located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. Due to hazardous conditions and roof falls, certain areas of the intake haulage slope and primary escapeway cannot be traveled safely. The petitioner proposes to examine these areas from the gunboat/slope car with an alternative air quality evaluation at the section's intake level, and to travel and thoroughly examine these areas for hazardous conditions once a month. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 12.

The petitioner proposes to use cross-sections instead of contour lines through the intake slope, at locations of rock tunnel connections between veins, and at 1,000 feet intervals of advance from the intake slope and to limit the mapping of mine workings above and below to those present within 100 feet of the vein being mined except when veins are interconnected to other veins beyond the 100 feet limit through rock tunnels.

No. 36&hyph;04281) located in Greene County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to use 800 feet trailing cables with three-phase 480 volt to supply power to loading machines, shuttle cars, roof bolters and section ventilation fans while developing longwall panels. The petitioner states that the cables would not be smaller than No. 4 A.W.G. for the ventilation fans, center bolters, and shuttle cars and not smaller than No. 2 A.W.G. for the loading machines; and that adequate training would be provided to all miners designated necessary by the operator.

No. 36&hyph;08221) located in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. Because of the steep, frequently changing pitch and numerous curves and knuckles in the main haulage slope, the petitioner proposes to use the gunboat without safety catches in transporting persons. As an alternative, when using the gunboat to transport persons, the petitioner proposes to use an increased rope strength safety factor and secondary safety connections which are securely fastened around the gunboat and to the hoisting rope above the main connecting device. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 17.

No. 40&hyph;01715) located in Emery County, Utah. The petitioner proposes to use belt air to ventilate the face area and to install a low-level carbon monoxide detection system that would provide both visual and audible alarm signals as an early warning device in belt entries used as intake air courses, which would provide two separate and distinct intake air escapeways to the miners working in the development sections.

			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Student loans not real success Sir, In your article 'Student loan 'success' hailed' (February 17), I was quite stunned at higher education minister Mr Tim Boswell's apparent ignorance of the average student's financial position. Grants have been frozen and entitlement to most benefits removed since the late 1980s. Students' real income has taken a remarkably heavy battering and the sluggish economy has removed a great proportion of the potential to supplement income through part-time employment. Therefore, it is hardly surprising that individuals have had to augment their income with these loans. Thus, the take-up rate indicates very little evidence of a 'success'. I left university with Pounds 1,500 worth of debt and am jobless. This worries me. However, what worries me more is that higher education resources inevitably will be misallocated more and more to those who can afford to buy them rather than to those with true academic potential.

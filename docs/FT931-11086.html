			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Germany fails the Maastricht test The theme of this year's Davos World Economic Forum was 'rallying all the forces for global recovery'. There was a good deal of agreement on a general theme that the world needed a sustained, soundly based recovery rather than a quick fix. There was also the theme of a world capital or savings shortage. How this could be so amid so many complaints of the lengths and depths of the recession and the calls to stimulate spending baffled me. If there is a shortage of savings one would expect interest rates to be rising and demand to be booming. Instead we see the opposite. The nearest I got to an answer was from a well-known US economist who wanted to see a rise in American savings, but not too much too soon, echoing Saint Augustine, who wanted to become virtuous, but not yet. The European Monetary System (EMS) was a peripheral theme in the global forum. But it was extensively discussed in what British political conferences would call fringe meetings. A widespread consensus, covering Germany as well as Britain, was expressed by Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of England, when he said that the EMS had to work more flexibly, 'with more timely and more frequent realignments'. The former French prime minister Raymond Barre, himself a pioneer of European Community monetary arrangements, agreed that it had been a mistake to see the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) prematurely as a de facto monetary union. He would have preferred a realignment earlier in 1992. He would have liked the UK to have realigned downwards by a few percentage points together with Italy, Spain and Ireland while the D-Mark and the French franc should both have realigned upwards. Yet only a couple of years ago the Bundesbank was pressing for an appreciation of the D-Mark against the franc as well as other currencies. The French government is now braced for a further speculative attack on the franc, maybe bigger than last autumn's, either in the run-up to the parliamentary elections in March, which the right-wing opposition headed by Jacques Chirac is likely to win. Some think that the pressure will be greatest during the negotiations that lead up to the next period of co-habitation between the French conservatives and President Mitterrand. The paradox is that on 'fundamentals' the franc is in a stronger position than the D-Mark. French inflation is lower; the budget and current account balances are in better shape; and there has been a smaller drop in industrial production in the current recession. Indeed one reason why the Bundesbank is against an early fast track to monetary union among a few core countries is the belief that Germany is not strong enough for such a step - the budget deficit in particular is likely to be for several years well above the Maastricht criteria. Nor is the Bundesbank impressed by some of the specific proposals in the air, such as representatives of the Bundesbank and the Banque de France sitting on each other's boards. Apart from anything else there is no body equivalent to the Bundesbank council in France and the Bundesbank is unwilling to share responsibility for German monetary policy in advance of the Maastricht process. As for the frequent suggestion of a narrowing of the franc-D-Mark margins, the response is that there is an intellectual case for wider not narrower margins to provide flexibility. A de facto example is provided by Switzerland, where the national bank has in practice shadowed the D-Mark within a broad band as well as targeting the money supply, but, unlike Austria, has avoided rigid currency links. Because of expectations of a rising Swiss franc, Switzerland can now have short-term interest rates some 3 percentage points below those of Germany. (The reason why a wide margin did not work in the British case is that the central rate was regarded as too high and there was no belief in a likely upward rebound when the bottom end of the grid was reached). A proposal for wider margins would be thrown out politically by France and some other nations as a step away from the European goal. The Bundesbank is therefore unlikely to propose it in the current review of ERM procedure. The one argument for a franc depreciation is the height of French short-term interest rates and the high and rising level of unemployment. French officials regard their country's unemployment as largely structural, reflecting labour market blockages - which does not sit easily with the insistence of the Mitterrand government for a so-called social element in the EC. Obviously French unemployment has been aggravated by recession. But the increase has not been anything like as large as in Britain and the dependence of French households and industry on short-term finance is very much less. The question for the country's leaders is whether it is worth jeopardising the credibility so painfully won by the years of the franc fort policy and the political gains from the close monetary relationship with Germany for the sake of a quicker cut in interest rates. The Bundesbank objection to 'unlimited intervention' in favour of any currency is well-known. But it may not arise because of the French policy (unlike the British last autumn) of defending the franc before the limit of the grid is reached. The hope of both the German and French sides is that a mixture of finite Bundesbank intervention, French willingness to use reserves and to introduce emergency increases in interest rates, will enable the franc to pull through until the end of March. There are strong hints that the French have undisclosed lines of credit, apart from their partners' ERM obligations. These could be either with the Bundesbank directly or through the central bank network at the Bank for International Settlements in Basle. The hope is that such measures will buy time until it is clear that a new French government supports the franc fort. The need for interest rate differentials against Germany could then go. In addition, German interest rates may at last be in clear decline. These two influences together should be sufficient to reduce French interest rates by up to 5 percentage points, and resist the political pressures for a U-turn. The strongest force going for the franc is, however, the market belief that it is fundamentally very strong. A Swiss banker specialising in France told me that he was switching from franc deposits into French equities. But he hesitated to move French francs into other currencies because he did not expect at worst a depreciation of more than 5 per cent and that there were many risks and costs involved, including the strong chance that the franc would soon start moving up again. The greatest risk for the French franc is the delay in making substantial cuts in German interest rates. If questioned about the strong recessionary forces in Germany, Bundesbank sources will ask why they are not showing up in the monetary numbers. They also see little sign of any other underlying turnround in inflation. Nevertheless the Bundesbank does look at the real economy as well as the money supply and once the symbolism of the solidarity pact with the unions, employers and Lander is in sight - Chancellor Kohl has given a deadline of February 17 - the Bundesbank will have to start reducing interest rates in earnest. But I cannot blame it for waiting until the last possible moment.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Reports are coming in of new instances of  arbitrary seizure of Black Sea Fleet property by the Ukrainian  military.    According to river motorboat crews, a group of eight  Ukrainian naval servicemen arrived in Izmail at 1300. They  handed to the unit commander an order from the Ukrainian defense  minister to the effect that the unit was disbanded and replaced  by a third brigade to guard the Ukrainian naval military  district.    Sources close to the Black Sea Fleet headquarters have  learned that on 15 April, near the settlement of Perevalnaya,  near Simferopol, one of the battalions of a mechanised division  of the Ukrainian armed forces has been placed on full combat  alert. Battalion personnel have been issued ammunition. Similar  measures have been taken at an artillery unit of the same  mechanised brigade. [passage omitted]</p>

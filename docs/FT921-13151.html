			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Pollution monitoring proposal COMPANIES should be allowed to monitor their own pollution emissions and set their own environmental targets, the Institute of Directors said yesterday. The institute, which has prepared a report on the environment, wants government regulation used only as a last resort and enforced with a 'light touch'. It said the tax on fossil fuels being considered by the European Commission would put European business at a disadvantage and increase distortions in the energy market. Mrs Janice Buck, IoD environmental research executive, said many companies might be put out of business by UK regulations enforcing integrated pollution control over air, land and water. She said pollution monitoring could be carried out by private enterprise 'as in MoT testing'. Stewards of the Earth. The Director Publications, Mountbarrow House, Elizabeth St, London SW1W 9RB.

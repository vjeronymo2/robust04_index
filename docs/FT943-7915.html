			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Court signals turning point in asbestos saga: Agreement could provide model for broader settlement of litigation Asbestos-related legal action will not end with the approval this week in a US federal court of a Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 844m) settlement for future victims - but the deal could be a turning point in a saga that has already cost more than Dollars 10bn. It is the biggest success yet enjoyed by the Centre for Claims Resolution, an asbestos industry body formed in 1988 to rationalise litigation and curb rising legal costs. The agreement provides compensation over the next 10 years for an estimated 100,000 future victims of mesothelioma - a cancer of the lining of the lung  -and other asbestos-related diseases. Any victim who had not filed a claim before January last year, when negotiations on the deal began, and who contracts an asbestos-related disease can claim, with individual payouts ranging from a maximum of Dollars 200,000 for victims of mesothelioma to as little as Dollars 2,500 for victims of non-malignant asbestos-related diseases. But the deal could provide a model for a broader settlement of asbestos litigation. The 20 former asbestos companies backing the centre account for only 20-25 per cent of the US asbestos industry, which is now largely defunct. Nor does the deal affect any of the 200,000 legal claims filed before January 1993. Mr Lawrence Fitzpatrick, chief executive of the centre, says that other former asbestos producers not currently party to the agreement have already shown interest in joining an expanded 'second wave' scheme. The willingness of some of the lawyers representing potential victims to agree the deal also signals the possibility of broader agreement. However, other lawyers have indicated their intention to appeal against the judge's decision to approve the scheme. They say it in effect denies legal rights to some victims and the level of awards is smaller than would be possible through court proceedings. Critics also say that if the number of claimants rises above the centre's estimates over the next 10 years, more money will be needed. 'The agreement doesn't provide legal finality. Asbestos could still rear its ugly head in 2005,' said Mr Randolph Fields, a US insurance lawyer. At the same time the settlement cases will have no direct effect on claims against asbestos companies over their liability for the cost of removing asbestos from buildings, so-called 'asbestos property damage'. T&amp;N, once the UK's largest asbestos producer and now a leading maker of motor components, faces a Dollars 185m legal suit from Chase Manhattan Bank in one of the biggest of these cases. Chase is seeking Dollars 85m in damages in relation to removal of asbestos from its headquarters in downtown New York and a further Dollars 100m in punitive damages. T&amp;N also faces the prospect of legal action by New York's Port Authority over asbestos used at the World Trade Center and La Guardia airport. Moreover there is also the prospect of continuing legal action by victims of asbestos-related diseases outside the US. Solicitors specialising in personal injury litigation in the UK, for example, say that the number of their asbestos-related cases has doubled over the last four years. Producers and manufacturers also face legal action elsewhere, notably in Australia. According to the National Safety Council of Australia (NSCA), Australian state governments, companies and insurers could already face ADollars 1bn (Pounds 480m) in liabilities. The attitude of insurers, who will fund about two thirds of its cost, to the settlement could also complicate matters. Insurers might be expected to welcome the deal, which will bring a greater degree of certainty about the size of claims which they face. Because claims emerge many years - sometimes decades - after the inception of an insurance policy, it can be difficult for companies to calculate the size of the reserves needed. 'You are always better off dealing with a finite number. This had the potential to be very costly for the industry,' said Mr Steve Goldstein, vice-president of the Insurance Information Institute of New York. However, Mr Fields believes a global settlement involving all asbestos producers could actually damage the position of insurance companies, since it would in effect crystallise claims which would otherwise only emerge over many years. 'The impact is difficult to predict. It could bring forth even more claims,' he says. In some cases, insurers are resisting claims by asbestos producers and manufacturers in the courts. Finally, the relief offered to the hard-pressed Names of Lloyd's will be limited. Lloyd's said yesterday that its exposure to companies involved in the settlement was minimal and that any real benefit would depend on the extension of the scheme. Many of the same syndicates are also exposed to multi-billion-dollar pollution claims which, observers believe, could have a bigger impact on the market than the asbestos claims.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The 20 companies which have formed the Centre for Claims Resolution, based in Princeton, which is pursuing the class action are: Amchem Products AP Green Industries Armstrong World Industries CE Thurston CertainTeed Dana Ferodo America Flexitallic GAF IU North America Maremont Asbestos Claims Management (for merly National Gypsum) National Services Industries Norsoc Pfizer Quigley Shook and Fletcher Insulation T&amp;N Union Carbide Plastics United States Gypsum.  Under the class action currently being heard, the 20 companies would together pay about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 650m) over 10 years to settle asbestos cases awaiting adjudication in state and federal courts.  Under the proposed settlement the companies would pay sufferers of asbestos-linked diseases Dollars 5,800 for non-cancerous disorders to Dollars 60,000 for lung cancer. Only those with symptoms would qualify.  Victims of asbestos-linked diseases who opted out of the settlement procedure may still pursue legal action. There are, however, understood to be some 100,000 outstanding cases awaiting a hearing, with courts in most states only now dealing with claims filed in the 1980s.  All federal lawsuits are understood to have been on hold since 1992 because of the legal logjam.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

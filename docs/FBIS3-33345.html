			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 15 Feb (NA) -- President Carlos  Menem stated that the government will start to pay the "social  debt" by establishing the Social Development Secretariat. He  pointed out that this new secretariat will have enough financial  resources at its disposal to implement aid programs for the  community.    Menem made these remarks on 14 February when installing Luis  Prol [former under secretary general of the presidency] in  office as the new social development secretary. Menem noted  that Prol "does not face an easy challenge," but he asserted  that he "will not be short of money." [passage omitted]    It was unofficially reported that $300 million will be  appropriated initially for the new secretariat and "cash in  hand" from the other ministries will subsequently be earmarked  to reach a total of $900 million. The secretariat will answer  directly to the president.    Menem ordered that funds from ministries' budget allotments  classified as "surplus" be transferred to the new secretariat,  which will then earmark them for social programs to be  implemented in the forthcoming months.    Prol reportedly will be in charge of managing the funds  collected from the National Lottery -- some $100 million, which  he will be able to use at his discretion.    The new secretariat will be in charge of managing social  programs undertaken by the government and "monitoring" their  progress.    Prol will take on the administration of some 60 social plans  and programs the federal government had entrusted to five  ministries, like intensive training programs (PIT) and the  upgrading of squalid rural schools, among others.

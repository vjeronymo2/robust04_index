			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Crash rekindles Airbus doubts THE Airbus A320's comput-erised controls and the delayed rescue effort were yesterday at the centre of a controversy surrounding the crash of a French airliner near Strasbourg on Monday. The cause of the crash, which killed 87, is still a mystery, though rescue workers have found the aircraft's two flight recorders, or 'black boxes'. They were handed to the accident inquiry team, which has been asked by the French government to produce a preliminary report in a month and a final public report a few months later. Mr Paul Quiles, the French transport minister, warned against drawing premature conclusions about the crash, which occurred when an Air Inter A320 flight from Lyons hit a snowbound mountain ridge in thick fog on its approach to Strasbourg airport. One of the nine survivors said the crash happened just after passengers had been asked to fasten their seatbelts for landing. 'There was no warning, no sign of trouble. We simply broke up in trees,' he said. The aircraft appeared to be flying below its normal altitude when it hit the mountain-side. The pilot gave no warning and the aircraft's emergency radio beacon did not function. This delayed the search for the wreckage, which took nearly five hours to find. Survivors said some passengers who were still alive after the crash later froze to death. The crash rekindled controversy over the state-of-the-art control system of the Airbus. Airbus Industrie, the four-nation European consortium which manufactures the A320, argues that the advanced fly-by-wire avionics make the aircraft safer. Critics say the controls are too sophisticated. This is the third crash since the A320 came into service four years ago. Pilot error was blamed for the previous two accidents. The main French navigators' union, USPNT, said the crash underlined the need for a three-man rather than a two-man cockpit crew in the A320. But the main French pilots' organisation, SNPL, said the pilots of Air Inter, the domestic carrier owned by Air France, had adapted to A320 technology and 'no longer had any real problems.'</p>

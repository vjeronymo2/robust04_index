			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / UK Company News: New projects help David Lloyd to Pounds 3m David Lloyd Leisure, the tennis and health club company, yesterday announced a 53 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.94m to Pounds 2.96m for the six months to March 31, fuelled by increased membership and contributions from two new projects. On a like-for-like basis, the clubs reported a 13 per cent rise, with membership fees up by 3 per cent more than the inflation rate. Turnover from continuing operations rose 26 per cent to Pounds 11m (Pounds 8.75m), helped by a 9 per cent increase in memberships from existing clubs to 23,000. The company's newest club, in Glasgow, cost more than Pounds 5m to develop and opened in October. It has already sold 3,000 memberships, and was profitable at the interim stage, despite a Pounds 150,000 write-off of pre-opening costs. In addition, the company saw a six month contribution from its new bowling centre in Raynes Park, London. It is on target with its stated policy of introducing two new clubs per year. Work has started on developments in Birmingham, Bristol and Reading, which are due to open in the first half of 1995. Interest payments dropped Pounds 524,000 to Pounds 143,000, due to the impact of cash raised from the March 1993 flotation. Gearing, however, has risen from 13 to 14 per cent in the past 12 months, and the company is signing up a Pounds 30m banking facility to help fund expansion. Earnings per share rose 15 per cent to 4.73p (4.1p). A first interim dividend of 1.45p is declared.</p>

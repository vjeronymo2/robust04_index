			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Economic confidence lifts metals The global economic outlook has not been so favourable since the 1980s, said RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, this week. And metals prices are certainly reflecting this view. Commodity and investment funds are piling into the metals markets, often ignoring the fact that the fundamental outlook for some materials - zinc and nickel for example - is not that bright. On the other hand, most analysts suggest that the present buoyancy in the aluminium and lead prices can be justified. Aluminium's price reached a fresh three and a half-year peak of USDollars 1,591 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange yesterday. Aluminium alloy, an LME contract launched two years ago to provide material mainly for the car manufacturers, reached a record level. Earlier in the week, lead moved to its highest price for two years. Buyers moved in for aluminium yesterday after the LME reported another substantial fall in stocks: 17,000 tonnes. Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, pointed out that this followed a drop of 104,000 tonnes in July, which was the biggest monthly fall since the LME started trading aluminium. But he warned that the market continued to rely on producers keeping to the output cuts made earlier this year and at present prices they were being severely tempted to restore production. Aluminium for delivery in three months closed last night on the LME at USDollars 1.586.75 a tonne, up Dollars 22.25 compared with a week ago. Lead, used mainly in batteries, also benefits from a healthy automotive market. Already lead is the best-performing LME metal since the world economic recovery began. Its price has risen by more than 70 per cent from the bottom of the trough in October last year from USDollars 357 a tonne to Dollars 625 at one point this week. Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Bain &amp; Co., pointed out that seasonal demand from the battery producers, who account for more than 70 per cent of lead demand, was helping tighten the market, as was a fall in exports from China, Russia and Kazakhstan. Gold bulls had a good week. First, they pushed the price through tough technical resistance at USDollars 390 a troy ounce and, after this gave way, moved on to press against the barrier at Dollars 392. Gold closed in London last night at Dollars 391.85, some Dollars 4.60 up from Friday's close last week. Meanwhile, the coffee market had a volatile week with prices rising close to 8 1/2 year highs set in July when Brazil's crop was damaged by frost. The trigger for a surge in prices came on Wednesday from the Brazilian government which hinted that it was reviewing its policy of auctioning off government-held stocks. Brasilia has so far sold 2.7m bags by weekly auction in order to dampen domestic prices and inflation. However, the policy has failed to push down internal prices and, with 5m bags of the stockpile still to sell, the government is expected to abandon its plans. The abandonment of the auction is likely to be bullish for the international coffee market as it will further restrict supply in an already tight market. Prices reacted by surging to Dollars 4,060 a tonne on Wednesday, but traders felt the market had overreacted and prices dropped on Thursday to Dollars 3,920 a tonne before moving back to Dollars 3,955 by the close in London last night, Dollars 115 up from the close on Friday last week.  --------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  --------------------------------------- Aluminium       -17,050 to 2,413,350 Aluminium alloy    -140 to    25,720 Copper           +1,600 to   369,400 Lead                +50 to   364,775 Nickel             +834 to   140,868 Zinc             +2,225 to 1,236,950 Tin                 +45 to    31,915  ---------------------------------------</p>

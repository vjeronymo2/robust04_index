			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Pollution Prevention Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (PPA) (42 U.S.C. 13101  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pub. L. 101&hyph;508, November 5, 1990) makes pollution prevention the national policy of the United States. The PPA identifies an environmental management hierarchy in which pollution ``should be prevented or reduced whenever feasible; pollution that cannot be prevented should be recycled in an environmentally safe manner, whenever feasible; pollution that cannot be prevented or recycled should be treated in an environmentally safe manner whenever feasible; and disposal or release into the environment should be employed only as a last resort *&blank;*&blank;*'' (Sec. 6602; 42 U.S.C. 13103). In short, preventing pollution before it is created is preferable to trying to manage, treat or dispose of it after it is created. According to the PPA, source reduction reduces the generation and release of hazardous substances, pollutants, wastes, contaminants or residuals at the source, usually within a process. The term source reduction ``include equipment or technology modifications, process or procedure modifications, reformulation or redesign of products, substitution of raw materials, and improvements in housekeeping, maintenance, training, or inventory control. The term `source reduction' does not include any practice which alters the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics or the volume of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant through a process or activity which itself is not integral to or necessary for the production of a product or the providing of a service.'' In effect, source reduction means reducing the amount of a pollutant that enters a waste stream or that is otherwise released into the environment prior to out-of-process recycling, treatment, or disposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PPA directs the Agency to, among other things, ``review regulations of the Agency prior and subsequent to their proposal to determine their effect on source reduction'' (Sec. 6604; 42 U.S.C. 13103). This directive led the Agency to implement a pilot project called the Source Reduction Review Project that would facilitate the integration of source reduction in the Agency's regulations, including the technology based effluent guidelines and standards. (See Section IV. B. for a more complete discussion of the Source Reduction Review Project.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Prior Regulation and Litigation for the Pesticide Chemicals Category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA promulgated BPT regulations for the Pesticide Chemicals Category on April 25, 1978 (43 FR 17778; 40 CFR part 455), and September 29, 1978 (43 FR 44846; 40 CFR part 455, subpart A). The BPT effluent limitations guidelines established a zero discharge limitation for the pesticide formulating and packaging subcategory (subpart C).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several industry members challenged the BPT regulation on April 26, 1978 and the U.S. Court of Appeals remanded them on two minor issues [ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> BASF Wyandotte Corp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Costle,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 596 F.2d 637 (1st Cir. 1979),  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> cert. denied, Eli Lilly  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Costle,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 444 U.S. 1096 (1980)]. The Agency subsequently addressed the two issues on remand and the Court upheld the regulations in their entirety [ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> BASF Wyandotte Corp.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Costle,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 614 F.2d 21 (1st Cir. 1980)].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On November 30, 1982, EPA proposed additional regulations to control the discharge of wastewater pollutants from pesticide chemical operations to navigable waters and to POTWs (47 FR 53994). The proposed regulations included effluent limitations guidelines based upon BPT, BAT, BCT, NSPS, PSES, and PSNS. The proposed effluent limitation guidelines and standards covered the organic pesticide chemicals manufacturing segment, the metallo-organic chemicals manufacturing segment and the formulating and packaging segment of the pesticide chemical industry. In addition, the Agency proposed guidelines for test procedures to analyze the nonconventional pesticide pollutants covered by these regulations on February 10, 1983 (48 FR 8250).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the new information collected by EPA in response to the comments on the November 30, 1982 proposal, on June 13, 1984, EPA published a Notice of Availability (NOA) of new information (49 FR 24492). In this NOA, the Agency indicated it was considering changing its approach to developing regulation for this industry. EPA requested comments on the data. EPA published a second NOA of new information on January 24, 1985, which primarily made available for public review technical and economic data which had previously been claimed confidential by industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA issued a final rule on October 4, 1985, that limited the discharge of pollutants into navigable wastewaters and into POTWs (50 FR 40672). The regulation included effluent limitations guidelines and standards for the BAT, NSPS, PSES, and PSNS levels of control for new and existing facilities that were engaged in the manufacture and/or formulation and packaging of pesticides. The regulation also established analytical methods for 61 pesticide active ingredients for which the Agency had not previously promulgated approved test procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several parties filed petitions in the Court of Appeals challenging various aspects of the pesticide regulation [ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Chemical Specialties Manufacturers Association, et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (86&hyph;8024)]. After a review of the database supporting the regulation the Agency found flaws in the basis for these effluent limitations guidelines and standards. Subsequently, the Agency and the parties filed a joint motion for a voluntary remand of the regulation in the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The Court dismissed the case on July 25, 1986, in response to the Joint Motion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upon consideration of the parties' motion to modify the dismissal, on August 29, 1986, the Court modified its order to clarify the terms of the dismissal. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals ordered that: (1) The effluent limitation guidelines and standards for the pesticide chemicals industry be remanded to EPA for reconsideration and further rulemaking; and (2) EPA publish a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice removing the remanded pesticide regulation from the Code of Federal Regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA formally withdrew the regulations on December 15, 1986 (51 FR 44911). Although the Agency found no errors in the analytical methods promulgated October 4, 1985, it withdrew these methods to allow for further testing and possible revision. The BPT limitations that were published on April 25, 1978, and September 29, 1978, were not affected by the withdrawal notice and remain in effect. Those existing BPT limitations regulations are not proposed to be changed in today's notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On September 28, 1993, (58 FR 50637) EPA published additional effluent limitations guidelines and standards under subpart A of part 455, which covers manufacturers of organic pesticide active ingredients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Scope of Today's Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulation proposed today would cover the pesticide formulating, packaging or repackaging industry by establishing effluent limitations guidelines and standards for the following subcategories:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

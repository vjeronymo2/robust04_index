			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 26 Feb (INA) -- Foreign Minister Muhammad  Sa'id al-Sahhaf has strongly condemned the ugly crime the  Zionist criminals committed against the sons of the Palestinian  people while they were performing prayer at the Ibrahimi Mosque  at dawn yesterday.    In a statement to the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY, the minister said  this appalling crime is a glaring example of racist Zionist  policy and how the United States and its Western allies react to  such acts.    He said the United States and its Western allies use the  most  violent means of interference in response to their supporters'  allegations about so-called human rights in one country or  another. But when large numbers of Palestinians are publicly  killed in a brutal and dirty manner, all that Washington,  London, and the other Western capitals offer is words.    Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf said: The way the United States and  some Western states reacted to this crime, which is part of the  genocide that the Palestinian people have been subjected to  since the partition and consequent usurpation of Palestine, is  evidence of the double standards the United States and its  Western allies follow in their dealings with world issues. We  have always noted these double standards. Wherever the United  States and its Western allies want to impose their political  will and their economic interests, they use the UN Security  Council and international organizations, as well as direct  force, to achieve their objectives. But when it has something  to do with peoples' rights and protecting them against genocide,  U.S. and Western reaction is confined to the shedding of  crocodile tears, maneuvers, and deception.    Concluding his statement, the foreign minister said: The  world peoples who love peace and justice and truly believe in  human rights, the peoples who denounced this dirty Zionist crime  against the people of Palestine, should denounce in the  strongest way the stand of the United States and some of its  Western allies on this crime. They should denounce their use of  double standards toward all fair world and Arab issues,  primarily the Palestine issue.</p>

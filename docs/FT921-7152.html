			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Appointments: Shuffle at S&amp;N Hugo Page Croft on Friday resigned from the board of Scottish &amp; Newcastle and his post as managing director of its wholesale beer business. The company refused to comment on the reasons for his departure. Page Croft, 47, had been a member of the board since 1988. He joined S &amp; N in 1985 when the brewer acquired Moray Firth Maltings, of which he was a founder-director. From 1986-88, he was md of William Younger, one of S &amp; N's operating companies. Guy Dickson, 46, present md of Scottish &amp; Newcastle Sales, will replace Page Croft with effect from May 4. A South African, he joined the company in 1979 as retail marketing manager. ***** Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, the world's biggest insurance services group, has announced a reorganisation of its senior management team, which entails a promotion for Philip Wroughton, 58, the London broker who has been deputy chairman of the group's brokerage division since 1988. Wroughton joined CT Bowring, acquired by Marsh &amp; McLennan in 1980, in 1961 and is well known in the London market as a reinsurance specialist. Separately, David Holbrook and John Sinnott are named co-chief executive officers of Marsh &amp; McLennan Inc, while Robert Clements, former chairman and ceo of the brokerage division, joins the main holding company as vice-chairman. Wroughton is a member of the council of Lloyd's, the governing body of the Lloyd's insurance market. ***** John Chisholm, who moved from the private sector last year to head the government's new Defence Research Agency (DRA), is taking Mike Good-fellow, a long-standing former colleague at the Sema software group, to join him as commercial director. The agency comprises four military research establishments and was set up with semi-autonomous status to improve cost-effectiveness and put facilities to better use, including for non-government clients. Goodfellow, 43, is being seconded from his job as technical director at BAeSema, a joint venture between Sema and BAe. The DRA has also appointed Graham Love, 37, as director of finance. He moves from Shandwick, where he was group financial controller.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, May 11 (XINHUA) -- In the first quarter  this year, more than 22,000 new employees were hired by  self-employed households in south China's Guangdong Province.    The number of registered self-employed households reached  1.22 million with 2.24 million employees.    Registered funds per household in Guangdong averaged 9,170  yuan, increasing by 5.1 percent over the average fund at the end  of 1993.    With the development of the socialist market economic  structure, governments at various levels in Guangdong have set  great store by the growth of self-employed households.    The governments in Guangzhou, Zhongshan, Shaoguan, Jiangmen  and Zhuhai cities have set preferential policies to support the  development of this type of private economy.    Meanwhile, Guangdong Province has also accelerated  construction of market places for the activities of  self-employed households.    In 1993, the provinces constructed more than 400 market  places with an area of about 2 million square meters.    In the first three months, the business volume of  self-employed households in Guangdong exceeded 10 billion yuan,  and retail sales of the households were 6.88 billion yuan,  accounting for 17.73 percent of the total retail sales of the  province.</p>

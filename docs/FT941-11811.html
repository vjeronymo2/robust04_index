			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Updated punchline for old German joke - BMW/Rover Deal 'BMW swallows Rover,' proclaimed a front-page headline in yesterday's Bild, the popular daily. 'English pissed off]' said the first sentence. Bild, a splashy but effective opinion former, was one of the few German newspapers to rush to judgment after Monday's takeover announcement. Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, the BMW chairman, had delivered 'a masterpiece of modern industrial policy,' it said in a leader. BMW was big, strong, successful, and had come through the auto industry crisis without a scratch. The brilliance of the deal had bathed the whole of German industry in sunshine. 'Onwards and upwards]' it concluded. In its less flamboyant way, the Frankfurt stock market also vigorously applauded the move. Following analysts' strong 'buy' recommendations, based mainly on the allegedly low price paid for Rover, BMW's shares closed DM51 (Pounds 19.40) higher yesterday at DM790 - bringing the surge since the start of Monday trading, when the news broke, to DM107. Daimler-Benz stock caught a little of the sun, too, rising DM6 to DM818 after losing DM4 the previous day. The quality press was decidedly guarded. Handelsblatt, the financial daily, was not sure that BMW's move out of its comfortable high-performance niche was altogether wise. The purchase would increase BMW's exposureto the cyclical bumps of the car market, it noted. Rover would also need continued financial support. The Suddeutsche Zeitung was puzzled that Honda letthe prize slip away. Was the real reason liquidity problems, or were the Japanese trying to push the price down? Whatever the reason, it hoped BMW did not become too cocky. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, which relegated the story to the fourth page of its business section, reflected the risk-aversion common in German business. Rover was not at the peak of health, and BMW's profitability was likely to be diluted, it said. Although several papers took the opportunity to revive an old German joke about British Leyland (once known as Britisch Elend or British Misery), most delicately avoided the nationalist or emotional issues involved. True to form, Bild quoted a UK car worker as saying:'Outrageous, why did we win the war?' But Handelsblatt side-stepped the issueeven in its page one splash headline: 'The last great British car maker will be steered by foreigners in future.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow welcomes the discussion by NATO of the  possibility of granting Russia a special status, Director of the  Russian Foreign Ministry's Department for European Cooperation,  Yuriy Ushakov, told Interfax.    He said that "judging from this discussion, many of our  ideas  concerning partnership and Relations with NATO are being  heeded." "We are optimistic about NATO's determination to  discuss relations with Russia. This is a move in the right  direction, because for natural reasons relations between Russia  and NATO have gone beyond the Partnership for Peace program," he  said.    To quote Ushakov, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's  visit to Brussels, scheduled for the next week, has two main  goals. "Firstly, it implies the discussion of the military  doctrine and high-level contacts with NATO. And secondly,  Grachev intends to discuss Russia's participation in the  Partnership program and consolidate the conceptual foundation of  our cooperation with NATO," he said.    He pointed out that the Partnership for Peace program was  mostly oriented to military cooperation. "At the current stage,  this is not the most important thing for us. Russia is  interested in real partnership, above all political and  economic," he went on to say.    He announced that Grachev would inform the NATO officials of  the Russian ideas of partnership with NATO. "We do not intend to  slow down our dealings with NATO. The essence of our relations  with NATO is far more important for us than any framework  documents similar to the Partnership for Peace program,," he  said. Russia's partnership with NATO has been developing even  without the Partnership for Peace program which does not add any  essential elements to our cooperation," said Ushakov.    No statements will be made in Brussels concerning the date  of  Russia's joining this program, he continued.    The Russian Defense Ministry welcomed the NATO discussion of  granting Russia a special status in the Partnership for Peace  program, the Defense Ministry told Interfax on Thursday.    Military experts noted, however, that it was not yet clear  what was actually meant by the term. Neither is it clear how  Russian representatives will be able to influence decisions  taken by the participants in the Partnership for Peace program.    Experts believe that the definition of Russia's status may  have the decisive impact on whether or not Russia will join this  program. "The final decision is to be taken by Russian President  Boris Yeltsin," said Ushakov.    As we reported earlier, Grachev's visit to Brussels and his  speech at the NATO headquarters, had been scheduled for May 24  and 25. Firstly, the visit implies the discussion of the  military doctrine and high-level contacts with NATO. And  secondly, Grachev intends to discuss Russia's participation in  the Partnership program and consolidate the conceptual  foundation of our cooperation with NATO. On his way to Brussels  (May 23), Grachev is to make a stop-over in Germany where he  will visit the Western Army Group and hold talks with German  bankers.</p>

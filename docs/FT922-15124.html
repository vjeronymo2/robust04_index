			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / EC-US agree on aircraft subsidies: Deal to limit government support lifts hopes for progress on world trade EUROPEAN Community and US trade negotiators ended six years of intermittent talks on aircraft subsidies early yesterday morning when they struck a deal to limit direct and indirect government support to civil aircraft manufacturers. The agreement, which has yet to be approved by US and EC governments, will remove one of the darkest clouds over their trade relations, and should provide a psychological boost to the flagging world trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Before leaving Brussels, Mr Michael Moskow, US deputy trade representative, said he was 'very pleased' with the deal, which should become the centrepiece of a multilateral agreement on aircraft subsidies under Gatt next year. A senior EC official said the agreement would mean a leaner and fitter aircraft industry on both sides of the Atlantic. Airbus said the agreement had lifted 'an important question mark on whether we could continue selling aircraft in the US without paying a penalty'. The US had threatened to impose special duties on Airbus air-craft. Boeing, the world's largest commercial aircraft maker, said it would not comment until the agreement was ratified. But US manufacturers appeared to consider the compromise as marking 'good progress'. But there are already fears that conflict over interpretation of the agreement may lead to new trade disputes, particularly in the sensitive area of indirect subsidies and government inducements to help sell aircraft. The dispute centred on US accusations that Airbus Industrie, the EC manufacturing consortium, received direct development aid from EC governments. In its turn, the Community claimed US manufacturers benefited from massive support disguised as space or military research grants. Both sides were forced to give ground to reach a compromise, although neither would quantify the new subsidy limits yesterday. EC negotiators believe the US has implicitly admitted that its manufacturers benefit from indirect support, by agreeing to limit such grants to less than 5 per cent of each company's civil aircraft turnover. The Community appears to have settled for an upper limit of about 30 per cent on direct subsidies, as a proportion of total development costs, on future airliner programmes compared with its original offer of 45 per cent. The US will now drop its threat to pursue the Airbus case through Gatt or take unilateral action against Airbus sales in its market. But Mr Moskow made clear that a parallel complaint - against a German government scheme to protect Deutsche Airbus from exchange rate fluctuations  -was a separate case. The EC will not go along with a Gatt panel's condemnation of the scheme although Bonn indicated this week it would alter the exchange rate guarantees it gives Daimler-Benz, the parent of Deutsche Airbus.

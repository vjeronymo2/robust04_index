			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xie Yicheng: "Zero Tolerance for Illegal Road Tolls"] </F>   [Text] Chinese authorities will press ahead with their  clampdown on illicit highway checkposts, charges and fines,  which block traffic and can undermine social stability, said  Communications Minister Huang Zhendong at a recent meeting in  Beijing.    A thorough probe will be launched this year by the ministry  to identify all toll posts across China's 1.07 million-kilometre  highway network. Then the ministry intends to pool efforts to  clear out any illegal or excessive tolls.    The ministry has also drafted a regulation on the  installation of highway toll stations, which is expected to take  effect later this year.    Under the rules, the rationale, location and charges of  highway toll stations will be standardized across the country.    The 2,800-kilometre State-level highway from Beijing to  Shenzhen will be set up as China's first "model road," where all  the checkposts, charges and fines are based on relevant rules.    The "model road" standard will be applied to all State-level  or provincial-level highways next year.    The ministry will also tighten its grip over its own law  enforcement teams on the highways to rein in any abuses of  power. To encourage local enthusiasm for highway construction,  the central government determined years ago that jurisdictions  borrowing money to build highways and bridges could levy tolls  to pay back their loans.    But many local departments abused the policy and put up  tollposts without approval, or collected tolls before building  the highways. Also, many individuals seeking easy money have  blocked the roads and posed as officials to compel passing  vehicles to pay "tolls."    In some chaotic highway sections drivers and trucking firms  are afraid of highway bandits at night and irrational charges or  fines during the day.    China's crackdown began in 1990 and has gathered momentum  since last August as part of the country's anti-corruption drive.    More than 10,000 officials participating in the crackdown  have covered 340,000 kilometres of highways -- about one-third  of the country's total.    Incomplete statistics show that 467 tollposts have been  removed and 54 irrational highway or waterway charges have been  halted over the past seven months.</p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Reno 'would be tough on crime' MS JANET Reno promised Congress yesterday she would be a tough law and order attorney-general whose priorities would be 'attacking violent crime, drug trafficking and public corruption'. She told the Senate judiciary committee at the opening of her confirmation hearings she would ensure civil rights laws and rules protecting the environment would be rigorously enforced. Polluters should be 'forced to clean up the mess they have left behind'. Ms Reno would be the first woman attorney-general if confirmed in office. This appeared in little doubt yesterday, as the committee greeted her with applause and initial questioning from senators of both parties revealed little controversy about her background and qualifications. Senator Joseph Biden, the Democratic chairman, and Senator Orrin Hatch, the ranking Republican, said they were satisfied there were no skeletons in her closet such as derailed two earlier candidates. Senator Hatch criticised the 'hate-mongering campaign' to which, he said, she had been subject; Senator Alan Simpson, Republican (Wyoming), remarked over the weekend that confirmation hearings had too often been marked by 'character assassination'. Senator Biden elicited from Ms Reno a commitment to crack down on domestic violence, as she had in her 15 years as a Florida state prosecutor. 'We need to send a clear message,' she said, 'that that will not be tolerated.' Senator Edward Kennedy (Massachusetts) urged her to work hard for effective gun control; she said she would. Most of her testimony was devoted to her own life, recalling her upbringing as the daughter of a Danish immigrant who became a newsman in Miami.</p>

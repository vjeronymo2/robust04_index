			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Peace beckons as Afghan opponents forge links: 'We are not here to fight,' a young guerrilla tells David Housego in Tange Pole Charqui, Afghanistan SOME OF the divisions which have rent Afghanistan during 13 years of civil war seemed to be disappearing yesterday as heavily armed mujahideen guerrillas linked up with government forces to guard strategic positions on the once dangerous highway linking Kabul to Jalalabad near the Pakistan border. At the entrance to the Kabul gorges where the road plunges between high cliffs, Nassir Mohammed, a young guerrilla fighter from the Harakat group, said: 'Mujahideen forces are here to combine with the army to bring peace to Afghanistan. We are not here to fight.' In a nearby hut, Colonel Ali Jan of the Tsarandoy, a paramilitary unit under the ministry of defence, said he had been told two days ago to co-operate with the mujahideen. Grinning as he sat opposite several mujahideen - all carrying automatic weapons or rocket launchers - he said: 'A year ago I would have killed them. A year ago I did kill one.' Asked whether he would serve a mujahideen government if this was formed in Kabul, he said: 'If it follows Islamic practice, then we will support it more than we did (President) Najibullah's regime or that of the king.' Both at Tange Pole Charqui, about 20km outside Kabul, and further down the Kabul gorge - the scene during early years of the war of devastating attacks by guerrillas on Soviet convoys - there were plenty of signs of mujahideen groups working together and across ethnic divisions. Present in the area were units of the Jamiat-i-Islami (controlled by Ahmad Shah Masood, now the main mujahideen leader), Harakat, and the Khalis Yunus group of the Pathan Abdul Haq. At several points along the road were burnt-out remains of army tanks and armoured personnel carriers. At Mahayapur a bus passed with mujahideen riding on the roof under orders to work with the army in reinforcing security around the southern perimeter of Kabul. The reinforcements are intended as a safeguard against a threat of attack by Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami movement who are resisting Mr Masood's domination of a post-war administration. But the Hezb look increasingly isolated and lack the strength to impose their will. At Mahayapur, there was a moment of tension when the rattle of automatic fire echoed across the gorge. But it turned out to be a young mujahideen testing his weapon. Mujahideen occupying a roadside house from which the roof had been blasted said they had only taken up the position yesterday. 'We are under orders not to fight but to work with the army,' said one. As yet no mujahideen have moved into Kabul where the army and police still operate on their own. In the hectic consultations to set up an interim administration that could take over from the government, Mr Benon Sevan, the UN special envoy, yesterday met Rashid Dostan, head of the Uzbek militia, in north Afghanistan and 50 other commanders who are part of Mr Masood's northern-based coalition. Near Pole Charqui, we passed prisoners just released from the nearby jail - one of the largest in the country and used both for political prisoners and captured mujahideen. Mohammed Shafi, 32, who had been imprisoned for two and a half years, said he had only heard of his release two hours previously. He had been an officer in the paramilitary forces who had also worked for Mr Masood's Jamiat-i-islami. In pouring rain he took off his socks to show how his toe nails had been torn off under interrogation. About 1,500 prisoners have been released this week in an effort to encourage compromise and reconciliation. 'Now the government know that they put nationalists in prison,' he said. 'They were in the wrong, not us,' he said. Barriers between the security forces and the mujahideen could disappear more rapidly than many people think because of the family links between the two. 'All my relations were in the mujahideen,' said Colonel Ali Jan of the Tsarandoy. Asked if he helped them during the war, he said: 'Naturally I did ', recalling an incident at nearby Sarobi where he provided a mujahideen unit with medicines, tea and sugar. Meanwhile, reports from Kabul yesterday said there were soldiers on the streets while shops were open and traffic moved normally. But there was an air of expectancy as people waited to see which way events would turn. Grounded aircraft and helicopters at the airport reflected the suspension of military operations against the mujahideen.</p>

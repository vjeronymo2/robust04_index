			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Better news from America WALL STREET'S reaction to the unexpectedly sharp rise in US payroll employment on Friday was telling: bond prices fell back in mild shock, but then recovered, and by the end of the day the yield curve was actually flatter. In short the US recovery, which is by now well established, still looks like a very moderate one. This is frustrating to the administration, which is looking for a political boost, and to the Fed, which had hoped for a stronger response to its quite aggressive monetary easing; but it suits the bond market. Growth looks strong enough to support tax revenues, but too weak to threaten a resurgence of inflation. It is easy to discount Friday's news: much of the growth was in health; manufacturing still looks sluggish, with shrinking order books; and in any case, there was an extra week in the survey period which is not reflected in any seasonal adjustment. Equally, the strong retail sales shown in recent store surveys can be put down to the weather, or a politically-motivated surge in Federal payments which will not recur. Meanwhile, car sales remain at historically depressed rates even after a modest April rebound. Positive signs Easy, then, to cavil; but almost certainly misleading. There are also hidden positive signs: the household survey of employment, which includes self-employment, is strongly positive - the strongest, in fact, in any post-war recovery; and payroll employment outside the growth sectors of retailing and health care has stabilised despite continued restructuring and layoffs in defence, finance and parts of the public sector. The private sector diffusion index - the proportion of all employers expecting to increase hirings - is now clearly positive. The puzzle for envious observers on this side of the Atlantic is to see what is driving any recovery at all. It is true that the Fed has responded, too slowly for some critics but far more strongly than any European central bank, to signs of self-imposed credit restraint. However, the figures for broad money and credit show no response - indeed, the growth of M2 fell through the bottom of the Fed's target range at its last reading. Strong personal income growth has not been enough to offset weak employment and weaker confidence in the UK; yet spending rises in the US despite the fact that real wage rates have hardly risen in a decade. Exports have accounted for well over half of US growth since the dollar was driven headlong from its 1985 peak, but most US export markets are now themselves depressed. Reviving confidence The first answer is that US domestic growth and employment growth are the two sides of a similar coin. The labour force is still growing, though less rapidly than in recent decades, strongly supported by immigration. This helps to explain low real income growth, low inflation and low personal savings rates; but it promises that reviving confidence in the jobs market - and confidence is reviving, according to recent surveys - will attract more participants. This is an economy without an effective labour constraint. This casts an odd light on the Europhobia which faces well-qualified would-be immigrants to most EC countries. A second answer is that US export growth is standing up well to sluggish demand in the outside world. This reflects not only an under-valued exchange rate - an example which cannot, by definition, be followed by everyone - but an open-minded trade policy. While the project for a North American Free Trade Area seems beset by snags, it has given the signal for dynamic growth. US exports to its economically tiny but potentially huge neighbour Mexico have been growing as fast as those to the entire EC. Contrast, again, the grudging response to the desperate trade needs of the former Warsaw Pact economies. It is ironic that these modest and sensible successes have been achieved at a time when American political self-doubt has never been stronger, when populists denounce the loss of jobs to Latin America, and minorities in US cities explode in mutual hate. But if returning economic success soothes these social problems, European economic leaders should be asking, between shouting-matches on trade, what they can learn from the US.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Golyayev: "Oleg Soskovets: We Must </F> Bring Order to the Economy"]    [Text] The latest conference of the government commission  on operational questions went on for over three hours and  examined measures to stabilize the work of the aluminum industry.    As in other sectors of the national economy, problems have  been building up here and they are holding back production  development. The situation is aggravated by the fact that prices  of this metal have slumped on the world market (we are largely  responsible for this) and demand has fallen in Russia itself.  The enterprise leaders addressing the conference insisted that  some kind of influence be brought to bear on the energy  industry, which has raised the prices of its products -- in  their view, this is inhibiting the sector's development. But,  as Railways Minister Gennadiy Fadeyev, who also came in for a  great deal of criticism, said at the conference, you cannot  generate your own economic prosperity at the expense of others.    After the conference First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets  answered journalists' questions:    [Question] How is the government reorganization going to  continue, indeed there is still one first deputy chairman  vacancy?    [Soskovets] There isn't a second first vice premier's post  in the plan that I possess. Nor is there an industry  commission, which I allegedly head.    [Question] The resignations of Gaydar and Fedorov got people  saying that the reforms were over. What do you think?    [Soskovets] I do not see in what way Fedorov and Gaydar are  more market-orientated than I.... The government's main task?  We must bring order to Russia.</p>

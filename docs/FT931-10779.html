			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Farewell to the bargain basement: Sterling's fall is shifting the balance of power between US and UK consumers When Richard McBrien, a London freelance author, published Buying Direct from the USA last June, it seemed a guaranteed best-seller. The booklet told British consumers how they could order by mail from the US products from jeans to computer software for two-thirds or less of the price at home - even after carriage, excise taxes and Vat. But the publication's popularity proved short-lived. After sterling fell out of the European exchange rate mechanism in the autumn, sales - which had been as high as 200 copies a day - dwindled rapidly. Although Mr McBrien still gets some inquiries, most concern items unobtainable in Britain, such as spare parts for American classic cars. For British tourists and shoppers, the great American fire sale is over. Since its 1992 peak of Dollars 2.004 in early September, the pound has lost almost 30 per cent of its value against the dollar, largely erasing the differential in transatlantic prices which last year turned the US into a vast bargain basement. Yet, though the US no longer offers outstanding value, it is still far from prohibitively expensive. An FT survey this week of a sample of goods and services found that, at a working exchange rate of Dollars 1.45 to the pound, relatively few goods cost much more in New York than in London - and many were still cheaper. Compared with a similar survey last July, among the most striking shifts in London's favour were car prices. The list price of a Japanese-made Toyota Lexus luxury saloon, which eight months ago was 29 per cent less in New York (including taxes), is 8 per cent higher there today. The US-made Jeep Cherokee, recently launched in the UK, costs 15 per cent more on its home turf. Sex with Madonna (the book) can be had in London for barely two-thirds its New York price, while those with more orthodox tastes in popular entertainment can make a similar-sized saving between the two cities on a front-stalls ticket for Phantom of the Opera. A Sony videocamera, which cost 39 per cent less than in London in July, is now priced at 6 per cent more - though the US version is, admittedly, a newer model. However, recently issued compact discs are still about a sixth cheaper in New York, as are Nintendo Gameboys. A Japanese-made Pentax zoom camera sells for a third less than in Britain, and the difference in the price of Levi Strauss jeans is even bigger. Such savings may no longer be enough to tempt shoppers across the Atlantic. But unless sterling plunges much further, living costs for British visitors should still be affordable once they get there - even on Manhattan, probably the most expensive destination in the US. At Dollars 3.34, a Big Mac hamburger and large fries is 17 per cent cheaper than in central London. At the other end of the scale, the discreetly luxurious Carlyle Hotel offers a Dollars 29 three-course set lunch. Even after the near-obligatory 20 per cent service charge, that compares well with the Pounds 25 table d'hote meal at the Connaught, the Carlyle's nearest London equivalent. The cheapest double room at the Plaza on Fifth Avenue is Dollars 246, about Pounds 170 at recent exchange rates. By contrast, London's Savoy charges Pounds 211. Partly for these reasons, the travel industry is far from despondent about prospects for British tourist traffic to the US. The Plaza says it had 50 per cent more UK guests staying last month than a year before. Thomson, Britain's biggest travel company, says the falling pound has not affected the group's US bookings. Many British tour operators have insulated themselves against sterling's fall by taking out foreign exchange cover. Thomson, which bought dollars forward at a rate of about Dollars 1.90, is guaranteeing to meet its current brochure prices until the end of the summer. For those yearning to see Mickey Mouse in his natural habitat, BA currently charges Pounds 2,322 for a one-week, all-in trip to Florida's Disney World for a family of four, compared with just Pounds 706 for two nights at Eurodisney. But on a per night basis the cost is comparable. In any case, who wants to visit northern France in February? The omens are mixed as to how many transatlantic tourists will be drawn to Britain this year. Travel agents and airlines in New York say sterling's fall has not yet given bookings a fillip, while the Savoy hotel group say signs of an increase in American guests are no more than a 'glimmer of light'. But at London's Inn on the Park hotel, Americans contributed two-thirds of a 12-point rise in the room occupancy rate last month, compared with a year previously. 'It will take time for the new value of the pound to filter through,' says Mr Ramon Pajares, general manager. 'If the pound stays at this level, we will see a substantial increase in Americans by April.' Mr Bill Melly, director of the Oxford Street Trad-ers' Association, which represents many West End stores, is also cautiously optimistic that his members will see more transatlantic customers this summer - provided there are no more serious bomb explosions in the area. However, he warns that the benefits of devaluation may be strictly temporary: 'Eventually, the merchandise which British retailers buy abroad gets more expensive, and that has to be passed through to the consumer.' That may mean retail prices across the Atlantic will again become a bargain. Such a differential has, in any case, long been normal for many internationally traded consumer products. For instance, British retailers say most Japanese consumer electronics companies have persistently charged them trade prices 20 per cent higher than in the US, even though the manufacturing cost of the products concerned was the same. Equally, car prices have long been lower in the US than on the other side of the Atlantic. However, the pattern may be changing. Timberland, the Maine producer of leisurewear, and Lands' End, a mail order clothing company based in Wisconsin which began selling in Britain two years ago, say they are holding their UK prices. Both companies are also pushing ahead with plans to expand their British sales. Lands' End says it can afford such a price freeze because it buys more products from suppliers based in the UK than it sells there. Timberland says it is ready to accept lower margins to increase market share. But there would also seem quite a lot of margin to cut. Six months ago, Timberland shoes cost a third more in Britain than in the US, while the price of the same shirt in Lands' End's US catalogue was half that in the UK version.

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Medeva shareholder sues over trading statements A SHAREHOLDER in Medeva, the drugs group which recently saw its shares halved following a profits warning, is suing the company and its directors over allegedly misleading trading statements. The group's shares fell a further 11 1/2 p to 95 1/2 p on the announcement. Analysts greeted the news with a weary resignation after a month in which the shares have fallen from a peak of 216p. 'This sort of thing is certainly not helping the cause,' said one. The shares fell sharply last month when the group warned its profits would be some Pounds 10m less than expectations of Pounds 55m to Pounds 57m. The warning came just three months after the group had launched a Pounds 94m 1-for-4 rights issue at 180p. The company said yesterday that it was too early to indicate the possible ramifications. The plaintiff had not specified the level of damages sought. However, it said it had been advised that such class action suits following a sharp decline in a company's share price were a common occurrence in the US. In general, the company said, such actions were settled out of court. However, Medeva was determined to oppose all claims in this case. The shareholder has launched a class action suit, aimed at representing US investors who bought American Depositary Receipts between January 14 and July 19, the date of the profits warning. It has been estimated that some 2m shares were traded during that period. The investor alleges that Medeva and some directors violated US securities laws by failing to warn the stock market of the group's impending troubles and being over-optimistic about prospects. Specific reference is made to comments by the company at the time of the merger with Armstrong Pharmaceuticals of the US in January, and at the time of the rights issue in April. The action has been lodged against all but two directors, the company and its main US subsidiary.</p>

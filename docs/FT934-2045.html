			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Andreotti interrogated over Mafia Mr Giulio Andreotti, the former Christian Democrat prime minister, has been interrogated for 12 hours by Palermo magistrates about his alleged links with the Mafia, writes Robert Graham in Rome. Media leaks have suggested Palermo magistrates had been able to corroborate evidence from Mr Balduccio Di Maggio, a former member of Cosa Nostra, the umbrella organisation of the Sicilian Mafia. Mr Andreotti was first warned in April he was under investigation for alleged links with the Mafia. In previous interrogations, he denied all contacts. Magistrates have uncovered evidence of Mr Andreotti meeting two Mafia figures, the Salvo cousins, linked to Mr Salvo Lima, his chief political representative in Sicily, murdered in 1992. Mr Andreotti has denied knowing the cousins.</p>

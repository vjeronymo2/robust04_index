			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent R. Safronov; from the "Vesti" </F> newscast]    [Text] A number of ministers in charge of social issues,  led by Yuriy Yarov, deputy chairman of the government, held a  news conference today. They revealed some very interesting  facts. For example, Labor Minister Gennadiy Melikyan said that  the number of people in Russia with incomes below the poverty  line nearly halved in February. The reason for this is that  people working in the public sector had a pay rise in that  month, the child allowance was increased, and pensioners began  receiving compensation for inflation.    However, the current year does not hold any bright prospects  in store. According to Yuriy Prokofyev, head of the Federal  Employment Service, the country today has 989,000 registered  unemployed, which amounts to one percent of the able-bodied  population. As for the real unemployment figure, currently  estimated at about 4 million, it could reach 6.5 million by the  end of the year, accounting for eight percent of the able-bodied  population. To prevent this category of the population from  sliding into extreme poverty, public works such as street  cleaning are to be organized, which will be paid for from the  federal budget. The 100 percent unemployed will receive an  unemployment benefit and those who would like to change their  profession will be offered retraining schemes, with grants  higher than the unemployment benefit.</p>

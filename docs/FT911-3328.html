			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Devenish hits back at criticism on strategy DEVENISH, the West Country brewer fighting off a hostile bid from Boddington, yesterday gave its first detailed response to the attack on its strategy by the pubs, hotels and health-care group. Directors met with advisers to begin drawing up 'a line by line rebuttal' to be sent to shareholders by May 6, 14 days after Boddington issued its formal offer document. Mr Michael Cannon, chairman of Devenish, responding to allegations that his company had committed a U-turn in buying and then selling wholesalers, accused Boddington of the 'biggest ever U-turn' in brewing history. Mr Cannon said: 'Ours was a blip of a U-turn compared with their massive blunder. The sale of our wholesalers was just a short, sharp reversal of strategy which generated a healthy profit. The same can not be said for Boddington's decision to buy and then sell its breweries.' Boddington bought the Oldham Brewery in 1982, followed by the acquisition of Higsons Brewery three years later. The group's brewing business was then sold by November 1989. The group said it recognised that 'the longer term prospects for profitable growth linked to brewing and brand ownership were unexciting'. In response to Boddington's accusation that Devenish had failed to achieve its ambition of increasing its estate from 400 to 1,000 houses, Mr Cannon said he still intended to buy more pubs 'but only when the price is right'. The West Country brewer is already buying individual pubs but admitted that it has put its plans to bid for a for a larger group of pubs on hold until the big brewers drop their prices. Mr Cannon also denied Boddington's charge that Devenish had wasted millions of pounds of shareholders' money on advertising the Newquay Steam brand. He said the promotional expenditure had been worthwhile and had helped push up sales to about 100,000 barrels a year. He added: 'The board's investment in Newquay Steam achieved its purpose. How does Boddington expect to launch a new product without advertising?'</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / International Company News: Australian cable TV venture stays intact Optus Vision, the consortium which was formed to build a broadband cable network across Australia and includes Mr Kerry Packer's Publishing &amp; Broadcasting group and Optus, the telecommunications carrier, said yesterday that it remained intact. It added that it was holding talks with the Australian government over the latter's stance on cable infrastructure regulation. The future of the consortium was thrown into doubt when Mr Michael Lee, the federal minister for communications, said he would not allow monopolies in cable infrastructure and would not act to stop geographical duplication of the networks planned by Optus Vision and Telstra. P&amp;B has already withdrawn from a potential ADollars 318m (USDollars 245m)investment in Optus as a result. However, Mr Bob Mansfield, head of Optus, said he hoped the government's stance would be clarified by Christmas. Mr Gerald Levin, chairman of Time Warner, admitted that the US-based company had been lined up to supply programmes to the Optus Vision pay-TV project, and now looked to be without an infrastructure supplier. He added, however, that the chapter was not closed.</p>

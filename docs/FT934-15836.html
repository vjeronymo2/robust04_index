			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Same difference anywhere Sir, Sometimes, neo-liberal zeal risks turning an otherwise excellent journalist into an ideological guerrilla. Stephen Fidler seems to consider the fact that a cup of coffee costs more at the counter than at the table as a definitive proof of the excesses of state intervention in Venezuela ('Anatomy of a stalled reform programme', October 4). However, what he fails to consider is that, no matter the country - and its development strategy, for that matter - the price for a coffee is always different depending on whether one takes it standing or sitting. Andrea E. Goldstein, 27, rue Campagne-Premiere, 75014 Paris, France</p>

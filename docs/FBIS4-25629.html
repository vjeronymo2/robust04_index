			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 13 (CNA) -- Taiwan's government and  private sectors are gradually reaching a consensus on slowing  down contacts with Mainland China, Hsu Hui-you, deputy  secretary-general of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said  Monday [13 June].    Hsu said that the change in mainland policy is inevitable in  light of the Qiandao Lake incident, which has once again exposed  the nature of the Beijing regime and their ideas about  cross-Taiwan Strait relations.    Hsu, a career attorney, said the recent trial of three  suspects involved in the Qiandao Lake murders was so speedy and  so simple that the whole process was not only "coarse" but also  "immoral."    Taiwan was denied a say in the trial, hsu said, adding that  the case early on turned from the criminal to political and  needed a political solution.    Hsu said Taiwan residents have been too hasty to develop  close ties with the mainland since the 40-year ban on  cross-strait contacts was lifted. The hastiness is  understandable, he said, as the Taiwan people could not help  themselves in the face of eager calls from the "homeland," and  seemingly unlimited business opportunities, he said.    Stricken with "mainland fever," Hsu said, Taiwan residents  forgot to remind themselves of the huge difference between the  two sides of the Taiwan Strait and the fact that Beijing has  never renounced its threat to take Taiwan by force.</p>

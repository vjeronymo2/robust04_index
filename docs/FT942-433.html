			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Management: Auditor takes on TV's darlings - Charles Allen, Granada chief, has big plans for LWT 'I really liked Cracker. I thought it was very powerful,' says Charles Allen, Granada Television's chief executive. The 37-year-old Scot from Lanark who began work as a trainee accountant at British Steel is not talking as a viewer but as someone who read the original script. He also turned up to see Robbie Coltrane film the off-beat police series in a leaky shed in Manchester. Allen's artistic judgment is not what he's paid for - though for what it's worth Cracker and Prime Suspect were the only ITV award winners at this year's British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards ceremony. His preparedness to understand the product and the process, though - as someone who had no previous experience in television - is an important feature of a management approach which has paid off handsomely at Granada and which is likely to help shape that company's integration of London Weekend Television. 'I probably read about two or three scripts a week,' says the man whose appointment in September caused alarm and despondency among some programme makers. 'In Granada I look at the whole development slate (of new programmes). It's much more about involvement than saying to programme executives: 'don't make this, or make that'. They obviously know much better than I do what works,' he says. Allen has been reading himself into running LWT since Granada's takeover in March and the subsequent departure of LWT chairman Sir Christopher Bland and chief executive Greg Dyke. In another move last week, Nick Elliott, managing director of LWT Productions, the company's programme-making arm, decided after 22 years to seek security in BBC Television as head of drama serials. The latest step in the integration of the two companies came yesterday with the announcement that Granada's advertising sales house, Time Exchange, and LWT's Laser would be merging. But the big plan for the future of a united Granada-LWT television group - who does what and who will survive - will be unveiled in the next four of five weeks. Allen's ability to double profits in three years, a target he sets himself when taking over responsibility for a business and which he achieved when running the contract catering business of Compass, the Granada leisure division and Granada Television, bodes well for the recently acquired company. He is nevertheless cautious about the scope for increasing profits at LWT - he admits it is already a well-run company. Allen concedes that even for someone who relishes change, the television sector is quite a challenge. 'To find an industry (television) that was changing completely at the same time as you were looking for a company to change completely, that was the big difference,' says Allen, whose career since 1983 has followed that of his mentor Gerry Robinson, chief executive of the Granada group. Allen spells out six rules for improving company profitability: Only employ top management even if it costs a lot of money; Keep management teams small to simplify communications; Get really upset when you are not getting quality; Make sure all staff sell services or programmes aggressively; Insist on a full price and prompt payment if you are confident of the services you are selling; Don't waste money doing it. When he started applying the rules to Granada, he found that despite its reputation for tight management the contrary was the case. More than Pounds 1m was saved, for instance, by new single-supplier agreements. Granada had at one time five separate video tape suppliers - and spent Pounds 500,000 a year on taxis. The number of people working on a programme has also been tackled by changing the ratio of staff to contractors. As a result, around 250 people previously on staff are now freelance. Allen's efforts at Granada have paid off. It is the only ITV company to earn more revenue from its programme sales to the ITV network centre, which commissions and schedules programmes, than it pays for its share of the national ITV network. While running Granada Television, Allen has insisted on closer links between programme makers and the commercial staff selling advertising. Together they have dreamed up new regional programmes aimed at young males in response to competition from Channel 4. Allen says that change at Granada has produced positive results mainly because he stuck to his original plan and never forgot it. 'The key is putting systems in place and coming back tenaciously every single month,' he says. Equally deliberately, Allen keeps Fridays free to catch up. That is when his staff really need to watch out. Some will get scrawly handwritten notes saying he's liked something they've done. But in an industry where everything tends to be 'wonderful darling', Allen balances the congratulatory notes with telephone calls expressing extreme disappointment. Allen says he has spotted another script that is up to the Cracker standard. It is called Band of Gold. 'I think it will be quite a strong and important piece. That's the one I will be banking on next year,' he says.</p>

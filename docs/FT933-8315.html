			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / S Korean stocks storm subsides CALM returned to South Korea's financial markets yesterday as the stock market rebounded sharply after tumbling late last week in response to a ban on the use of aliases in financial transactions, writes John Burton in Seoul. The general share price index rose by 25 points from Saturday's close to 691, although it still remains below the 725 level on Thursday when the ban was announced. Trading was brisk at 31m shares, twice last week's volume, as investors took advantage of buying opportunities.</p>

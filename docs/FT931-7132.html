			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Stalin's nuclear city goes on the market ONE of Russia's most secret cities has taken on western privatisation experts to help it sell off shops, restaurants and small businesses. Tomsk-7, its secrecy denoted by the number, was created by Stalin in 1949 to help the Soviet Union make a nuclear bomb. Set in the heart of Siberian forestland, the town is still so heavily guarded that even a trip to the beach involves crossing a Russian equivalent of Checkpoint Charlie, lest intruders try swimming across from the other side of the Tom river. It is still closed to foreigners, and even Russians from other parts of the country. Its main role is to produce enriched uranium and plutonium for nuclear weapons. A spin-off is to supply 40 per cent of the heating for the neighbouring city of Tomsk. Barbed-wired gates to the town slam shut behind a bus carrying in a team from the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's investment arm, and another set of gates bar the way ahead. A guard from Russia's internal troops checks passports. The restrictions on visitors to the town will go once its remaining two military reactors are closed, Mr Yuri Krasnov, the city council chief, says, although the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry says this is unlikely to happen until the year 2000. It says a new power plant has to be built for Tomsk and a new centre made ready to cleanse ageing plutonium which needs replacing in nuclear warheads not earmarked for destruction. The difficulties of shifting Russia's military-industrial machine mean that Tomsk-7 will continue to produce new plutonium to renew existing warheads for the foreseeable future. The task of adjusting is especially hard for a town of 100,000 inhabitants geared to just one thing. As one IFC official put it: 'Does anyone know how to restructure a closed city which makes plutonium?' 'Two years ago we could not even invite foreigners here,' says Mr Krasnov, who keeps in his office a portrait of Andrei Sakharov, the nuclear physicist turned human rights champion. A straw poll of residents asked about privatisation showed support for any reform which might improve supplies of food and consumer goods that were once among the best in the country thanks to the city's special status. The IFC's brief is to try to help do just this. However, Mr Nikolai Proponenko, Tomsk-7's deputy mayor, has also been quick to ask for IFC help in finding investors or customers for the larger establishments which are its main source of employment. The city's chemical works, said to devote just 10 per cent of its capacity to producing components for nuclear weapons, is looking, for instance, to market extra-powerful magnets and metallic powders for the ceramics industry. 'Apart from the service sector we have nothing that can generate new jobs,' Mr Proponenko explained. 'We cannot change the profile of the industry we already have.'</p>

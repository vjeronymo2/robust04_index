			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=69 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=41 g=1 f=1 -->  <RINDOCK>[Docket No. 50&hyph;416] </RINDOCK> <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=55 g=1 f=1 -->  <DOCTITLE>Entergy Operations, Inc., System Energy Resources, Inc., South Mississippi Electric Power Association, Mississippi Power and Light Co.; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License and Opportunity for a Hearing </DOCTITLE> <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;29, issued to Entergy Operations, Inc. (the licensee), for operation of the Grand Gulf Nuclear Station, Unit 1, located in Claiborne County, Louisiana.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendment, requested by the licensee by letter of October 15, 1993, would represent a full conversion from the current Technical Specifications (TS) to a set of TS based on NUREG&hyph;1434, ``Improved BWR/6 Technical Specifications,'' Revision O, September 1992. NUREG&hyph;1434 has been developed through working groups composed of both NRC staff members and the BWR/6 owners and has been endorsed by the staff as part of an industry-wide initiative to standardize and improve TS. As part of this submittal, the licensee has applied the criteria contained in the Final NRC Policy Statement on Technical Specification Improvements to the current Grand Gulf Nuclear Station, Unit 1 Technical Specifications utilizing BWR Owners' Group (BWROG) report NEDO&hyph;31466, ``Technical Specification Screening Criteria Application and Risk Assessment,'' (and Supplement 1) as incorporated in NUREG&hyph;1434.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee has categorized the proposed changes into four general groupings. These groupings are characterized as administrative changes, relocated changes, more restrictive changes, and less restrictive changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrative changes are those that involve reformatting, renumbering and rewording of the existing TS. The reformatting, renumbering and rewording process reflects the attributes of NUREG&hyph;1434 and do not involve technical changes to the existing TS. Such changes are administrative in nature and do not impact initiators of analyzed events or assumed mitigation of accident or transient events.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Relocated changes are those involving relocation of requirements and surveillances for structures, systems, components or variables that do not meet the criteria of inclusion in TS as identified in the Application of Selection Criteria to the Grand Gulf Nuclear Station TS. The affected structures, systems, components or variables are not assumed to be initiators of analyzed events and are not assumed to mitigate accident or transient events. The requirements and surveillances for these affected structures, systems, components or variables will be relocated from the TS to administratively controlled documents. Changes to these documents will be made pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59. In addition, the affected structures, systems, components or variables are addressed in existing surveillance procedures which are subject to 10 CFR 50.59 and subject to the change control provision in the Administrative Controls Section of the TS. These proposed changes will not impose or eliminate any requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> More restrictive changes are those involving more stringent requirements for operation of the facility. These more stringent requirements do not result in operation that will alter assumptions relative to mitigation of an accident or transient event. The more restrictive requirements continue to ensure process variables, structures, systems and components are maintained consistent with the safety analyses and licensing basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Changes characterized as less restrictive have been subdivided into four additional subcategories. They include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Relocating details to TS Bases, the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR), or procedures.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The requirements to be transposed from the TS to the Bases, USAR or procedures are the same as those currently included in the existing TS. The TS Bases, USAR and procedures containing the relocated information are subject to 10 CFR 50.59 and are subject to the change control provisions in the Administrative Controls section of the TS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Extension of instrumentation surveillance test intervals (STIs) and allowed outage times (AOTs).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed changes affect only the STIs and AOTs and will not impact the function of monitoring system variables over the anticipated ranges for normal operation, anticipated operational occurrences, or accident conditions. However, the changes are expected to reduce the test related plant scrams and test induced wear on the equipment. General Electric Topical Reports GENE&hyph;770&hyph;06&hyph;1 and GENE&hyph;770&hyph;06&hyph;2 showed that the effects of these extensions of STIs and AOTs, which produced negligible impact, are bounded by previous analyses. Further, the NRC has reviewed these reports and approved the conclusions on a generic basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Relocation of instrumentation only requirements (which provide no post-accident function).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These requirements are part of the routine operational monitoring and are not considered in the safety analysis. Changes made to the Bases, USAR, and procedures containing the relocated information will be made in accordance with 10 CFR 50.59 and are subject to the change control provisions in the Administrative Controls section of the TS. These proposed changes will not impose or eliminate any requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other less restrictive changes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Additional changes that result in less restrictions in the TS are discussed individually in the licensee's submittal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

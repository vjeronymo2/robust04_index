			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NAKED MISTAKES  </P> <P> Patrick Goldstein's indignation over the nude model in the Billy Joel ad (Pop  Eye, Sept. 9) is surpassed only by the writer's illiteracy. Did he really  write, "But you can't help but wonder -- aren't their (sic) any women in the  music biz who think its (sic) tacky (and yes, sexist) to use female nudity to  sell records?" I would suggest Mr. Goldstein take his sensitivity to a local  junior high and learn some rudiments of English. The Times might like to have  their proofreaders accompany him.  </P> <P> WILLIAM H.

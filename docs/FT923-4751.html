			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Budapest looks for strength in salami - Brokers hope that two new share issues will revive the market Never before has so much depended on a sausage, however noble a variety. Budapest's anaemic stock market, hungering for nourishment, is eagerly awaiting the flotation of Pick Salami, the leading producer of Hungary's very own sausage. Brokers hope that the launch of Pick, which started marketing its flotation earlier this week, and Danubius Hotel and Spa Company, which follows, will end a dry spell of share issues, overlay investors' bitter experience of Hungarian privatisation issues and draw them back to the market. Above all, the two offerings, which are to be floated in Budapest and placed privately abroad, have to overcome the poisonous legacy of Hungary's first privatisation issue. Ibusz, the national travel agency, went public and launched the Budapest Stock Exchange in June 1990 in a blaze of glory. But it then lost its investors, mainly foreigners, a lot of money with the stock falling 44 per cent from its issue price. The market as a whole has not dazzled, either. The BSE index, battered by local wars and a depressed economy, languishes at 826, down from last year's peak of 1,227 and only 60 points above its all-time low. Brokers, although embarrassed on many occasions over the past two years by misplaced optimism, are nevertheless cautiously upbeat about Pick and Danubius. Mr Zsigmond Jarai, Hungarian manager of James Capel, the UK broker involved in both forthcoming issues, says: 'Pick will help to promote a second chapter in the history of the stock exchange.' The salami manufacturer and the hotel chain are widely regarded as quality shares - their earnings are relatively well-insulated against Hungary's economic recession and their prospectuses are an improvement on those of earlier issues. Equally important, the government is trying to make privatisation more popular and so the pricing promises to be keen to ensure success and provide investors with a nice capital gain. Pick is likely to be priced at 6 to 7 times earnings, compared with a market p/e of 16.4 at the end of the first half. This year's rises in Fotex, a retailing group and the most traded share, and Styl, a privatised clothing manufacturer, have given punters a taste of the profits they can make. The other big difference this time is that interest rates have fallen dramatically. Three-month Treasury bills yielded just 16.55 per cent at last week's latest auction, down from 35 per cent a year ago, giving equities a chance against bank deposits in attracting retail investors. Many analysts, however, argue that equity issues, while they may be prestigious and attract attention, remain marginal to the Hungarian stock market. Mr Paul Greatbatch, a board member of Lupis Brokerhaz, a leading domestic broker, says: 'The equity market performs the same role as owning a vintage Rolls Royce. It is of limited everyday use, but it impresses the neighbours.' Turnover in the BSE's 21 shares for the whole of July was only Ft480m (Dollars 6.3m) and the market's capitalisation is about Ft36bn (Dollars 500m). Volume is low partly because Budapest's settlement system, convoluted by foreign exchange controls, pushes trading off the exchange. In Hungarian shares, foreign markets - Vienna, London and New York - out-trade Budapest by up to five to one. But even taking into account the trading abroad, and Budapest's large OTC market, dominated by bank shares, equities are likely to be dwarfed by trading in government debt, which Mr Greatbatch describes as Hungary's 'first serious securities market'. On the one hand, the state budget deficit is growing rapidly, with the government forecasting a shortfall of about Ft200bn (up to 8 per cent of GDP) both this year and next; and new legislation forces the government to finance the bulk of that on credit markets. On the other, banks and individuals remain downbeat about the economy and risk-averse, so government paper still looks attractive in spite of falling yields.</p>

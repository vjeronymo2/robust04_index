			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> DEMOCRATIC RIVAL ENDS YOUNG'S GOVERNOR BID;  </P> <P> ELECTIONS: GEORGIA'S LONGTIME LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR HAS A 20-POINT LEAD IN THE  POLLS OVER THE FORMER ATLANTA MAYOR AND U.N. AMBASSADOR.  </P> <P> Georgia Lt. Gov. Zell Miller won the Democratic nomination for governor  Tuesday, cutting short Andrew Young's effort to become the state's first black  governor.  </P> <P> With 26% of precincts reporting, Miller had 153,602 votes or 71% and Young had  62,984 votes or 29%, clearly enough to assure victory.  </P> <P> Miller will face state Rep. Johnny Isakson, the Republican nominee, in November  elections. Isakson had won the nomination outright in the July 17 primary.  </P> <P> For Young, the loss closes a chapter in his long history of public service,  including stints in Congress, the United Nations, and as mayor of Atlanta, and  raises the question of what his next endeavor will be.  </P> <P> Since the primary last month in which he outpolled Young but failed to win a  majoity of Democratic votes, Miller, who has been lieutenant governor for 16  years, had amassed a 20-point lead in public opinion polls.  </P> <P> In an effort to overcome that lead, Young, in the final days of the contest,  resorted to attack ads, labeling Miller "Zigzag Zell" and accusing him of  waffling on several issues.  </P> <P> Also, Young, who was accused of ignoring black voters before the first round of  voting, made a concerted effort to attract them in recent weeks. He could be  heard on black-oriented radio stations, touting his record as mayor of Atlanta  and boasting of his achievements in the civil rights movement as a chief aide  to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.  </P> <P> However, Miller had hit upon an issue that proved to be a winner: a state  lottery. Georgians by the thousands trek to Florida to buy lottery tickets and  responded to Miller's promise to start one in this state. Miller also promised  to apply part of the lottery proceeds to help the state's schools.  </P> <P> Miller's other high-profile campaign issue was the drug war, as he vowed to  establish "military-style boot camps" for first offenders.  </P> <P> For his part, Young emphasized his worldwide contacts gained during his tenure  as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and promised to attract business to  the state, this providing jobs and economic prosperity.  </P> <P> In other elections Tuesday:  </P> <P> In Kansas, first-term Gov. Mike Hayden fought for survival in a Republican  primary as his chief opponent, real estate executive Nestor Weigand Jr., tried  to capitalize on voter anger over higher property taxes. On the Democratic  side, former Gov. John Carlin was favored to win the first round of a comeback  bid.  </P> <P> In Michigan, Republicans picked opponents for two Democratic incumbents seeking  third terms -- Gov. James Blanchard and Sen. Carl Levin. Polls showed Rep. Bill  Schuette a heavy favorite over lawyer Clark Durant for the right to challenge  Levin. State Sen. John Engler was expected to trounce General Motors engineer  John Lauve and earn a shot at Blanchard.  </P> <P> In Missouri, Rep. Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, sought the  Democratic nomination for an eighth term against Nicholas F. Clement, a  newspaper carrier who is a follower of extremist Lyndon H. LaRouche JR.  </P></p>

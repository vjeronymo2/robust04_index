			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Ramos catches up with rival in Philippine poll MR FIDEL RAMOS, the former Philippine defence chief, last night caught up with his main rival Mrs Miriam Defensor Santiago, in the race for the presidency, according to latest unofficial counts based on a sixth of the votes cast in Monday's election. Earlier Mrs Santiago, a lawyer and anti-corruption campaigner, had claimed victory but her opponents had said her claim was premature. Quoting Winston Churchill, the outspoken Mrs Santiago said she would be magnanimous in victory. 'Certain losers among the presidential candidates might try to cheat, and may even have started doing so,' said Mrs Santiago, who hopes to undermine the country's oligarchy of influential families, 'but the youth and all the Filipinos who helped me to win will not allow the triumph of evil'. Mr Ramos had said yesterday afternoon that he expected the rankings to change in his favour as votes came in from the provinces following Monday's presidential, congressional and local elections. The lengthy manual process of counting ballot papers - each with up to 44 handwritten names - from as many as 27m voters has already given rise to several disputes in local political contests, but businessmen have reacted favourably to the relatively peaceful conduct of the poll. Both Mr Ramos and Mrs Santiago are regarded as candidates who would encourage private enterprise and foreign investment, and the twin stock markets of Manila and Makati rose more than 7 per cent yesterday from their levels on Friday after holidays on Monday and Tuesday. The Manila Stock Exchange composite index rose 93.02 points to 1,328.04. A glance at the official table of comparative statistics on violent incidents in recent elections helps to explain the euphoria. Between January 12 and yesterday morning there were only 12 'liquidations' (assassinations) throughout the islands, compared to 95 in the chaotic 1986 presidential elections and 93 in the local elections of 1988. Sceptics, however, have noted that the election cannot be said to be finished until the results are clear and have expressed fears about the destabilising effect of the long counting period. In an attempt to defuse the tension, the Commission on Elections yesterday warned candidates against making premature victory claims and announced an agreement with television and radio stations under which all unofficial counts - except for one authorised by the Commission - would cease from noon today.</p>

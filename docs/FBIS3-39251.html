			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Sian Clare, PRESS ASSOCIATION lobby correspondent] </F>   [Text] The Prime Minister today marked the fifth  anniversary of the late Ayatollah Khomeyni's death threat to  author Salman Rushdie by warning Iran it could not enjoy "full  and friendly relations" with the rest of the world until it was  lifted.    But as John Major issued a statement backing Mr Rushdie,  Iran  renewed its threat to the author's life. Javad Larijani, an  adviser to Iranian president Hashemi Rafsanjani, said: "We  consider Rushdie as a man who tried to betray Islam, to  downgrade Islam and to downgrade the sentiments of more than one  billion Muslims. So...he does not deserve to exist."    On February 14, 1989, Ayatollah Khomeyni, then leader of the  Islamic Republic of Iran, issued his death threat -- or fatwa --  against Mr Rushdie and others associated with the publication of  the author's book The Satanic Verses.    Mr Major said in his statement: "I met Salman Rushdie last  May to demonstrate the Government's full support for his  fundamental rights.    "I have been heartened by the way in which many governments  around the world have demonstrated their support both by meeting  Mr Rushdie and in their discussions with the Iranian government.    "We all want to make clear to the Iranian government that  they cannot enjoy full and friendly relations with the rest of  the international community unless and until we can be satisfied  that there is no further direct or indirect threat from the  Iranian authorities to Mr Rushdie's life, or to that of others  associated with his book.    "I hope very much that they will listen to the message."  When  on Tehran radio Ayatollah Khomeyni pronounced on Mr Rushdie for  alleged blasphemy, his words changed the Indian-born author's  life, led to a breakdown in relations between Europe and Iran,  and sparked violence across the Muslim world. Now, despite  statements that Mr Rushdie intends to resume a more normal life,  there is little prospect that he will be able to do so. So  serious is the death threat that ever-watchful Special Branch  bodyguards still move him from safe house to safe house. In the  first five months of his "captivity" he was shifted 50 times.    Hitmen have already killed the Japanese translator of The  Satanic Verses and attacked the Italian translator. Last  October, the Norwegian publisher of the novel was shot and  seriously wounded outside his home in Oslo.    The author's 24-hour protection has so far cost an estimated  &pound;5 million, but he has contributed more than  &pound;500,000 of  his own money.    When Mr Major met Mr Rushdie at the Commons last May, Iran  responded by raising from &pound;14 to &pound;504 the cost of a  visa  for British citizens travelling to Tehran. At the same time,  top Iranian officials reiterated that Ayatollah Khomeyni's death  sentence on Mr Rushdie was "irrevocable."    Despite reaffirmation of the death threat, Mr Rushdie has  refused to remain hidden, visiting 15 countries since June 1992  and even sharing a stage with rock group U2 before 70,000 fans  at Wembley Stadium.    Last November he met President Bill Clinton at the White  House.    Tehran cut relations with Britain in March 1989 over  publication of Mr Rushdie's book. Diplomatic links were  restored in September 1990, but Britain has made it clear that  the resumption of full diplomatic relations depends on Iran  lifting the fatwa.</p>

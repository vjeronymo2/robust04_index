			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CLEANUP OF PCH LANES COMPLETED AFTER SLIDE  </P> <P> Caltrans completed its cleanup Thursday of the stretch of Pacific Coast Highway  that a landside closed on Tuesday and Wednesday.  </P> <P> Two northbound lanes in Pacific Palisades were closed for minor cleaning and  restriping early Thursday, but were reopened shortly afterward, said Caltrans  spokeswoman Margie Tiritilli.  </P> <P> Although geologists initially speculated that a 20-yard-long section of the  side of the bluff would have to be removed, Tiritilli said Caltrans has no  plans to work on the wall.  </P> <P> "If we didn't feel that it was safe we wouldn't have our work crews there and  we wouldn't open it up for drivers," she said.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, a sheet of rocks and earth swept down a cliff behind the 15000  block of Corona del Mar and onto the freeway. Two motorists suffered minor  injuries.  </P></p>

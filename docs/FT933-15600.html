			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Oil on Algeria's troubled waters: There is little hope for peaceful change as the governmentsets a timetable for elections What Algeria's press ruefully calls the country's 'multi-dimensional crisis' has claimed another 11 lives this week. The three soldiers among the dead bring to 78 the number of Algerian security personnel slain by Islamic extremists in the past seven months. Diplomats put the death toll of the violence which has ravaged Algeria since the annulment of its first multi-party elections in late 1991 at 1,000. Algiers, the capital, has been under a night-time curfew for months. But political violence is only the starkest symptom of Algeria's ills. Since the military-backed government deprived the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) of victory in the second round of the 1991 poll, Algeria has been pitched into a combination of political convulsion and economic straits unequalled in its 30 years of independence from France. 'Everything is in the air at once,' says Mr Omar Belouchet, editor of El-Watan newspaper and survivor a few weeks ago of an assassination attempt. 'The future of Algeria is being decided, debated, now, passionately and violently at every level. We are deciding on a project for our society.' This 'project' took its violent turn straight after cancellation of the elections, an act pressed on the government by the army, which then set up a five-man presidency known as the High State Council to govern the country. The FIS was outlawed, although its anti-government rhetoric, populist appeal to the poor, and promise to install an Islamic state won it 3m votes and an unassailable majority in the 430-seat assembly in the 1991 poll. Its leaders were detained, or they fled, and a battle started between armed extremists and the police, punctuated by assassinations of eminent scholars and writers. Last month, however, the state council took what it claims is the first step towards restoring Algeria's political balance and, eventually, to bringing in democracy. It has laid out a draft transition plan - to be discussed by the main political parties, including two permitted Islamic groups, and the main, republican leftist parties - allowing for presidential elections no sooner than 1996, but no later than 1997. By ruling out elections until 1996, diplomats, politicians and academics believe, the state council is giving itself time to achieve its two greatest priorities: to restore security, and to revive Algeria's economy. The government's political project will depend essentially on achieving these goals. One senior diplomat puts it more strongly: 'The government is certainly trying to bolster its own legitimacy by seeking consensus, but finally the regime's top priority, raison d'etre even, is to smash Islamic fundamentalism.' Few in Algeria underestimate how bloody a fight this will be. Although residents of some 'hot' FIS areas in Algiers say attacks on security forces have dropped since 15,000 troops were brought in to the capital recently, there is plenty of evidence that extremists are able to carry out well-planned ambushes with groups of 10-20 heavily armed men. But the logic of the government's strategy is that it can seriously damage support for the Islamic extremists if it tackles the social and economic deprivation from which the FIS appears to draw its nourishment. Its hopes for the economy rest on optimism over the country's unexploited resources in hydrocarbons - oil and gas - and success in mastering its foreign debt. Algeria leans heavily on its oil, gas and other hydrocarbon exports, which bring in more than 95 per cent of the country's hard currency earnings - about Dollars 11bn last year. But a crippling 71 per cent of export earnings are devoured servicing Algeria's Dollars 27bn external debt, leaving the country's industries starved of money to buy spares and raw materials. The government blames this hard currency shortage, above all, for unemployment of more than 20 per cent and the fact that state enterprises - which make up about 80 per cent of Algeria's industry - are running at an average 60 per cent of capacity. But the government calculates it will be over the crest of its present debt servicing mountain within three years, and western economists agree that by 1996 Algeria's payments of interest and principal should fall to 50 per cent of hard currency earnings. As important as the fall in its debt servicing is the potential rise in its export earnings. Since Algeria abandoned its determination to develop its hydrocarbon wealth without foreign involvement in the late 1980s, it has signed more than 30 exploration and production sharing deals with foreign oil companies. The arrival of companies such as BP, Repsol, Arco and more than 20 others is expected to lead to fresh discoveries, and to improve the exploitation of oil and gas already found. The government estimates that total investment in the industry will reach Dollars 19.3bn by 1997. Natural gas sales were already expected to double to 60bn cu m by 2000 through announced plans to double its present pipeline capacity to Italy and for the construction of a fresh link to Spain. 'Algeria's gas is very strategically placed for the south European market, which is growing fast,' says Mr David Drury, BP's general manager in Algiers. Figures from Sonatrach, the state oil group, suggest the value of hydrocarbon sales should rise to about Dollars 13bn by 1997, assuming oil at Dollars 20 a barrel. Some western economists believe that earnings of this order, combined with a reduced debt burden, could leave Algeria with an extra Dollars 5bn a year to spend on the domestic economy. It is this bonus on which the government is counting. 'The government thinks that as revenues grow it can afford more openness politically, but while 70 per cent of their resources are paying off debt they have no room for political manoeuvre,' says one western ambassador. But it may be dangerous to bet on an essentially economic solution to the country's political problems. First, the government is assuming that the boost to export earnings will easily translate into job creation. Many economists seriously doubt this will happen, given the government's continued commitment to a largely state-run economy. 'So far the government's policy is essentially to pour money into inefficient public sector enterprises,' says a western economist. 'And there's no chance in hell that will work. These enterprises are not economic concerns, they're employment agencies.' The government also appears to be hoping to weather the period up to 1996-97 without any further political fissures blowing open. Many question this, too. Among politicians, there are already clear signs that the government's hoped-for 'national consensus' may be illusory. 'It will be impossible to reach consensus while there are two completely opposing political beliefs in the country - Islam and republicanism,' says Mr Mustapha Bacha, national secretary of the RCD Republican party. 'Even the so-called democratic parties are absolutely divided,' says newspaper editor Mr Belouchet. 'They have absolutely nothing in common.' Furthermore, at street level, where the FIS appeared to draw much of its support in 1991 from among Algeria's tens of thousands of young unemployed, the next three years before the arrival of the country's expected oil and gas bounty promise only more austerity. Some diplomats are concerned that this, the tough police clampdown and the curfew could produce a dangerously volatile mix. Islamic activists argue, meanwhile, that nothing the government does in the next two years can diminish the appeal of the fundamentalists in any circumstances. 'FIS may no longer be a political party, but it's become a popular phenomenon,' says an Islamist lawyer close to the now banned party. 'You can't dissolve a popular phenomenon by judicial decree or by offering it money.' The country's natural wealth means there is some hope for the economy. But by leaving its political role to an ill-defined attempt to rally 'consensus'  -one that prohibits the group that nearly won the last elections - many believe the government is taking the same risk it took in 1991, when it miscalculated the people's political aspirations so badly. The cost of such a miscalculation would be further and continuing bloodshed.</p>

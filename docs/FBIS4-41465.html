			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: by correspondents </F> Igor Porshnev, S. Kolosova, and others]    [Text] China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen is due to come  to Moscow on Monday [27 June] evening. On Tuesday he is  scheduled to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev.  It is not ruled out that Russian President Boris Yeltsin will  meet with the Chinese minister as well, Russia's Deputy Foreign  Minister Aleksandr Panov reported in his interview with Interfax  Friday.    As he said, the parties will continue preparation for an  official visit of Chairman of the People's Republic of China  Jiang Zemin scheduled for September. "In addition, it is  necessary to coordinate our positions on several sharpest  international problems, in particular, to discuss preparation  for the first ASEAN forum on security which is to be held late  July and which head of the Russian Foreign Ministry Andrey  Kozyrev is to attend and the situation on the Korean  peninsular," Panov said.    He recognized that there are differences in Moscow's an  Beijing's approaches towards the Korean problem. "The Chinese  count on bilateral contacts. In their opinion, it is more  expedient to go "along three roads with four partners" where  "three roads" mean bilateral negotiations between North Korea -  the United States, North Korea - South Korea, North Korea -  IAEA. However, the Chinese do not rule out that it will be  necessary to hold an international conference at a certain  stage. As far as Russia is concerned, we are not against  bilateral relations, however, everyday practice demonstrates  that it brings no results. Then why should we become hostages  of this form of relations? That's why we persistently call to  convene an international conference," Panov said.    He does not rule out that in the course of Qian Qichen's  visit the parties will touch upon the problem of demarcation of  the Russian-Chinese border. He recognized that until now part  of the population in the regions bordering China did not  understand principles of demarcation. "They even appealed to  denounce the 1991 Russian-Chinese agreement which was ratified  by the Russian parliament. This is clearly an unrealistic  approach," Panov continued.    He reported that he had recently visited Khabarovsk and met  with its residents. In addition, Genrikh Kireyev, head of the  Russian delegation at the negotiations on border issues, made a  televised address. "We have presented necessary explanations.  As a result, those who wanted to understand the situation  perceive it as sober- minded people. But it is difficult to  persuade those who want to build local policy on this," Panov  said.    He reconfirmed that in accordance with the 1991  Russian-Chinese agreement the border will be laid along the  fairway of the navigable rivers and in the middle of  non-navigable ones. "The thing is that there has been neither  any border laid here nor any demarcation. The principle "who is  strong he considers that this is his territory" reigns here.  Now we start to draw a civilized border, for the first time in  the history of the Russian-Chinese relations. - Panov continued.  - Naturally, we are to go away from some territories which were  occupied by us in the thirties without any notifications and  agreements. On the other hand, we shall receive a legal right  for other territories."    Panov specially stressed that there is no question about  "any  dramatic concessions." "If there are any concessions, these are  concessions to the international law and sound sense," he said.    Mentioning the fate of the islands of Bolshoy Ussuriyskiy  and  Tarabarov which are situated near Khabarovsk, Panov pointed out  that they "remain in our possession. There are no doubts about  this," he noted.    When asked whether the parties would discusses  trade-economic  cooperation and, in particular, military shipments to China,  Panov answered that "they do not stand on the agenda." "These  issues were in detail discussed during the recent visit of  Premier Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to Beijing," he explained.</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Tomkins keeps earnings promise TOMKINS, which reported pre-tax profits up 29 per cent to Pounds 171m yesterday, has always said its aim is to produce above average increases in earnings per share. Yesterday, on cue, it showed a 4 per cent rise compared with a UK average decrease of 3.8 per cent and, for good measure, a 21 per cent lift in the dividend, compared with a UK average fall of 7.6 per cent. But rather than welcome the news, the market promptly clipped 5 per cent off the share price. For some time Mr Greg Hutchings, chief executive, has been able to rely on his track record and exhortations to 'trust us'. While this record has indeed been impressive, investors who dipped deep in their pockets to fund the Pounds 935m RHM acquisition appear disappointed they have been given so little ammunition with which to judge for themselves Tomkins' prospects - at RHM and at the existing businesses. The first disappointment revolves around Tomkins' failure to produce a figure for fair market adjustments at RHM, seven months after the company was acquired. Mr Ian Duncan, finance director, provided half an answer yesterday. While praising the calibre of the accountants at RHM, he said the reporting systems were inadequate. The extent of the fair value provisions will, in any case, be resolved with six weeks when the accounts are published. Nor has Tomkins set down any milestones in the reorganisation of RHM, against which the outside world can judge Mr Hutchings and his team. Analysts said this might be a result of caution, but when a business is as closely followed as the milling and baking industry is in the UK, the absence of a clearly spelled out strategy for reorganisation is likely to lead to unease. At the operational level in the existing businesses, the company is little more specific about the last year or prospects. Operating margins in the non-RHM business slipped slightly to 9 per cent last year with margins down in three of the four divisions. Fluid controls, services to industry and professional, garden and leisure products saw reduced margins. Margins were under pressure in the UK and the US to varying degrees, and Tomkins said it has seen no strong evidence yet of a recovery of industrial or consumer confidence. The industrial products division improved margins from a strong base on strongly increased sales - up 23 per cent - as the group benefited from operational gearing born of investing in low cost production during the recession. Mr Hutchings has identified his main product as financial performance. With the share price under some pressure, holders are sending a clear signal that they want to know more about how that performance is to be achieved.</p>

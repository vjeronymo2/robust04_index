			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / World Trade News: New attack on US-EC Airbus pact THE US-EC agreement over Airbus came under new attack yesterday by Congressman Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, who said the 1992 pact must be strengthened when it is reviewed in July, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington. The congressmen, a close adviser to President Bill Clinton on trade matters, represents a Missouri district, where thousands of McDonnell Douglas jobs are being lost to Airbus competition. The pact permits European governments to continue providing subsidies for aircraft development. Mr Gephardt called on the Clinton Administration to ensure that the agreement is not adopted by other countries in the Uruguay Round. In a speech to the Economic Strategy Institute, Mr Gephardt defended the Administration's 'results-oriented' trade policy toward Japan. The US must go further, investigating the practices of Japanese companies that act as cartels in the US. He said he would 'work day and night' to pass a North American Free Trade Agreement if the supplemental agreements on jobs and the environment, under negotiation, are effective. 'I don't want us to walk away from the table in defeat,' he insisted. See Nafta survey</p>

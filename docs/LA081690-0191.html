			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE CORNER BAR: MORE BARS:  </P> <P> The Tropicana Bar and Grill, 610 Avenida Victoria (across from the San Clemente  Municipal Pier), San Clemente.  </P> <P> Open Sundays through Thursdays till 11, Fridays and Saturdays till midnight.  (714) 498-TROP. A yuppie joint with charm. Sit leisurely under the thatched  roof and sip tropical drinks while viewing the pier and surfers below. The most  memorable feature, though, is found in the ladies room: a mural of Tarzan that  lets out a yell in the bar when you pull down the Ape Man's loincloth.JAMES M.  GOMEZ  </P></p>

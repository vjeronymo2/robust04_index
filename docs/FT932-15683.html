			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / French rates predicted to fall 'significantly': Finance minister sees confidence being restored THE FRENCH government predicted yesterday that interest rates, which have fallen on the money markets by up to 1.5 percentage points since the conservatives won a sweeping election victory nearly two weeks ago, 'will decrease significantly from now until the summer'. Though Mr Edmond Alphandery, the finance minister, said there was no question of pushing rates lower, he forecast that they would 'fall by themselves' because of a restoration of confidence in the French economy and currency. Markets are speculating that the Bank of France will cut its upper official rate - the five-day repurchase rate, currently at 12 per cent - next week. Reaction to the new conservative government's programme, which Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, announced to parliament on Thursday, was largely favourable. Stock market operators, however, expressed some dismay at planned increases in indirect taxes to reduce a budget deficit which Mr Balladur estimated would grow to FFr330bn (Pounds 39.9bn) this year or 3.4 per cent of national output. The only discordant notes came from Mr Michel Rocard, the Socialist party's new temporary leader, who said Mr Balladur had shown 'an amazing lack of imagination', while the Communists' parliamentary group expressed its 'firm opposition' to the Balladur plan. Nonetheless, Mr Balladur won his first vote of confidence by 457 to 81 votes, with two abstentions. Mr Balladur said that combatting unemployment, currently at 10.6 per cent of the workforce, was his 'absolute priority', but he saw no hope of stabilising job losses until the end of this year. He asked employers to lay off workers only as a last resort. Mr Francois Perigot, head of the Patronat employers' federation, yesterday agreed that his members should remember that 'making someone redundant was a serious matter'. Mr Alphandery said draft legislation to give the Bank of France independence and to privatise state-held companies would be ready before the end of next week. He expected Parliament to approve both laws by the summer. The French central bank has so far not chosen to reflect the easing of money market rates in its official rates, in order to attract money into francs. This has replenished its foreign exchange reserves, drained during the fight to keep the franc tied to the D-Mark in recent months. Mr Alphandery said the bank would repay loans from the Bundesbank several weeks before they were due. After the overnight money rate dropped to 10 1/8 per cent, and the rate for one-month money fell to 9 5/8 per cent, on Thursday, many analysts saw little sense in the Bank of France keeping its 'repo' rate at 12 per cent, and predicted a possible cut on Tuesday. The central bank is considered likely to maintain its intervention rate, at which it lends limited amounts to banks, at 9.1 per cent.

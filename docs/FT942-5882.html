			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Lasmo bid extended as controversy grows Enterprise Oil yesterday extended its hostile bid for rival explorer Lasmo until June 17 amid increasing controversy over the target's allegations that it had breached accounting standards. Officials from the Takeover Panel are believed to have discussed the accusations with Lasmo as part of their on-going examination of the bid. Separately, Lasmo is believed to have written to both the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the UK accounts watchdog, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission, to complain about Enterprise's accounting policies. It claims that Enterprise contravened SSAP 23, the standard on acquisitions and mergers, in its treatment of the acquisition of the Beryl oil field properties in 1988 and Texas Eastern in 1989. Enterprise is offering 27 Enterprise A shares and 12 warrants for every 80 of Lasmo's. Any revised offer must be made by June 17. See accounting column</p>

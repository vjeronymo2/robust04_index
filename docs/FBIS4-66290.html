			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Zhi (3769 5365): "CPC Newspapers, Journals </F> Lose More Than 100 Million Yuan"]    [Text] At the beginning of each year, the CPC department  concerned would, as a rule, review the work on party newspapers  and journals. This year is no exception. As early as 17 January,  the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee [CPCCC]  issued a circular to all units around the country, under the  title "Suggestions on Recommending Newspapers and Journals for  Study by Party Organizations." The fact that the party media  have to be "recommended" to party organizations by the CPCCC  Propaganda Department shows that the party's mouthpiece cannot  get a foothold on the market and must be supported by an  administrative order.  <H5>  Declining Circulations of Party Newspapers and Journals </H5>   As revealed by the Information Office of the State  Council, the circulations of party newspapers and journals have  plummeted since last year when the State Council stipulated that  personal subscriptions to such papers and journals be paid at  personal expense. In general, the circulations of party and  government journals at the central and local levels have fallen  by 15 percent--in some cases, the drop has exceeded 50 percent.  Statistic figures show that the annual loss suffered by  newspapers and journals published by central and local  government and party departments has totaled some 135 million  yuan.    The Chinese Communists once elatedly boasted that RENMIN  RIBAO was the paper with the largest circulation in the world.  In fact, the paper is financially supported by the state coffer.  Organs like RENMIN RIBAO are synonymous with "public  newspapers." Without doubt, the "subscription at personal  expense" stipulation, which went into effect last year, has  served as the best public opinion poll [about people's  confidence in the party media]. The over 135 million yuan loss  is by no means a small amount; it is sufficient to send the  press magnate of any country into bankruptcy. To the CPC, which  maintains a one-party rule in China, however, the concern is not  the huge loss of money, but the loss of public confidence in the  party media as indicated by the sharp drop in their  circulations. Such being the case, it is no matter of surprise  that the CPCCC Propaganda Department has come out to act as a  "recommender" for the party media.    The CPCCC Propaganda Department's circular requests that  party organizations at all levels take it as the party's  principal propaganda work to promote the study and reading of  newspapers and journals so as to understand and get a grip on  important domestic affairs and gain knowledge about major  international events. According to the circular, party  organizations should give periodical written tests to cadres  with party membership to check their knowledge about major  domestic and international events and use the test results as  one of the criteria for their promotion or job assignment. Every  member of the party organization, the circular urges, must  subscribe to a party newspaper or journal. In remote areas,  every village party organization and county propaganda  department is responsible for subscribing a party newspaper and  making arrangements for party members to study it on a regular  basis.    While the CPCCC Propaganda Department has issued numerous  orders in the past to urge party organizations at all levels to  give attention to political study, never before has it required  that cadres with party membership take a "written test" on the  contents of party newspapers and that the test results be used  as one of the criteria for "promotion." There is, indeed, some  reason for doing this, but it cannot be said openly.  <H5>  Real Situation of Circulations and Expenditures of the `Two </H5> Newspapers and One Journal'    Besides the CPCCC Propaganda Department's circular, the  Information Office of the State Council also issued on 24  January a circular entitled "On Seriously Promoting the Work of  All Media-Distribution and Publication Departments." The  Information Office is quite clear about the concrete statistics  on the distribution and publication of the party media. In  addition to the above-mentioned annual loss of some 135 million  yuan, there are many more figures, which are considered as  "state secrets." Following are the real situation of  circulations and expenditures of the "two newspapers and one  journal" at the central level:    RENMIN RIBAO (Domestic Edition): The daily circulation in  1992 was about 2.3 million. In 1993, the circulation was only  1.65 million, down by 28 percent, and the excess expenditure  amounted to some 8.3 million yuan.    GUANGMING RIBAO: The daily circulation in 1992 was about  1.5 million. In 1993, this dropped to 850,000, down by 43  percent, and the excess expenditure was some 3.1 million yuan.    QIUSHI magazine: In 1992, each issue had a circulation of  about 1.5 million. In 1993, the figure dropped to 1.1 million,  down by 27 percent, and the excess expenditure was more than  860,000 yuan.    In comparison, the mainland's evening papers have a rather  stable circulation because their contents are richer and more  "liberal." A survey shows that the daily circulations of  government and party newspapers and journals in the nation's 30  provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have dropped  15 percent--in some cases more than 50 percent--with the  exception of nine newspapers and journals including XINMIN  WANBAO in Shanghai, YANGCHENG WANBAO in Guangdong, BEIJING  WANBAO in Beijing, and CHENGDU WANBAO in Sichuan. More than 50  party organs at the provincial level have excess expenditures.  On the average, the excess expenditure is as high as more than  60 percent.  <H5>  Circulation of CANKAO XIAOXI Plummets </H5>   What is worth mentioning is that CANKAO XIAOXI, the  largest circulation publication in the country, was once widely  received by readers as the only "other information source" under  the CPC's information-blockade policy. During the past decade,  however, its circulation has nose-dived, from 25 million in 1982  to 16 million in 1988 and then to 8 million in 1993. The fall  was 68 percent compared with the peak attained 11 years ago.    The declined circulation has worsened the problem of  excess expenditures. For example, the three news agencies  XINHUA, ZHONGXIN, and ZHONGTONG have an average excess  expenditure of more than 60 million yuan [figure as published].  This does not include the special funds that the State Council  has allocated to them for the purchase of supplies and  communications equipment and for various large-scale activities.  Specific figures follow:  <H5>  Three Official News Agencies Have Excess Expenditure of 60 </H5> Million Yuan [as published]    In 1993, the official XINHUA News Agency had an  expenditure of 87 million yuan, showing an excess of some 13  million yuan.    In 1993, ZHONGGUO XINWEN had an expenditure of 42 million  yuan, showing an excess of some 8.6 million yuan.    In 1993, ZHONGGUO TONGXUN had an expenditure of 60 million  yuan, showing an excess of some 9.7 million yuan.    Of the three news agencies, ZHONGXIN had the smallest  excess expenditure. In addition to the above, there is a  "record-breaking" figure: The Xinhua Bookstore's total sales of  political and theoretical books throughout the country was  305,000 books in 1993 (excluding My Father--Deng  Xiaoping and Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping,  Volume III), hitting a record low since the founding of the  People's Republic. More than 1.8 million books on politics were  sold in 1950. The highest record was registered in 1967, when  3.25 billion political and theoretical books were sold.    A low circulation--a high expenditure; a decline in  circulation--a still higher expenditure. It seems that the CPC  mouthpiece can hardly get out of this difficulty at the moment.  Even the measure of linking party newspapers to promotions and  pay raises will not produce any result. This is a disastrous  effect of separating economic reform from political reform. Just  think: When people are enjoying every day the material life  created by capitalism, how could they believe the party's  stereotyped propaganda that "only socialism can save China"?</p>

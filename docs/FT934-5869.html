			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Another largely featureless day in the futures market aped the pattern of the previous session when a large buy order from one UK broker provided the stimulus to carry the market forward for most of yesterday's session, writes Christopher Price. The December FTSE futures contract opened quietly at 3,111, with trading seen in a tight range. However, late morning saw a leading UK investment bank come in with a substantial buy order. This prompted other buyers and produced a squeeze in the December contract. By mid-afternoon trading had slowed and December drifted, slipping to the 3,120-level. A late flurry saw it close at 3,125, some 14 points above the cash market and around 10 over the fair value premium currently standing at approximately 4. Turnover was a respectable 12,000. In traded options, 37,710 contracts were traded, 14,257 done in the FTSE contract. BT headed the stock option list, with 3,146 traded.</p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LABORER SAYS HAVING BAG PUT OVER HEAD NO LAUGHING MATTER  </P> <P> Contrary to testimony given by a Carlsbad baker the previous day, a 27-year-old  migrant worker told a Vista court jury Thursday that being bound with duct tape  and hooded with a paper bag behind a Carlsbad market was no laughing matter.  </P> <P> "No, I was scared," Candido Gayosso Salas answered when asked by Dist. Atty.  George McFetridge whether he laughed when Randy Ryberg bound his legs and arms  with silver duct tape and placed a bag, bearing a funny face and the words "No  Mas Aqui," crude Spanish meaning "No More Here," over his head.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Ryberg, who along with William Zimmerman is being tried in Vista  Superior Court on a felony count of unlawful imprisonment in the Jan. 3  incident, told the court that Gayosso had laughed when he saw the bag, on which  had which been scrawled a face with a toothy grin.  </P> <P> Gayosso's statements came during the third and final day of testimony in the  case.  </P> <P> The jury will return Monday for final arguments before Judge Charles Hayes.  </P> <P> Ryberg and Zimmerman, a self-contracted meat cutter, have been charged with  handcuffing Gayosso to a stair railing for more than two hours after Ryberg  grabbed the undocumented worker, who had been soliciting day labor with several  dozen workers outside the store.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys allege that Ryberg was making a legitimate citizen's arrest.  Zimmerman's lawyer claims that he was assisting in the arrest.  </P> <P> Authorities, however, say that the two were using Gayosso to send a message to  other workers that their daily presence was not appreciated outside the rural  store, on El Camino Real, south of California 78.  </P> <P> Ruben Cases, a U. S. Border Patrol agent, also told the jury Thursday that he  saw Gayosso handcuffed to the railing while on routine patrol behind the store.  He asked the worker what had happened.  </P> <P> But, before Gayosso could respond, a voice behind a screen door inside the  store responded 'It's all been taken care of,' " Casas told the court. He did  not identify the speaker. Gayosso said the agent then left without attempting  to release him.  </P></p>

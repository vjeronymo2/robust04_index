			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Business and the Law: Court has power in swap rate case - European Court The European Court of Justice has been asked to rule whether it has jurisdiction to hear a case concerning the Brussels Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments referred to it by the English Appeal Court. The case concerned interest rate swap contracts between Glasgow District Council and Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank. In performance of the contracts, Kleinwort Benson paid Glasgow District Council sums totalling more than Pounds 800,000. After these payments, the House of Lords ruled that local authorities such as Glasgow District Council did not have the power to enter into such contracts. In the light of the Law Lords judgment, Kleinwort Benson brought a High Court action against Glasgow District Council for restitution of the sums paid out under the swaps contracts. The parties agreed the contracts were governed by English law, that England was the place of performance and that it was the place where the harmful event occurred. However, they were in dispute about which UK courts had jurisdiction to hear the dispute. Kleinwort Benson argued the English Courts should have jurisdiction. Glasgow District Council claimed the Scottish Courts should hear the case. The English High Court decided it did not have jurisidiction. Kleinwort appealed and the Appeal Court referred the issue to the Luxembourg court. The claims of both sides were based not on the Brussels Convention but on the provisions of a schedule to the 1982 Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act, which incorporates the Convention into UK law. One of the act's provisions allows for questions relating to any Convention issue to be referred to the ECJ. Such a reference is not made under the Rome Treaty but under a 1971 Protocol to the Brussels Convention. Because of this technicality, the issue of the ECJ's jurisdiction to hear the case arose. Both Glasgow District Council and Kleinwort together with the German and Spanish governments argued the Court did have jurisdiction to give a ruling on the questions referred to it. Their arguments were based on the fact that the reference related to the Convention; that even if it concerned the application of the internal legislation of a member state, the national law in question referred to provisions of Community law for which the ECJ had jurisdiction; that it was necessary if there was to be a uniform application of Community law; and, that the mere fact that the case concerned the assignment of jurisdiction between courts in a single member state should not deprive the ECJ of its jurisdiction. However, the French and UK governments, together with the European Commission argued the Court did not have jurisdiction to deal with the reference. Their arguments included: the fact that the dispute did not concern an international jurisdictional issue, but rather a conflict of jurisdiction in one member state; that the reference was governed exclusively by national law; and, that even if the Court did give a preliminary ruling, the national court would not be bound by that ruling as it would only be an advisory opinion and in such an event, it would be ruling on questions of national law contrary to its own case law. It was argued the Court's case law on the interpretation of Community law applied by national legislation should be strictly construed and only apply where the national law directly transposed the relevant Community law. That was not the position in this case. On the separate issue of which UK court should hear the dispute, Kleinwort claimed that jurisdiction should be given to the English courts either because England was the place of performance of the contracts or because it was where the harmful event occurred. Glasgow District Council argued the normal rule should apply, whereby people are sued in the part of the country in which they are domiciled. The advocate general's opinion is expected next year followed by a full judgment of the ECJ. C - 346/93: Kleinwort Benson v City of Glasgow District Council, oral hearing, 22 November 1994.

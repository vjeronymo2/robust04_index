			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with economist Fan Hengshan (5400 1854 1472) by </F> Zhou Yuanhong (0719 5913 4747); date and place not given: "Major  Measures in Accelerating and Pushing Forward the Work of  Building the New Structure"]    [Text] The year 1994 is the first year for implementing  the "Decision" and is also a crucial year for realizing overall  progress and key breakthroughs in economic structural reform.  How are our reforms to develop? Will there be risks? Where  lie the hopes? In order to more accurately understand and grasp  the trend of development of economic reform, this reporter  visited the economist Fan Hengshan, who has been engaged in the  work of overall planning and policy research for economic  structural reform for many years, and put to him some questions  which are of wide concern to the people.    [Zhou] Since the beginning of 1994, there has been overall  implementation of the total reform strategy with very powerful  measures. Why have so many reform measures been implemented at  once and what is the innate relationship between them?    [Fan] I believe that, apart from manifesting the demands of  reform as it enters the crucial period, the pushing forward of  these reform measures is, generally speaking, consistent with  the strategy of "overall progress and breakthroughs in key  points." It is also in accord with the requirement to "have the  new structure replace the old as quickly as possible." First,  these reform measures manifest the demand for coordinated  reform. The setting down of the target of a market economy  structure has meant that our reforms are not just tinkering with  or patching up the original structure but for achieving  essential change. Thus, the goal of our reform is an entirety,  a system. The reform measures must also be overall and not just  in some areas. In the reforms up till now, the relatively  independent measures have been implemented quite well. However,  the possibility and effectiveness of their further development  will not be determined mainly by these measures themselves but,  more importantly, by how other measures are coordinated with  them. Thus, the concurrent pushing forward of many reforms is  inevitable if there is to be coordination. Only in this way  will the various individual reforms see development and will the  reform measures themselves not restrict each other but will,  instead, form a joint force. As an example, if we do not put  property rights into order and do not establish a modern system  which can manifest property rights restraints and interests  restraints, enterprises will be unable to truly realize  autonomous operations and responsibility for their own profits  and losses. It will also be impossible to establish a system  whereby they take responsibility for maintaining and increasing  the value of state assets, to guard against the large-scale  erosion of state assets. It will also be impossible to truly  transform government functions or to form a competitive market  system in which market signals are accurate and economic  relationships are rational. Also, the reforms in the revenue,  financial, planning, investment and foreign exchange spheres,  such as implementing a revenue-sharing financial system,  restructuring the financial system in accordance with market  economy requirements, strengthening the macroeconomic nature,  strategic nature, policy nature, and medium- and long-term  nature of planning; establishing the status of enterprises as  investment entities; and realizing the merger of the different  types of exchange rates, are significant, not only in creating  an indirect macroeconomic management system, but also in the  fact that, at the same time, they are creating conditions  whereby enterprises can shed their fetters and move toward the  market. For example, changing the specialized banks into true  commercial banks which have profits as their basic goal, will  mean that the relationship between the commercial banks and the  enterprises will be completely equalized and marketized.  Decisions regarding to whom credit will be given and how much  credit is to be provided, what interest rates will be charged  and how long the repayment period will be, and whether repayment  will be required on the set date or whether the credit can be  extended, will be decided between the banks and the enterprises  in accordance with their earnings and risks. The banks will no  longer be dependent on the administrative organs and the  enterprises will no longer be dependent on the banks. Further,  this coordination must not only be manifested in the three major  aspects of economic structural reform, that is, among  macroeconomic management, enterprises, and the market, but also  manifested in the various links in all major aspects. For  example, the various macroeconomic reform measures now being  promoted have all been coordinated in terms of switching central  government functions from where the central government managed  everything to where it only controls the overall major matters.  At the same time, the forms by which these functions are  implemented will be made more scientific and more subject to the  market. No matter whether it is dividing central and local  jurisdictions, establishing the position of the People's Bank of  China as the central bank, bringing the mechanism of market  competition into the investment sphere, or freeing foreign  exchange operations and realizing exchange rate merger, the aims  all lie in this. Further, this coordination is also manifested  within the various links. For example, in the reform of the  financial structure, the central bank will change from where it  implements target management and quota control to where it  regulates standard interest rates and regulates the activities  of specialized banks through reserve fund and discounting  interest rates and by engaging in open market business and other  economic measures. In this way, the specialized banks will  truly become commercial banks which decide on their own  operations, take sole responsibility for their own profits and  losses, and which operate in coordination with the policy-nature  banks which solely engage in government-type financial business.  Both types are essential.  At the same time, these reforms also manifest the focal points  and they are very important links in the new structural  framework. For diverse reasons, they also have high  coordination requirements, wide-ranging effects, and touch quite  deeply the relationship between power and interests. They are  also being carried out at links which have fallen behind in the  reforms. For example, through over 10 years of reform of the  macroeconomic structure, the strength of administrative  management has been greatly reduced and the role of the market  mechanism in deploying resources and regulating the economy has  clearly expanded. There has been a shift from the direct  management mode with major reliance on mandatory planning and  the fixing of quotas, the approving of projects, the  distribution of investment, and the allocation of goods and  materials, to where there is greater reliance on economic and  legal measures in regulating economic activities. The  traditional macroeconomic management structure has thus seen  basic transformation. However, as compared with the demands of  economic activities, and relative to the reforms in other  economic spheres, the progress has not been great, the results  have not been good, and the responsibilities of the regulatory  and control entities have not been made clear. This has  prevented forces from being combined and has actually resulted  in mutual impeding. The administrative nature of regulatory and  control measures is still very strong and their transitional  nature is not in accord with the demands of a market economy.  This restricts the progress of reform in other aspects and has  given rise to many deep contradictions and problems. This  situation has now reached a stage where there cannot be reforms  without great efforts being made. In respect to the reform of  the enterprise system, over the last few years, we have also  continued to place the focus of reform on enlivening  enterprises, especially on enlivening medium and large  state-owned enterprises, and adopted many measures in this  regard. However, for various reasons, including  misunderstandings on the question of how to interpret the  public-ownership system, it has been impossible to place the  focus of reform on putting property rights in order, so as to  establish a modern enterprise system which is in accord with the  requirements of a market economy. In this way, not only has it  been impossible to form a mechanism for raising efficiency, and  for guaranteeing and increasing the value of state-owned assets,  but it has resulted in some people making improper use of  opportunities. At the same time as enterprise performances have  been poor and vigor insufficient, many of the state-owned assets  have been transformed from public to private ownership and they  have been appropriated by a small number of individuals. Thus,  at the same time as upholding coordination, and grasping these  key points to achieve breakthroughs, so that they can play a  guiding role, we must grasp the opportunity to establish the  framework of a new structure as quickly as possible.    [Zhou] Putting forward these reform measures will  undoubtedly play an important role in the building of a new  structure. However, reform is a revolution which affects deep  relations and power structures and entails certain risks. What  are your views on the opportunities and risks for reform this  year and in future?    [Fan] This can be considered from the two angles of results  and process. Speaking in terms of the results of reform, it  will inevitably provide opportunities for people and for  society. These opportunities must be manifested at different  levels and in different areas. Speaking from quite a high  level, as soon as a good structure is established, it will be  possible to promote the sustained, healthy, and rapid  development of the economy; to advance the productive forces to  the greatest possible degree; and to provide people with  convenience in many respects. This includes spiritual,  material, production, and livelihood aspects. Speaking from a  quite concrete level, each complete system or structural link  can bring people advantages in one or many respects. For  example, if we establish a competitive and open labor employment  system, the space and opportunities for laborers to choose their  employment will be greatly expanded and mental and physical  abilities will be given full play in the most appropriate post  (production conditions). However, as far as the process of  reform is concerned, this will not only provide opportunities  but also involve risks. This is because the process of reform  is itself a readjustment of the powers and interests of some  entities. Even if interests are enhanced, as the reforms are  still in process and the focuses of the reforms are not exactly  the same, it is impossible to give everyone interests and  benefits at the same level and at the same time. That is to  say, opportunities will not exist at the same time and to the  same degree for everyone. Meanwhile, during the reform process,  risks might arise at any time and the results of these may  affect everyone. An example of this is price fluctuations.  However, risks and opportunities can be transformed. If the  relationships between all sides are properly handled, and if the  good opportunities and modes are grasped, it will be possible to  reduce risk to the lowest possible degree and thereby provide  people with the greatest degree of opportunities over the  greatest range. In speaking of the risks in the process of  reform, I believe that the greatest risk is the one whereby the  distortions of the reform measures, caused by various factors,  result in a situation where there is nominal pursuit of a market  economy but what is produced is actually a marriage of the  powers manifested by the planned economy with the interests  manifested by the market economy and that, in the end, will cost  society dearly. If foul water is tossed on the head of the  market economy and this leads to its end, it will be difficult  to seek further opportunities for market economy operation.    [Zhou] I have noticed that in recent years, you have stated  that we must be vigilant against distortions in the building of  the market economy, and some of your views have attracted strong  responses from society. Why have you laid special stress on  this issue? Could you speak a little more about the causes of  the distortions?    [Fan] It needs to be especially pointed out that with our  special ideological atmosphere and structural basis, it is  particularly easy for distortions to occur in economic  construction. Speaking in respect of the first, our theoretical  guidance has long been the ideological concepts of the planned  economy and, having always lived in a planned economy  environment, we are used to ideas and language related to  planning. For example, we feel very strange with language like  capital, shares, credit cards, and open market business, which  is the language of the market economy. However, we are quite  familiar with terms like targets, quotas, allocations and  examination and approval. Thus, consciously or unconsciously,  we use these ways of thinking and concepts in appraising and  selecting new reform actions and measures. This results in the  building of the market economy structure moving toward a fork in  the road. Speaking in terms of the latter aspect, we have long  implemented a system which is essentially opposite to the market  economy. We are now switching from a planned economic system in  which mandatory planning plays the main part, toward a market  system. The former is a tight system formed over many years and  its structural base and "inertia" produce a counteracting effect  on reform measures. This can result in the reform measures not  going into effect or being distorted. The most typical result  however, in building the new structure, is that the reform  measures end up being "semi-finished products" or having a  "dual-track" nature. Thus, in the process of building the new  structure, I believe that guarding against the distortion of  reform measures is more important than anything else. Relatively  speaking, a quicker pace is better than a slower pace. However,  speed must be realized on the basis of healthy and solid  progress. The achievements in the 10 years of reform have  startled the world. However, we can also see that quite a  number of the reform measures have been successively alienated,  distorted, and warped. In this respect, we also see the problem  of reform plans being incomplete and having to be revised in  practice but this is not the cause in the majority of cases. If  we are able to avoid or reduce such distortions, our  achievements can well be greater. Actually, when thinking about  the "Seventh Five-Year Plan," the central authorities proposed  that we would lay down the base for the new structure during the  1980's. Clearly understanding the possibility and seriousness  of distortion in building a market economy structure, and  putting great efforts into preventing or overcoming such  distortions, should be the primary task of the builders of the  market economy. If we do well in this respect, it will be the  same as grasping the greatest opportunity.    [Zhou] In your view, in order to healthily promote the  building of the market economy structure, and guard against  distortions, which major aspects have to be grasped?    [Fen] I believe that we need to grasp the following major  aspects: 1. We have to deeply understand the complexity of  transforming a planned economy into a market economy. We have  to transform thought, we need to raise understanding, and we  need to tightly grasp the study of knowledge about a modern  market economy and accurately grasp the basic characteristics of  a socialist market economy. We also have to practice using the  language of market economy operations. These are the most basic  and most important links in solidly pushing forward reform. 2.  Scientifically grasping the dialectical relationship between  the contents of reform, the modes of reform, and the reform  environment, to guarantee the smooth implementation of reform.  We need to put relationships in order and readjust the  structure of powers and interests. Under the precondition of  ensuring that the ultimate effects do not harm the essence of  the reforms we can, while doing everything possible to take into  consideration the various existing interests, adjust actions to  the local situations and push forward some essential measures  for readjusting powers and interests relationships. At the same  time, we must grasp the beneficial opportunities for reform. 3.  We need to correctly and properly handle the relationship  between conscious fostering by the government and spontaneous  development by the market. That is, we must swiftly and  properly push forward the building of the new structure and use  necessary administrative measures to overcome the blindness,  lack of order, and slowness inherent in the spontaneous  development by the market. 4. We must bring the construction  of the new system onto the track of standardization through laws  and guard against the distortion of reform measures. In a  certain sense, the process of establishing a new structure is a  process of moving from the authority of the administration to  the authority of the market and of laws. The market economy is  essentially an economy based on the legal system. We need to  stress, from a high plane, the combining of economic reform and  legislation and bring the building of the new structure onto the  track of standardization through legislation.</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Names struggle to meet submissions deadline NEW EFFORTS to find an out-of-court settlement to legal disputes at Lloyd's of London are running into difficulties, casting a shadow over efforts to restore profitability at the insurance market. Seventy one groups of loss-making Names - the individuals backing underwriting at Lloyd's - were invited last week to submit statements to Sir Michael Kerr, the former High Court judge who is chairing a panel set up to assess Names' claims of negligence against their agents. Names claim that a deadline of July 23 is unrealistic and will not allow them to consult legal counsel. Mr David Tiplady, a solicitor representing four groups of Names, said: 'It is impossible.' Mr Tiplady is pressing the panel to put back its deadline to mid-August. But Mr Bill Knight, of solicitors Simmons &amp; Simmons, which is working with the panel, stressed that the deadline was a 'hard' one. He said the panel would be unable to report to Lloyd's by the autumn unless it stuck to this deadline. Lloyd's, which last month reported its third successive year of record losses, is keen to settle litigation with Names in order to restore confidence as it seeks to attract fresh capital. Separately, Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Names Action group, the biggest group of loss-making Names, said his group would meet the deadline but 'smaller less well-financed groups' would be disadvantaged. Mr Deeny, who is also on a second panel which is examining the potential financial resources available for a settlement, said he was 'sceptical' about its chances of success. He said the errors and omissions insurers - which cover Lloyd's agencies against awards for negligence - were only prepared to consider a settlement which would not 'trigger their own reinsurance protections'. Since errors and omissions insurers - themselves Lloyd's syndicates - usually buy reinsurance, the amount available to settle claims would be limited. Mr Deeny said: 'At the end of the day all the arm-twisting by the Lloyd's management hasn't got anywhere. The only solution is to get a court judgment and put 30 to 40 agencies into liquidation.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by security affairs correspondent Sharon Shade] </F>   [Excerpts] Israeli sources express concern in view of the  growing tension between black factions in South Africa in  anticipation of the elections in April. The sources refused to  react to foreign reports according to which missile scientists  have threatened to reveal details of nonconventional weapons  cooperation between Israel and South Africa. They also refused  to comment on the possible ramifications of the new situation on  bilateral cooperation. According to the sources, due to  political reasons bilateral security cooperation has been  extremely curtailed over the last few years, and this  cooperation will be affected by future internal changes in South  Africa.    In the past Israel maintained tight military and security  cooperation with the white regime of South Africa, including --  according to foreign reports -- the development and manufacture  of weapons to the tune of billions of dollars, as well as  nuclear cooperation, including trade in sensitive raw materials.  [passage omitted]    Israeli sources expect changes to take place in South  Africa's security concept in the wake of the political changes  there. It is possible that the South Africans will reevaluate  various military projects. The Israeli sources believe that  South Africa will strive to become a regional power and a  leading African force by increasing its military power. This  will require a rebuilding process in many parts of the Army,  while introducing new battle doctrines to accommodate the new  black recruits. The sources assess that the South African  Army's ground forces will absorb many new black recruits. A  long time will be required, however, to absorb them in the air  force due to the complicated systems, which require long  training periods for pilots, as well as technical and  engineering personnel.

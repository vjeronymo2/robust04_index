			<p>920803 FT  03 AUG 92 / Letter From Paris: Mitterrand finds it hard to cool it France is grinding to its customary summer halt in a tetchy and unpredictable mood. As more than a third of the workforce starts its holiday, the weather is suffocatingly hot, with forecasts of violent thunderstorms. So is the political situation. Try as it may, the government cannot cool the country's temperature. President Francois Mitterrand dearly wants to ensure a reasoned, unemotional campaign leading up to the referendum on European union, set for September 20. By that time, he hopes, the disgruntled populace will still be bronzed and relaxed enough to say yes to Maastricht. Instead, just about everything that can go wrong for the ruling Socialists has gone wrong, creating a build-up of anti-Mitterrand sentiment. A feeling that the government is not entirely in control started to intensify in June when farmers mounted motorway blockades to protest against European agricultural policy reforms, even laying siege to Euro Disneyland. That was nothing like as disruptive as the truckers' spectacular blockade at the start of last month. They were protesting against tough new driving regulations under which offenders can lose their licence if they clock up six penalty points. While the government deserves credit for not giving in to the truckers' demands to repeal the penalty system, it did look embarrassingly powerless for a few days. The strike also showed how deeply out of touch the government was with the feelings of truckers - who fear European competition  -and with most French people, who sympathised despite the inconvenience. No sooner were the motorways clear than the judiciary started to add to the trouble by casting a haze of moral dubiousness over the Socialists. An examining magistrate in Rennes summonsed Mr Henri Emmanuelli, president of the national assembly and former Socialist party treasurer, to appear in court in mid-September - just before the referendum - to face charges of political corruption. The magistrate, Mr Renaud Van Ruymbeke, observing national tradition, promptly went on holiday, leaving the storm to gather. Mr Mitterrand has defended Mr Emmanuelli, but he has been unable to dispel the suspicion over the party. Adding to the damage to the Socialists' image, there is the trial of four senior health officials who face charges of allowing HIV-contaminated blood to be distributed to haemophiliacs. Since the trial started in late June, television and newspapers have been full of heart-rending accounts of some of the 1,300 infected by the contaminated blood and the more than 250 haemophiliacs to have died as a result. The scandal is on everyone's lips. A remark by Mrs Georgina Dufoix, social affairs minister at the time of the infections seven years ago - that she was 'responsible but not guilty' - has even been taken up as an ironic popular catchphrase. The impression that the Socialists are in some way responsible for the tragedy was underlined when three former ministers, including Mr Laurent Fabius, now first secretary of the Socialist party, were called to the witness box last week. While showing suitable respect for the victims, they did not succeed in absolving themselves from responsibility in the public's eyes. One, Mr Edmond Herve, former junior health minister, admitted knowing that contaminated blood was being distributed. Against this murky background, it is no surprise that Mr Mitterrand's popularity has taken a fresh plunge, down to 26 per cent in mid-July, according to one poll. That is the lowest rating for the president since before last March's regional elections, when the Socialists' showing was very poor. The polls have even signalled an end to the honeymoon period for Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the straight-talking prime minister, who took office in April. He received a 32 per cent satisfaction rating, compared with 39 per cent who expressed dissatisfaction. So far, the government's attempts to focus minds on Europe have gone comically wrong. A television and radio campaign devised by Mr Mitterrand's former presidential campaign publicity manager had to be cancelled after the CSA broadcasting authority warned it might contravene a law against broadcasts of political advertising. So the government is relying on a press and poster campaign featuring photographs of friendly-looking people mouthing pro-European sentiments: 'Maas . . . tricht? Apart from its being unpronounceable, I am rather in favour,' is one particularly feeble example. The anti-Maastricht wing of the opposition Gaullist party plans to hit back with its own poster campaign today. French people on holiday will not be able to escape. Politicians who support and oppose Maastricht are campaigning on beaches and at popular holiday destinations, reminding citizens of their Euro-duty. How the French will respond is anybody's guess. Most political observers believe there will be a solid majority in favour of Maastricht, but the polls show this is diminishing. At the last count three weeks ago, some 55 per cent favoured ratification. Will the public get irritated enough with its mostly pro-European political establishment to vote against Maastricht? To take an appropriate French expression, a lot will depend on how people feel in their tripes when they return.</p>

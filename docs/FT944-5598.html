			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / International Company News: Barlo midterm fall to IPounds 1.81m Barlo, the Dublin-based radiators and packaging group, blamed lower margins in its plastics business for a fall in pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 from IPounds 2.42m to IPounds 1.81m (Pounds 1.78m). Turnover rose to IPounds 55.5m (IPounds 43.4m) reflecting continued organic growth and the contribution from Veha Radiators.

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / International Company News: Credit Agricole edges up 5% CREDIT Agricole, one of France's biggest banks, experienced its second successive year of sluggish profits growth and steep provisions in 1991 when net profits rose by just 5 per cent from FFr4.7bn to FFr4.93bn (Dollars 876m). Despite the relatively sluggish increase in profits, Credit Agricole, which is a co-operative farmers' bank, made the highest profits of all the French retail banks last year by beating the 'three old ladies' - Banque Nationale de Paris, Credit Lyonnais and Societe Generale. Mr Yves Barsalou, president, said that 'continuity and stability' were the linchpins of Credit Agricole's development and had helped it cope with the competitive conditions of the French banking market. Credit Agricole's net banking income rose by 11.4 per cent to FFr57.5bn during the year. It restricted the rise in general costs to 4.5 per cent at FFr32.6bn, thereby boosting gross profits by 22.1 per cent to FFr24.9bn. However, Credit Agricole, like other big French banks, notably Credit Lyonnais and the Paribas investment banking group, was forced to raise provisions last year by 17 per cent to FFr13.9bn. This followed another sharp increase - of 15 per cent to FFr11.9bn - in 1990. Mr Barsalou said that Credit Agricole planned to continue its strategy of controlling costs and rationalising its overheads by merging regional branches in 1992. It would also continue its expansion abroad after recent investments in Italy and Portugal.</p>

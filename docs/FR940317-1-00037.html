			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 32. If a regulatory fee is not paid in a timely manner, we will make every effort to identify delinquent payors and to notify them of their delinquency as soon as possible. This notice will, pursuant to the statute, automatically assess the 25 percent penalty and, as proposed below will require the delinquent payor to pay the fee and penalty, may subject the delinquent payors' pending applications to dismissal, and may require a delinquent payor to show cause why its existing instruments of authorization should not be subject to revocation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Dismissal of Application <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 33. Section 9(c)(2) authorizes the Commission to dismiss any application, group of applications or other filings for failure to pay in a timely manner any fee or penalty under section 9. 47 U.S.C. 159(c)(2). Because application and regulatory fees may be combined, we propose that, where a regulatory fee is required to accompany a regulatee's new or renewal application (as is the case with the small fees), the application will be returned if the regulatory fee is not included. If the application that must be accompanied by a regulatory fee is a mutually exclusive application with a filing deadline (or any other application that must be filed by a date certain), we also propose to dismiss the application if not accompanied by the regulatory fee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Revocation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 34. Section 9(c)(3) provides that, `[i]n addition to or in lieu of'' the 25 percent penalty required by section 9(c)(1) and the application(s) dismissal authorized by section 9(c)(2), ``the Commission may revoke any instrument of authorization held by any entity that has failed to make payment of a regulatory fee assessed pursuant to this section.'' 47 U.S.C. 159(c)(3). The statute specifies that the Commission must provide notice to the licensee of the Commission's intent to take such action and must allow the licensee at least 30 days to either pay the fee or show cause why the fee does not apply to the licensee or should otherwise be waived or payment deferred. A hearing is not required under this revocation provision unless the licensee's response presents a ``substantial and material question of fact.'' In any case where a hearing is conducted, it shall be based on written evidence only, and the burden of proceeding with the introduction of evidence and the burden of proof shall be on the licensee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 35. While we do not foresee that revocation will be necessary except in egregious circumstances, we reserve the right to invoke these abbreviated revocation proceedings against any delinquent regulatee. We note that this provision requires only that a regulatee ``has failed to make  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> payment of a regulatory fee.'' Id.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (emphasis added). It does not require ``willful or repeated'' failure to pay. Compare 47 U.S.C. 312(a) (3), (4) and (7). Therefore, if we deem it appropriate, our notification to a regulatee that is delinquent with its regulatory fee payment will take the form of an ``Order to Show Cause,'' allowing the regulatee to either pay the fee or show cause why the fee does not apply or should otherwise be waived or payment deferred. We propose to provide a 60 day period for a reply by the subject regulatee in order to afford an adequate opportunity for the regulatee to obtain any necessary financing of its fee payment and to otherwise prepare its response. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Debt Collection Act Remedies <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 36. In addition to the above-described remedies under section 9(c), we intend to invoke our authority under the Debt Collection Act against any person or entity failing to meet its regulatory fee payment obligations. See 31 U.S.C. 3711  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with part 1, subpart 0 of our rules (47 CFR &sect;&sect;1.1901&hyph;1.1952), we intend to pursue the collection of outstanding debts arising from regulatory fee payment failures at the same time we proceed against the debtor with the other sanctions authorized by section 9(c). Moreover, where circumstances require, we will refer outstanding debts to the Internal Revenue Service. See 31 U.S.C. &sect;3720A. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

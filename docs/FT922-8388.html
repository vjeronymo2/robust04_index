			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Threat seen to future of Drax BRITAIN'S biggest power station - Drax in North Yorkshire - may be forced out of business by the end of the century, according to National Power, the privatised electricity generator which owns the station. Drax, which supplies enough power for six cities the size of Liverpool, is on the River Ouse near British Coal's Selby colliery complex. National Power argues that Drax could be priced out of the new electricity market if negotiations with British Coal over coal pricing cannot be resolved. Mr Mike Grasby, manager at Drax, warned that the station could be switched off most of the time because of tough competition from gas-fired power stations.</p>

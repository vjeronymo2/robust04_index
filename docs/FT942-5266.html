			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Currency details 'lacking' Only a quarter of British companies with foreign currency exposure provide any meaningful disclosure, according to Company Reporting, the monthly Edinburgh-based monitor of company accounts. In a sample of 520 companies' latest annual reports, 76 per cent showed some evidence of foreign currency exposure but only 27 per cent of these provided significant detail. The analysis comes as there is increasing attention on the potential liabilities which are incurred by businesses by foreign currency hedging and other derivatives or financial instruments, such as swaps and options. Company Reporting says the degree of information provided has risen considerably since three years ago, when only 15 per cent of companies analysed their currency exposure in any detail. The survey considered the analysis of currency exposure for company debt, assets, cashflow and general treasury management matters. It found that many businesses rarely provided quantified data. Most companies offering some analysis considered indebtedness and a small proportion analysed assets by currency. Only one company - Reuters - analysed cashflow by foreign currency exposure. Company Reporting also notes that companies are not showing scrip dividends  -payment of shares instead of cash to shareholderes - in the spirit of new accounting standards. It says FRS4 and FRS5 should require scrip dividends as a charge against profits, as are cash dividends. Company Reporting, 68 Dundas Street, Edinburgh EH3 6QZ. Subscription Pounds 340 a year.</p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: Recession holds Malbak to 5% rise at halfway Malbak, the South African industrial conglomerate recently unbundled from mining house Gencor, has reported a sluggish 5 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to R341m (Dollars 99m) in the half-year to February 28, against R325m in the same period in 1992. Sales grew by 8 per cent to R5.81bn from R5.39bn, but the lingering effects of the country's recession dented profitability, with operating income falling to R384m from R388m. Mr Grant Thomas, executive chairman, said: 'The past six months have been characterised by sporadic bursts of consumer spending interspersed with periods of stagnation.' Mr Thomas said a general decline in consumer demand knocked sales volumes and operating margins, aggravated by the group's large cash balances which earned less revenue as interest rates declined in the period. Malbak's cash in hand stood at R887m at the end of the period, compared with R675m a year earlier. Distributable profit rose to R179m from R170m after a reduction in net interest charges and lower tax provisions. Results were most disappointing from Foodcorp, the group's wide-ranging foods producer, and Holdains, the group's packaging subsidiary, which contributed R34m and R27m to bottom line earnings compared with R33m and R29m respectively a year ago. Results were buoyed by the group's branded consumer products operations, led by its furniture business Ellerines and electronic appliance subsidiary Tedelex, which returned to profitability. They contributed earnings of R37m, compared with R23m in 1992. Mr Thomas said SA Druggists, the pharmaceutical products subsidiary, had an 'excellent' half-year. International operations, led by London-quoted MY Holdings, had a satisfactory period. The company acquired Insight Cartons, a UK folding carton business, while Malbak would reduce its stake to 67 per cent from 85.7 per cent when the deal was completed and move the company from the London Stock Exchange's unlisted securities market to the main board to improve the marketability of the shares.</p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Bright hope for Ukraine's future Sir, The announcement by the Ukrainian government of a complicated procedure for run-off elections ('Kravchuk sets new hurdle in the path of parliament', March 30) shows that the true democrats in Ukraine are not politicians, but its citizens. Despite a confusing electoral law 75 per cent of the people voted in the first round. Regardless of the final outcome one clear message has been given. Ukrainian citizens seek solutions through democratic institutions. Although in the west this sentiment is taken for granted, in a former authoritarian state, where two-thirds of the people are classified as living under the poverty line, it is the one bright hope for the future.

At an informal meeting, held unusually ahead of a summit of  the G7 countries scheduled for July, the ministers said they  were convinced environmental projects could generate 2.1 million  jobs in Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the  United States.    They agreed that preservation of nature could be financed by  "environmental accounting" or better distribution of taxes.    "No one talked about creating new taxes," said Italian  Environmental Minister Valdo Spini at the end of the two-day  meeting.    French Environment Minister Michel Barnier said Europe must  "implement such reforms together," noting that "pollution has no  boundaries."    On safety at nuclear plants, particularly in Central and  Eastern Europe, the ministers pledged to "promote aid and  economic and technological assistance to countries with the  biggest problems."    They also discussed the greenhouse effect -- or warming up  of  the earth's climate through pollution -- as well as  deforestation, desertification and water pollution.    G7 heads of government and state are to meet in July in  Naples.</p>

"The fact that we have survived  and gotten here in 20 years is a miracle," said Arthur Mitchell, executive  director and co-founder of the company. Speaking before the performance,  Mitchell thanked the audience for its support and the city of New York for a  $2.5-million grant that will be used to renovate the Harlem facility and other  properties.

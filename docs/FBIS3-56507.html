The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR] Army units  are waging heavy defensive battles. The NKR Defense Army press  service has reported that yesterday the Azerbaijani troops  continued their incessant attacks against the Karabakh  positions. The fiercest battles took place in the direction of  Askeran-Agdam. The enemy used scores of armored cars.    After destroying one tank, one armored car, and more than 60  soldiers, the Karabakh fighters forced the Azerbaijanis to  retreat to their initial positions. Two were killed and seven  injured on the Armenian side.    No substantial changes took place in the other sectors of  the  confrontation line.    The Karabakh positions at the eastern and southeastern  sectors of the front have been coming under intensive artillery  and rocket shelling since this morning.    Also, the Azerbaijani Air Force has again become active. A  number of Azerbaijani warplanes tried to attack Stepanakert, the  capital of the NKR, between 1000-1200 today. Details are still  being verified.    The Armenian Defense Ministry Press Service has reported  that  it has been relatively calm on the Republic's border since  yesterday night. No serious incidents have been reported.</p>

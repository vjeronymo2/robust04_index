			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 10TH CHESS GAME, SHORTEST OF MATCH, ENDS IN A DRAW  </P> <P> Defending champion Garry Kasparov and challenger Anatoly Karpov agreed to a  draw Friday in the 10th game of the world chess championship.  </P> <P> The players agreed to the draw after Kasparov's 18th move.  </P> <P> The game lasted three hours and 12 minutes, the shortest so far in the match.  </P> <P> Each player had 4 1/2 points after they agreed to a draw Wednesday in the ninth  game. Friday's draw gave them each another half-point, bringing the match score  to 5-5.  </P> <P> The first player to gain 12 1/2 points wins the championship and $1.7 million  of a $3-million purse. In the event of a 12-12 tie, Kasparov will retain the  title. The first 12 games are being played in New York and the rest will be  played in Lyons, France.  </P> <P> Karpov had the advantage in Wednesday's game but blundered on the 32nd move and  lost a pawn. A few moves later, he offered a draw and Kasparov immediately  accepted.  </P> <P> Grandmaster Maxim Dlugy called the Wednesday mistake "the most horrible blunder  of this match." It was the third game in a row in which one player or the other  made a significant mistake.  </P> <P> Following are moves in the 10th game of the chess championship, with Kasparov  playing white:  </P> <P> 1. e4/e5; 2. Nf3/Nf6; 3. d4/exd4; 4. e5/Ne4; 5. Qxd4/d5; 6. exd6/Nxd6; 7.  Nc3/Nc6; 8. Qf4/Nf5; 9. Bb5/Bd6; 10. Qe4+/Qe7; 11. Bg5/f6; 12. Bd2/Bd7; 13.  0-0-0/Qxe4; 14. Nxe4/Be7; 15. g4/a6; 16. Bc4/Nd6; 17.

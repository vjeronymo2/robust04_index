			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Monitored in progress] </F>   [Text] ... (?Government) forces have been destroying  bridges in an attempt to slow down the advance of the Rwandan  Patriotic Army, especially in the southern part of the country.  Two bridges have been destroyed, one at Gashora on the road  from Bugesera to Butare and the other bridge across the River  Nyabarongo on the road to Gitarama. The Rwandese Patriotic  Front [RPF] now controls more than half of the country and this  includes the entire borderline with Uganda, the borderline with  Tanzania and a big part of the Rwanda borderline with Burundi.  The current RPF military offensive is intended to stop the  massacres by the illegitimate government in Rwanda, using the  army and the Republican National Movement for Democracy and  Development militia. The massacres have claimed more than  300,000 people, opposition officials and people of Tutsi origin.</p>

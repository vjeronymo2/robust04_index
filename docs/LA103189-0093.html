			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Bush Signs Farmer Relief Bill: President Bush signed legislation that gives a  break to farmers who are growing substitute crops on land where drought  destroyed or damaged earlier plantings. The measure eases restrictions that  were part of a previous federal farm-disaster aid package. The revision  protects winter wheat and cotton farmers who otherwise might have been denied  disaster payments for their lost crops under a USDA plan -- even though the  producers expect to earn little or no profit on replacement crops such as grain  sorghum or soybeans.  </P></p>

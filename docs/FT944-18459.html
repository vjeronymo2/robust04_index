			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Taiwan index hits second high in 2 days The Taiwan stock exchange index hit a second four-year high within two trading days yesterday, in anticipation of government support for share prices to boost the ruling party's prospects in December's elections. On December 3, voters will choose a provincial governor and mayors for Taipei, the capital, and the southern port city of Kaohsiung. Previously these were appointed posts. They will also elect the provincial assembly and councils for each of the two cities. Gauging by historical precedent, political imperatives, remarks by senior officials and monetary factors, stock market analysts believe the index could top 8,000 before the year ends. Yesterday's close was 7,183.75 points on moderate turnover of TDollars 64.16bn (Pounds 1.56bn). The governing Kuomintang's grip on power has slipped in successive elections since democratisation began with the lifting of martial law in 1987. The Democratic Progressive party, the leading opposition party, now controls one-third of Taiwan's counties and holds nearly a third of seats in the Legislative Yuan, the country's primary law-making body. In recent years the policies of the KMT have moved so closely into line with those of the opposition as to be nearly indistinguishable. KMT leadership has all but publicly declared Taiwanese independence from China, long the defining issue of the opposition, in an attempt to win votes. The ruling party is expected to win polls for the provincial governorship, largely a figurehead post, and thought likely to retain control of the Kaohsiung mayor's office. But it is widely seen as a fait accompli that the influential position of Taipei mayor will go to Mr Chen Shui-bien, the lawyer-turned-legislator of the DPP party. Mr Chen launched his political career defending dissidents arrested in a 1979 crackdown on opposition. 'Winning a mayoral seat would give the DPP a degree of legitimacy it did not have before,' Mr Peter Kurz, head of Asia-Pacific research for Baring Securities (Hong Kong), said. 'This would be the first time the DPP has attained an administrative position of real significance.' The stock market rallied sharply leading up to and after island-wide county elections in November 1993. The KMT retained control of most counties, but the DPP captured 42 per cent of the popular vote, its best showing. The three leading commercial banks led yesterday's gains. The banks are seen as bellwether stocks, and often their rise marks the beginning of a rally. 'A lot of people were caught napping last year, so when the banks start to move the fear factor sets in,' a stock analyst at a UK securities house said. See world stock markets</p>

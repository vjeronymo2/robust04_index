			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "If You Behave Yourselves Well, We </F> Will Help"]    [Text] The Cabinet of Ministers has allocated 3 1/2  billion coupons from the state budget to cover the debts of four  newspapers to the "Samshoblo" Publishing House where they are  published and from whom they rent offices. The lion's share of  this amount -- approximately 1.8 billion [coupons] -- has been  allocated to the newspaper SAKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA.    As the heads of the publishing house have said, this sum is  being formally transferred from the budget simply for publishing  needs. However, to all intents and purposes, this "injection" is  being allocated specifically to SAKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA,  SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA, and two publications appearing in the  Armenian and Azeri languages.    The sum is nothing out of the ordinary and, in general,  there  would have been nothing unusual in this had it not been for one  circumstance. All four newspapers were formerly the official  organs of the Communist Party Central Committee and Supreme  Soviet of Georgia.    However, following all the state political upheavals that  started in Georgia three years ago and that have seemingly  continued to this day, they were reregistered as independent  publications. Nevertheless, they have continued, in the main, to  fulfill their previous functions.    The problem would not have arisen had the state structures  admitted that they were openly protecting their own papers.  Such a draft decision now seems to be in preparation. However,  this as yet hidden patronage is causing justifiable resentment  among the mass of other truly independent publications.    The overwhelming majority of papers that are not so loyal to  the authorities are barely managing to make ends meet. However,  they are regularly paying their debts to the publishing house as  they fear for their fates.    True, even by doing this, they cannot boast that they are  being regularly published. Objective difficulties concerning  paper supply, electricity, and many other things encountered by  the single publishing house responsible for production and  equipment affects, first and foremost, precisely independent  publications. Some of them have been hit harder than others.    Criminal proceedings have been initiated against the  "Zviadist" newspapers [IBERIA-SPEKTR, SAKARTVELOS SAMREKLO] and  their publication has been halted.    DRONI employees are still being hauled up before the  Procurator's Office for publishing an interview with Nodar  Natadze, chairman of the Popular Front and one of the leaders of  the opposition in parliament, whose remarks opposing Georgia's  entry into the CIS were assessed as an incitement to violence.    The popular newspaper 7 DGHE, which takes a restrained but  very critical line against the current authorities, is in very  bad shape. A few months ago, a group of armed people, who were  not pleased with certain articles that had been published, raked  the editor in chief's office with gunfire and damaged a large  amount of editorial equipment. Then, last week, the remaining  computers and printers were stolen.    In general, when certain independent newspapers have to  suffer in this way, it is understandable why government help to  other -- also "independent" -- newspapers is viewed as blatant  injustice.    Meanwhile, the resignation of Archil Gogeliya, chairman of  the Television and Radio Broadcasting Corporation, has been  received in Eduard Shevardnadze's office. Certain television  employees with whom we spoke suppose that it was the result of  incessant "pressure" applied on the chairman from "above." The  leaders of opposition forces in Georgia have also pointed out  that their access to radio and television has been made  extremely difficult of late. However, Gogeliya's resignation  has yet to be accepted.</p>

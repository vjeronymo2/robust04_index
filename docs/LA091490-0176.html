			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BRITISH INFLATION OVER 10% MARK  </P> <P> Britain said today that its annual inflation rate broke through the  psychologically important 10% level in August for the first time in eight  years.  </P> <P> The retail price index, the country's main measure of inflation, showed a  year-on-year rise of 10.6% last month, up from 9.8% in both June and July.  </P> <P> It was higher than financial analysts had expected, but the London stock and  currency markets took it in their stride and were little changed by the news.  </P> <P> The underlying inflation level, which excludes home loans and local taxes and  is seen by some economists as a more accurate measure of price increases, also  rose from 7% in July to 7.9% in August.  </P></p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Forestry group makes turnround Kymmene, the Finnish forestry group, returned a FM176m (Dollars 32.5m) profit after financial items in the four months to the end of April, a sharp turnround from a FM164m loss (restated) made in the same period last year. The improvement was partly due to lower financial expenses stemming from reduced interest charges. Net financial expenses fell to FM460m from FM657m. Sales moved up to FM5.94bn from FM5.64bn, while group operating profit reached FM604m, compared with FM491m last time. The figures for last year were restated to conform with a shift to European Union-based accounting principles. Kymmene said markets for forest products had 'clearly improved' during the first four months, with prices increasing for fine papers and chemical pulp. It added that it expected improvements in earnings in chemical pulp, panels and sawn timber by the year end. The company said operating profits for the full year would be ahead of last year's FM1.58bn surplus. Kymmene spent FM295m on capital projects during the first four months and expected capital investment in production facilities to reach FM1.3bn for the year as a whole. The projects include two oxygen bleaching plants, an expansion of plywood output, the rebuilding of a paper mill and anti-air pollution projects at two chemical pulp mills.</p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: LET ROSEANNE BE NO BARR TO PEACE  </P> <P> I haven't heard too many solutions for the problems in the deserts of the  Mideast. Oh, there was that bad joke about how President Bush was going to send  1,000 women with PMS because they were not only mean as snakes but they also  could retain water. But other than that, no one has come forward with a plan.  Until a few weeks ago.  </P> <P> An Italian politician and porn star, Illona Staller (a.k.a. La Cicciolina), has  volunteered to sleep with Saddam Hussein if he agrees to free the foreigners he  is holding in Iraq.  </P> <P> I feel like a fool. The only thing I could come up with was to cut down on my  gas consumption by car-pooling.  </P> <P> The radical member of Parliament's offer is a dramatic one, but I have to ask  myself: Where was Illona when we were dealing with the old Ayatollah Khomeini  or the Zits Squad -- Gen. Manuel Noriega, Moammar Kadafi and Yasser Arafat? If  this is to be a viable solution to our global problems, we can't pick and  choose whom to sleep with.  </P> <P> Actually, I was surprised to see this offer come from Italy. It's usually the  French who make love, not war. The English, on the other hand, would have  countered with, "Let's sit down over a nice cup of hot tea." The Italians  traditionally would have said, "Relax. I'll make you a nice dinner."  </P> <P> The Americans? We don't really make sacrifices until we are pushed into a  corner. But we can do it. We can bite the bullet if we have to. There's an  entire generation out there without any idea of what we did to win World War II  on the home front. For four years, my grandmother saved her fat in large coffee  cans. I don't know what she ever did with it, but someone told her to do it and  she did. Nylon was being used for parachutes, so women used makeup on their  legs and painted a seam up the back with a pencil. On a hot day, the makeup  melted and your legs looked like someone turned up the heat in a wax museum.  </P> <P> We had ration stamps for sugar, coffee, shoes and gasoline. I don't recall  anyone stepping forward and volunteering to sleep with Hitler or Tojo.  </P> <P> On Thanksgiving, President Bush unveiled his secret weapon for peace. He said  he considered sending Roseanne Barr to Iraq to sing "The Star-Spangled Banner."  Before you discard that idea, remember what happened to Noriega when he hid out  in the Vatican embassy and our soldiers played rock music at 140 decibels?  </P> <P> Maybe our options come down to Illona or Roseanne.  </P></p>

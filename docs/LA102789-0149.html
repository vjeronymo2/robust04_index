			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COOPERATION CLEARS WAY, EDUCATORS SAY  </P> <P> Cooperation among high schools, community colleges and universities in Orange  County is removing barriers to higher education for minorities and others who  might otherwise be shut out, county education leaders said Thursday.  </P> <P> "It's a little embarrassing," said Rudy Castruita, superintendent of Santa Ana  Unified School District, "but three or four years ago, our counselors did not  know what the requirements were for the state university systems. The  cooperative programs we have now are making college a reality for our  youngsters. Before, it was just a dream."  </P> <P> Castruita, who heads the predominantly Latino district with 43,000 pupils,  joined Cal State Fullerton President Jewel Plummer Cobb and executives of four  community college districts Thursday at a "State of Education in Orange County"  breakfast meeting hosted by UC Irvine Chancellor Jack W. Peltason.  </P> <P> The links between the institutions have resulted in programs to encourage  minority students to pursue college education and in unified lobbying to get  more state money, Peltason said.  </P> <P> And while he said the ultimate cooperative effort -- establishment of a new  campus in the booming South County that would combine programs of the  University of California, California State University and Saddleback Community  College -- is still just a wish, Peltason said he sees no reason to rule it  out. Saddleback Chancellor Richard Sneed and Cal State Fullerton President Cobb  have suggested that such a university might grow out of CSUF's new satellite  campus in Mission Viejo.

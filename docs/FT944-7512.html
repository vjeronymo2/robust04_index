			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Observer: Out in the cold Whatever happened to Sir Peter Holmes? He has gone to ground since he stepped down as chairman of Royal Dutch/Shell nearly 18 months ago. Unlike his predecessors, such as Sir Peter Baxendell, who went on to chair Hawker Siddeley, and 'Fearless Frank' McFadzean, who went on to head British Airways and Rolls-Royce, Sir Peter has kept his head down. At 62, he is still young enough to take his pick of chairmanships in the public or private sector. But he seems to prefer spending his time trekking in remote areas rather than networking in the City. It seems to run in the family. His daughter, Martha Holmes, has just picked up an International Emmy award for her documentary Life in the Freezer - the product of two years spent in the Antarctic.</p>

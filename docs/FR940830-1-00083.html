Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 18, 1988, Congress enacted the Shore Protection Act (33 U.S.C. 2601, Public Law 100&hyph;688, 102 Stat. 4139 hereinafter referred to as ``SPA'') to minimize trash, medical debris and other unsightly and potentially harmful materials from being deposited into the coastal waters of the United States as a result of inadequate waste handling procedures by vessels transporting wastes on U.S. coastal waters and associated loading and off-loading facilities. SPA is Title IV, Subtitle A of P.L. 100&hyph;688. The Congressional Conference Report on P.L. 100&hyph;688 stated that landfills and their attendant barging operations are a major source of floatable waste in harbor areas. The report concluded that this type of waste has fouled the beaches of this country on several occasions, reducing the quality of coastal waters, endangering the health of humans, marine mammals, waterfowl and fish, and causing severe declines in coastal economies dependent upon tourism and recreational uses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4102 of SPA, titled Vessel Permits and Numbers, establishes that a vessel may not transport municipal or commercial waste in coastal waters without: (1) A permit from the Secretary of Transportation; and (2) displaying a number or other marking as prescribed by the Secretary under Chapter 123 of Section 12502(b) of Title 46, United States Code. The Department of Transportation (DOT) has promulgated an interim regulation on vessel permitting and vessel numbering system (33 CFR part 151, subpart B).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4103(a) of SPA requires owners and operators of waste sources, vessels transporting waste and waste receiving facilities to take all reasonable steps to minimize the amount of municipal or commercial waste deposited into coastal waters both during vessel loading and unloading operations, and during vessel transportation from a waste source to a receiving facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA and DOT have been given authority to implement certain provisions of SPA. DOT is responsible for issuing permits to the appropriate vessels and for prescribing the number or marking which the vessel must display under section 4102 of SPA. EPA is responsible for developing the regulations, in consultation with DOT, which prescribe waste handling practices pursuant to section 4103(b) of SPA. This proposed rule, when promulgated, will fulfill EPA's obligation under SPA section 4103(b). DOT is responsible for enforcing SPA, although the Secretary of Transportation may authorize other officers or employees of the United States Government to enforce provisions of SPA under title 14 U.S.C. 89.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary of Transportation has designated the United States Coast Guard (USCG) as the lead entity in implementing SPA on DOT's behalf. Vessel permits under SPA are issued by the USCG in accordance with 33 CFR part 151, subpart B. Under Sections 4102(d), (e) and 4104(a) of SPA, EPA has a consultation role on USCG permits and can request that the USCG deny, suspend or revoke a permit. Specifically, SPA section 4102(d) provides that DOT (USCG) and EPA can deny a permit if the owner or operator of a vessel has a record indicating a pattern of serious violations of any of the following statutes: The Shore Protection Act (33 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.); The Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.); The Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 (33 U.S.C. 1401 et seq.); The Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899 (33 U.S.C. 401 et seq.); or The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.). SPA directs the USCG to provide a hearing process for denial, suspension or revocation of a permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA is proposing these regulations to set waste handling practices for municipal and commercial waste transported in U.S. coastal waters. SPA permits will require the permittee to comply with these EPA regulations when they are promulgated in final form.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG /FTAG --></p>

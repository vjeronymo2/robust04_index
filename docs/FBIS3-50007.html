			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Jan 14 (CTK) -- The articles on appointment  of LIDOVE NOVINY editors, included in the agreement on the  position of editor-in-chief, violate the law and were therefore  never valid. Therefore, it is not true that the agreement was  violated by the adoption of the new internal rules and  procedures, Josef Kotrba informed CTK today.    Kotrba, chairman of the Board of the LIDOVE NOVINY joint  stock company, was reacting to a series of declarations by  Jaromir Stetina, who resigned as LN editor-in-chief on Wednesday  [12 January]. He said that the new internal rules and  procedures, accepted by the LN Board of Directors recently,  violated two essential documents -- the editorial statute and  the agreement on the editor-in-chief -- which guarantee the  independence of the paper.    According to the new rules, the top editors of the staff are  not appointed by the editor-in-chief, but by the director of the  company, and the editor-in-chief is not subordinate to the  Board, but to its chairman.    Kotrba's declaration said that the Board of Directors,  composed entirely of the original shareholders of the LN joint  stock company and the employees, explicitly declared that the  new rules did not contradict the statute of the editorial staff.    LIDOVE NOVINY was founded in 1893 as a liberal daily. Banned  by the communist regime after it seized power, it started  reappearing in 1988 as a dissident publication.    Last November the Swiss press company Ringier purchased a  majority stake in the paper, whose circulation is around 100,000  copies.    The declaration also mentioned that the paper's independence  was not threatened at all since it was guaranteed by an  editorial board statute which can be only changed by a general  meeting of the shareholders with a nine-tenths vote.</p>

			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Why the Germans fight shy of shares A STORY is circulating in German financial circles about Chancellor Helmut Kohl's first visit to the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in January this year. Shortly before he gave a stirring speech to the flower of Germany's business community, the Chancellor was chatting with Rudiger von Rosen, the exchange's managing director. The conversation turned to the German people's reluctance to invest in shares. 'Why is it,' Kohl is reported to have wondered, 'that we Germans are more than happy to invest in big cars, nice houses and long holidays - but we never buy any shares?' Kohl is not alone in being nonplussed at this eccentric aspect of the German character. Normally patriotic and hard-headed, Germans have denied themselves the opportunity to invest profitably in their own successful economy. Germans avoid investing their copious surplus cash in shares and much prefer buying government securities - 'even though they know they will make much more money owning shares rather than bonds', as von Rosen puts it. As a measure of this, the value of Germans' investments in bond funds was DM102bn last year - a five-fold increase since the beginning of the 1980s. The comparable figure for equity unit trusts was DM20bn, not much more than double the DM8bn it was ten years ago. This is in spite of the fact that the average gross annual return on bonds was 8 per cent a year during the 1980s, compared with 14 per cent for equities. DM10,000 (Pounds 3,400) invested in the DAX index of 30 leading shares at the beginning of the 1980s would now be worth DM33,400 (Pounds 11,360). If the same amount of money were invested in Bunds, it would now be worth DM21,600 (Pounds 7,347). The net return for equities was even higher, as investors do not have to pay capital gains tax on equities if they hold them for more than six months. In total, there are only about 4.2m shareholders in Germany - just over 5 per cent of the population - compared with 12m shareholders in the UK and 51m in the US - 21 per cent of the population in both cases. So why are Germans so shy of buying shares? Here are a few reasons for the lack of an equity culture in Germany: An aversion to the rough-and-tumble of the equity markets - and by extension to speculation and financial excesses of any kind - is deeply ingrained in the German psyche, probably due to folk memories of the great inflations of the 1920s and the political consequences. 'Germans are not . . . at ease with the equity market,' says Christian Strenger, until recently with the Deutsche Bank in New York and now head of the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Wertpapiersparen, Europe's largest retail fund manager, with DM50bn under management. 'They like it when it goes up but their tolerance level is low when it goes down. 'If someone in the US buys a share and it doesn't work out, he says to himself, 'OK, too bad.' He sells the stock at a loss and makes a new investment. Here people sit and suffer. They hate to lose and are not very mobile when compared with US investors.' The concept of 'shareholder value' - of managing a business for the benefit of shareholders - is rare. German law requires that managers put the interests of the 'company' - difficult to define - ahead of those of other parties. It is against the law to put the shareholder first. Hostile takeovers are virtually unheard of. Management performance is never subjected to the judgment of the market - unlike in the UK or the US where managers live in constant fear of being dislodged by a bidder if they do not deliver. German managers have no great incentive to raise share prices, and shareholders can never benefit from takeovers. The German stock market plays a limited role in German corporate life. Only about 660 companies have a listing and all but around 50 of these are controlled by family shareholders or the big German banks and insurance companies. Companies rarely turn to the stock market for funds, relying on their commercial banking relationships instead. Domestic institutional investment in equities - from pension funds and insurance companies - is not well developed. For example, Germany's colossal insurance companies have an average of between 5 and 15 per cent of their reserves invested in shares, and the rest in government bonds. This is the opposite of the situation in the UK and US and hinders the development of liquid equity markets. Germans have been put off buying equities as a result of a spate of insider dealing cases and other murky goings-on in the Frankfurt stock market (the biggest by far of Germany's six exchanges) last year. Partly as a response to last year's scandals, the German financial establishment has embarked on a big 'clean-up.' Insider dealing is to become illegal (it is not at the moment) and a tough new regulatory regime is planned for the end of the year. These initiatives are targeted primarily at international institutional investors and are designed to make Frankfurt more competitive with London as a financial centre. However, they are also likely to attract private individuals back to the market. In the short term, Germans are likely to shun equities and continue investing in holidays, big cars, bonds - and bank accounts. German interest rates are at historically high levels and German investors prefer to take no risks - they just leave their money in the bank.</p>

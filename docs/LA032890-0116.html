			<p><P> March 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FERRARO SEES LIKELIHOOD OF WATER RATIONING  </P> <P> City Council President John Ferraro on Tuesday said "there is a strong  possibility" that Los Angeles will resort to water rationing this summer in the  face of a projected 12% shortfall in water supplies.  </P> <P> But Ferraro, following a council committee hearing on the Department of Water  and Power's projections, said he does not believe that strict enforcement  methods are necessary or cost-effective in saving water.  </P> <P> "The people have responded in the past and they will again" answer the call to  reduce water usage and honor rationing levels, Ferraro said. "We can't expect  the police . . . to check on every leaky water faucet," he said.  </P></p>

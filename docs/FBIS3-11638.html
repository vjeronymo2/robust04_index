			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ligia Moreno ] </F>   [Text] During a meeting with members of the Venezuelan  Institute of Financial Executives, Finance Minister Julio Sosa  Rodriguez said that he must meet with President Rafael Caldera  to discuss Democratic Action's proposal to grant special powers  to the president. Caracas Stock Exchange President Noris  Aguirre and Finance Vice Minister (Luis Javier Grisanti) also  participated in the meeting.    Minister Sosa indicated that in his opinion, a special  powers  bill would only serve to expedite measures he has already  proposed. He emphasized that Venezuela has gone from an exchange  rate of 4.30 bolivares per U.S. dollar to 115 bolivares per U.S.  dollar without knowing for certain the reasons behind such a  currency devaluation, which is most probably related to the  fiscal deficit. He also pointed out that the government is very  concerned about this situation and believes that there cannot be  any in-depth changes to the Sosa Plan. Nevertheless, the  possibility of a special powers law has not been rejected.    [Begin Sosa recording] I do not think modifications can be  made and then a special powers law promulgated, because what  they would really be doing is evaluating the same laws that  allow them to promulgate such a law. If it is a special powers  law, they are really passing the responsibility to the Executive  Branch. [end recording]    Minister Sosa Rodriguez also emphasized that his visit to  the  United States had been positive because he felt that investors  were receptive to Venezuela's proposals. He also stated that he  did not understand a report in THE ECONOMIST [previous two words  in English] that states the VAT should have been applied only at  the retail level since implementing such a proposal is very  difficult. In addition, in reference to gasoline, what the  government can earn in revenue is merely 20 to 50 billion  bolivares, which is insufficient to solve the country's problems.    Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez concluded by insisting  that right now the most important thing is to pull Venezuela out  of the economic and fiscal crisis it is currently facing.</p>

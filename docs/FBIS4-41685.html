			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Major General Yu.P. Makarov, commander of </F> Separate Berlin Order of Bogdan Khmelnitskiy Motorized Rifle  Guards' Brigade of Russian Armed Forces, by Aleksandr Polotskiy  of RIA NOVOSTI under the "Out-of-Turn Parade" rubric; place and  date not given: "Russia, Dismiss! With Belongings! May 1945:  They Came. June 1994: They Left"]    [Text] Today, 25 June, the farewell parade of the Separate  Berlin Order of Bogdan Khmelnitskiy Motorized Rifle Guards'  Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces will take place in the  capital of Germany. Our correspondent met with Major General  Yuriy Petrovich Makarov, its commander.    [Polotskiy] The allies left with music, riding on combat  hardware. But we?    [Makarov] Ten T-80 tanks are ready for the parade, but the  German authorities are very afraid for "the asphalt and the road  markings," which they might damage, and also for the streetcar  lines, of which there are rather a lot in this part of East  Berlin. Some six weeks ago, however, when a brigade of the  French armed forces took its leave of the city folk in the  environs of its Berlin garrison, the French drove not even 10  but a whole 30 of their tanks into the streets -- the world was  not turned upside down. Berliners gave the French military a  very benevolent welcome.    [Polotskiy] Is the motherland ready to receive you?    [Makarov] We will send all our combat hardware and armament  to Russia before 5 July, and all the families will leave before  1 August. Only servicemen who will participate in the final  ceremonial send-off of the Russian troops from Germany,  scheduled for 31 August in the presence of President B. Yeltsin  and Chancellor H. Kohl, will remain in Berlin. We will set out  in two trains for the motherland, for Russia, 1 and 2 September.  A ceremonial welcome for the Berlin Brigade is already  scheduled for 3 September in Moscow and for 4 September in Kursk.    I will state frankly that we have been very lucky with our  new stationing location -- housing for officers is already ready  for us there, and there is a barracks for soldiers. We are  taking with us another two prefabricated-panel barracks, which  will house the medical unit and the staff, and we are reckoning  on settling in entirely normally in the new place by fall or the  beginning of winter. A Turkish firm is constructing a military  camp there with 1,326 apartments, schools, clubs, and an  artificial reservoir with funds taken from the sum of 7.8  billion marks allocated by the FRG Government.    [Polotskiy] In conclusion: Yuriy Petrovich, which of the  Russian servicemen, nonetheless, will be the last to leave  Berlin?    [Makarov] We are people who respect both ourselves and  others. Therefore, in order to leave the garrison in Karlshorst  clean and in full order, we propose to entrust this work to a  special recultivation group from our brigade. It will consist  of up to one company. This group will have through 5 September  to "tidy the apartment" being left to its owners.</p>

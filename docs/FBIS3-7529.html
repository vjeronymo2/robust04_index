			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Cynthia D. Balana and Lynda T. Jumilla] </F>   [Text] Foreign Secretary Roberto Romulo yesterday  described as "inappropriate" and "unproductive" the United  States decision to send 160 Patriot air defense missiles to  South Korea, saying the arms buildup against communist North  Korea could lead to "miscalculation" and war.    Sharing Romulo's apprehensions, Sen. Blas F. Ople warned the  Philippines may again be drawn into a full-scale conflict in the  peninsula as in the 1950-53 Korean War.    Sen. Rodolfo Biazon, however, called on the Philippines and  other members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to  avoid knee-jerk reactions and "carefully measure their responses  to developments in the Korean peninsula."    Tensions on the peninsula are high over North Korea's  suspected nuclear weapons program. Nearly 2 million troops on  both Koreas have been placed on a heightened alert.    The situation sharply deteriorated last weekend after  Pyongyang barred UN experts from inspecting sites where North  Korea is believed to be developing nuclear weapons.    While seeking UN sanctions against Pyongyang, the United  States decided to ship Patriot missiles, more troops and  additional arms to South Korea. Washington also planned to  revive "Team Spirit" military exercises with Seoul.    North Korea has declared these U.S. measures, if pushed  ahead, would be taken as a declaration of war.    "I continue to be worried about the Korean situation,"  Romulo  told a press briefing. "All parties must be deliberate in  action and not consider the international isolation of the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea."    He said the United States approach was "inappropriate,  unproductive and may even cause disequilibrium in the  Asia-Pacific region."    Romulo's statements represented a rare instance when Manila  openly refused to toe the U.S. line.    He said Washington seemed "unmindful" of the repercussions  of  its action on ASEAN members, including the Philippines, should  the heightened tension on the Korean peninsula lead to war.    Like Washington, Manila only has diplomatic relations with  Seoul but not with Pyongyang, an isolated, Stalinist state.    Still, Romulo said, it would be more productive if North  Korea were encouraged to join the international community of  nations.    Romulo said he has ordered Philippine Ambassador to South  Korea Francisco Benedicto to draw up a contingency plan for some  20,000 Filipino workers there should war break out.    At the Senate, Ople said he expects the Philippines to be  "under pressure" to support any UN-led military action against  Pyongyang.    During the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, Manila sided  with Seoul and sent the Philippine Expeditionary Force to Korea  upon the "request" of the U.S.-dominated United Nations.  President Ramos, then a lieutenant, was part of the Philippine  military contingent.    "If there's going to be war between the United Nations and  North Korea, I would expect the Philippines to be put under  pressure to send troops," said Ople, chair of the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee.    He said the imposition of UN economic sanctions would force  Pyongyang to resort to war.    Ople called on Manila to lead the ASEAN in an "intensified  peace diplomacy" to defuse the tension in the Korean peninsula.    But Biazon said the Philippines may not necessarily be  compelled to send a military contingent should a Korean war  erupt anew.    "Not one nation can be compelled to do so because sending  troops is a function also of its capability to bankroll, equip,  and staff such a force," he said.    Biazon called on Pacific rim nations, particularly ASEAN  members, to "carefully measure their responses to the  developments in the Korean peninsula."    "This is just the classic military situation of buildup on  the frontlines and there may not be cause for alarm at the  moment," he said.    Biazon said that conditions are no longer the same as in the  1950s because the Cold War is over and countries in the region  are more concerned about economic progress.    But should tensions degenerate into a military  confrontation,  "then let it be confined to the peninsula," he said.</p>

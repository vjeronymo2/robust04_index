			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> CITY HALL WILL CLOSE THROUGH HOLIDAYS  </P> <P> Fullerton City Hall will be closed for the holidays, Dec. 25 through Jan. 1. It  will reopen at 8 a.m. on Jan. 2.  </P> <P> Essential services, such as police and fire protection, will be unaffected, but  the city's libraries and recreation facilities will operate on reduced holiday  schedules.  </P> <P> Water bills deposited in the slot outside City Hall will be collected during  the holiday week, and maintenance crews will be on stand-by in case of an  emergency.  </P> <P> City officials say the reduced schedule saves money by closing offices where  demand for services is typically slow during the holidays. Most employees will  take the week off without pay.  </P></p>

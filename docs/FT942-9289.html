			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Church assets return to growth Assets of the Church Commissioners, which declined by Pounds 800m between 1989 and 1992 after over-exposure in property markets, grew by 14 per cent last year. Summary accounts published yesterday showed that net assets rose from Pounds 2.1bn in 1992 to Pounds 2.4bn last year. The assets were worth Pounds 2.9bn in 1989 and the commissioners say that last year's growth makes their value similar in real terms to the early 1980s. But although asset value improved, net income declined by 4 per cent last year to Pounds 154.9m. The Church of England has been forced to recognise that, even before the collapse in asset values, it was making excessive demands on the commissioners' income. In their report yesterday the commissioners said distribution of income had been running at more than 7 per cent of assets 'instead of the 4 per cent to 5 per cent which might normally be considered prudent for the preservation of capital value'. As a result parishes are being told that they must make a greater contribution to the cost of maintaining their churches. The commissioners last year paid Pounds 58m to clergy stipends - 37 per cent of the total. Their contribution to stipends and housing support will be reduced by Pounds 5.5m this year and Pounds 12m next year. Parish support for stipends rose by 2 per cent to Pounds 67.8m last year. One of the church's biggest financial difficulties concerns clergy pensions. These are financed almost entirely by the commissioners, and expenditure rose from Pounds 63.9m in 1992 to Pounds 69.4m last year. With pension costs continuing to rise, there is a risk that the present pension scheme would eventually consume the commissioners' entire income. Alternative proposals will be published later this year. The commissioners yesterday said a series of steps had been taken following 'serious criticism' of their asset management last year in reports commissioned by Dr George Carey, archbishop of Canterbury. An audit committee had been established, a new financial secretary appointed, the property portfolio independently valued and assessed and independent actuaries appointed.</p>

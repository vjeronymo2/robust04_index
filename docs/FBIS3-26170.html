At the beginning of this year, when we look  ahead, we have every reason to believe that great successes in  reform will definitely be achieved in the new year.    As everyone knows, the theme of reform in the 1980's was to  smash the old system, which was a project of "demolishing the  old house," whereas the major task of reform in the future is to  set up a new system, which is a project of "constructing a  building." In a sense, the latter is even more difficult than  the former because reform today has begun to shift from a  shallow level to a deep level and from achieving successes in  single areas to making overall progress.    Reform at a deep level determines that we have to undertake  arduous tasks.    So, in 1994, what kind of reform tasks are we going to face?  According to officials of the State Commission for Restructuring  Economy, following a long period of repeated deliberations,  studies, and estimates, in the new year reform will be deepened  and breakthroughs will be made in many fields, including  taxation; finance; investment; the foreign trade system; social  security; the housing system; the civil service system; the wage  system of executive organs, institutions, and units; and price  reform.    There are two foci in these numerous reforms: Efforts will  be made to transform the state-owned enterprise operating  mechanism and to make innovations in the enterprise system and,  at the same time, to speed up reforms in the taxation, finance,  planning, and investment systems and to make important strides  forward in establishing a macroscopic regulation system in line  with the requirements of the market economy.    To fulfill these arduous tasks in reform, we must ultimately  achieve three goals: 1) We must establish a modern enterprise  system which meets the requirements of the market economy and in  which the property rights as well as the rights and  responsibilities of enterprises are clearly defined, government  administration and enterprise management are separated, and  scientific management is established; 2) With emphasis on  developing the market of factors of production, we must develop  a unified, open, competitive, and orderly market system; 3) We  must study and establish a positive and effective system of  state macroscopic regulation and policies as well as a whole set  of national economic statistical indexes and laws and  regulations so as to maintain a basic equilibrium of total  supply and demand, to help optimize the economic structure, and  to lead to sustained and healthy development of the national  economy.    Experts generally hold that to fulfill these tasks and  achieve the set reform goals, we must uphold the reform strategy  of making overall progress in a coordinated manner. We must not  only carry out a comprehensive design of reform from a  coordinated angle but also consider the arrangement of each and  every reform measure from a comprehensive angle.    The reform in 1994, which touches a wide range of areas, is  a  complicated and formidable systematic project. Reform which is  carried out in a wide scope at a deep level involves the  readjustment of the pattern of power and interests on all sides.  Hence, to fulfill these tasks, we must on the one hand be fully  confident of victory, but on the other hand we must be  psychologically prepared for difficulties which may arise,  insist on scientific design, work prudently, sum up the  situation promptly, and avoid making big mistakes.    The conditions are favorable. First, our party constantly  clarifies the orientation and objectives of reform and perfects  theories of reform, thus creating a favorable political  environment; second, 15 years of reform and opening up have  enabled millions of people to more consciously take part in this  great practice, thus creating a more favorable social  environment and public opinion. In addition, as the people's  living standard is being improved day by day and they are in hot  pursuit of new systems and things, all these factors also  strengthen their perseverance in reform, thus creating a better  environment of psychological acceptance.    We have nowhere to retreat. The establishment of a socialist  market economic system is a pioneering undertaking unprecedented  in human history, and we are required to accomplish this great  cause with unprecedented courage. We are full of hope in the  new year and toward the future.</p>

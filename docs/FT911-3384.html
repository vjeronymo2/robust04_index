			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / World Trade News: Tokyo and US split on wording of chip pact TOKYO has agreed that a 20 per cent target figure can be included in a new pact with the US on its foreign semiconductor market share in Japan, but the two countries were divided last night over final wording of the agreement. Japanese officials suggested they had made a significant concession in accepting the figure, although it has been clear that the US would not conclude the negotiations unless a target was set. The two countries have argued for five years over whether a target figure was set for the first semiconductor agreement, which began in 1986 and will expire at the end of July, with Washington insisting that the commitment was contained in a side-letter and Tokyo arguing that no such commitment was made. Japanese officials want the 20 per cent to be seen as a general goal rather than a specific target, and are aiming for a final wording of the agreement to be vague enough for it not to be a precedent for market share targets in other trade areas. The foreign-market share in Japan at the end of last year was 13.2 per cent and, under the US interpretation of the present agreement, was supposed to be 20 per cent in July, a target that is now out of reach. The latest round of negotiations for a new pact began here on Tuesday and continued late last night. While there were hopes that the agreement would be settled, officials of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and the office of the US Trade Representative are likely to have to meet again. Other important issues have been Japan's insistence that sanctions imposed under the present agreement be lifted, and the choice of a measurement standard for the market share. Japanese officials have argued that Japanese companies are making efforts to increase their use of foreign chips and these efforts should be recognised in the new agreement.</p>

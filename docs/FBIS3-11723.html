			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Arturo Jara Avelli, president of the UIP  [Paraguayan Industrial Union], reported that during the latest  UIP executive board meeting the unanimous decision was made "to  withdraw support for the government, as no results can be seen  for this sector."    The UIP executive board will meet on 30 March to debate this  issue as well as the country's economic situation and the  government position in face of demands made by industrialists.    The rupture between the industrial sector and the government  will lead within a short term to the withdrawal of its  representatives in the Coordination Council for Social  Development. This decision was conveyed yesterday to Industry  and Commerce Minister Uvaldo Scavone, who also received the  concerns of the industrialists.    Jara Avelli said: "Some of the problems we see in the  current situation are an economic policy harmful to industry,  the overvaluation of local currency that favors `dumping' by  some countries into the Paraguayan economy, and the lack of  support for this sector." [passage omitted]    According to Jara Avelli, the industrialists gave the  government eight months time by keeping a "prudent silence, and  the government should have at least shown the political will to  solve the problems, but we did not see any such thing," and we  therefore decided to withdraw our support.    He said: "Industry receives support in the electoral  campaigns, and we saw within the economic program of President  Juan Carlos Wasmosy an industrial development plan, but nothing  of that plan has been fulfilled."    He added: "We realized the government's lack of a political  will to change the economy of exploiting raw materials without  added value, and of trying to solve the problem by importing  subsidized finished products -- in other words a system that  creates hunger among peasants and favors a privileged group of  importers."    He concluded by saying: "The government must realize it  cannot continue to put the industrial sector aside."</p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Observer: Flying high Dutch racing pigeons may be tested for drugs to foil cheats who artificially boost their birds' aerial prowess, according to a report in a Dutch newspaper. Drugs can slow the rate at which young pigeons lose their feathers during moulting and so increase flying speed. The sport's ruling body, the Netherlands' Pigeon Post Organisation, is so concerned it is sending its chairman to a Belgian research laboratory - to investigate methods of dope testing winning birds, rather than to be tested himself.</p>

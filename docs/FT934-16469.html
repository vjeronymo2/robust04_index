			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / AT&amp;T appoints president to target UK as growth area AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Tele-graph, the US telecommunications giant, has appointed its first UK president, to spearhead its growing ambitions in the UK. Mr Merrill Tutton is one of only three AT&amp;T country presidents outside the US. The other two are in Spain and China, which AT&amp;T also views as growth markets. Mr Tutton, 52, was formerly responsible for AT&amp;T's residential long-distance business in the US, which has more than 32,000 employees. It forms a large part of the company's telecommunications services group, which last year generated turnover of Dollars 40bn (Pounds 26bn). The appointment of such a senior manager indicates the priority AT&amp;T attaches to developing its UK business. With 7,000 UK-based employees, AT&amp;T has only a modest foothold in the UK. But it has an application pending with the Department for Trade and Industry for a full public network operating licence. It could use the licence either to build its own infrastructure or - more likely - to provide services in conjunction with existing and new operators in the UK's increasingly competitive market. Either way, it would give added intensity to AT&amp;T's international battle with British Telecommunications. Both operators are seeking to establish themselves as global companies, providing cross-border services to multinational companies. 'This is a tangible sign of our long-term commitment to the UK market,' said Mr Tutton. 'There are many new areas we could develop if we gain a licence: our whole notion is to grow this market.' BT yesterday made large cuts in its prices for international digital private circuits. It made average reductions of 29 per cent on circuits to North America and 11 per cent to most of Europe, and launched special offers for companies agreeing fixed-term contracts for circuits to North America and parts of Asia-Pacific and the Middle East.</p>

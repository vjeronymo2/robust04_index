			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>   [Text] Han Blix, director general of the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], strongly hinted today that there  are still several undeclared nuclear facilities [in North Korea]  by disclosing for the first time that it is essential to make  approaches to more facilities, in addition to ad hoc inspections  of two undeclared facilities, for the purpose of looking into  the exact amount of North Korea's stockpile of plutonium.    In the second-day session of the IAEA Board of Governors  held  early this morning, Director General Han Blix made a separate  report on North Korea's violations of the nuclear agreement in  which he expressed with high intensity and certainty that there  is undeclared plutonium in North Korea at the moment, while  saying that he did not know whether it is in gram or kilogram.    Director General Han Blix pointed out that the two  undeclared  facilities, which North Korea has not opened to inspections  claiming they are military facilities, exist within the Yongbyon  nuclear complex. He stressed that North Korea's allegations  they are military facilities are not sufficient to set aside  inspection.    In particular, Director General Han Blix said for the first  time that it is essential to make approaches to more facilities  in addition to ad hoc inspections of the treatment site of  nuclear waste materials for the purpose of looking into the  exact amount of the plutonium produced, thereby strongly hinting  that there are several new undeclared nuclear facilities.    In the meantime, the IAEA Board of Governors will adopt a  resolution of warning against North Korea after discussing North  Korea's nuclear issue either tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.</p>

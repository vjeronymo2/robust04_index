I claim that not a single unit of the army of Yugoslavia has  crossed into or is fighting in either the Serb republic (RS)  (the state of the Bosnian Serbs) or in the republic of Serb  Krajina (RSK) (The serb state within the administrative borders  of the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia)," [quotation marks  as received] General Perisic said on Radio Kragujevac. He said  there was no organized departure of the Army of Yugoslavia for  the RS, and there would be none in the foreseeable future. The  U.N. and the U.S. Administration, themselves, have said that  there is no evidence that VJ units are engaged in the fighting  in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Asked to comment the NATO threats that it will launch air  strikes against Bosnian Serb positions, General Perisic said he  did not think the air strikes would take place since he said  what was involved were threats and pressure from the architects  of the so-called new world order.    The VJ chief of general staff said the use of any  significant  forces in the air in Bosnia-Herzegovina would produce small  results militarily and would not secure the desired goal. If  such strikes are launched, however, I think that Serbs in the  RS, especially their military leaders, are wise enough to avoid  the strikes, that is, place themselves in a position in which  they would maximally be protected, General Perisic said.    Asked about the possibility of the war spilling over into  the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Perisic said the forces which  had undertaken to destroy the states on the territory of the  former Yugoslavia wanted to apply the same scenario to the  territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia using, among  other things, on the basis of the same principle applied so far,  internal factors which have directly placed themselves in the  service of those forces and were working for their interests.    It is for that reason that the situation in the F.R.Y. is  very complex, and it is only thanks to the extremely wisely  conducted policy that the scenario has not been applied on its  territory. We must constantly be aware of that, of the fact  that the enemy's ultimate goal is to place the Serb and  Montengrin peoples in the position of the Palestinian people,  that is, of a people without its own state. It is quite clear  to everyone what has been and what is the faith of peoples with  no state, General Perisic set out.    Asked whether it was possible for the war to escalate and  spread to other parts of the Balkans, General Perisic said the  architects of the "new world order" had caused the war on the  territory of the former Yugoslavia and for the time being, since  the war had acquired such proportions and gotten out of their  control, they feared the most that it could acquire proportions  which would threaten Europe and the world.    Faced with the unexpected resistance by the Serb people on  the territory of the former Yugoslavia, the architects of the  "new world order" are now afraid of a war on a larger scale, all  the more so since they can no longer control it, just as they  cannot Croatia's intervention on Bosnia-Herzegovina territory,  or the activities of Muslim forces, General Perisic said.    Roughly 60,000 of Croatia's regular army troops have been  engaged in the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina since it broke  out in April 1992. The three warring sides in  Bosnia-Herzegovina are the local Muslims, Serbs and Croats.</p>

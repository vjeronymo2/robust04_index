			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FDA APPROVES HUMAN TESTS FOR TRIMEDYNE ARTERY LASER  </P> <P> Trimedyne Inc. said Tuesday that it has received approval from the U.S. Food  and Drug Administration to conduct human tests on its holmium cold-laser system  to clear clogged heart arteries as an alternative to bypass surgery.  </P> <P> The Tustin-based biotechnology company said it successfully tested the laser  system last week at the Northern Sheffield Hospital in England. It expects to  expand its studies to more than 10 medical centers worldwide, including  Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center.  </P> <P> The news of the FDA approval gave the company's stock a boost Tuesday. The  stock closed up 37.5 cents Tuesday, closing at $2.25 in over-the-counter  trading. Still, Trimedyne stock is off 67% from its yearly high of $6.75  achieved in January.  </P> <P> Trimedyne, which pioneered the use of laser-assisted catheters to open blocked  arteries, in 1987 was the first company to win FDA approval to use lasers in  leg surgery.  </P> <P> Its technology then was a "hot-tip" laser that used heat to vaporize plaque or  fatty deposits in arteries. That hot laser, however, could damage the artery.  </P> <P> Cold lasers have since been used to cut through the plaque with short bursts of  ultraviolet light, which do not produce the heat of hot lasers.  </P> <P> Trimedyne's cold laser uses holmium, a rare metal element used to control the  wavelengths of highly focused laser light.  </P> <P> FDA spokeswoman Susan Cruzan said it normally takes more than two years for a  company to test a medical device and get final approval. Trimedyne is just one  of several companies that received FDA approval to test the cold laser for  coronary application, she said.  </P> <P> Other companies include Irvine's Advanced International Systems Inc.,  Spectronetics Corp. of Colorado Springs and Eclipse Surgical Technologies Inc.  of Mountain View in Santa Clara County. GV Medical Inc. of Minneapolis said it  expects approval for similar tests later this year.  </P> <P> "The company hopes to use this new device to re-establish itself as a leader in  laser angioplasty," said Chriss W. Street, managing director of Reorganized  Securities Corp. in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> He added that if approved by the FDA, the device could move Trimedyne to the  forefront of this increasingly popular method of correcting coronary artery  problems, short of heart surgery.  </P></p>

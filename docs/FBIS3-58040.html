			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed JCH/MAR: "Cautious Response From Belgian </F> Foreign Ministry Following Mobutu Statements"; as released by  Brussels BELGA Database]    [Text] Brussels, 5 Jan (BELGA) -- "After an initial  analysis, it would appear from the statements made by Zairian  President Mobutu that he seems to be taking into account a  number of points mentioned in the latest approaches taken by  Belgium, France, and the United States, by coming out in favor  of the rapid signing of the agreements on the transition to and  implementation of a government," said a spokesman for the  Belgian Foreign Ministry, in response to the latest political  statements made by Marshal Mobutu.    "It is clear, however, that all these points, especially the  delicate question of the opposition appointing a prime minister,  must be cleared up. As in the past, we remain vigilant," the  same source said.    "President Mobutu is advocating presidential, parliamentary,  and local elections before the end of the year, but for us it is  essential that these elections be able to be held under good  conditions and that they be free and fair. Only a government of  national unity will be able to ensure such conditions," the  spokesman continued.    "In a country that has no infrastructure or means of  communication, organizing elections presents enormous  difficulties. At first glance, a one year deadline seems  inadequate," the Foreign Ministry affirmed, saying that "this  question will also have to be the subject of consultations  between the Zairian parties involved."    "Belgium will continue consultations with its Western  partners as well as with the Twelve. At present, the policy  established vis-a-vis Zaire is not subject to change. We feel  the criteria of this policy were clearly established by the  trilateral approach of 10 December 1993," the spokesman  concluded.    The approach of 10 December 1993 was made jointly by  Belgium,  France, and the United States to President Mobutu and Prime  Minister Tshisekedi.    Motivated by the breakdown of the democratization process  and  the alarming economic situation, the aim of the approach was to  lead to concluding the transition agreements negotiated since 10  September between the opposition and the supporters of the  president, appointing the prime minister from within the  opposition, and rapidly implementing an efficient government of  national unity.    This approach was taken at the request of the Western  countries by Lakhdar Brahimi, special envoy of the the UN  secretary general.</p>

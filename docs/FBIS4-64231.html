			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Government, Berlusconi `Fairly </F> Optimistic'"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 29 -- Prime Minister-designate  Silvio Berlusconi, leaving his Roman residence this morning,  told reporters he was "fairly optimistic" he could form a  government in reasonable time.    His morning's agenda included meetings with Northern League  representatives Umberto Bossi and Roberto Maroni, with life  Senator Paolo Emilio Taviani, and with Rome Mayor Francesco  Rutelli.    Asked about the controversy over the sensitive post of the  Interior Ministry, the Forza Italia leader said that "We still  have to go into all that but I don't see any insurmountable  problems."    His Northern League allies have pressed to obtain that post,  but other political forces have vetoed that, saying the League  could open up a Pandora's box if they got their hands on  sensitive police and security roles and files.    The list of potential ministers was "still up in the air,"  he  said.    Formal consultations on the cabinet are slated to begin  Monday [2 May].</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Irina Kiryanova: "President On Vacation: So The </F> Local Kolkhoz Members Get it in the Neck"]    [Text] Krasnodar -- The Russian president, on vacation in  Sochi, met there with Kuban Governor Nikolay Yegorov. They  discussed questions of the development of agriculture, the fight  against crime, restrictions on migration to the kray, and the  stationing of military formations on its territory. The  president approved the local administration's actions.    Boris Yeltsin was told of the active dissatisfaction of the  heads of major collective farms in the kray with the latest  recommendations by the president's analysis center. Anger at  price parity that puts the countryside at a disadvantage, at tax  policy, and so on is now commonplace. But the proposal on  breaking up farms immediately, on the threshold of the spring  sowing, provoked the most vigorous protest.    It is a delicate matter. Why indeed destroy something that  is at least functioning, feeding, and providing a service. And  actually doing not badly, by Russian standards. At any rate, in  the Kuban agriculture is better developed than anywhere else in  the Federation. And it is actually based on the kolkhozes, not  on anything else -- for history deemed it so.    On the other hand, the local agrarian leaders are  equivocating, claiming that the communal form of land use is a  traditional one in the Kuban and cannot be revised. In the  first place, it is not traditional, the Kuban has run the entire  gamut in the past. Second, for decades no one has attempted to  operate in any other way than as a kolkhoz.    Anyway, the latest news is that the president has been  persuaded to leave the Kuban and its kolkhozes alone for the  moment.</p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: Irish Life lifts premium income by 9% to IPounds 340m IRISH LIFE, the largest funds manager in the life and pensions market in Ireland, reported a 9 per cent upturn in premium income to IPounds 340.2m (Pounds 318.8m) for the six months to June 30 1993. Investment income improved 32 per cent to IPounds 154.6m (Pounds 144.8m). The main growth in business occurred in the US through the Interstate subsidiary, where premium income almost doubled from IPounds 32.5m to IPounds 62.3m. Mr David Kingston, group managing director, said new recurring premium business in the core Irish market had declined slightly 'because of the taxation situation in Ireland, which benefits short-term savings at the expense of long-term investments and a general lack of buoyancy in the savings market'. He said a marked capital appreciation of IPounds 446.8m on linked investments was a result of strong advances in equity prices since devaluation of the punt last January, while the sharp drop in interest rates which had paralleled this development had improved the perspectives for new single premium business. The cashing-in of single premium policies was a significant source of the downturn in premium income in the full year accounts to the end of 1992, and according to Mr Kingston, continued to be 'a major problem in January' prior to the devaluation. Claims and the cashing-in of policies, which have grown sharply from IPounds 305m to IPounds 425m in the first half this year, 'are now running back at historic levels', he said. Group total assets have increased by IPounds 713m to IPounds 4.95bn since the end of 1992. No embedded value figure was given with the interim results.</p>

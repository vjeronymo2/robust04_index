			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Economics Notebook: Reformers run the gauntlet of politics Mr Manmohan Singh and Mr Sartaj Aziz, the finance ministers of India and Pakistan respectively, are both bold reformers. They are attempting to steer their countries away from socialist-inspired bureaucracy and to shift the impetus for growth to the private sector. They are eloquent and sincere technocrats rather than career politicians. But their reform policies at present enjoy a political consensus. Each has the enthusiastic backing of his prime minister, and the grudging acquiescence of opposition parties. Their tasks are huge, and the achievements already significant. Since elections in October 1990, Pakistan has abolished licensing (bureaucratic sanction for corporate investment); undertaken rapid privatisation of industry and banks; removed virtually all restrictions on currency movements and foreign investment; deregulated interest rates; started to dismantle trade barriers; and begun big improvements in physical and social infrastructure. Since India's elections in June 1991, the government has abolished licensing; cut the fiscal deficit; removed most restrictions on foreign investment; made the rupee partially convertible; relaxed import curbs and begun to cut tariffs; reduced subsidies and deregulated interest rates; and started the restructuring of state industry, with tentative steps towards privatisation. Mr Aziz and Mr Singh are trying to maintain a momentum which will prevent a variety of special interests - bureaucrats, industrialists protected by tariff barriers, labour unions - from regaining the initiative and tilting back towards the cosy excesses of public sector domination. Yet the international response to their programmes has generally been to applaud the intent, but to await further evidence of the practice. Some multinationals, already familiar with the region, are interested in expanding capacity with a view to export. However, many companies simply see big domestic markets which they would like to supply if the profit prospects are good. Investors who want more than just a quick turn on the stock exchange have to look at the overall environment, and not simply the sudden absence of barriers to their presence. And in spite of the political honeymoon, the fact is that politics is never far away. In India's democratic cauldron, the Rs35bn (Dollars 1.27bn) stock market scandal has become embroiled in politics, with a joint parliamentary committee raking over complex transactions already investigated by at least two other bodies. Mr Singh has spent months dealing with the scandal. But, asked whether the speed of reform has started to slip, he says 'there is not much of substance in what is being said on this subject'. The pace, he insists, is exactly in line with the programme of reform first set out last year. Nevertheless, key elements of reform - privatisation, reduction of fertiliser subsidies, restructuring or closure of loss-making state industries - are very tricky to push through politically. Old assumptions in all areas of society about the role of the state have to be delicately addressed, and a consensus for change sought. The politicisation of the scandal has exposed intense suspicion of links between the private and public sector. If senior officials are found to have spoken on the telephone with private sector businessmen, the almost automatic assumption is that corruption is involved. Foreign ventures of Indian businessmen are treated in the press as though they were suspect. Clearly, this ingrained attitude is a hangover from the days when the 'license raj' meant that the private sector did depend on the favour of the bureaucrats, with the possibility of corruption. The economy's isolation and protection meant that foreign links and foreign assets probably involved circumvention of restrictions and 'black money'. The restrictions may have been swept away, but the mindset instilled by decades of bureaucracy and public sector domination takes longer to kick. In Pakistan, Mr Aziz and the prime minister, Mr Nawaz Sharif, are frustrated that they have not seen more foreign investment when they have created, as they see it, an environment among the most liberal in Asia. They have sought the advice of several public relations consultants on how to trumpet their message abroad. Again, the political background is important. Pakistan's tortured political history leaves outside observers unsure of the relative influence of the elected government, the army and the president - the so-called 'troika'. They are also uncertain of the future role of Islamic practices in the financial system. The taxation structure is a mess, and it is not clear that the political will exists to tackle it. The bureaucracy is still ponderous and interfering. What both finance ministers need is faster economic growth and exports to bolster the domestic political argument at the same time as lower fiscal deficits to satisfy international lending institutions. This is a tall order, especially when export markets are depressed. How galling it must be for these democracies to see export-oriented foreign investment pouring into China, which has been engaging in similar economic reforms while firmly keeping the lid on political expression. It is true that other considerations apply. The Chinese labour force may be thought to be cheaper and more productive. Much of the investment in China is from overseas Chinese in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Investors are betting the Chinese communist party is not going to collapse like its Soviet counterpart, so they feel they can expect stability even if they are uncomfortable with the politics. Also, China's reforms have not come overnight: they have been underway for 13 years, and they still have a long way to go. This means that the sub-continent's reformers have to be patient and stay the course, provided that they can maintain the political advantage. Meanwhile they deserve all the help they can get from the outside world.</p>

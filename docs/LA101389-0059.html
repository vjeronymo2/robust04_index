			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TALKS ON LEBANON PACT STALLED AS CHRISTIAN CHIEF STORMS OUT  </P> <P> Talks on a tentative accord for shifting power to Lebanon's Muslim majority  temporarily collapsed Thursday when a right-wing Christian leader stormed out,  refusing to accept any plan that did not provide for Syria's withdrawal from  Lebanon.  </P> <P> The acrimonious, closed-door bargaining session, which followed an exhausting,  round-the-clock series of meetings the night before, reflected Lebanese  lawmakers' increasing frustration over their failure to reach agreement on a  permanent peace plan after nearly two weeks of negotiations.  </P> <P> Only hours before dawn Thursday, a special negotiating committee of  parliamentary deputies reported that they had reached tentative accord on a  political reform plan that would for the first time give Muslims an equal voice  in Parliament and limit the powers of the Maronite Christian president.  </P> <P> But talks on putting the tentative agreement into writing broke down after five  hours Thursday night when Georges Saade, head of the Lebanese Front and the  leading right-wing Christian in Parliament, walked out of the session in  response to new "conditions" proposed by Muslims.  </P> <P> The conditions reportedly included a new effort to wipe out the religious basis  upon which Lebanon's government has historically been built.  </P> <P> Saade, in a brief statement to reporters, did not identify the conditions that  led to the breakdown in the talks. But he said they reached "basic and  essential issues which cannot be accepted in any form whatsoever."  </P> <P> Other sources close to the negotiations said the Christians' objections arose  when a Muslim deputy proposed to include in the agreement a plan to abolish  religious sectarianism as the basis for political power in the Lebanese  government. The tentative accord would have left that controversial issue to  the new government.  </P> <P> Earlier, Saade also had vowed not to accept any political reform plan unless  Parliament first settles on an acceptable timetable for withdrawal of the  estimated 40,000 Syrian troops that now occupy about two-thirds of Lebanon.  </P> <P> After a marathon bargaining session, the committee of nine Christians and eight  Muslims had reached a tentative accord on a wide-ranging plan for sharing power  within Parliament and the Cabinet and boost the number of Muslim seats.  </P> <P> It would leave the Christian president as formal chief of the armed forces but  would transfer to the Cabinet and the Sunni Muslim prime minister most actual  authority over the army.  </P></p>

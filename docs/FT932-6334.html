			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: Hitachi and Toshiba suffer steep falls in earnings for year TWO of Japan's large, comprehensive electronics groups yesterday reported steep falls in profits for the year to end-March as they faced persistent weakness in the domestic market, falling prices and a higher yen. Hitachi and Toshiba both revealed a sharp deterioration in their business performance for the third year running as Japanese corporate and consumer spending remained sluggish throughout the year. Hitachi unveiled a 40 per cent fall in parent pre-tax profits to Y78.1bn (Dollars 719m) from a previous Y130.8bn as it was hit by fierce price competition in the computer market and depressed demand for its consumer electronic products. Non-consolidated sales fell 3 per cent to Y3,811bn while consolidated sales also dropped 3 per cent to Y7,536bn. Group pre-tax profits slid 37 per cent to Y234.7bn. Hitachi, one of Japan's leading mainframe computer manufacturers, was also affected by the downturn in mainframe demand, particularly in overseas markets. Consumer products suffered from a lack of demand, particularly for audio-visual products and air conditioners, and sales fell 20 per cent. On the bright side, the fall in Hitachi's electronics operations was countered by strength in its power systems division, which reported an 18 per cent rise on the back of strong demand from electric power companies. Toshiba suffered a 22 fall in non-consolidated pre-tax profits to Y54.8bn. Firm demand from overseas for information and communications equipment and electronic devices was offset by a depressed Japanese market. In the personal computer market, Toshiba reported strong demand from overseas and PC exports rose 15 per cent. However, this was offset by a 15 per cent fall on the domestic market which went through a period of turmoil following the launch of low-priced PCs by US groups. Consumer products fell 13 per cent largely as a result of a 35 per cent drop in sales of air conditioners which were affected by Japan's cool summer. Buoyant demand was seen in heavy electricals where sales increased 11 per cent, largely on demand from electric power companies and from a railway company. Toshiba was optimistic about the outlook for the current year. The expected gradual recovery of the Japanese economy this year, helped by the government's economic stimulus package, and the growth in PC and semiconductor demand, supported its forecast of a 5 per cent increase in parent sales to Y3,300bn. It expects flat pre-tax profits but a 26 per cent rise in net profits to Y32bn.</p>

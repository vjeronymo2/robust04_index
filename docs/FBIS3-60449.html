			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] During November, the cases of meningococcal  meningitis in Rio exceeded the maximum limit anticipated.  According to the Municipal Health Secretariat, 48 cases were  reported, representing 37 percent more than the 35 cases of the  disease expected for the month. The number of fatalities during  November rose to 12 with the death, on the night before last, of  the child J., aged one year, who was confined in the Salgado  Filho Hospital. According to the Secretariat, the baby's parents  live in the shantytown of Jacarezinho.    Despite the spread of the meningococcal disease in Rio, the  Secretariat denies the existence of an epidemic, because he does  not believe that there has been a significant change in the  number of reports of the disease compared with previous years.  Most of the cases of meningococcal meningitis in Rio have been  caused by the Type B meningococcus, characterized by a slow  spread. It is unlike types A and C, which are capable of causing  very intense epidemics within a short period of time.    Compared with last year's reports, however, the figures on  the meningococcal disease in Rio indicate an abnormal rise in at  least five months: February (increase of 50 percent); March (105  percent); April (43 percent); September (56 percent); and  November (37 percent). Nevertheless, during August and October  the number of cases was nearly 30 percent lower than that  recorded for those months in 1992. The total number of cases  reported to date has already exceeded that of last year's cases:  392 by November, compared with 328 last year.    For this reason, the Municipal Health Secretariat requested  of the Health Ministry authorization to administer the vaccine  against type B meningococcal meninigitis in Rio. The  effectiveness of that vaccine is a controversial topic among the  experts.  <H5>  Deaths From January to November Total 142 </H5>   The State Health Secretariat's data indicate that by  November, in the state as a whole, the meningococcal meninigitis  cases exceeded the total reported in 1992. To date, the  Secretariat has recorded 725 cases of the disease, compared with  702 last year. This represents an approximate increase of 3  percent, not counting the figure for the month of December. The  disease, which killed 153 persons in 1992, caused 142 fatalities  among its victims by November of this year.    When added to those of other types of meningitis (such as  the  ones caused by Haemophilus influenzae, pneumococcus, and  viruses), the total cases this year number 2,209, versus 2,422  last year. Yesterday, in Rio, the Municipal Health Secretariat  recorded another case of type A meningococcal disease. The  victim, L., aged 11 months, lives in Jacarepagua, and is  confined in a private clinic.</p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RAY'S HIT BEATS JAYS IN 11, 4-3  </P> <P> Johnny Ray's one-out double in the 11th inning Thursday scored Gary Disarcina  with the winning run as the Angels rebounded from a disappointing ninth inning  to edge the Toronto Blue Jays, 4-3.  </P> <P> Disarcina led off the 11th against Tom Henke (0-1) with a walk and moved to  second on Devon White's sacrifice bunt. Ray's second hit in six at-bats drove  in Disarcina with the run that gave the Angels a season-best four-game winning  streak and their sixth victory in their past seven games.  </P> <P> Bryan Harvey (2-1) was credited with the victory after blowing a save  opportunity in the ninth. He entered the game with a 3-1 lead, as Angel Manager  Doug Rader used Mark Eichhorn as a setup man for Harvey instead of as a closer.  Rader has often said he wanted to get Harvey into more save situations, but  Harvey squandered the chance he was given Thursday, yielding a single to Mookie  Wilson, a double to Kelly Gruber and a sacrifice fly before throwing a wild  pitch that tied the game on what was supposed to be an intentional walk to Fred  McGriff.  </P> <P> "I just tried to lob it in right to him," Harvey said. "I didn't have my  mind-set right and I threw it too easy.  </P> <P> "I'm happy we won, but I would have been happier if we won it in the ninth."  </P> <P> Wally Joyner had another big game, going three for four to raise his average to  .318.  </P> <P> Although starting pitcher Kirk McCaskill was unable to get out of the fourth  inning, a succession of relievers stifled Toronto's offense until Harvey came  on.  </P> <P> McCaskill, making his first start since May 10, left with the Blue Jays holding  a 1-0 lead, built in the third on a walk, an error and a single by McGriff. The  Angels overcame that deficit in the fourth on Joyner's single and Dante  Bichette's forceout and added a run in the fifth on an infield single, a walk  and Joyner's second single of the evening.  </P> <P> California used three pitchers in the sixth alone: Mike Fetters began the  inning, but was relieved by Scott Bailes after walking Manny Lee and allowing a  double to Junior Felix. Bailes walked Tony Fernandez and got Mookie Wilson to  pop up to short before being relieved, in turn, by Mark Eichhorn. The  side-armer threw only one pitch, but the Angels' infield turned it into a  double play that ended the inning.  </P> <P> As has become normal for him this season, McCaskill constantly worked with  runners on base. He escaped a first-and-third situation in the first and a  first-and-second jam in the second -- getting out of the latter trouble when  left fielder Bichette leaped against the fence in left-center to rob Tony  Fernandez of a home run.  </P> <P> McCaskill, who had issued 18 walks in his previous 35 1/3 innings, put himself  in trouble in the third when he walked Wilson leading off the inning. He got  Kelly Gruber on a fly to right, but third baseman Rick Schu couldn't handle  Bell's shot to third. Wilson went to second on the error and scored on  McGriff's looping single to right-center.  </P> <P> An error and another walk in the fourth brought an end to McCaskill's outing.  Fetters came in and defused the Blue Jays' threat.  </P> <P> Joyner's hot hitting helped the Angels come back and take a 2-1 lead in the  bottom of the inning.  </P> <P> Davis began the inning with a walk and moved to second on Dave Winfield's  single to center. Davis scored on Joyner's sharply hit single and Winfield went  to third. Bichette's force play scored Winfield.  </P> <P> Another RBI single by Joyner padded the Angels' lead to 3-1 in the fifth off  John Cerutti. Davis reached on an infield single and Winfield walked. Davis was  caught stealing third, but prolonged the rundown enough for Winfield to take  second, and Winfield scored on Joyner's soft single to right-center.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> Infielder Rick Schu was recalled from triple-A Edmonton to replace injured Jack  Howell, and started at third base Thursday. Howell was placed on the 15-day  disabled list Wednesday because of a sprained left knee. Schu, who was optioned  to Edmonton on May 19 when pitcher Mike Fetters was recalled, hit .286 in three  games with the Trappers with one home run and three RBIs. . . . Gary Disarcina  singled in the sixth for his first major league hit in 10 at-bats. The crowd of  24,460 rewarded him with a round of applause.  </P> <P> Infielder Mark McLemore (sprained right wrist) was assigned to Edmonton for  rehabilitation. Catcher Bill Schroeder (post-surgical elbow problems) was sent  to Class-A Palm Springs, also for rehabilitation. . . . Shortstop Dick  Schofield said his strained hamstring "feels real good," but wouldn't put a  timetable on his return.  </P></p>

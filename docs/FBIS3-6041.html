The officials said the decision was made in a revision of  the  Securities and Exchange Law, which was made public in the  official gazette.    They said the new law makes it mandatory for companies  listed  on the market to disclose information related to forward  exchange contracts.    It will mean revealing the outstanding amount of contracts  and their value in yen terms at the time the contracts were  signed and at the end of their business terms.    The officials said the decision was in line with  recommendations made last June by an advisory panel for the  finance and trade ministers.    Investors have raised demands for the disclosure of such  information since last year after Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K.  suffered a loss of more than 100 billion yen in forward exchange  contracts.</p>

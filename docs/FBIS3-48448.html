Referring in detail to the  basic contents of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New  Year's address, he pointed out: Last year, our people won a  brilliant victory in socialist construction and demonstrated the  might of chuche Korea to the world despite the harsh trials the  imperialists and reactionaries viciously subjected them to  through their anti-Republic maneuvers. This was a result of the  outstanding and tested leadership of the great leader Comrade  Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. This  year, too, our party and people will unite as one around the  great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il and thoroughly implement an independent, self-reliant,  and self-defensive revolutionary line. As a result, they will  further strengthen the political, economic, and military might  of the country and positively struggle to achieve national  reunification through a way of a confederal system based on one  nation, one state, two systems, and two governments.    Pointing out that our party and the Government of the  Republic will consistently carry out an independent, peaceful,  and goodwill foreign policy in the future, too, he continued:  Today our people's struggle is arduous, but the Korean people,  who are struggling for the just cause under the wise leadership  of the great leader [suryong] and the great leader [chidoja],  are ever victorious. The maneuvers of the imperialists and the  reactionaries, who want to isolate and crush [apsal] the DPRK  under the pretext of the non- existent nuclear development, will  not avoid their own destruction.    Participants in the meeting congratulated our people on  their  brilliant achievements made in socialist construction last year  and sincerely wished them a greater success in their future  works under the wise leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.</p>

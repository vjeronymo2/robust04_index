			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RERUNS TO REWATCH: THE GOAT THAT ALMOST ATE MAYBERRY  </P> <P> Sleepy Mayberry wakes up for a while when an ornery billy goat swallows some  dynamite in "The Loaded Goat" on The Andy Griffith Show (Friday at 3:35 p.m. on  TBS).  </P> <P> Usually the town's biggest danger is Barney Fife, but this time Jimmy the goat  even has Barney beat.  </P> <P> Jimmy, who had insisted on coming to town to see the sights, gets loose and  snacks on some explosives meant for highway work. ("First time he comes uptown  he figures he's got to do everything," complains Jimmy's owner, Cy Hudgins).  </P> <P> Barney and Andy put Jimmy in a sort of padded cell to keep him safe, but the  goat's run-in with a drunken Otis- who doesn't like his new roommate- threatens  to blow their plans sky-high. (Warns Andy: "About one loaded goat at a time is  all we can handle.")  </P> <P> In the end, thanks to Andy's brains and Barney's French harp playing, the goat  winds up in one piece- and so does Mayberry.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DRIVER WHO 'JUST WANTED TO GET HOME' KEEPS GOING IN BURNING, WRECKED CAR  </P> <P> The engine was on fire, the windshield was smashed in, two of the tires were  flat, the roof was partially caved in and the right front side was ripped open.  But Goorgen Hukassians of Saugus managed to drive his car about a mile in a  vain attempt to get home after an accident Monday morning.  </P> <P> "I've never seen anything like it," said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy  Steve Grossman of the Santa Clarita Valley Substation. Grossman arrested  Hukassians at the scene on suspicion of hit-and-run driving, drunk driving and  damage to city property.  </P> <P> "It's incredible a car in that condition was able to move a foot, let alone as  far as he got," the deputy said.  </P> <P> Grossman said that Hukassians, 22, who was able to walk away from the wrecked  car, lost control of the Pontiac Fiero soon after he left the Golden State  Freeway at the Valencia Boulevard exit.  </P> <P> "For unknown reasons, he flips over once or twice -- he said he couldn't  remember how many times," Grossman said, "and knocks over a fire hydrant near  Rockwell Canyon Road in front of the College of the Canyons."  </P> <P> But Hukassians managed to keep driving the car up Valencia Boulevard until it  finally died near Bouquet Canyon Road, Grossman said.  </P> <P> A security guard working near the area reported a car on fire to the sheriff's  office. When Grossman was on his way to the scene, he said, he heard a report  on his police radio that the fire hydrant had been knocked over and was spewing  water.  </P> <P> "I figured they were related, and the man who was driving the car did not deny  hitting the fire hydrant," Grossman said. "But when I asked him why he had  tried to drive away from the scene, he said, 'I was just trying to get home. I  just wanted to get home.' "  </P></p>

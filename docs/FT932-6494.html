			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Israel sells shares in Bank Hapoalim THE Israeli government yesterday sold off 16.5 per cent of its shares in Bank Hapoalim, the country's largest bank, raising an immediate Shk360m, our Jerusalem correspondent writes. The sale, which was 120 times over subsribed, is expected to yield a total of Shk783m (Pounds 187m) once various share options are realised over the coming year. Yesterday's sale marked the first time that shares in Hapoalim have been traded on the Israeli stock exchange for almost a decade. Shares in the big Israeli banks collapsed in October 1983 after years in which they inflated their own share prices, leaving the Israeli government with little option but to bail out the sector by taking a controlling interest in the banks. Until yesterday, the government owned 97 per cent of Hapoalim and the sell-off represents only the first small step on the government's long road to divesting itself of all the shares in the major banks it stepped in to buy 10 years ago.</p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLAG PLEDGE SNUB BY 3 ON RENT BOARD SPARKS FUROR  </P> <P> The American flag, often the center of controversy in national and foreign  issues, has been unfurled in the contentious relationship between the Santa  Monica Rent Control Board and area landlords.  </P> <P> Last week, three of the five elected board members, whose political  pronouncements often go beyond rental and housing issues, announced that they  would refrain from pledging allegiance to the flag at the beginning of board  meetings in protest of U.S. involvement in El Salvador. The three had said that  they would instead observe a moment of silence.  </P> <P> At Thursday night's board meeting at City Hall, more than 100 landlords and war  veterans protested by reciting the Pledge of Allegiance twice, singing "God  Bless America," and calling for the resignation of the three board members.  </P> <P> "We had a nice party," said Carl Lambert, president of Action, the largest  landlords' group in Santa Monica, and an organizer of the demonstration. Action  members at a meeting Monday informally decided to demonstrate at Thursday's  meeting and then contacted other landlords and veterans groups.  </P> <P> "It was definitely an interesting meeting," said Wayne Bauer, one of the  protesting board members.  </P> <P> A flyer distributed before the meeting said: "Either these publicly elected  officials should, here and now, recite our country's Pledge of Allegiance . . .  or they should resign. Either these elected Santa Monica officials should  support America's constitutional rights, America's free enterprise system and  ideals, and America's national symbol or they should resign from public office  forever."  </P> <P> Lambert called the board members' refusal to salute the flag "indicative of the  fact that they continue to have no respect for the Constitution or justice or  fairness. They do whatever they want."  </P> <P> Protesters waved small flags and carried candles outside the meeting room,  before marching into the session. Lambert said similar demonstrations will be  held at every board meeting until the board members resume recognizing the  flag.  </P> <P> "My feeling is that the issue is not free speech or El Salvador," said landlord  James Baker. "The issue is elected officials conducting a publicly funded  meeting and holding the flag hostage to their political views. To refuse to  lead the pledge is irresponsible."  </P> <P> Board chairwoman Susan Packer Davis, one of the protesting three, said she had  no objection to anyone else reciting the Pledge of Allegiance at the meetings  and that being an elected official does not mean giving up rights to free  speech. She called the demonstration part of a tendency to focus on the flag  rather than on the polices and rights represented by the flag.  </P> <P> "They have a right to protest, but they can't enforce their wishes on me,"  Davis said. "This is not a board action, this is a personal action. It's not  like this is occupying all our time at board meetings.  </P> <P> "They see this as un-American because we don't support the same kind of free  enterprise rights as they do. But we're trying to preserve housing. They are  using the flag to once again attack rent control."  </P> <P> The flag is "just a piece of cloth without the rights attached it it," Bauer  said. "People should take the flag from in front of their eyes and look around  and see how taxpayers' money is being spent."  </P> <P> Julie Lopez Dad, the third board member choosing the silent protest, said the  decision for her was difficult.  </P> <P> "It has always been important to me to pledge the flag, but I am doing this . .  . because what is going on in El Salvador is so serious." Dad said. "But the  demonstration did not have as much to do with the flag as it did (with)  anti-rent control sentiment. The flag was misused and abused by those who used  it to pour out their vengeance and hate against rent control."  </P> <P> Board member Dolores Press said she agrees with her colleagues' opposition to  U.S. involvement in El Salvador but chooses not to use the board meetings as a  "forum for my anger." Press said she will continue to recite the Pledge of  Allegiance at board meetings.  </P> <P> However, she questioned whether the landlords' demonstration was really about  patriotism, but rather just another attack on rent control.  </P> <P> Board member Eileen Lipson could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Spain Spain and Italy tend to be lumped together from an investment point of view as high-yielding Mediterranean markets on Europe's periphery. For much of this year, this comparison has seemed unfair on Spain, a country which has its fair share of economic troubles and political instability, but not apparently on the same scale as Italy. However, in the past few weeks, the gravity of Spain's home-grown political problems has intensified amid mounting evidence of links between the current administration and illegal anti-terrorist activities. It is not surprising that the peseta has weakened against the D-Mark in the past few weeks and is now below its former floor under the European exchange rate mechanism. The gap between yields on Spanish bonds and German bunds has also widened, in common with the performance of Italian bonds. But more recently Spanish bonds have underperformed their Italian equivalents. This is likely to continue, especially if foreign investors' confidence in Italy revives appreciably. In Italy, political chaos is fully priced into the market - in Spain this is not yet the case. An added risk for bond investors comes from the inflation outlook; poor inflation figures for January could lead the Bank of Spain to increase short-term interest rates.</p>

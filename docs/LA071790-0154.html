			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY PROFILE: FOCUS;  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD IS HOME TO HISTORY  </P> <P> The two buildings with greatest historical significance in Anaheim were  transplanted to this neighborhood, like the city founders themselves.  </P> <P> Anaheim had its start when 50 German colonists living in San Francisco wanted  to move to Southern California to grow grapes and make wine. But planting  grapes wasn't their only reason: They thought San Francisco would be a bad  influence on their families.  </P> <P> The Gold Rush of 1848 had brought saloons, miners and brothels to San  Francisco. The colonists wanted to go to a new place and start afresh. So they  hired surveyor and civil engineer George Hansen to choose a site and lay out  the town where they would settle.  </P> <P> Hansen bought 1,165 acres at $2 an acre in the area that would become Anaheim.  He divided the land into 20-acre lots for the vineyards, with the central 20  reserved for 64 house lots.  </P> <P> Hansen's home and office from 1857 to 1863 is a modest wood-frame building, the  first of its kind to be built in Orange County (adobe being the prevailing  building material). Its original site was 235 N. Los Angeles St. (now Anaheim  Boulevard) between Cypress and Chartres streets.  </P> <P> When E.E. Beazley purchased the land in the late 1920s, he thought the location  would be ideal for a service station. But when he made his intentions known to  tear down the house, residents protested. Beazley donated the house to the city  of Anaheim.  </P> <P> Marie Horstmann Dwyer, a member of Mother Colony chapter of the Daughters of  the American Revolution, offered the land on West Street where her father, F.A.  Horstmann, had grown his crops. She deeded the property to the Mother Colony  chapter of the DAR in 1929 and the house was moved to its present location, 410  West St.  </P> <P> Today, this five-room wooden house with redwood floors and a latticed porch is  called the Pioneer House of the Mother Colony. (Germany was the motherland of  most of Anaheim's original settlers.) It was the county's first museum and is  today a California historical landmark.  </P> <P> Within its walls is the towel of "A.H.," Amalie Hammer, the first bride of  Anaheim; an upright piano, surviving a flood in 1884 and landing on a river  bank while the house was washed away, was donated by Anna Fischer De Frees, the  first child born to a colonist's family.  </P> <P> The contiguous site on West Street offers respite for yet another house. The  building known today as the American Red Cross-Anaheim House was originally  located at Center and Palm Streets (today Lincoln Avenue and Harbor Boulevard),  an area slotted for redevelopment. This grand two-story house, embellished with  stained-glass windows and a turret crowned by a cupola, was built by John  Woelke in 1894 as his residence.  </P> <P> But the DAR was able to save the house when Mr. and Mrs. Dwyer (Lera, the  second Mrs. Dwyer) bought the house in 1950 for $5,000 and had it moved next  door to the Mother Colony House. The house was subsequently donated to the Red  Cross in 1953. (The Anaheim Red Cross is itself historically significant:  founded in 1917, it was Orange County's second chapter; Fullerton was first by  a couple of months.)  </P> <P> As the site for these two buildings would suggest, much of the land here  remained working farms until the turn of the century. Behind these ancient  houses lie the playing fields of the Anaheim High School.  </P> <P> The houses in the neighborhood today are predominantly single-family homes,  grand in their demeanor and some of the oldest in Anaheim. North of Lincoln  Avenue the lot sizes are large. In the westernmost part of this area the trees  are likely to be the oldest residents.  </P> <P> South of Lincoln Avenue, lot sizes are substantially smaller and houses of  varying ages are in closer proximity, as Anaheim's downtown area must have  looked at its inception. But at the neighborhood's southern border, Santa Ana  Street has met the fate of many of the neighborhood's older houses: it is torn  apart -- fortunately, though, for repair.  </P> <P> An Orange County Historical Commission marker, set on a pedestal at the  westerly end of Center Street, commemorates the San Pedro Gate, which stood at  the corner of West and Center streets. In earlier times a fence of living  willow trees kept livestock outside the city limits, and this gate was opened  to permit travel to and from San Pedro and Los Angeles.  </P> <P> But this gate is also a reminder of Anaheim's birth: It was through this gate  that barrels of wine were hauled to the Anaheim Landing for shipment.

"We have to learn to take care of the state -- and even to  love it a little -- because if we lose track of society's  progress as a whole, business will suffer too," said Professor  Prodi, an economist who teaches at Bologna when not busy with  public sector affairs, in a talk entitled "State and Market in a  Changing Italy," held at the University of Bologna main lecture  hall.    "The modern state was born of the conviction there was a  leading role to play in assuring citizens certain essential  functions," said Prodi. "I would never attempt to dismantle  that conception of the state because it would be like destroying  our roots, it would encourage disintegration and we would be  committing those errors that today, we see the United States  trying to remedy," he said.    "For years the international business community scoffed at  us, they were convinced Italy would never carry out  privatizations," said Prodi, who has just finished supervising  the successful transfer to public company of one of Italy's  largest commercial banks, Comit [Italian Commercial Bank],  following quickly on the sale of Credito Italiano and IMI  [Italian Institute for Financing Personal and Real Property].    But privatization is a process that "cannot be interrupted,  even after the elections, because people are lining up to buy  the shares and the politicians can see that," he said.  Privatization helps to restructure public finance "but above  all it creates economic pluralism and thus supports political  democracy," he continued, but "we have to make these companies  grow, not create conglomerates with them."    "If in the place of a public sector monopoly we go on to  create a private sector monopoly, then I must say I preferred  the public sector one," he added.    In a lecture one listener said it sounded like "a speech by  an aspiring prime minister," ("if that's what one is aiming, one  is generally more cautious," shot back Prodi) the IRI chairman  underlined that the long and sometimes torturous process of  privatizing Italy's public sector industries and services did  not imply the state would not continue to play a "fundamental"  role in Italian affairs.    Italy needs a public sector "with a light structure, but  that  remains responsive," because it is "unthinkable that the state  be absent from its role in the life of the country," he said.    While reducing tax pressure is a goal, said Prodi, it is not  something than can happen in several months or several years.  "The goal is not to avoid taxes, but to have an intelligent,  light state," he said.    Prodi also commented on the Italian television market,  recalling an old professor of his and his lessons on anti-trust  rules.    "He used to say that the mass media was a chapter all by  itself, and that the law had to be more stringent in relation to  it. First, it was important to fix market quotas to make sure  they weren't excessive, secondly, to pay particular attention to  the interface between media ownership and general economic power  overall," Prodi said.</p>

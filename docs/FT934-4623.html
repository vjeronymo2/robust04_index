			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Donors' generosity overwhelms Uganda When the World Bank and other donors abruptly cancelled their support for Uganda's National Aids Secretariat, the shock waves went through the entire edifice of donor-funded projects that prop up Uganda's economy. The secretariat had appealed in November for Dollars 450m to fund a 'multisectoral' plan to combat the disease. It proved to be the last straw for donors already exasperated by the failings of the secretariat. 'We are interested in fighting Aids, not funding an Aids bureaucracy,' one of the donors present at the meeting explained. The secretariat's staff had not been up to the job, causing donors to question whether they had been too ambitious for one of their model pupils in Africa. Uganda has been smothered with aid since President Yoweri Museveni's government adopted a World Bank-approved programme of economic reforms six years ago. The international community, delighted with Mr Museveni's enlightened, if unelected, leadership, pledged more than Dollars 825m in aid this year, an amount equivalent to a quarter of Uganda's gross domestic product. Foreign aid finances 60 per cent of government spending. Even the luggage trolleys at Entebbe airport say 'donated by the UN Development Programme'. Aid has financed every development project since the end of the civil war in 1986. Most of it has gone on rebuilding roads, dams, electricity and telephone systems destroyed during the war. Donors are also involved in rebuilding civil society: providing judges to train new magistrates, inspectors for the police force, and cash for the demobilisation of soldiers. But their generosity has begun to outstrip Uganda's ability to absorb the aid. The World Bank estimates it has a backlog of projects worth Dollars 750m awaiting implementation. In some cases the government has been unable to contribute the 10 per cent counterpart funding for projects demanded by the World Bank. In others, the underpaid bureaucracy has been slow to get projects off the ground. 'I think we have reached the point where we have to take a hard look at the amount of aid Uganda is getting,' says Mr Chukwuma Obidegwu, the resident World Bank economist in Kampala. 'My main concern is that it discourages Ugandans from developing the exports that would reduce their dependence on aid.' The inflow of dollars has led to an appreciation of the Ugandan shilling, which is now overvalued. This has undermined donor-funded efforts at export promotion and diversification. As the trade deficit widens, Uganda has become more dependent on donors for balance of payments support. Aid money is also feeding an industry of consultants. Virtually every government ministry has a clutch of expatriate 'advisers'. Their standard pay is Dollars 10,000 a month, or about 100 times the salary of a senior Ugandan civil servant. One official said he knew of an international firm of chartered accountants who charged Dollars 200,000 for a report on accounting information systems for the public sector. 'It was copied straight out of a first-year accountancy text book,' he said. Its recommendations were not implemented. Although most aid is being put to good use - building roads, repairing hydroelectric dams, providing essential drugs - its abundance is breeding corruption. Diplomats in Kampala speak openly and disparagingly about government ministers who are on the take.</p>

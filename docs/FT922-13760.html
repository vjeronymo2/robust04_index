			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Money Markets: Rates still soft FRISKY trading at the short end of the UK money markets sent the June sterling contract higher in the last day before the general election. 'It has been a whippy day,' said one dealer. 'Short sterling has been up and down and all over the place.' The June contract touched a high of 89.17 from an opening of 88.93 in very high volume of trading. During the mid-morning, rumours of an opinion poll putting the Conservatives three points ahead of Labour excited the market. Since the pollsters, still crunching the findings of the poll, were unable to confirm the rumour the market had to wait until after the close for the final outcome. Nevertheless, the rumour permeated dealing rooms, creating a grain of optimism. Rates, helped by large amounts of money 'sloshing around' the short end, held their earlier improvement. The three-month sterling interbank rate opened  1/8 point down at 10 7/8 -10 3/4 per cent after touching a high of 11 1/2 per cent last week. It eased further to close at 10 13/16 -10 per cent. One year rates also eased to 11-10 7/8 per cent from Tuesday's close of 11 3/16 -11 1/16 . The market is still expecting base rates - currently at 10.5 per cent - to rise by at least half a percentage point after the election. There seems little doubt that the foreign exchange market will test a Labour chancellor's commitment to keeping sterling at its current value within the European exchange rate mechanism, but opinion is divided as to whether rates will have to rise. Some dealers believe central bank intervention will be suff-icient to shore up sterling without the need for a base rate rise. The Bank of England continued to pursue its aim of keeping the market calm during the last few days of political uncertainty. The Bank's initial forecast of liquidity shortage was Pounds 550m, later revised to Pounds 700m. It operated in the morning, buying Pounds 650m of band-1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. The shortage was further revised in the afternoon, this time to Pounds 800m, and the Bank bought a further Pounds 25m of band-1 bank bills at the same rate. Although the market was apparently left some Pounds 125m under-relieved, dealers said there was no tightness in the closing stages. Overnight rates finished at 8 7/8 -8 3/4 per cent.</p>

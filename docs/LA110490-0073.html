			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OAK TREE;  </P> <P> UPSETS THE RULE IN CALIFORNIA CUP  </P> <P> If nothing else, the first California Cup was a longshot player's delight.  </P> <P> Upsets were the rule during the $1 million, seven-race series spotlighting  California-breds.  </P> <P> Theresa's Pleasure, who went wire to wire in the Juvenile Fillies, the final  race, was the lone favorite to reach the winner' circle. The biggest surprises  came from Great Event, who won the Starter Handicap at 19-1, and Gum, who won  the Mile at 16-1.  </P> <P> Trainer Bill Spawr had to settle for second with heavily favored Sensational  Star in the Sprint, but his disappointment didn't last long.  </P> <P> A few hours later, My Sonny Boy, a horse Spawr claimed for $62,500 June 16, led  every step of the way and won the richest Cal Cup race, the $300,000 Classic.  </P> <P> Riding to instructions, Jorge Velasquez, who replaced the absent Pat  Valenzuela, urged the 5-year-old out of the gate, was able to get over to the  rail from his outside (No. 14) position into the first turn, and kept right on  going to provide Spawr with his most lucrative victory.  </P> <P> My Sonny Boy completed the 1 1/8 miles in 1:46, one-fifth of a second off Star  Spangled's track record -- over a track that favored front-runners all  afternoon. My Sonny Boy finished 2 1/2 lengths ahead of 15-1 shot Stylish Stud,  who was later disqualified and placed third for coming out and bumping Rob An  Plunder, the original third-place finisher, in the final sixteenth.  </P> <P> Blinkers have obviously made a difference to My Sonny Boy. Since they were  added three races ago, he has two victories and a second and he had all kinds  of trouble in his defeat in the Pomona Invitational Handicap at Fairplex Park.  </P> <P> "This horse wants to be on the lead," said Spawr after another of his astute  claims paid off in a big way for owner Carlton Sell. "He has no punch. You have  to let him run out there, stride out and finish.  </P> <P> "I just told Jorge to put him on his toes and put him on the lead. He won at  Pomona (the C.B. Afflerbaugh) and I thought he was five lengths the best in the  Pomona Handicap, but he got into all kinds of trouble. I've been pointing him  for this since that race."  </P> <P> It was also a huge victory for Velasquez, who is giving California another try  after a long and successful career in the East.  </P> <P> "Mr. Spawr told me not to let this horse get stopped," he said. "He's a big  horse. He told me to get him away 1-2-3 to avoid losing ground. I didn't need  the whip to get him going, and when we got the lead, so much the better.  </P> <P> "He was going easy. It didn't seem like he was going that fast (22 1/5, 45,  1:09 and 1:33 3/5 for the mile). He finished strong, too. This is my biggest  win in California in some time."  </P> <P> Variety Road, who could have gone over $1 million in career earnings with a  victory, finished sixth as the lukewarm 3-1 favorite.  </P> <P> Gum, who had won only one of his previous nine starts on the turf, outfinished  another outsider, 7-1 shot Individualist, to win the $150,000 Mile.  </P> <P> It was an emotional victory for trainer Mel Stute. Gum is owned by The Hat  Ranch of Bay and the late Ken Schiffer, a longtime force in the California  thoroughbred industry who died earlier this year.  </P> <P> "Mrs. Schiffer wanted this one because her husband was so much a part of the  California Cup," Stute said. "We were very close. It meant a lot to me to win  on this day for him."  </P> <P> Crystal's Game made it five victories in six starts by beating troubled  stablemate Mizter Interco by three-quarters of a length in the $100,000  Juvenile. Treated with Lasix for the first time, the Crystal Water gelding  covered the 1 1/16 miles in 1:42 2/5 under Kent Desormeaux.  </P> <P> Theresa's Pleasure's final time in the Juvenile Fillies was the same as that of  Crystal's Game as she remained perfect in four starts. Owned and bred by  87-year-old Lester Smith, the daughter of Greenwood Star began her career in a  $32,000 maiden race at Los Alamitos last summer.  </P> <P> Valiant Pete, who was racing with Lasix for the first time, ran six furlongs in  1:08 1/5 to surprise 7-10 favorite Sensational Star by a half-length in the  $100,000 Sprint.  </P> <P> Ridden by Julio Garcia and trained by John Sadler, the 4-year-old gelded son of  The Irish Lord drew away after a :43 1/5 half-mile, had a 2 1/2-length lead  after completing five furlongs in :55 1/5, then held on.  </P> <P> Linda Card picked the right time to win her first race of 1990 in the $150,000  Distaff at 6 1/2 furlongs on the turf. Winless in 10 previous starts this year  and a loser in five earlier grass appearances, she and Gary Stevens defeated  favored Survive by 3 1/2 lengths in 1:12 3/5.  </P> <P> Great Event, who was claimed for $25,000 by trainer Robert St. Cyr on Aug. 11,  outbattled Comical to win the $50,000 Starter Handicap.  </P> <P> Petite Ile could clinch an Eclipse Award with a victory in the $400,000 Yellow  Ribbon Stakes today at Santa Anita.  </P> <P> The 4-year-old Ile de Bourbon filly hasn't been out since beating males in  Hollywood Park's Sunset due to a shin problem, but she has been training very  well for Ed Gregson. Before the Sunset, she also beat the boys in the Golden  Gate Handicap and has won three of her four U.S. starts. Corey Black again will  ride.  </P></p>

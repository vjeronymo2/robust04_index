			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOMESTIC ABUSE LAWS;  </P> <P> VICTIMS FIND LITTLE SAFETY IN SYSTEM  </P> <P> A Massachusetts woman asked a judge for protection from the abusive husband who  bragged, even to police, of his plans to kill her. "This court has a lot more  serious matters to contend with," she was told.  </P> <P> In the District of Columbia, a man broke into an apartment and held the mother  of his two children at gunpoint for hours. Prosecutors wrote the case off as a  routine child custody spat and did not press charges.  </P> <P> A woman in Colorado, terrorized for years by a former boyfriend, pleaded that  he be held in jail. But she had only a scratch to show from his latest attack,  and he got out with a $100 fine.  </P> <P> These three women are now dead.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Killing Every Six Hours  </P> <P> Pamela Nigro Dunn, Leedonyell Williams and Sharie Burge were murdered by the  enraged, obsessed men who had been their husbands or lovers. Such killings  occur somewhere in this country every six hours and account for almost  one-third of women murdered.  </P> <P> Rarely do they happen without warning. Almost always, the women leave their  stories in a police file somewhere -- one that chronicles an all too familiar  pattern of escalating violence, one that spells out every opportunity the legal  system had to step between the abuser and his victim.  </P> <P> The system's last chance to save Maria Navarro came a week ago, when she  telephoned the Los Angeles County sheriff's 911 emergency number and told a  dispatcher that her estranged husband was on his way over to kill her. The  dispatcher refused to send a patrol unit to her apartment and, half an hour  later, a gunman killed Navarro, her two aunts and a family friend. Authorities  later arrested Navarro's husband.  </P> <P> Questions immediately arose as to whether the department properly handled the  call. But the real issue, according to authorities and advocacy groups, is that  the system all too often fails the desperate women who turn to it for refuge.  </P> <P> "Maria Navarro did everything right, everything the system told her to do --  she had left the husband, she had a restraining order (that had expired), she  called police," said Sheila James Kuehl, managing attorney for the Southern  California Women's Law Center.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Very Serious State'  </P> <P> "What we must learn from this is that even the threat of domestic violence is a  very serious state," added Cheryl Ward, the senior assistant city attorney who  chairs the Los Angeles County Domestic Violence Council.  </P> <P> "When there is an opportunity for authorities to intervene, they must take that  opportunity," Ward added. "Unfortunately, when there is violence short of death  -- threats, pushing, shoving -- it seems to get trivialized."  </P> <P> One reason for this apparent disregard may be that frequency has inured society  to family violence. A University of New Hampshire study estimated that at least  two-thirds of the 56 million married and cohabiting couples in this country  have experienced at least one violent incident. California law enforcement  agencies received 182,540 domestic violence calls last year.  </P> <P> Women are usually at the receiving end in the worst cases -- the victims in 90%  of the assaults and two-thirds of the domestic murders recorded by the U.S.  Justice Department. The surgeon general in 1984 identified battering as this  nation's single largest cause of injury to women.  </P> <P> Not until the situation becomes almost unbearable will most women turn to the  police, said Murray Straus, a sociology professor who directs the University of  New Hampshire's Family Research Laboratory. "It takes an incredible amount of  abuse for a woman to take legal action."  </P> <P> When she does, her problems often multiply. Interviews with family counselors,  educators, prosecutors and various police officials, as well as research  conducted by universities and law enforcement agencies, reveal the following  points where the system is likely to break down:  </P> <P> * Despite a national trend toward arresting those who commit acts of domestic  violence, and evidence that arrest is the best deterrent, she may encounter  police who are reluctant to respond to her call or to treat an incident as the  crime that it is.  </P> <P> * As in any crime, if an abuser is arrested, he usually can be free in a matter  of hours in many jurisdictions, even if he has threatened in front of police to  kill his victim at first opportunity.  </P> <P> * Easily obtained court protective orders, effective in most cases, are  worthless against someone who is determined to hurt someone else.  </P> <P> * Prosecutors and judges, swamped by other types of criminal cases, may not  give family violence high priority.  </P> <P> * Those who do pursue these cases stand a good chance of losing the victim's  cooperation. A woman may be caught in an unhealthy dependence on her abuser,  frightened by his threats of reprisal, swayed by his promises to reform or  disillusioned by a confusing and intimidating court system.  </P> <P> Historically, courts have granted men wide latitude in settling disputes with  their spouses.  </P> <P> In English common law, a man was considered to have a right to "physically  chastise an errant wife." What passed for restraint was the notorious "rule of  thumb," which stated that the stick he beat her with could not exceed the width  of his thumb.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Treated Differently  </P> <P> Even after domestic assaults were made illegal in the United States, a century  ago, the system continued to treat them differently from other types of crime.  Official policy of almost every police department was to try to reconcile the  couple, to walk the abuser around the block until he cooled off, maybe  recommend some counseling.  </P> <P> When these cases ended up before a judge, it was usually in family court.  </P> <P> "In family court, the orientation is the preservation of the family," said Mary  Werner, an assistant district attorney in Suffolk County, N.Y. "Most of the  time the victim gets an order of protection. Period. End of story."  </P> <P> It is only recently that domestic violence has been treated as a crime.  </P> <P> The case often cited as the turning point began on June 10, 1983, when Tracey  Thurman telephoned the Torrington, Conn., police to complain that her husband  was harassing her in violation of the protective order that was supposed to  keep him away.  </P> <P> It took 25 minutes for an officer to arrive from a nearby station, and by the  time he did, Charles (Buck) Thurman had stabbed his wife in the face, neck and  back. As the officer called an ambulance, he watched Thurman continue to kick  her and grind his heavy work boot into her neck.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sued Police Department  </P> <P> In the first case of its kind, Tracey Thurman sued the Police Department in  federal court and collected $2 million for the partial paralysis and other  injuries she had suffered.  </P> <P> The decision put station houses throughout the nation on notice that they could  be held liable for their failures to stop domestic violence. Their insurance  companies began to demand that they retrain their officers, with greater  emphasis on intervention.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Police Department standards, considered among the nation's most  progressive, were rewritten as part of a 1985 settlement of a class-action suit  in which three women alleged that despite repeated assaults by their husbands,  they could not get police to arrest the men.  </P> <P> The women said police had argued that domestic violence was a civil, not  criminal matter, and that a jailed husband could lose his job and the family's  income.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Agreement Signed  </P> <P> The department's 7,000 officers signed an agreement to treat domestic violence  like other battery cases -- in other words, like a felony. It is then up to  prosecutors to determine whether a case should be pursed as a felony or a  misdemeanor or dropped.  </P> <P> In the last few years, more than half the big-city police departments  throughout the nation have established what are called a "pro-arrest policies."  Every state but West Virginia has also adopted statutes aimed at encouraging  arrest.  </P> <P> California's law, passed in 1985, requires that all sworn police officers  receive 8 1/2 hours of training on how to handle domestic violence complaints.  The dispatcher who answered Maria Navarro's call had been through such a  program.  </P> <P> Adding to the pressure for more arrests was an experiment conducted in  Minneapolis for the U.S. Justice Department in 1981 and 1982. Researchers  discovered that suspects who were arrested were only half as likely to repeat  the offense as those who were simply counseled or taken away from the scene.  Arrest appeared to be a strong deterrent, even though only a handful of people  who were hauled in ever spent as much as one night in jail.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Arrests Have Skyrocketed  </P> <P> "The lesson is the fact that wife-beating is against the law," said Richard  Berk, a UCLA sociology professor who co-wrote the study.  </P> <P> Law enforcement agencies nationwide say the number of domestic violence arrests  has skyrocketed as the result of new pro-arrest requirements. Los Angeles saw a  sevenfold rise in domestic violence arrests when it began its policy four years  ago.  </P> <P> Attitudes take longer to change.  </P> <P> Even in communities where there is an official pro-arrest stance, many say  police do not treat domestic violence with the same urgency accorded when the  assailant is a stranger.  </P> <P> "Definitely, the way to get a quick and effective police response is to tell  them, 'There's a man in my house with a knife.' If you say, 'It's my husband,'  you get an entirely different response, with a lower priority," said Joan  Meier, a Washington attorney who is on the legal committee of the D.C.  Coalition Against Domestic Violence.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'We're Swamped'  </P> <P> A torrent of domestic violence arrests is adding to the burden of overloaded  jails and courtrooms. "We're swamped," Suffolk County's Werner said. "We cannot  give the time and effort and the person power that we want to the prosecution  of these cases."  </P> <P> In the past, some Los Angeles prosecutors have been openly resentful at having  to spend time on what they see as frivolous cases arising from the city's  pro-arrest policy. One, who asked to remain anonymous, did not disguise his  scorn as he showed the evidence from a case to a Times reporter in 1986.  </P> <P> "Look at this, a scratch on the stomach," he told the reporter. "What am I  doing with this? They (the police) know better."  </P> <P> Judges, too, have been known to express low regard for the domestic cases that  have crowded their docket.  </P> <P> In 1987, Massachusetts Judge Paul H. King was disciplined, in part because he  was rude and insensitive to battered women whose cases were heard in his  courtroom.  </P> <P> "I don't believe she was beaten. I didn't see any bruises. Most women bruise  pretty easily," King once said of a victim, even though her story was verified  by police.  </P> <P> King asked another woman, "What did you do to make him hit you?"  </P> <P> Today, King remains on the bench and last April he was named Man of the Year by  the Quincy Bar Assn.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unwilling Judges  </P> <P> With jails already full of dangerous criminals, judges often are unwilling to  hold wife beaters there for long. Further, in New York and many other states,  the law prohibits them from taking a family's safety fears into account when  setting bail. The amount is based instead on ensuring that a suspect will  return for his next court date.  </P> <P> If he appears to have roots that will hold him in the community -- a job, a  house -- the arrested man is likely to be released on his own recognizance,  often to return to the home he shares with the woman he abuses.  </P> <P> In California, it is left up to the judges to consider public safety issues  when setting bail.  </P> <P> "There have been innumerable times when a judge has refused to hear my  information that this man is a threat to his family and should have a higher  bail," said Los Angeles Deputy City Atty. Alana Bowman, who heads the agency's  domestic violence prosecution unit.  </P> <P> Experience had taught Lisa Bianco everything she should do to protect herself.  After she got her ex-husband sentenced to five years in prison for his years of  abuse, she counseled others at the battered women's shelter in Elkhart, Ind.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Phone Threats  </P> <P> He oftened phoned her from prison to tell her what he planned to do to her when  he got out, and each time, Bianco would report it to prison officials. They  agreed to inform her if he ever got out, even on a short furlough.  </P> <P> They didn't. When Alan Matheney got an eight-hour pass last March, he headed  straight for Bianco's house 150 miles away. He is to stand trial in November on  charges of bludgeoning her to death on her front sidewalk with the butt of a  gun.  </P> <P> Indiana Gov. Evan Bayh has agreed to a $900,000 settlement to be paid her  estate and her two daughters.  </P> <P> Christy Doheny is afraid that the same thing may happen to her. Her former  boyfriend, Anthony Young, is to be released soon from a Connecticut prison  where he is serving time for burglary and for beating and choking her.  </P> <P> Young has written her more than 45 threatening letters.  </P> <P> "I bet you this time here I kill you," he wrote in one note, quoted in a  front-page story by the New Haven Register. He also has mailed her pictures of  their daughter with her eyes poked out and mutilated copies of the court order  that ostensibly bars him from contacting her.  </P> <P> "In many cases, the protective orders work really well -- I would say 80 to  90%," said Robin Murphy, head of the New Haven Legal Assistance family-child  unit, which is working on Doheny's case. "But in the other 10% of the cases,  the restraining orders mean nothing."  </P> <P> Indeed, in the space of nine days last December and January, three Long Island  women holding protective orders were killed by their husbands.  </P> <P> Authorities say one of their biggest problems is that victims themselves often  are unwilling to cooperate in prosecuting those who batter them.  </P> <P> For example, police say that in fully half of their Suffolk County domestic  violence calls, the victim does not want her attacker arrested. In misdemeanor  cases, this means police must let him go.  </P> <P> Of those victims who do allow arrest, another half change their minds by the  time the case gets to court.  </P> <P> Suffolk County's Werner blames this on the unhealthy dependence that many  victims, their self-esteem and confidence battered out of them, have on their  abusers.  </P> <P> "The woman is someone who married this man, who loves him. She's had children  with him," Werner said. "She depends on this battering man for every  satisfaction in her life -- for social support, for financial support, for  emotional support."  </P> <P> Because of these strong attachments, many women become caught up in cycles of  escalating violence.  </P> <P> The pattern begins with what counselors call the "battering incident," which is  followed by a "honeymoon phase," a time of reconciliation when the victim  denies her troubles and hopes for better times. Tensions then rise again until  another beating takes place.  </P> <P> "The cycle can continue for years to the point where victims are being  stalked," said Barbara Kendall, director of the Victim Witness unit of the  Boulder County district attorney's office in Colorado.  </P> <P> They also grow disillusioned with the disjointed and intimidating justice  system, others say. In Los Angeles, for example, a woman may have to take her  case to Juvenile Dependency Court, Family Law Court and criminal court.  </P> <P> "The woman will have to appear in three different places and tell the same  story over and over. . . . It's a mess," said Sheila James Kuehl of the  Southern California Women's Law Center. She and others advocate establishing a  single domestic court to handle all such cases.  </P> <P> The 1985 California law gave law enforcement officers the ability to arrest  domestic violence suspects even when the victim refuses to press charges.  </P> <P> Some argue that it is important to take batterers into custody, even without  the consent of their victims, because this will impress upon them that their  actions are a crime, even if they are never put in jail.  </P> <P> "A good arrest does not have to lead to a conviction. A good arrest leads to a  change in behavior," said Edmund Stubbing, an ex-New York City police officer  who now works for the nonprofit Victim Services Agency and organizes seminars  to help police executives set up pro-arrest systems.  </P> <P> Other agencies are taking pro-arrest policies one step further -- to  "pro-prosecution." San Diego is considered to have perhaps the most aggressive  pro-prosecution efforts in California, taking about 1,400 misdemeanor spousal  abuse cases to court each year.  </P> <P> "About 80% of the cases involved victims who did not want us to prosecute,"  said Casey Gwinn, a deputy city attorney in charge of San Diego's domestic  violence unit. "But society only recently is beginning to treat domestic  violence like any other crime. We never ask an armed robbery victim if she  wants to prosecute. We just prosecute. Why should it be any different in  domestic violence cases?"  </P> <P> When battering is still at the misdemeanor stage -- pushing, shoving, bruising  -- the legal system has its best chance of changing an abuser's behavior, Gwinn  argued.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Study of Abusers  </P> <P> A 1988 San Diego study tracked 200 misdemeanor abusers who were sentenced to  one year of weekly counseling sessions. None of the 72% completing the class  were rearrested within the next year. But nearly half of those who dropped out  were.  </P> <P> Officials worry, however, that highly publicized tragedies such as Navarro's  slaying will make women even more fearful of calling for help or leaving their  husbands or boyfriends. Often, they say, a husband will show his wife a news  clipping of such an incident and warn her that she could be next.  </P> <P> "The wrong message gets out," Werner said. "There is hope.  </P> <P> "God, we have to believe that."  </P> <P> Karen Tumulty reported this story from New York, and Stephanie Chavez from Los  Angeles.  </P></p>

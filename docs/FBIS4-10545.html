			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 12 Apr (NA) -- With the goal of  resolving the crisis being experienced by his province and  forestalling federal intervention, Jujuy Governor Jose Carlos  Ficoseco asked tonight for a six-month leave of absence. This  will allow the appointment of a replacement, with the agreement  of the other provincial parties.    According to remarks made tonight by Interior Minister  Carlos  Ruckauf, the new provincial governor will emerge from an  agreement among the ruling Justicialist Party, the Jujuy Popular  Movement, which won the 10 April elections, and the Radical  Civic Union. At the government house Ruckauf announced that the  legislature will meet tomorrow to appoint Ficoseco's replacement  and begin the province's political recovery.    Ficoseco made his decision to ask for a leave of absence  after meeting at the government house with Ruckauf and  presidential Secretary General Eduardo Bauza. [passage omitted]    Nevertheless, the possibility of tipping the balance in  favor  of an intervention, following an escalation of the conflict in  the province after unending protests by the state workers labor  union and other labor unions, has not been ruled out. The  government source placed the possibility of an intervention on a  "stand-by" status.    Ficoseco's "elegant" departure cools down Jujuy's overheated  situation, even though the social situation experienced by this  province remains very critical, and might have serious  consequences.</p>

			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> BRITAIN;  </P> <P> 28-WEEK ABORTION LIMIT REDUCED TO 24  </P> <P> The British Parliament voted to cut the legal time limit for abortions from 28  to 24 weeks of pregnancy. The first change in the abortion law since 1967  marked a compromise between anti-abortion forces, which favored an 18-week  limit, and forces favoring liberalized abortion laws. But the legislation  exempts cases in which an abortion is needed to prevent grave permanent injury  to a woman.  </P></p>

			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / Arts: Eden Cinema - Offstage Downstairs, NW1 Marguerite Duras's work has a strange bleached quality, which is taken up in stagings of her plays. It is as if a drying and denaturing wind has played over her memories, picking them clean of dramatic flesh, leaving only the bones to be delicately reassembled. Susan Todd and Iona McLeish, the director and designer responsible for Foco Novo's billowing production of Duras's Savannah Bay a couple of years back, team up again for Eden Cinema. Once more the dominant colour is white: white sand, pale planks which reach half way up the stairs of this basement theatre. Even the audience seats are shrouded with white rags. The memories are of growing up in Indo-China. The narrators, Suzanne and Joseph, look back on a childhood in which nothing positive seems to have happened except for one brief moment of optimism after their widowed mother erected a sea wall to make her lands farmable, and before the Pacific tides swept it out to sea. This former pianist in the Eden cinema had been conned by colonial authorities into spending her life savings on a tract of salt marsh on which nothing would ever grow. The play, which is certainly not to everyone's taste, functions through a teasing denial of information. Suzanne knows nothing about her mother's youth, while memories of her middle age are obstructed by the developing identity of a lonely adolescent. The older Suzanne (Julia Foster) looks on as her younger self (Emma Rice) extorts a diamond from a luckless suitor, then sets off for the city en famille to sell it for money to rebuild the sea wall. Almost dispassionately the older Suzanne tells us that her mother was prepared to sell her as well to make up the money, but we have no way of knowing whether this is reality or fantasy. Like marriage and escape, and many other possibilities in her life, it simply did not happen. Similarly, Suzanne's reports that her mother was mad are undercut by Doreen Mantle's exquisite portrayal of a sad, still megolith, brooding over the misfortunes of her own family and the starving peasants. Duras writes beautifully and unusually for the actress of a certain age, allowing characterisation to seep out of the cracks between what we see and what we are told. Susan Todd picks this up in a moody, elegiac production richly served by a splendid cast. Emma Rice and Sean Patterson's sullen teenagers, oozing dangerous passions, are poignantly offset by the sweating pallor of Sam Cox as Suzanne's suitor and the mellow wistfulness of Julia Foster's half-comprehending narrator.</p>

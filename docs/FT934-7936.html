			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Nicaragua breaks aid logjam THE Nicaraguan government has agreed under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to take measures to raise tax revenues or cut spending, breaking a logjam which had been holding up flows of official finance to the country. This initial agreement with the fund immediately paves the way for finance from the Inter-American Development Bank and Taiwan totalling about Dollars 55m (Pounds 36.9m). It also clears the way for the arrival next week of a team from the IMF, to negotiate Dollars 25m in concessional funding, and the World Bank. The IMF has been seeking government savings, either spending cuts or revenue increases, equal to 4 per cent of GDP. Earlier disagreements with the World Bank and IADB, which both saw this as too tight a policy for a war-damaged economy with single-digit inflation, seem to have been resolved. If the IMF agrees to provide finance, under an Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility used mainly by poor countries in Africa, it will clear the way for funds from the World Bank totalling some Dollars 60m, some possible US finance, and some tied aid. Nicaragua's foreign exchange reserves had fallen close to zero, with imports of around Dollars 800m a year running at four times the level of exports. Inflows of official finance are essential to replenish reserves, since private investment is almost non-existent, because of the impossibility of enforcing property rights. Despite the advances in the negotiations, questions remain about the ability of President Violeta Chamorro's government to deliver on its promises. An earlier attempt to levy a vehicle tax was reversed this year after widespread protests. The government has been seeking, so far unsuccessfully, to include representatives of the left-wing Sandinistas, the former guerrillas defeated in a 1990 election, in the negotiations with the IMF and World Bank. Mrs Chamorro's government has been paralysed by the collapse of the conservative UNO coalition which swept her to power in 1990. The US suspended aid to Nicaragua last summer because of the continued heavy involvement in government of the Sandinistas, described by one US official as running a 'state within a state'. More recently, the Sandinistas have attacked government plans to privatise several public utilities and Mrs Chamorro's insistence that Mr Humberto Ortega, brother of former Sandinista president Mr Daniel Ortega, step down next year as head of the military. The Sandinistas are also unlikely to find the IMF proposals acceptable. They have been seeking a relaxation of credit constraints which would particularly affect agriculture, and benefit, not coincidentally, many Sandinistas. The Chamorro government has had startling success against inflation, bringing it down to single digits from an annual 33,600 per cent in 1988 and 13,500 per cent in 1990. But with unemployment as high as 60 per cent and poverty worse than anywhere in the Americas except Haiti, austerity is unpopular. 'We have just emerged from a decade of war. This policy ignores that,' said Mr Oscar Rene Vargas, an economist in Managua.</p>

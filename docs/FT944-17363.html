			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / International Company News: Disney to introduce French films to US cinema-goers Mickey Mouse may soon be blushing in embarrassment, thanks to an attempt by his masters to bring the gems of the French cinema to American audiences in readily digestible form. Euro Disney, the French-based theme park owner, said yesterday that Mr Philippe Bourguignon, chairman, had decided to set up a new subsidiary of Miramax, owned by Walt Disney, which would promote French films in the US. Mr Bourguignon, who had the idea but will not be directly involved in managing the company, said the aim was to release at least three French films a year in the US. Asked whether some of the more sensuous French films would be on offer uncut to American mass market tastes - often considered more prudish - Euro Disney said no decisions had been taken on the types of film to be supported. It said the new company aimed to dub four existing French films into English by 1996, in an attempt to broaden the audience of European cinema away from a minority 'elite type of viewer' prepared to read sub-titles. The subsidiary may also threaten the dominance of a few leading French actors, such as Gerard Depardieu, by taking an active part in casting French actors in Miramax film productions. Euro Disney - which has been criticised for being too American in outlook for its European customers - lost no opportunity to emphasise the French image of the initiative. It said the company would be based in Paris and would be headed Ms Agnes Matre, vice-president of Miramax. The company admitted that Euro Disney wanted to build its own, international identity, but stressed the reason behind the move was purely 'a business decision' and that 'we should focus on and retain our Disney roots'. The new company intends to work on about five European productions a year and set up co-productions with French producers.</p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / International Company News: Anglo American-led group buys stake in paper concern A CONSORTIUM led by Anglo American Corporation of South Africa and some of its main subsidiaries, including Mondi Paper, is to pay R550m (Dollars 190m) to acquire a 44 per cent stake in Frantschach, a leading Austrian pulp and paper group. Mr Tony Trahar, executive chairman of Mondi, said the interests of the consortium members, also including De Beers Centenary and Minorco, would be held through a recently-formed holding company, Mondi Europe. Anglo American is to own 46 per cent of the holding company, Mondi 5 per cent, Centenary and associates 28 per cent, and Minorco 21 per cent. Mondi will provide the managerial lead on behalf of the consortium; Anglo and its affiliates will hold joint control. Mr Trahar said a substantial portion of the purchase price would be invested directly in the company to enhance its capital base for future growth. The 51 per cent portion of the purchase price to be paid by the South African participants - Anglo American and Mondi - is to be financed from overseas facilities. The deal is the second significant step into Europe by Mondi - a wholly-owned, unlisted subsidiary of Anglo American. In November 1990, Frantschach sold a 49 per cent interest in Neusiedler of Austria, a producer of photocopy and business forms paper, to Mondi, Anglo and their associates. The purchase price was not disclosed, but estimates range from Dollars 85m to 135m. Mr Trahar said that after a long period of isolation the deal brought Mondi back into the international arena, giving it access to new areas of technology and to European markets, especially if Austria should become a member of the European Community. The deal will also enhance Mondi's ability to export pulp from South Africa to Neusiedler. The Frantschach group has four main areas of activity: bleached pulp and paper; unbleached pulp and packaging paper; packaging and converting; and distribution. It has 6,000 employees and an annual turnover of about R3bn. Mr Trahar said that Frantschach was well-positioned to benefit from environmental concerns over the use of plastic packaging and a growing preference for paper products. He added that, with other international paper groups suffering from ill-considered acquisitions and the industry going through a recessionary phase, it was a good time to be making an acquisition. Mondi recently announced an 18 per cent increase in earnings to R110m for the 1992 financial year, after a 45 per cent drop in 1991 to R89m. Mr Trahar said 1992 would be a difficult year, with recovery expected in the second half.</p>

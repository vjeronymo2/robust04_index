			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / World Trade News: UK wins big HK contracts The building boom in Hong Kong shows little sign of slackening for British companies with the award of two further orders for construction on projects worth a combined Pounds 110m, writes Andrew Taylor, Construction Correspondent. Tarmac in a joint venture with Kumagai Gumi, the large Japanese construction company, has won a Pounds 55m contract to design and built a new rail tunnel under the harbour linking Hong Hong island with the West Kowloon peninsula.

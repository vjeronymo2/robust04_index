			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN LEFT;  </P> <P> WHY THEN EMBRACE DE KLERK?;  </P> <P> IN MANY WAYS, SOUTH AFRICA HAS BEEN WORSE THAN IRAQ. BUT HOW DIFFERENTLY THE  ADMINISTRATION TREATS THEM.  </P> <P> As the value of oil increases, the value of blood may be devalued. Why else  would the Bush Administration refuse to talk with Saddam Hussein with American  lives at risk, and insist on talking with South Africa's President F. W. de  Klerk while apartheid continues to reap its grisly harvest of African lives?  </P> <P> Why embrace De Klerk? Apartheid's racial repression of the majority for decades  has taken a far greater toll than Hussein's attacks on the Kurdish minority in  Iraq. De Klerk's presidency is no more democratic -- and certainly far less  representative -- than Hussein's dictatorship. South Africa's terror against  its several neighbors is no less aggression than Iraq's aggression against  Kuwait.  </P> <P> President Bush announced that reforms in South Africa were "irreversible." But  why give out the grade before the exam has been taken? Nelson Mandela is out of  jail, but he is not free. The pillars of apartheid still stand -- the laws that  exclude blacks from voting, those that enforce segregation and racial  exploitation, those that give the police emergency powers for brutal  repression.  </P> <P> Indeed, President De Klerk's security police are now implicated in the current  violence among black South Africans. De Klerk has used the rhetoric of one  person, one vote, but does that have the same meaning in the South African  context as it does in the United States? Nelson Mandela does not think reform  is irreversible; he urges sanctions until democracy. Why embrace De Klerk?  </P> <P> For years, conservatives defended South Africa as a strategic ally against  communism in southern Africa. But the Cold War is over. Romance with the  apartheid regime, always immoral, now has no strategic excuse. Leaders of the  African majority call upon us to keep the pressure on until democracy comes. If  self-determination by the majority is a principle of American foreign policy,  why then embrace De Klerk?  </P> <P> The world acknowledges that South Africa is a racist state. In 1988, the  Democrats called it a terrorist state. Both are right. Under the pressure of  economic sanctions and international isolation, De Klerk decided it was better  to jaw with Nelson Mandela than to jail him. Greater political participation  and involvement are happening in the country. Hopes for fundamental change have  risen. But only the hope, not the reality.  </P> <P> This week, President Bush became thefirst U.S. President to meet with the head  of a South Africa still organized on the principle of apartheid. If President  Bush had met with De Klerk to repeat forcefully our concern for a democracy,  our commitment to sanctions until democracy is reality, the meeting might have  been understandable. We must learn to talk with those who we oppose. For the  same reason, the United States should try to talk it out with Hussein, not  simply fight it out. But we would not praise Hussein while Americans were still  held hostage and Iraqi troops remained in Kuwait. Why then embrace De Klerk?  </P> <P> Many fear that De Klerk hopes to use cosmetic reform to end South Africa's  costly international isolation, without ending the brutal racial exploitation  on which apartheid is built -- a face lift without changing the fundamentals in  South Africa. The Administration's decision to use a loophole in the sanctions  law to import South African iron and steel may embolden him. President Bush's  warm embrace may encourage him. If so, the President's meeting with De Klerk  was as wrong-headed as the Administration's kinder and gentler dealings with  Saddam Hussein prior to the invasion of Kuwait. Both conversations sent the  wrong message to the wrong man at the wrong time.  </P> <P> When Iraq's aggression threatens the supply of oil, we mobilize the world. Our  guard seems to go down and our tolerance up when the question is racial  violence. We cannot value oil more than blood. If we are to build the new world  order that the President invokes, we must begin by measuring human rights by a  single yardstick. Support international law, but be consistent. Why then  embrace De Klerk?  </P> <P> The smiles may beguile. Congress should now make certain that President De  Klerk is clear about this country's opposition to apartheid. Loopholes in the  sanctions legislation should be closed, our commitment to sanctions until  democracy restated. The end of South African economic sanctions and isolation  should and will come from change within -- not from public relations abroad.  </P></p>

He said he had seen  three girls in a corner of the pub "shooting up and down into  the air like puppets" as they were being gunned down with  automatic rifles.    SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news  reported the unnamed witness had walked into the pub to buy  cigarettes and was busy chatting when he heard sounds resembling  firecrackers. "I knew they were gunshots" he said, adding he  "instinctively hit the deck".    "When I looked around everything was very quiet. But I heard  the gunshots and I saw three girls in a corner going like  puppets, shooting up and down into the air". He said people  were running all over, hurrying outside, trying to get to their  cars.    "Why did this happen in Observatory?" He asked. "I have been  all over the country and Obs is such a peaceful place, very  multiracial ...Why did they attack here?" "They were young  people (the victims)...They keep talking about peace, peace,  peace, but that's not peace. That was sick. I can't stop  thinking about those three girls. I've seen action here, there  and everywhere but this was different, because it was in my home  town, right here. It's not fair," the witness said.</p>

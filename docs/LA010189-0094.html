			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Two men hired to monitor the performance of lottery ticket computers sued the  California Lottery, complaining that officials ignored reports that computer  problems were underreported. In the Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit, Emmitt  A. Allison and Randy Troxel alleged that they were placed on administrative  leave and reassigned in September after they took their complaints to the state  controller's office. State lottery officials have said the allegations were  investigated and were unfounded. The complaint seeks unspecified damages and a  court order forbidding lottery officials from destroying documents supporting  Allison's and Troxel's findings.  </P></p>

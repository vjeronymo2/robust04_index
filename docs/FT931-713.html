			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Latin American Finance (11): Lines are blurring - A look at the markets in Latin debt THE NATURE of the Latin American debt market is changing rapidly, as an increasingly broad range of investors enters the market. As this process advances, there has been a blurring of the strict delineation between Latin American country loans traded in the secondary market and new issues launched in the Eurobond market by both sovereign and corporate Latin American borrowers. In the wake of the debt crisis, when many Latin American countries defaulted on their bank loans, the secondary market in their debt grew up as a result of trading by banks, largely creditor banks trying to lay off or manage their risk. When Latin American sovereign and corporate borrowers returned to the Eurobond market a few years ago, these high-yielding bonds were initially bought largely by retail investors in Europe or by Latin American nationals (in the form of so-called flight capital). But the region's recent record of strong growth and economic reforms has attracted new investors and a growing number of specialist funds. In fact, the market in secondary bank loans has now been virtually replaced by a market in Brady bonds, the restructured bank debt created under the Brady debt reduction plan. Venezuela and Mexico have already implemented their Brady plans, and Argentina is poised to issue its Brady bonds. Meanwhile, trading in Brazilian debt has stopped, ahead of the implementation of the Brady package there, which was agreed with Brazil's bank advisory committee last July, but has been disappointingly slow to come to fruition. The conclusion of the package has been delayed by the need to get an International Monetary Fund agreement in place prior to the Brady plan. The IMF agreement in turn requires a new package of measures by the government which have, in turn, been delayed by political problems. Meanwhile, trading in Brazilian bank debt has come to a standstill, because banks have already tendered for bonds under the Brady plan. Instead, trading is concentrated in IDU bonds (issued last year in lieu of interest payments) and in when-and-if-issued (WIFI) Brady bonds. Among other Brady bonds, Mexican par bonds have performed well, holding their spread relative to the US Treasury market until recently, despite the strong US market rally. However, the market in Venezuelan par and conversion bonds has been much more difficult - 'there is a permanent political crisis: as a result, the fiscal deficit and current account deficits are mounting,' says Mr Paul Luke, head of developing country research at Morgan Grenfell. The price of the par bonds slumped a point to 56 3/4 in a week, despite the strong rally in the US market. Meanwhile, the spread of investors in Latin American Eurobonds continues to increase, with even mainstream institutional investors beginning to dip their toes into the market, by buying Latin American securities as a small part of large and diversified portfolios. AN appetite for extra yield, at a time when low interest rates are squeezing returns, has encouraged more investors to look at Latin American bonds. Although the market has been volatile, there has been, overall, a steady tightening of yield spreads relative to the US Treasury market in recent years, as the creditworthiness of Latin American borrowers has improved. But the market suffered a setback at the end of last year, when oversupply caused yield margins to widen substantially. However, those wider margins, reviewed at the start of the year, started to attract investors back to the market. As well as the broader range of investors, smaller Latin American countries are now returning to the market. Also, the market is now open to more Latin American companies, though investors remain nervous of weaker credits. Colombia, which has never rescheduled its debt, will make its debut in early April, via Bankers Trust, with a Dollars 100m issue of five or seven-year Eurobonds, which is expected to attract strong demand. Meanwhile, Uruguay, which completed its first Eurobond last year, is to return to the market with a five-year deal, arranged by Chase Investment Bank. Some bankers believe that Peru - or a government-owned company - may also tap the market this year, after having implemented a number of economic reforms last year. Ecuador is also cited as a potential new borrower. However, bankers have become increasingly frustrated in their efforts to bring Chilean borrowers to the market. The government has clamped down on foreign borrowing, barring banks from tapping the market and restricting all but a few companies. 'Every time you get a mandate, the Chilean authorities change the rules - in effect, blocking the market,' complains one banker. Chile has an active domestic market, where funding of up to 20 years is available, but the amounts are small. In addition, banks are keen to raise dollars in the international market to on-lend to companies for their export business. Borrowers are also beginning to tap markets other than the dollar market. Venezuela is said to be planning a DM350-400m issue of five-year bonds via Commerzbank (having just issued three-year dollar bonds in the domestic Colombian market), and Pemex, the Mexican oil company, recently tapped the Swiss franc bond market, for example.</p>

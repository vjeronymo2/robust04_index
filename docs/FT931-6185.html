			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Sales of new homes increase by a fifth so far this year SALES OF new homes rose by more than a fifth during the first eight weeks of this year, according to Britain's 15 largest housebuilders. The figures confirm the revival of activity in the housing market reported by builders, estate agents and building societies. The sales rise did not prevent a further 0.3 per cent fall in house prices last month compared with January, according to figures published yesterday by Halifax Building Society, the country's biggest mortgage lender. Halifax said there had been a sharp rise in mortgage applications and in interest from potential buyers through its estate agencies, but this had not yet worked through to prices. Sales figures compiled by the Housebuilders Federation show that net reservations - sales on which a deposit has been paid less cancellations - totalled more than 5,000 in January and February for the 15 largest housebuilders. This figure compared with 4,200 in the first two months of last year. The 15 companies account for about 80 per cent of new house sales. The federation's survey, conducted weekly, also shows a 15 per cent rise, to more than 150,000, in the number of people visiting new homes for sale during January and February. Abbey National, which yesterday announced a 9 per cent fall in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 564m, said the numbers of new mortgage offers issued by the bank to first-time buyers and of people moving house were 30 per cent higher in January than in the same month last year. Besides reporting a fall in profits, Abbey also said it intended to sell its Cornerstone estate agency business. The group said it had lost Pounds 226m on estate agency business since its acquisition in 1987. Mr Peter Parkin, chairman of Raine Industries, one of the housebuilders surveyed, said the number of potential purchasers visiting its sites had risen to more than 1,000 a week in January and February. This compared with fewer than 400 a week in December. 'Net reservations are between a fifth and a quarter higher than during January and February last year,' Mr Parkin said. 'It is too early to talk of a sustained recovery but business is looking better.' The improvement had occurred at sites all over the country rather than in any particular region. Halifax said the average price of houses which sold in February was Pounds 60,196, 7.2 per cent down on the same month last year. First-time buyers paid 1 per cent more for houses last month as lenders targeted the group to provide the spur to the market. 'Although house prices are still falling, the small size of the declines in January and February could be an early indication of stability returning to house prices in the spring,' Halifax said.

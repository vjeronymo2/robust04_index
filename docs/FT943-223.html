			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Management: Are you the uncertain type? - Adrian Furnham seeks to identify those intolerant of ambiguity It is well known that we can be sure of only two things: death and taxes. For the rest of life, the future is uncertain. Economic and political predictions are ambiguous, mutually contradictory and frequently gloomy. But it is not only the future that is unclear. All sorts of things in our daily lives are uncertain and ambiguous: people's motives, competitor strategies, the cause of certain illnesses. There are those who seek out ambiguity. They like abstract art, poetry with multiple meaning, wandering in unfamiliar countries. And there are those who are made fearful and angry by it. They need order, clarity, structure and strict demarcations between right and wrong. A person with a low tolerance of ambiguity experiences stress, reacts prematurely and avoids ambiguous stimuli, be they in art, literature, politics or emotional experience. Those who dislike change can be seriously out of kilter with the modern world. As companies become global and multinational in terms of location, work-force and customers, these people tend to be rather xenophobic and nationalistic. But before we condemn those uncomfortable with uncertainty to a 'four-legs good, two-legs bad' world, why not evaluate yourself: 1 An expert who doesn't come up with a definite answer probably doesn't know a great deal. True or false? 2 A good job is one where what is to be done and how it is done are clearly specified. T/F. 3 In the long run it is possible to get more done by tackling small, simple problems rather than larger, complicated ones. T/F. 4 A person who leads an even, regular life in which few surprises or unexpected happenings arise has a lot to be grateful for. T/F. 5 I like parties where I know most of the people more than ones where all or most are complete strangers. T/F. 6 The sooner we all acquire similar values and ideas the better. T/F. 7 People who schedule their lives all the time probably miss most of the joy of living. T/F. 8 It is more fun to tackle a complicated problem than to solve a simple one. T/F. 9 People who insist on a yes or no answer don't know how complicated things really are. T/F. 10 Many of our most important decisions are based on insufficient information. T/F. 11 Managers who hand out vague assignments give a chance for subordinates to show initiative and originality. T/F. 12 I have always felt that there is a clear difference between right and wrong. T/F. 13 Nothing gets accomplished unless you stick to some basic rules. T/F. 14 Vague and impressionistic pictures really have little appeal for me. T/F. 15 Before an examination, I feel less anxious if I know how many questions there will be. T/F. 16 Sometimes I enjoy going against the rules and doing things I'm not supposed to. T/F. 17 I like to fool around with new ideas, even if they turn out to be a waste of time. T/F. 18 If I were a doctor, I would prefer the uncertainties of a psychiatrist to the clear and definite work of a surgeon. T/F. 19 I don't like to work on a problem unless there is a possibility of an unambiguous answer. T/F. 20 It bothers me when l am unable to follow another person's train of thought. T/F. Scoring: The higher the score the more intolerant of ambiguity you are. Score one for each time you put T for questions 1-6, 11-15 and 20. Score one for each time you put F for questions 7-10 and 16-19. Score 0-8: Perhaps an arty, creative type; Score 9-15: A pretty normal score. You are happy to recognise and deal with life's little uncertainties; Score 16-20: A conservative, call-a-spade-a-spade type.

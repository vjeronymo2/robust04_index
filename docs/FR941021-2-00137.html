			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If market value of the Banking Industry Portfolio has declined, the owners of the Banking Industry Portfolio Notes will receive at least 90% of the principal amount of the Notes. The payment at maturity is based on charges in the value of the Banking Industry Portfolio, subject to any cap on appreciation that may be included by the issuer, but does not reflect the payment of dividends on the securities that comprise the portfolio. Banking Industry Portfolio Notes are cash-settled in that they do not give holder any right to receive a portfolio security or any other ownership right or interest in the portfolio securities, although the return on the investment is based on the aggregate value of the Banking Industry Portfolio securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the Amex, Banking Industry Portfolio Notes will allow investors to combine the protection of a portion of the principal amount of the Notes with a potential additional payment based upon the performance of a portfolio of 20 highly capitalized banking industry stocks. In particular, the proposed Banking Industry Portfolio Notes will provide at least 90% principal protection with the opportunity to participate in any upside appreciation of the underlying Banking Industry Portfolio, subject to any cap on appreciation that may be included by the issuer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Banking Industry Portfolio consists of securities of 20 companies that collectively, at the time of issuance, <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  will satisfy the generic listing requirements approved by the Commission for the listing and trading of options on newly established narrow-based indexes. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  Specifically, the component securities of the Banking Industry Portfolio satisfy the following criteria: (1) a minimum market capitalization of $75 million, except that up to 10% of the component securities may have a market capitalization of not less than $50 million; (2) trading volume in each of the six months prior to the offering of the Notes of not less than one million shares, except that up to 10% of the component securities may have a trading volume in each of the six months prior to the offering of the Notes of not less than 500,000 shares; (3) at least 90% of the component securities will meet the then current criteria for standardized options trading set forth in Exchange Rule 915; (4) all components of the Banking Industry Portfolio will be listed on the Amex or the New York Stock Exchange, or will be National Market securities traded through Nasdaq; (5) all components of the Banking Industry Portfolio will be subject to last sale reporting pursuant to Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1 of the Act; and (6) no more than 20% of the weight of the Banking Industry Portfolio shall be represented by foreign securities or ADRs for which the Exchange does not have in place a comprehensive surveillance sharing agreement with the appropriate regulatory organization(s) in such country(ies). <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission notes that because the Banking Industry Portfolio is a static portfolio, the Amex will not make adjustments subsequent to issuance of the Notes for purposes of maintaining compliance with these standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34157 (June 3, 1994), 59 FR 30062 (June 10, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The exchange has represented that Lehman Brothers may conclude prior to issuance of the Notes, based on changes in its market research and investment strategy, that the composition of the Banking Industry Portfolio should be altered. In such an event, Lehman Brothers would be allowed, with the concurrence of the staff of the Commission, to replace component securities accounting for up to 10% of the number of components of the Banking Industry Portfolio ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , two components) provided that with the replacement components, the Banking Industry Portfolio still satisfies the requirements for the listing and trading of options on newly established narrow-based indexes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  If Lehman Brothers determines to make any changes to the Banking Industry Portfolio that do not satisfy these conditions, the Exchange would be required to obtain approval from the Commission pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act before listing Notes based on the altered Banking Industry Portfolio. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the outset, each of the securities in the Banking Industry Portfolio will have equal representation. Specifically, each security included in the Banking Industry Portfolio will be assigned a multiplier on the date of issuance so that the security represents an equal percentage of the value of the entire portfolio on the date of issuance. The multiplier indicates the number of shares (or fraction of one share) of a security, given its market price on an exchange or through Nasdaq, to be included in the calculation of the portfolio. Accordingly, each of the 20 companies included in the Banking Industry Portfolio will represent approximately 5.0% of the total portfolio at the time of issuance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

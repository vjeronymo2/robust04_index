			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Japanese brokerage reorganisation DAIWA Securities, a leading Japanese brokerage, yesterday announced it would transfer 200 head office personnel to domestic branches, writes Emiko Terazono. The move reflects the company's need to boost branch level sales commissions, which have declined sharply due to the sluggish stock market. Japanese brokerages have been hard hit by the low trading volumes in the equity market stemming from deteriorating investor confidence. While smaller brokers, which rely heavily on stock broking commissions and have been hit by the faltering market, have been announcing shifts of head office employees to sales branches, Daiwa will be the first of the big four brokerages - which also include Nomura, Nikko and Yamaichi - to implement such changes. Yamaichi Securities also said it was considering a reorganisation of employees at the end of next month. The move also represents a change in business strategy of the leading brokerages. The big four have been pressured to allow more autonomy to the branches, as previous sales methods which involved the head office issuing stock recommendations through branch networks have been criticised for distorting share prices and, in some cases, price manipulation. Now the branches are expected to operate more independently, tailoring investment advice to local conditions and local customers' needs.</p>

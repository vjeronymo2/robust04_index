			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Take-over fever proves catching - London / But retailers strike a sour note One of the few remaining hopes for a bit of stock market fizz before the end of the year has been bid speculation, and this week has provided some entertaining tests of whether words might actually turn into action. They failed spectacularly to do so in the case of SG Warburg, the UK investment bank with global ambitions, and Morgan Stanley, of the US. Merger talks were called off on Thursday, a week after they became public. Postmortem reports revealed that the sticking point was Mercury Asset Management, Warburg's 75 per cent-owned fund management arm which contributed nearly all the group's first-half profits. The board of MAM wanted a premium offer for the minority shareholders, along with guarantees about independence. The US firm would have contemplated the former, up to a point, but jibbed at the latter. The merger collapse left Warburg with difficult questions to answer about its vaulting ambition to become a global investment bank. Its share price fell 99p to 678p on the day. The other big bid prospect of the week remains firmly on the cards, however. Interest in Trafalgar House's putative offer for the Newcastle-based Northern Electric is intense, especially as it would be the first hostile bid for a privatised UK utility. The engineering and property conglomerate is controlled effectively by Hongkong Land - a subsidiary of Jardine Matheson, which is trying to reduce its dependence on Hong Kong ahead of the 1997 hand-over to China. Money from the colony, plus the target's own strong balance sheet and cash-generative powers, would finance such a deal rather than Trafalgar's other shareholders, whose goodwill has been strained by asset write-downs and two rights issues since 1992. At least Trafalgar House has returned to profit after three years of losses, and gearing at the September 30 year-end had been cut to just 3 per cent on shareholders' funds of Pounds 708.6m. With the government saying it would retain its 'golden' shares in the regional electricity companies until March 31, Northern's share price ended the week at 985p (valuing the group at Pounds 1.22bn) after rising to 1010p on Wednesday, the day Trafalgar said it was considering a bid. Northern started the week at 881p - already nearly 300p above this year's low. Then, a rising clamour about bids in the sector kept mentioning it as a prime target. It is one of the smaller of the 12 recs, with a reputation for lacklustre management - although some analysts have begun to revise that view. Takeover fever has added a few extra volts to a highly charged sector. The recs' results season, which culminates on Monday with East Midlands, has thrown up dividend rises of between 15 per cent and 47 per cent - politically unpopular dimensions. Underlying earnings have risen strongly, even if re-organisation charges - including hundreds of job losses - have dented headline figures. What a contrast with the retail sector, which ought to be enjoying its jolliest time of the year. The latest CBI survey, showing stagnant sales in November and October, confirmed that the 'feel-bad' factor was continuing to affect consumers. Ample evidence of high street gloom was provided by this week's set of company announcements, most graphically in the profits warning from Hornby, maker of the racing car game Scalextric. Its shares fell 50p to 127p on Wednesday as one source was quoted as saying: 'It is going to be a poor Christmas.' On Thursday, Asda's chief executive, Archie Norman, came out with a typically bleak forecast for the supermarket sector: the era of intense competition and falling margins was likely to continue for another two years. In spite of this, the group has continued its recovery, beating market expectations with half-year pre-tax profits of Pounds 108.7m. A ray of hope for the future was offered by one small multimedia company. VideoLogic has signed what could prove to be a lucrative deal with NEC, of Japan, to develop computer games with much more realistic 3D images. Never mind the Scalextric: games now available only in arcades are set to enter the home. Rather quaintly, VideoLogic explained away its Pounds 3.7m interim losses by saying that the business remained 'in development mode'. It had eschewed short-term profits deliberately to keep up investment in research into the multimedia breakthrough. And, believe it or not, the market's reaction was anything but cynical: the shares rose 11 1/2 p to 51p on the day. As the company results season starts to wind down, the discomfiture of some high profile individuals has this week vied with the takeover excitement for the front pages. Maurice Saatchi, founder of the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi advertising group, was last night forced to stand down as its chairman following pressure from some big shareholders. They were incensed by a proposal he should receive a Pounds 5m option package - based on his old salary of Pounds 625,000 instead of his new one of Pounds 200,000. Yet, even Pounds 5m pales into insignificance beside the estimated Pounds 40m of personal debts owed by Robert Montague, chief executive of container rental group Tiphook. Barclays Bank has joined Royal Bank of Scotland in serving petitions for bankruptcy on him. The latter's action is due to be heard on Thursday. Of the money owed to Royal Bank, some Pounds 8m is secured on Montague's 1,300-acre estate in Oxfordshire. Another of the lenders is Commerzbank, of Germany, which has about Pounds 7m secured on his yacht. If Montague is made bankrupt, he will no longer be able to sit on Tiphook's board.</p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> PANEL URGES CONCRETE PILINGS AS PIER SUPPORT  </P> <P> An advisory committee is recommending that the new Huntington Beach Pier be  rebuilt with concrete instead of steel pilings, and it is urging the City  Council to approve that change at its meeting Monday night.  </P> <P> The Pier Design Committee previously supported rebuilding the 77-year-old  landmark with steel legs that would be cheaper and faster to install, despite  some protest among community members who found the idea of steel less appealing  than the gray concrete.  </P> <P> Residents and city officials who form the committee reversed themselves  Thursday night after learning that two piers with similar steel pilings were  now showing signs of saltwater corrosion just 5 years after they were built.  </P> <P> City staff members reported that, while not severe, rust already had  materialized on the San Clemente and Pismo Beach piers at the spot where  vertical steel pilings were welded to horizontal beams beneath the decking.  </P> <P> Since 1983, two winter storms have destroyed costly parts of the Huntington  Beach Pier, which was deemed a public hazard and closed by the city last July  13. At the committee's recommendation, the City Council voted a few months ago  to build a pier with steel pilings because it would save an estimated $1.5  million and open 6 months earlier.  </P> <P> But the potential costs to repair the corroded steel combined with the less  favorable, two-tone appearance of a steel and concrete mixture led the pier  advisory committee members to change their recommendation.  </P> <P> Monday's council meeting will begin at 7 p.m. at City Hall, 2000 Main St.  </P></p>

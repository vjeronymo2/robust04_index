			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 7 INSURANCE FIRMS TOLD TO RETURN $305 MILLION;  </P> <P> COMMISSIONER'S TENTATIVE ORDER APPLIES MAINLY TO NON-AUTOMOBILE POLICIES;  APPEALS POSSIBLE  </P> <P> Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie Tuesday tentatively ordered seven  leading insurance sellers to give $305.3 million in rate rollbacks to their  California policyholders.  </P> <P> Beginning the long process of compelling companies to roll back premiums in  accord with Proposition 103, Gillespie's biggest rollback orders, for the most  part, applied to homeowner and earthquake, not automobile, policies.  </P> <P> Finding earthquake insurance rates excessive, she ordered rollbacks as large as  92% in those premiums. The homeowners rollback orders ranged up to 9% and most  of the auto insurance rollbacks were relatively minuscule, although one  company, USAA, was ordered to roll back its auto premiums 16%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Fair Rate of Return'  </P> <P> Proposition 103 originally called for uniform rollbacks of 20% from 1987 levels  for most lines of property and casualty insurance. But the state Supreme Court  ruled in May that the rollbacks had to be adjusted by the insurance  commissioner to assure the companies a "fair rate of return."  </P> <P> In most of these initial decisions, Gillespie ordered rollbacks well under 20%  and in some lines no rollbacks at all, although in a few she ordered rollbacks  well in excess of the 20% standard.  </P> <P> The rollback figures she released Tuesday are also keyed to present prices, not  to the often much lower 1987 prices Proposition 103 said should be used as the  base from which the cuts would be figured.  </P> <P> Each of the orders can be contested by the individual companies at a series of  hearings that will begin in September, and final rollback orders can be  appealed by the companies to the courts. So it could be months or even years  before refund checks are in the mail.  </P> <P> The seven companies subject to the initial orders Tuesday are Allstate, ordered  to roll back premiums by an overall $85.7 million (6%); State Farm Fire &amp;  Casualty, by $83 million (7.9%); USAA, by $56.7 million (17.3%); California  State Automobile Assn., by $44.8 million (4%); Safeco, by $19.5 million (7.9%);  20th Century, by $14 million (2.4%) and Progressive Casualty, by $1.6 million  (1%).  </P> <P> The State Farm company listed is not the main State Farm Mutual company, the  largest seller of auto and homeowners insurance in California. That larger  company, and hundreds of others, will be subject to rollback orders in coming  weeks.  </P> <P> In a series of significant statements that gave the first solid indication of  Gillespie's approach to rollback and other impending rate decisions, the  commissioner:  </P> <P> * Declared that she is setting the "fair rate of return" standard at an annual  11.2%. This, she said, was the average rate of return for all U.S. property  casualty insurers during the years 1973 through 1987. By comparison, she  estimated that the insurers have recently been realizing about a 15% annual  rate of return in California.  </P> <P> * Said she had found most of 4,000 separate insurer filings for exemptions from  Proposition 103-mandated rollbacks "very much biased in favor of the insurance  companies." Having determined that she could not rely on them, she said, she  based her first rollback orders on figures developed through examinations of  1988 company records conducted by her staff.  </P> <P> * Concluded, based on industry profitability figures for 1987 compiled by the  National Assn. of Insurance Commissioners, that California insurance sellers  had earned a 29.2%, or $150 million, return on homeowners policies that year,  while losing 7.5%, or $227 million, on automobile insurance. She said this  indicates that homeowner policies are subsidizing auto policies in California,  although the subsidy is not enough. Other lucrative lines of insurance offset  the shortfall.  </P> <P> * Said she hopes, over a period of several years, to make each line of  insurance in the state self-sustaining, with the insurers earning close to the  11.2% rate of return, but that this could not be done in automobile insurance  without legal reforms that would reduce costly litigation. Proposition 103 is  bringing to the surface much information about insurance pricing that the  Legislature will not be able to ignore, she said.  </P> <P> * Vowed that, in making rollback decisions, she will not award any company a  higher rate than it is charging now.  </P> <P> Gillespie's tentative rollback orders and her statements Tuesday drew a frosty  reaction from insurance firm spokesmen who insisted that the commissioner was  being too hard on the companies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reaction Is Mixed  </P> <P> Reaction from consumer groups was mixed, with some compliments from  representatives of the Consumers Union and the Insurance Consumer Action  Network on grounds that Gillespie has toughened her attitude toward the  companies, and strong criticism from Proposition 103 chairman Harvey Rosenfield  and his favored candidate for insurance commissioner, Conway H. Collis, who  both said she was not nearly tough enough.  </P> <P> State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty promptly said it will resist giving any  rollbacks. "We feel our rates are fully justified and we'll be able to  demonstrate that at the hearing," said Judith Mintel, a company lawyer and rate  expert.  </P> <P> "Our reaction is one of disappointment," said Rick Dinon, a spokesman for 20th  Century. He said his company has always sought to be an efficient, low-cost  provider and does not think rollbacks of its premiums would be justified.  </P> <P> Bob Murphy, a spokesman for Allstate, said Gillespie's orders represent only  the start of a long process and that his company is convinced that hearing  officers will uphold Allstate's present rates.  </P> <P> On the consumer side, Rosenfield called the commissioner's pronouncements "all  bogus" and insisted that Gillespie was, in fact, accepting most of the "phony"  financial figures submitted by the companies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Not Justified'  </P> <P> Collis said, "The ordering of such minimal rollbacks is not justified by either  the facts or the law. . . . She has placed the burden on consumer  representatives to fight in the hearings for greater rollbacks. . . . She has  prejudged the process in favor of insurers. The insurers may act unhappy, but,  in fact, they must be ecstatic."  </P> <P> But Judith Bell of the Consumers Union gave credit to Gillespie for "stepping  out front and taking on some of the larger companies," and Steven Miller of the  Insurance Consumer Action Network said he found "a lot of promise" for  consumers in what the commissioner had done.  </P> <P> Bell cautioned, however, that in setting "a fairly low rate of return" standard  for the companies, Gillespie may have paradoxically ushered in a new,  protracted period of insurer litigation, thus delaying refund checks  indefinitely.  </P> <P> Miller, for his part, expressed concern that in setting one standard for fair  return Gillespie might be favoring less efficient companies while penalizing  the more efficient. He noted, for example, that she had directed a 17.3%  overall rollback for one of the most efficient companies, USAA, while ordering  only a 1% rollback for Progressive Casualty, which he said is viewed as a less  efficient one.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Huge Profits Cited  </P> <P> One sidelight of interest in Gillespie's statements Tuesday related to  earthquake insurance, where she ordered the largest rollbacks.  </P> <P> The commissioner noted that federal tax laws prohibit companies from reserving  premiums against the possibly distant time of a damaging earthquake. So there  are huge profits being made in this line of insurance.  </P> <P> But, she also noted, since the reserves are held down, it is unlikely that many  companies would have the wherewithal at the time to cope with paying for the  damages caused by a truly major quake.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TENTATIVE ROLLBACK ORDERS  </P> <P>  The following figures represent the state Department of Insurance's assessment  of what rate rollbacks for individual insurance companies should be under Prop.  103. Figures focus on four primary areas of coverage. Percentage figures  indicate the percentage of premiums that would be returned based on present  prices. Money figures in millions of dollars. The figures are subject to being  contested by the companies in hearings that will begin in September. Final  orders could be appealed to the courts.  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.44IN:2.00IN:2.22IN:2.00IN:1.89IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> COMPANY  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> AUTO  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> HOMEOWNERS  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> QUAKE  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> FIRE  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Allstate  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4.3%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6.9%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 42.3%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3.1%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> or $40.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> or $22.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> or $14.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> or $0.5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Cal.

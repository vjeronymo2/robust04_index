			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chips down for UK Potato Board  -David Blackwell on a scheme that may fall foul of the single market THE UK'S POTATO Marketing Board does not market potatoes. But it does aim to control the supply of potatoes to the UK market under a system which does not sit well with the principles of the Single European Market. Potato growing has not yet been brought within the ambit of the European Community's common agricultural policy, but the European Commission has to bring forward a proposal soon to comply with the Single European Act - it was expected to make an announcement a year ago. All predictions are for a 'light regime', which is highly unlikely to include any kind of quota system or market support measures. The PMB is lobbying hard to keep its supply side scheme, which it claims works in the interests of everyone in the UK potato trade. The great majority of growers favours the scheme. Amid the general talk of plummeting incomes at the recent Oxford Farming Conference, one potato grower was overheard to say that he had just completed his best year ever in farming after paying Pounds 30,000 in levies to the PMB. But the Potato Processors Association, whose members purchase about 25 per cent of the UK crop, is lobbying equally hard against the PMB scheme. The association says it boosts the costs of its members products - such as frozen chips and crisps - and makes them less competitive than producers on the continent. No-one in the UK can grow potatoes on more than 0.4 hectares (or one acre) unless they have acquired 'basic area' from the PMB. Any new grower gets 0.5 hectares on application and can build on that or purchase or lease basic producer. Mr Alasdair Fairbairn, the PMB chief executive, says there is a 'very dynamic market in basic area', both for leasing and purchasing. Growers with basic area pay a levy of Pounds 85.60 a hectare. If they grow too few potatoes they lose some of their basic area the following year; they are entitled to grow excess potatoes, but then must pay ten times the normal levy. The 'target area,' which determines the amount of potatoes grown in the UK, is set about 18 months in advance of the growing season by a joint consultative committee. The committee comprises grower organisations, unions and co-ops, and representatives along the supply chain, including merchants, retailers and consumer organisations. It has an independent chairman. The committee looks at the requirement of the total market, including exports, before setting the target area - 154,000 hectares this year. Mr Fairbairn says that the system means that beyond the farm gate there is a totally free market in the UK, and points out that there are no restrictions on imports. 'We have a terrific system. Prices are market driven. The levy itself at retail level is equal to one-tenth of a penny per lb. This enables us to fund collective advertising, promotion and research and development.' The PMB, which had an income of Pounds 13m last year, wants to maintain a system which it says costs the taxpayer nothing and gives a co-ordinated approach to the industry. Critics of the scheme point out that it dates from the 1930s when there was no potato processing industry. Now a third of potatoes consumed in the UK are in processed form in a market worth Pounds 1.5bn a year. However, only 25 per cent of the UK crop is processed - the difference is made up by imports worth up to Pounds 150m a year, according to the PPA. Potatoes make up about 50 per cent of the cost of frozen chips and dehydrated products and 25 per cent of the cost of crisps. Mr Richard Harris, chairman of the PPA, believes UK processors are paying more for potatoes, putting them at a disadvantage to those in continental Europe. 'You don't have to be an accountant to know that if half the production costs are higher it has a heck of an effect on profitability.' He claims the PMB is exporting both potato acreage and processing capacity, with consequent effects on the balance of payments. He points out that the cost of transporting potatoes across the channel is Pounds 30 to Pounds 35 a tonne, compared with a price of only Pounds 90 a tonne. 'The UK market has that protection. I don't see the need for this protectionist system.' The PMB, however, believes the system is leading to greater efficiency in the UK market. Mr Fairbairn says the number of growers has fallen from 45,000 in 1970 to 17,000 in 1990 as production becomes concentrated in the hands of serious professional growers who are on the right soil types and have invested heavily in mechanisation. Yields have also risen steadily, Mr Fairbairn says. He thinks the PMB growers would survive in a free-for-all. But there is overwhelming support to retain the system of collective forecasting and balancing in order to avoid swings in price that the PMB believes could damage the heavy per capita consumption of fresh potatoes achieved in the UK. The European Commission is apparently still a long way from a decision on potatoes. While a lightweight regime is generally expected, it is 'not a foregone conclusion that the PMB will be abolished,' according to one official.</p>

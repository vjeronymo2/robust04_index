			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Arts: Fine crafts reach the capital The applied arts are the poor relations of the exhibition circuit - invariably confined to the provinces and constricted by a lack of cash. Of the thousands of shows staged in London over the last decade, the only memorable exhibitions of western works of art that spring to my mind are the V&amp;A's Rococo: Art &amp; Design in Hogarth's England (1984), Paul de Lamerie at the Goldsmiths' Hall in 1990 and the in-house celebration of George IV's Carlton House at the Queen's Gallery three years ago. And characteristically, it took a collaboration between the Liverpool Museums and a commercial furniture dealer, Blairman's, to re-establish the reputation of the extraordinary George Bullock as one of the greatest cabinet-makers and designers that England has produced, in an exemplary show in 1988. By refreshing contrast, a number of promising shows of objects and applied arts are scheduled for London in the New Year. The first, at the Royal Academy from January 20, presents highlights from the choice, idiosyncratic and wide-ranging collection of antiquities amassed by George Ortiz. In an age in which any rich-ish professional calls himself a collector, it is heartening to discover that the rare breed of connoisseur is not quite extinct. A quite different taste is exhibited at the V&amp;A when over 350 pieces produced by the House of Faberge, Imperial Jewellers, go on show, courtesy of the Hermitage and the Faberge Arts Foundation of Washington DC (January 26-April 10). From February 16, the museum is also host to The Golden Age 1730-1760: Brass Inlaid furniture by John Channon and his Contemporaries, a show which originated from that powerhouse of furniture history, Temple Newsam House in Leeds. What should be the exhibition to go and see in 1994 is the V&amp;A's monographic study of one of the most profoundly influential figures of the 19th century, AWN Pugin, the father of the Gothic Revival. Pugin: A Gothic Passion (June 15-September 11) takes up the perhaps unenviable challenge of presenting the great Goth as architect and designer of everything from furniture and metalwork to silver, ceramics, jewellery, textiles, wallpaper and stage sets.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pakistan has expressed its concern over the Indian  decision to deploy Prithvi and Agni missiles. A spokesman of  the Foreign Office, while briefing newsmen in Islamabad today,  said that Pakistan has informed the Missile Technology Control  Regime countries, including USA, that the Indian decision will  further aggravate the threat to peace and security in South Asia  and unleash a specter of nuclear missile race in the region. He  hoped that the world community will prevail upon India to stop  this reckless move.    The spokesman said India has increased violations of the  Line  of Control and its helicopters had twice infiltrated into the  territory of Azad Jammu and Kashmir on the 5th of this month.  He said three innocent civilians had been killed and five  wounded by Indian firing during the last two weeks.    Referring to the recent spate of baseless allegations  leveled  by India regarding Pakistan's involvement in occupied Kashmir,  the spokesman said this would further heighten tension between  the two countries. In fact, the spokesman said, India was  engaged in spreading terrorism in Pakistan. Pakistani troops  had recently arrested two armed terrorists from Kotli sector,  trained by India to carry out sabotage activities in Pakistan.  Fifty-two kg of explosives was recovered from them.    The spokesman said that 2,000 Pakistani troops would be  deployed in Bosnia-Herzegovina by June this year under UN  auspices. He said 40 of them are being trained in Germany,  while rest of the contingent is getting training in  Czechoslovakia [as heard] with German equipment.</p>

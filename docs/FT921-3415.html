			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / International Company News: Orkla pre-tax profits halved at NKr601m ORKLA, the Norwegian group with interests ranging from paper to food and drinks, has revealed 1991 pre-tax profits of NKr601m (Dollars 91.6m), or half the level achieved the previous year. The group, which last June merged with Nora Industrier, took a NKr236m non-recurring charge against plant closures and goodwill. It also suffered a NKr165m share portfolio loss. Group operating revenue rose to NKr16.13bn from NKr15.46bn, while operating profit dropped to NKr863m from NKr911m. Orkla said that, with the exception of snacks, all branded food and drink goods had improved operating margins. However, negative market developments for pulp affected the wood processing division. A dividend of NKr3.75 a share is declared, and a one-for-10 bonus issue is proposed. Norske Skog, the pulp and paper producer, posted a decline in net profits to NKr370m for 1991, against NKr959m the previous year. The company warned that 1992 profits would fall further. A change in accounting principles has given Norske Skog extra one-off income of NKr110m. Vital Forsikring, the Norwegian insurance group, reported 1991 profit, before year-end adjustments, down 53 per cent at NKr718m. Vital explained that the figures for the last two years were not directly comparable due to changes in collective premium rates. The dividend is being held at NKr4.75 a share. Superfos, the Danish grain and fodder, construction, packaging and chemicals group, said that profits after non-recurring items and tax had fallen from DKr177m (Dollars 27.2m) to DKr126m. Sales dipped from DKr6.88bn to DKr6.64bn, primarily because of disposals. An unchanged dividend of DKr90 a share is proposed.</p>

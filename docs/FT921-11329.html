			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Yeltsin likely to act to speed foreign investment PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin is expected to issue a decree setting out rules for foreign investors to exploit Russian mineral wealth. The decree will act as a substitute for long-awaited legislation on mineral rights and allow foreigners to operate concessions - gaining ownership of up to 50 per cent of the output of a given area. It will seek to clear the way for rapid western investment to revive Russia's flagging oil and gas industry, circumventing a delay of months while bills make their way through parliament. Meanwhile, Mr Viktor Danilov-Danilian, minister for ecology and natural resources, brushed aside opposition to a deal with a US-Japanese consortium for a feasibility study of oil and gas reserves off Sakhalin Island. He said that Mr Valentin Fiodorov, the local governor, had no sound reason to criticise the deal and suggested he would be sacked if he caused trouble. Moscow and the three western companies - McDermott International, Marathon Oil and Mitsui and Co - would decide later whether to exploit the reserves through a joint venture, production-sharing or a concession. The minister said that the consortium may still admit two of the defeated parties in the tender - Mobil, of the US, and Japan's Sodeco.</p>

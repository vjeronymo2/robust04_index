			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Li Wei (2621 0251)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 9 Jun (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- China's  Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen told ROK Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu this morning: China holds that two basic  targets should be set for the settlement of the issue of North  Korea's nuclear fuel, that is, promoting denuclearization in the  Korean peninsula and safeguarding peace and stability there.  China considers these two targets are in conformity with the  fundamental interests of all countries in northeast Asia.    The Chinese and ROK foreign ministers held a working meeting  here this morning. Han Sung-chu gave an account of the recent  new developments of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.  Qian Qichen expounded China's views on the current situation.    Thanks to efforts made by various parties, Qian Qichen said  that the situation at the previous stage had developed in a  positive direction. Because of differences between the  International Atomic Energy Agency and the DPRK on inspections  of the nuclear fuel rods, the situation had deteriorated. China  is deeply concerned about the situation.    In the face of the current difficulties, Qian Qichen pointed  out that the parties concerned should, in particular, keep calm  and remain restrained and should not shut the door to  negotiations.    Qian said that China had appealed to the parties concerned  to  continue to make efforts to restart talks to leave room for the  possibility of a settlement of the issue.    Qian also pointed out that sanctions would not help solve  the  problem. On the contrary, they might lead to consequences which  no one wished to see.    Han Sung-chu arrived in Beijing on the evening of 8 June for  a working visit. He will leave for home on the afternoon of 9  June.</p>

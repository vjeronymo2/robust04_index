			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Bullish motor talk hides doubt: Commercial vehicle sales are curiously low AMID all the bullish talk of recovery in the motor trade one discordant question remains: why are commercial vehicle sales still so low? Last month's 11.9 per cent rise in new-car registrations was greeted with joy. But the market's apparently strong upturn from one of its steepest declines on record is not consistent. Sales of commercial vehicles are still below those of last year - itself the worst sales year since the 1950s. Commercial vehicles are bought not on whim or sentiment but to transport goods. Their purchase, therefore, might be regarded as an accurate indicator of economic activity. Statistics released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show that commercial vehicle sales of 14,735 in June were 8.91 per cent lower than in the corresponding month last year. Sales fell by 5.15 per cent compared with the first six months of last year. Car sales over the same period rose 9.14 per cent. The decline disguises large variations in demand for different types of vehicle. Truck sales rose 15.35 per cent, compared with a 2.7 per cent fall in sales of medium commercial vehicles typified by Ford's Transit panel van and a 28.55 per cent fall in the sale of light vans. Ford's researchers say that sales of commercial vehicles traditionally have lagged improvements in the rest of the economy. Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford UK, is in no doubt that the new-car market is well into a recovery, although he acknowledges that the pace of revival is not as strong as the raw figures might indicate. The figures have been flattered by the practice of dealers 'pre-registering' cars which have yet to find buyers. The recovery may also have been over-hyped by manufacturers keen to instil some buoyancy into showrooms. Registrations of trucks of over 3.5 tonnes have risen in all but two of the past 11 months, particularly those of heavy trucks over 15 tonnes. The problem for medium commercial vehicles, Mr McAllister suggests, is that much of the demand for them comes from hard-pressed small traders in the construction industry and consumer businesses. 'If the demand is not there within these sectors, no one is going to invest in new commercials. They will do everything they can to extend the life of what they've got,' says Mr McAllister. Customers have not survived the recession. Of the tens of thousands of small businesses that have failed over the past three years, the majority would have been van or light truck operators. Another factor is the receivership of Leyland Daf, Ford's closest rival in the van market, early this year. That may have artificially depressed demand while customers loyal to the marque, including large organisations such as the Post Office, waited to see if it could be salvaged. The share of the panel-van sector held by the reborn Leyland Daf did leap sharply last month, to 14.35 per cent - double its level during the receivership. But this should have added to total demand. Instead, total panel-van sales in June were down by 2.77 per cent compared with the same, severely depressed month last year, contributing to a 6.76 per cent drop for the first half of the year. Mr Allan Amey, Leyland Daf Vans' managing director, only sees 'hopeful' signs that the economy is picking up and that 'this will be reflected in the second half with demand beginning to increase again'. Professor Garel Rhys, an independent industry analyst at Cardiff Business School and adviser to the Commons trade and industry committee, suggests that the recovery in heavy truck sales partly reflects the fact that these are used primarily for long-distance haulage. Some of these ageing, long-haul fleets are already overdue for replacement. Demand may be helped by the fact that these vehicles tend to be operated primarily by larger companies possibly better attuned to early economic stirrings. 'That smaller companies, the van buyers, clearly want more evidence that the upturn is under way is indicative of the brittleness of the recovery,' Prof Rhys suggests. He adds that there should not be too much scepticism about recovery in the car market. The company sector has held up better than the private car market, he points out. But even though private consumers are holding back from daunting decisions in the housing market, 'one of the results is that many have a lot of money in their pockets and have begun consoling themselves with a new car instead'. Partly as a result he expects that total new-car sales this year will be 'at least 1.7m' - a 7 per cent rise on last year's 1.59m, accelerating to 1.8m next year. But he and other analysts warn that the car market recovery, and the industry's reviving profitability, could not withstand a significant further worsening in continental Europe's economic plight. Ominously, statistics this week showed a 17.2 per cent plunge in European new-car sales.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                  UK COMMERCIAL VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS                           JANUARY-JUNE 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Volume     Volume      Share (%)     Share (%)                        (Units)  Change (%)   Jan-June 93   Jan-June 92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Market*           97,217    -5.16        100.00        100.00 Imports                 38,552    +8.58         39.66         34.64  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Small vans (up to 1.8 tonnes) Total                   30,501    -6.17        100.00        100.00 Imports                 10,578   +71.72         34.68         18.95 Ford                    14,310    +3.82         46.92         42.40 Vauxhall (GM)            9,627   -11.62         31.56         33.51 Peugeot (incl.

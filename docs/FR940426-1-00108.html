			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA also requests comments on the regulatory language proposed in this notice. Are there any safety belt designs that adjust to fit a wide range of occupants but which might not be considered as complying with this proposal? Is there any design that could fall within the language of the proposal but which a commenter believes should not be allowed because it does not fit a sufficiently wide variety of occupants? NHTSA requests that commenters address both why a design does (or doesn't) comply with the proposed requirements and why the design should (or shouldn't) be allowed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA discussed in the ANPRM the increased number of complaints concerning safety belt fit in recent years. The agency stated improving safety belt fit should increase belt usage and that increased usage would, in turn, yield safety benefits. At the same time, the agency noted that there might be adverse safety consequences if belts were not adjusted by each successive user to provide the appropriate fit. NHTSA asked whether it was possible to quantify the benefits of a rule on improved safety belt fit, and specifically whether any relevant studies or other data were available. The agency did not receive any data or analysis regarding the issue of benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, NHTSA again asks commenters to address this issue. Would the rule lead to an increase in belt usage? Would the rule result in a reduction in belt misuse? For example, would it reduce the instances in which occupants place the shoulder belt portion of a lap/shoulder belt behind their backs or under their arms? What would be the net effect of the rule on safety? What relevant studies and data exist? For example, do vehicle manufacturers have any information showing a decrease in complaints about safety belt fit after vehicle models have been equipped with adjustable shoulder belts?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA believes that occupants need to have information available on the proper use of belt adjustment devices. However, NHTSA also believes that the new labeling requirements for air bags should be the focus for information in the vehicle. Therefore, NHTSA is not proposing a requirement to label vehicles but is proposing instead to require information instructions on proper use in the owner's manual for vehicles with manually adjustable belts. Because the occupant does not have to take any action to ensure proper fit, devices which provide automatic adjustment, including integrated seats, would not need such instructions. In addition, NHTSA is not proposing specific language for this requirement as NHTSA believes that manufacturers are in the best position to determine the best means of providing this information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If adopted, the agency proposes to make this amendment effective September 1, 1996. NHTSA believes many vehicles, currently or in the near future, will comply with this safety belt comfort and fit requirement to satisfy consumer demand. Additionally, this date is concurrent with the beginning of the required phase-in of manual safety belts and air bags. Manufacturers will be able to take advantage of the redesign process necessary for the air bag requirement to also make any design changes necessary to comply with this safety belt fit requirement. Considering these two factors, the agency believes that two years leadtime would be sufficient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

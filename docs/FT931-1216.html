			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Japan set to restrict Euroyen issue access JAPAN'S ministry of finance is poised to tighten its grip on placements of yen-denominated corporate bonds issued overseas by clamping down on Japanese purchases of Euroyen bonds. The decision is seen as an attempt to protect the country's fledgling corporate bond market, which is currently sagging under the surge of domestic straight bond issues. The move could also depress the number of yen bonds issued in the Eurobond markets by Japanese companies as the restriction on placement may lead to higher issuance costs. The ministry has tried to keep Eurobonds offshore by prohibiting yen bonds issued overseas from entering the country for the first 90 days of issuance. Japanese securities houses have found their way around the restrictions, however, by agreeing to hold the bonds for three months before selling the paper off to Japanese investors at the issuing price. Foreign criticism has been rising over the lack of transparency of the agreements between Japanese brokers and investors. The ministry may now start monitoring the placement of Euroyen bonds to prevent the 'warehousing' of bonds. Buying Eurobonds has allowed Japanese investors to avoid paying withholding tax, so increasing the returns on investments. Japanese brokers and overseas underwriting affiliates of Japanese banks will be seriously affected by the ministry's restrictions. Japanese brokers, which have turned to overseas bonds as an important source of income following the sharp fall in profits due to the sluggish Tokyo stock market, will be especially hard hit. After Japanese companies were permitted to raise money on the Euroyen bond markets in 1990, they issued Y3,130bn in 1991 and Y2,800bn last year. One US investment banker welcomed the move, saying it would 'cleanse' the Euroyen bond market, making prices and trading less artificial.</p>

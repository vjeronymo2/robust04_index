			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Skills fear over Tecs' policies THE NATIONWIDE supply of skilled electricians is being jeopardised by the local emphasis of Training and Enterprise Councils, according to the Electrical Contractors' Association, the main supplier of trained electricians. The association provides a broad-based national training programme through a joint training organisation with the unions. However, the 82 Tecs in England and Wales have different priorities for what they perceive as local skills needs and this is reflected in the amounts they offer to employers to take on young people under the Youth Training programme. The association said that the amount offered to employers by Tecs varied from Pounds 15 to Pounds 40 a week, making it much less attractive in some areas for employers to recruit young people. This development, combined with the recession, had resulted in the intake for electrical installation apprentices halving from 4,607 in 1990-91 to 1,770 in 1992-93. There was no organisation, either of Tecs or at government level that was looking at what the UK as a whole needed. Mr Harry Simpson, the association's director, said: 'A consistent, uniform provision of training funding and qualifying procedure on a national basis is essential if this national training initiative and requirement is to be fostered and fulfilled.' The complaint is a common one among trade associations, which have a national perspective of skills needs. Attempts by the associations and industry training organisations to feed their requirements into Tecs' planning procedures have not proved successful. The government has sought to address some other concerns of national training providers which have complained of the bureaucracy of negotiating with up to 82 Tecs. The National Training Partnership is being set up to negotiate funding with Tecs on behalf of the big national providers. Amounts will still vary for the same training, however, and training organisations will still be responsible for providing separate attendance records and other details of each trainee's activities to individual Tecs. Mr Simpson said these procedures absorbed much of the efforts of trainers. Devonport Management, which runs the Devonport Dockyard, Plymouth, will not take on any apprentices this year. Mr Ian Williams, for the company, said this was because of job reductions and a much younger profile of the workforce. The dockyard has taken on up to 50 recruits a year in the past and traditionally has been an important provider of craft and technology training for the region.</p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA;  </P> <P> AZTECS AVOID PADRES, MOVE UTEP GAME  </P> <P> San Diego State has resolved a scheduling conflict with the Padres at San Diego  Jack Murphy Stadium by moving its home football game with Texas El Paso next  season to Nov. 24.  </P> <P> The game had been scheduled to be played Sept. 22, but the Padres took that  Saturday night date for the second of a three-game series with the Cincinnati  Reds.  </P> <P> The switch of the UTEP game to what had been an open date for SDSU was made  this week during the Western Athletic Conference winter meetings in Denver,  Jeff Hurd, the WAC's associate commissioner, said Thursday.  </P> <P> Hurd also said that conference athletic directors voted unanimously to return  to round-robin scheduling in football beginning with the 1991 season. This will  end a scheduling format adopted in 1986, and instituted this past season, that  allowed four schools each season to play seven rather than eight conference  games.  </P> <P> This allowed schools to use the extra date to schedule another nonconference  game, but Hurd said athletic directors were concerned that the uneven number of  conference games put schools at a disadvantage when it came to determining the  WAC champion and the Holiday Bowl berth.  </P> <P> SDSU used the uneven scheduling to eliminate a home-and-home series with  Colorado State for 1989 and 1990. The change will not affect the Aztecs until  1993, when they again would have been permitted to drop a conference game.  </P> <P> The plan still must be approved by the conference presidents at their annual  meeting in June 8-11 in Tucson, Ariz.  </P> <P> In other action, the 1991 conference basketball tournament was awarded to  Wyoming. CURT HOLBREICHFOOTBALL Hollywood is interested in filming a story  about former Vista High and Colorado quarterback Sal Aunese, who died of  inoperable stomach cancer Sept. 23. Beverly Hills agent Ed Hookstratten has  been retained by the Aunese family to represent its dealings with movie studios  interested in the life of the late athlete. "I don't see it being done as a  picture on TV; it's larger than that," Hookstratten said. "It's a theatrical  motion picture and should be handled by the finest in the business." When he  became ill in the spring of 1989, Aunese's teammates dedicated their season to  him, then finished 11-0 and ranked No. 1 nationally. The Buffaloes can win the  national championship by beating Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl on Jan.  1.BASKETBALL Howard Wright, a former Patrick Henry all-county player, returned  to his high school and made his first six shots of the second half to break  open a close game, leading Athletes In Action to a 114-92 exhibition victory  over Christian Heritage College. The former Patriot who went on to play at  Stanford scored a game-high 28 points and had eight rebounds. The Hawks were  led by Mark Kraatz and Brad Soucie, who each had 23 points. Athletes In Action  is now 8-21 and their collegiate tour will end Saturday at Loyola Marymount.  </P></p>

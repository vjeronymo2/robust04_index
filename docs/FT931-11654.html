			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Foreign investors push developing states to margins DEVELOPING countries have been increasingly marginalised by foreign investors over the past decade, with their share of global inflows falling from 25 per cent to 19 per cent, according to an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report, writes David Dodwell, World Trade Editor. Just 10 countries - led by China and Hong Kong, Singapore, Brazil and Mexico  -accounted for three-quarters of the inflow. This occurred at a time when dwindling access to bank lending increased developing countries' reliance on foreign investment. The decade saw Japan emerge as the world's leading foreign investor, with a strong shift towards investment in services and high-technology industries. The report notes that the impetus for a quadrupling of investment from Dollars 48bn in 1981 to an average of Dollars 188bn (Pounds 124.5bn) in 1989 and 1990 was economic growth, market integration, the globalisation of business, the growth of regional economies, and technological innovation. What happens in the 1990s will depend largely on these factors, it adds. International Direct Investment - Policies and Trends in the 1980s. OECD.</p>

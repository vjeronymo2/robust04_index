			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'MISS SAIGON' CASTING FUROR  </P> <P> So Actors' Equity changed its mind ("Actors' Equity Says White Can Portray  Eurasian," Part A, Aug. 17). Big Deal! One must wonder what's become of us when  the matter of perceived racial discrimination in the casting of Broadway shows,  not to mention hiring on other fronts, becomes a fanatical preoccupation among  those whose time and energies should be put to more productive use.  </P> <P> The "Miss Saigon" flap is an excruciatingly embarrassing symbol of misplaced  U.S. priorities. Why must overblown causes such as these supersede the struggle  to correct our nation's seemingly forgotten failings such as deterioration of  our national work ethic and the declining quality of our goods and services?  </P> <P> Producer Cameron Mackintosh's cancellation of his show is a proud reminder to  all of us that hiring the most qualified, efficient and hard-driving person for  the job, any job, is the paramount issue, and that the choice must be at the  discretion of the employer, not the employee. It's more important than ever  during these days when America must play second fiddle to other countries whose  people are more intent on creating the best product and service.  </P> <P> How much longer will protesters ignore that we're beset with serious economic  problems and national recession? Legitimate civil rights issues  notwithstanding, the arrogance and destructive tactics used by militant job  seekers must give way to common sense, the plain and simple matter of economics  and the right of private entrepreneurs to operate their businesses at optimum  levels.  </P> <P> NORMAN JACOBSON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

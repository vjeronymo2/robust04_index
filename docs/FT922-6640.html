			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Farm Reform in Europe: German minister stands his ground against farm lobby GERMANY'S battle-hardened agriculture minister, Mr Ignaz Kiechle, must have known he was on a hiding to nothing. On Tuesday, the German farmers' union demanded that he fight the proposed reforms 'with all his might, and even use his veto if necessary'. So it was hardly a surprise that Baron Constantin von Heereman, president of the German farmers' organisation, the Deutscher Bauernverband (DBV) for the past 23 years, denounced the package yesterday as 'intolerable'. 'We are in favour of reform, but not the one which Kiechle is accepting,' he declared. 'They get a 5 per cent plus wage rise in the public sector, and we get 35 per cent minus for the cereal farmers: it is unacceptable.' That comes on top of a drop in farm incomes in 1990-91 of 16 per cent, and little better than stagnation in the current year, according to official figures. The DBV predicts another real loss of some 21 per cent in 1991-92. For once, however, Mr Kiechle seemed to be standing his ground against his own farming lobby, strongest above all in his native Bavaria. He described the DBV and its members as 'day-dreamers who have no idea of agricultural political necessities'. Mr Kiechle fought his corner in Brussels with his usual tenacity, but the key change in Germany's position was that he did not appear willing to use his veto. Two factors seem to be behind that relaxation in Germany's staunch defence of the CAP: a desire to reach a deal in the Gatt round, above all before the Group of Seven world economic summit in Munich in July, to be chaired by Chancellor Helmut Kohl; and the advent of huge east German farms to German agriculture, requiring a whole new set of policy priorities. German agriculture is no longer so dominated by small farmers - above all by part-time farmers. A whole new category of huge factory farms on the eastern model have now to be taken into consideration. Most are effectively bankrupt now, but they have to be given the incentive to recover. Mr Kiechle wanted a cereal price cut of 15-20 per cent maximum. In that, he was seeking to defend western Germany's relatively small and high-cost farmers, fearful that if the EC support price were dropped too far, they would be unable to compete with French cereal farmers, themselves driven out of the export market. He has been forced to accept a 29 per cent cut, although he will be allowed to pay substantial compensation to his farmers. Germany was happy to go along with Britain in calling for the compensation to be paid to big farms as well as small - thanks to the existence of the eastern farms. The compensation comes in two ways: Mr Kiechle has won the right to keep paying income support measures this year to replace the 3 per cent VAT rebate which expired last year. That is a German national measure - a clear distortion of the agricultural common market, and therefore an important concession. The second form of compensation is that payable to all EC farmers in exchange for a 15 per cent reduction in their arable land. Mr Kiechle was determined that the payments should be allowed for an indefinite period. But even then, his farmers are suspicious. 'The farmers are naturally sceptical about whether the compensation will be lasting,' an Agriculture Ministry official said yesterday. 'Lasting could mean five years, or it could mean 10 years.' Or as one diplomatic observer of German agriculture put it: 'The farmers know they are being paid to do nothing. That is a very vulnerable position to be in.' The EC reforms bring German agriculture face to face with some unpleasant realities. 'They have to restructure their agriculture and lower their overheads,' an independent analyst said. 'That means they are going to have to go further down the road towards the industrialisation of agriculture - which is anathema to Mr Kiechle.' The irony is that perhaps Mr Kiechle will not be around to implement it. He is widely expected to be a casualty of the next cabinet reshuffle in the autumn, finally abandoned by his friend and admirer, Chancellor Kohl, in the interests, no doubt of 'agricultural, political necessities'.</p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM urges swift Gatt deal A DEAL on the Uruguay round of trade liberalisation talks would make 'the single biggest contribution' possible towards world economic recovery, Mr John Major said yesterday. Amid calls from many Tory backbench MPs for lower interest rates or a sterling devaluation to revitalise the UK economy, Mr Major stressed the importance he attaches to free trade when he reported on last week's Munich summit of leading industrial nations. He betrayed his frustration that a deal had not been possible last week and, in a jibe at countries he believes are blocking a settlement, said: 'With the right political instruction, the negotiators could very swiftly reach a settlement.' The stumbling block to a deal on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) remains a dispute between the European Community and the US over farm subsidies. France, in particular, wants the US to respond positively to recent reforms in the EC common agriculture policy. A settlement of the Gatt would 'give a sharp non-inflationary boost to the world economy,' Mr Major said. Shrugging off his failure to strike a deal, Mr Major said he made 'no apology for putting it high on the agenda at Munich'. A Gatt agreement would boost world annual income by Dollars 195bn (Pounds 101.4bn) of which more than Dollars 90bn would go to developing and former communist countries. However he faced ridicule from Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour leader, for the 'ineffectual results' of the summit. Mr Kinnock said: 'It would be sensible now to suspend G7 meetings until the leaders of the seven of the strongest economies in the world are willing to take action which is significant enough to live up to the splendour of the summit occasions.' He complained there were no proposals for the co-ordinated growth policies needed if the world economy was not to sink into prolonged stagnation. Mr Major admitted that there had been 'some successes and some disappointments' in Munich.</p>

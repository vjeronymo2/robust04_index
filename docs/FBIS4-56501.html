			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Elena Gallegos and Emilio Lomas] </F>   [Text] At noon yesterday, making his first statements as  National Public Security Coordinator, Arsenio Farell Cubillas  said this new office has been created because emerging  circumstances in the country make it necessary to strengthen the  legal regime "essential for safeguarding public peace."    Farell met with the media in the Carranza Room of the Los  Pinos presidential residence. He was accompanied by Attorney  General Diego Valades and Federal District Prosecutor Humberto  Benitez Trevino. Valades said the new office "is a noble  project." Benitez commented this is an efficacious response to  the people's rightful demand for security.    The coordinator discussed the need for citizens to cooperate  with the authorities in preventing and fighting crime. He  reiterated what was said Monday during the announcement of the  creation of the new office, that it will establish avenues for  communication with the Secretariats of Government and Defense,  the Navy, the Federal District, and state governments in  "working to safeguard public order." Farell said his office  will try to forge links among security corps so that they become  more effective in both preventive tasks and the fight against  crime.    The coordinator said the most adequate course will be sought  to determine the guidelines and actions that must be undertaken  by offices directly or indirectly in charge of matters having a  bearing on public security.    Referring to Valades and Benitez, who were at his side,  Farell said both are "old friends who have told me they want to  cooperate enthusiastically in this endeavor which will  strengthen peace in Mexico."    Valades and Benitez spoke later, after being introduced by  Jose Carreno Carlon, the director general of the Presidency's  Public Relations Office. Valades said he will work  enthusiastically on the mission the president assigned to Farell  for the sake of the country's security. He noted: "As an aide to  the president of the country, as a public official, a citizen,  and an attorney, I am convinced of this project's worthiness and  of the need for establishing efficient coordination mechanisms."    As Valades sees it, "no one better than an illustrious  attorney, a distinguished public figure, an eminent teacher, and  an outstanding Mexican could lead this coordination effort." He  continued referring to Farell by noting: "He will have all my  support and that of all officials in the Attorney General's  Office."    Immediately thereafter, Federal District Attorney General  Humberto Benitez Trevino spoke in more or less the same terms as  Valades. He pledged to support Farell "so the people will have  what they deserve and are demanding: more and better security."    Benitez Trevino said: "Our chief, President Salinas, has  appointed Arsenio Farell, an exceptional Mexican, a man of law,  an impeccable public servant, and an accredited university  professor. He is the best guarantee that the inhabitants of the  entire country will have the improved security which they are  rightfully demanding."    Thus concluded the Public Security coordinator's brief  presentation to the news media. Later, reporters received  copies of the agreement whereby the new office was created,  which was published yesterday in the DIARIO OFFIICAL DE LA  FEDERACION [official gazette].    The agreement establishes that it will be the coordinator's  duty to: coordinate national public security actions established  by the federal executive in accordance with applicable laws;  establish mechanisms for the Attorney General's Office of the  republic and the attorney general in the Federal District to  adequately and efficiently fulfill their duties; and to propose  pertinent measures and establish agreements with the state  attorney generalships on national public security matters.    The presidential agreement also points out that the  coordinator will propose and establish efficient and timely  channels of communication between the aforementioned  institutions to safeguard national public security; it will  coordinate and follow up on the agreements that are reached by  the National Security Cabinet, sending them to the president of  the republic for consideration and to ensure their fulfillment.  The coordinator will also carry out duties entrusted to him  expressly by the federal executive.    Finally, the agreement establishes that federal  administration departments and institutions will provide, in a  timely manner, the coordinator with the information and support  he may require to fulfill his duties.</p>

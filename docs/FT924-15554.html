			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Food and Drink: My kind of place in the Big Apple - Grand Hotels / Jancis Robinson stays at the Lowell and Nicholas Lander at the Mark in New York IF YOU listened to all the advice from Gerry Frank, author of the invaluable Where to find it, buy it, eat it in New York you may never stay in that fascinating city. Do not, he advises, give out your room number to strangers, charge calls to your room or touch anything in the refrigerator. And, in the present depressed climate, do not accept the quoted room rates. All kinds of deals are possible. Many of the city's newer hotels were planned in happier times. You can choose from: Essex House, Mercer, St Regis or Ian Schrager's trio, Morgan's, Royalton or the Paramount. And, as befits a city where the dollar is king, the competition is fierce, particularly between two sumptuous hotels situated within a block of New York's greatest natural asset, Central Park. THE LOWELL It is rare to encounter a hotel bed you would happily substitute for your own back home but I did, last May in Manhattan, in suite 14B of the Lowell, a determinedly small, discreet hotel on the Upper East Side that is part-British owned. It is significant that the Lowell is the only member of the French-based Relais &amp; Chateaux hotel and restaurant group to be found in New York City. Its decor and spirit are deliberate throwbacks to a quiet but grander age. One friend told me she had seen Mickey Rourke in the tiny lobby, another that New York's most eligible bachelor (ie a recently divorced billionaire) had taken up residence there. European guests tend to be FT readers, I noted in the chintzy first-floor Pembroke Room which the management consciously dedicates to power breakfasts. In many ways the Lowell is indeed the antithesis of the American hotel stereotype. One can not only open the windows but, in 10 of the 48 suites, walk out on to one's own balcony and marvel at the proximity of Central Park (and the paucity of roof gardens). The grumbling mini-bar is replaced by a kitchen larger and better equipped than the average resident New Yorker's (although the equipment in mine was tellingly unused). TV screens have to be sought out inside Chinese lacquer chests and mahogany tallboys. Gideon's bible may well be augmented by five shelves full of books such as 21 Sure Fire Ways To As Much As Double Your Money. Rooms are deliberately furnished with desks large enough to accommodate a raft of company reports and one king-bedded suite, surely not aimed at Europeans, even has its own separate gym, CD system, woodfire, dining area, two bathrooms, three TVs and seven telephones (two fewer than the presidential suite). In the same building is the Post House restaurant and bar, famous for its steaks, wine list and clubby atmosphere, particularly during immediately post-Wall Street hours. A useful place, but not for impoverished female vegetarians. Room rate from Dollars 260 (Pounds 152) for one of their four singles but Dollars 520 (Pounds 304) for a one-bedroomed suite such as 14B. The Lowell Hotel, 28 East 63 St, New York. Tel: (212) 838 1400, fax (212) 319 4230. THE MARK In any part of what Americans succinctly call the hospitality business first impressions are vital - perhaps none more so than in an hotel after a transatlantic flight and an even bumpier cab ride. Here was the first of The Mark's attractions, their Head Doorman. During my five-day stay the doorman whispered an instantaneous weather report, never failed to give me a smile and immediately knew where I could conveniently buy the FT. The hotel's physical charm stems from the fact that it was originally a residency building, built in 1926 and known as the Hyde Park, and converted into an hotel five years ago as the New York flagship of the Munich-based Rafael Group. My room had all the amenities that corporate good taste and the big budgets of the 1980s could buy. The finishing touch was a pair of extremely comfortable leather slippers left by the bed on the first night. The Mark has invested heavily in its restaurant. The chef Philippe Boulot, born in Normandy, has worked with two of Paris's most famous chefs, Robuchon and Senderens. Raymond Bickson, the general manager, was born in Hawaii, educated at the Goethe Institute in Berlin and Cornell University and was consultant to the Peace Hotel in Shanghai. Bickson and Boulot bring a very cosmopolitan air to what is an intimate, although occasionally sombre, dining room. They have organised a diverse sequence of dinners with wine producers from California, France, Germany and Portugal, for which they charge reasonable prices (from Dollars 50-Dollars 70 including wines), and built up a first-class wine list. But they also know what is going on in the Big Apple. When an early morning appointment took me down to Wall Street they told me to call in for breakfast at Florent (69 Gansevoort Street, 989-5779). Originally a coffee shop straight out of an Edward Hopper painting, Florent is now a cafe/restaurant open 24 hours and run by a Frenchman. At the bottom of his menu is a phrase all hoteliers would love to copy: 'We are pleased to accept cash only.' The Mark, Madison Avenue, East 77th Street. Tel: 212-744-4300, fax 212-744-2749. Rooms from Dollars 265 plus taxes.</p>

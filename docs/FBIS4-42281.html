			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Ilnur Cevik: "We Need Some Sincerity From the </F> Congress"]    [Text] There is a growing Western offensive against Turkey  on the lack of human rights in our country. We have warned  numerous times in the past that Turkey's human rights record is  dismal and that those in power have to do something urgently to  correct this situation. The authorities have preferred to turn  a deaf ear to our warnings, and we have reached a stage where  Turkey can no longer pretend to be a select member of the  community of civilized nations and still fail to take action to  correct its human rights image.    Recently the American Congress joined the Western offensive,  linking U.S. aid to Turkey to human rights and the Cyprus  question. We feel this is very mistaken.    Cyprus is not only a very sensitive subject for Turks but it  is also a national issue, and any external pressures, especially  from the American Congress, will only sharpen the feeling of  Turks that they are unjustly being persecuted.    This coupling of Cyprus with human rights will only be  counter-productive, even for those of us who are trying to  promote human rights in Turkey. People will feel we are  cooperating with those who are trying to force concessions on  Cyprus, under the guise of talking about human rights. We are  the ones who complain about the lack of human rights. Yet we  also would like to remind our friends on Capital Hill that human  rights in Turkey does not only mean Kurdish rights, but the  rights of all the citizen of the Turkish Republic who are facing  repression and intimidation.    The citizens of Turkey are facing serious hardships in the  midst of a guerrilla war, and those living in the western areas  of the country often see their rights being violated, even  though they do not live in the trouble spots....    We feel that people on Capital Hill should show sincere  concern about human rights and the lack of freedoms in Turkey,  and set aside Cyprus and Kurdish rights. There are writers who  go to jail simply for expressing their views. There are people  who disappear while in custody. This happens in major cities,  not in the Kurdish-dominated trouble spots of southeastern  Turkey.    If the congressmen stop using Cyprus and eliminate a degree  of bias, then their actions to promote human rights in Turkey  will take on a more sincere dimension.    We are aware that friends of Turkey abroad are also hard  pushed to defend our country, in view of its unfavorable human  rights image. It is about time we started doing something  ourselves to eliminate these deficiencies in our democracy and  take our rightful place among the community of civilized nations.</p>

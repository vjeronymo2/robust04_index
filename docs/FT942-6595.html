			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Brussels to reformulate social policy The European Commission is looking for 'a new balance between what is economically necessary and socially desirable' in formulating a social policy for the next decade, according to Mr Padraig Flynn, social affairs commissioner. There is likely to be less Euro-legislation, and less focus on labour law, the main area of controversy between the UK and its partners and between employers and trade unions. The emphasis will be on 'the quality, not the quantity of our legislative action', and on improving labour conditions through higher productivity, the commissioner forecast, as Brussels finalises its preparation of a new White Paper on social policy for July. 'We are looking for new ways to reconcile the twin objectives of economic growth and social progress - a new European model,' Mr Flynn said. Winding up a three-day seminar on Saturday in preparation for the White Paper, he rebuked those who saw competitiveness purely in terms of lower labour costs. 'We need to recognise that, yes, wealth creation is essential to pay for social progress, but also that the social environment is an integral part of the competitive formula,' Mr Flynn said. 'The fixation of some with the labour cost side of the equation is one-dimensional,' he added. 'What counts is productivity, and the social environment. . . is a key factor in determining that.' He said he hoped that the Commission's revamped directive for elected works councils in large trans-European companies - opposed by the UK and criticised by Unice, the Euro-employers' lobby - would be adopted by EU social affairs and labour ministers on June 22. The directive would not in theory affect companies in the UK, by virtue of Britain's opt-out from the Maastricht treaty's social chapter. But Mr Flynn nevertheless looked forward to a period of consolidation to follow the already flagging activist phase of EU social policy, to cover the jobless as well as those in work. The top priority would be job creation, and Mr Flynn called for the pursuit of higher labour standards through a new commitment by both sides of industry to 'high productivity, high quality, and high value added'. But he underlined that the European Union remained committed to 'a level playing field of agreed minimum standards' for workers, as the corollary to the Single Market and fair competition within it. Attempts by the UK to dilute that would be resisted, he warned. 'If we cannot progress as 12, then we will be obliged to progress as 11 rather than stand still or move backwards,' he said, citing as an example the works council directive - the first measure under the Maastricht social chapter.</p>

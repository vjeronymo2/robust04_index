			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 11 Apr (PAP)--A period of confrontation in  Europe has not been followed by major changes. There is a  chance for a peaceful solution of problems, but swift actions  and brave decisions are needed. The United States has the  greatest responsibility for the future, President Lech Walesa  said today, when greeting U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe  Talbott at the Belweder Palace.    According to the president, a chance exists for building  unity in Europe, and, "acting together with the United States,  we might achieve splendid victories." "It is the United States  that is the most important in the battleground at present," Lech  Walesa said. Poland is concerned with the remnants of communism  and the Warsaw Pact, although, according to the president, there  are no major threats.    Lech Walesa underscored that West Europe maintains its  position and NATO is not expanding. "We have been struggling  for 50 years with millions of victims and great financial  costs," he said. Poland has devoted the past four years to the  search. No great structural changes have been made, and life  cannot stand a vacuum, Lech Walesa argued.</p>

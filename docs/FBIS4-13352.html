			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah Hammudah and Hamud Munsir: "General </F> People's Congress Denies Sanaa Alliance With al-Turabi  Conference and Brotherhood"]    [Excerpt] London, Sanaa -- 'Abd-al-Salam al-'Anasi, head of  the general department in the Yemeni General People's Congress  [GPC], has denied reports of the arrival in Sanaa of delegations  from Arab and international Islamic movements "to discuss an  alliance formula with the GPC led by Yemeni President 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih and the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG]," the  northern partners in the ruling coalition in Yemen, in the face  of a so-called "Egyptian alliance with the Yemeni Socialist  Party [YSP] against extremist organizations."    He made this statement following information supplied to  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT by well-informed sources, namely that Sanaa  received a delegation from the West German-based Muslim  Brotherhood's international organization based in West Germany  and a delegation from the Khartoum-based Arab Islamic [Popular]  Conference [AIPC] led by Dr. Hasan al-Turabi.    The sources added that the two delegations met with  President  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and expressed willingness to support Sanaa  in its dispute with the Aden-based YSP.    The sources said that the proposal for the Muslim  Brotherhood  international organization to cooperate with the Yemeni  leadership "is limited to the ideological aspect" and includes  moving the headquarters of an Islamic studies center and a  European-based Islamic magazine to Sanaa, in addition to  appointing Faris al-Saqqaf, member of the YRG Higher Committee,  as the magazine's chief editor and providing expertise to  contribute to the battle against the YSP.    As for the AIPC's proposal, the sources said that it  "stresses the need to prepare for a military battle to secure a  jihad atmosphere that helps to polarize Islamic mujahidin from  all over the world in order to wage a war against the YSP and  prevent it from returning to secularism." The sources added  that AIPC representatives cited in their proposal what they  termed "Egypt's supply of military and security experts to Aden."    Yemeni television's Channel 2, which transmits from Aden,  has  launched a media campaign against "extremism in the name of  Islam."    AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT could not get in touch with Faris  al-Saqqaf  yesterday evening, as he was busy with the YRG Higher Committee  meeting. However, 'Abd-al-Salam al-'Anasi pointed out that  these reports "are part of the media leaks which the YSP has  begun to use in the framework of a new shift in its media  rhetoric to manage the Yemeni crisis." Al-'Anasi said that 'Ali  Salim al-Bid, Yemeni vice president and secretary general of the  YSP, and Salim Salih Muhammad, member of the Presidential  Council and assistant secretary general of the YSP, "said  recently that they had uncovered a political Islam plan in Yemen  against the democratic unionist plan -- which is untrue and has  nothing to do with political reality in Yemen." He expressed  his amazement at the YSP's use of this card "to win the West  over against political forces currently allied with it in  power." [passage omitted]</p>

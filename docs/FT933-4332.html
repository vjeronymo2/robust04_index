			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Observer: Noses out of joint Rupert Pennant-Rea, new deputy governor of the Bank of England and erstwhile editor of the Economist magazine, is at last putting his famous reforming zeal into practice. Senior bank staff are in mourning because he has announced the abolition of the Golden Trough. This is the nickname of the dining room on the fourth floor of the Bank reserved exclusively for 35 senior officials, including the department heads. The only identifying mark on the door is a big 'private' sign. It was set up in the 1930s to allow the chief cashier, who then acted as Bank chief executive, to keep in touch with the officer class. Since then it has become, in the words of one stricken official, 'a wonderful perk'. However, Pennant-Rea believes that such privileges are divisive and old-fashioned. From January the executives will have to troop across Lothbury to the staff canteen in King's Arms Yard and eat with the other ranks. He is also making the canteen more egalitarian by abolishing a separate area reserved for principals, the rank below senior officials. However, Pennant-Rea himself will be able to avoid rubbing shoulders with the troops over lunch. The directors' private dining room is to be retained.</p>

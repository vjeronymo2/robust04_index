			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Henderson lifted to Pounds 17m despite 6% fall in funds HENDERSON Administration, the fund management group, yesterday announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 17m for the 12 months to March 31, an increase of 7.3 per cent on the previous year. This was achieved despite a 6 per cent fall in funds under its management. However, directors said that 'the outflow has now slowed down', while the subsequent strong post-election performance of UK markets had provided a 'useful boost' to funds under management. They said the upswing in investor confidence following the general election would boost their business, and Henderson was considering further acquisitions and joint ventures to follow the establishment of Henderson Venture Managers, which manages unquoted investments, and its 25 per cent stake in Sabre, a futures manager. Mr Jeremy Edwards, group managing director, said: 'I do see us acquiring other fund management businesses if they would be a good fit with us and if the price is right.' Investment performance had improved slightly, despite the fall in the overall value of funds under management. The company hopes to use this to bid for more pension fund management business, an area where it lost revenue following poor investment performance in 1987 and 1988. Operating expenses were reduced slightly, from Pounds 33.9m to Pounds 33m, allowing a 40 per cent increase in operating profit from Pounds 7.23m to Pounds 10.1m. A final dividend of 28.5p (27.5p) is recommended, to give a total of 41p, up from 37.5p the previous year. Earnings per share were 54.3p, up from 49.7p. Henderson's share price dropped on the news, falling from 760p to 745p.</p>

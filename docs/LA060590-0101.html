			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> 'RECALL' TOTALLY OUTDISTANCES 'FUTURE' IN BOX-OFFICE RACE;  </P> <P> MOVIES: SCHWARZENEGGER'S SCI-FI FLICK OPENS WITH $25.5 MILLION. BUT IT ONLY  JUST EDGES THE 'TURTLES' ' $25.3-MILLION RECORD.  </P> <P> Michael J. Fox was no match for muscleman Arnold Schwarzenegger at the weekend  box office. With ticket sales of $25.5 million, Tri-Star Pictures' "Total  Recall" -- which sends Schwarzenegger to Mars -- sent the box office into  hyperspace for the year's biggest three-day opening.  </P> <P> "Total Recall" edged out the previous record-holder, New Line Cinema's "Teenage  Mutant Ninja Turtles," by a hair: the "Turtles" opened with $25.3 million.  </P> <P> With its startling victory, the R-rated "Total Recall" -- which opened to mixed  reviews -- got the summer movie sweepstakes war off to a formidable start and  marked Schwarzenegger's successful re-entry to the action-adventure genre  following a string of titles which misfired at the box office. (Among them:  "Red Heat" (1988), which earned $29 million; "Predator" (1987), $25 million;  "The Running Man" (1987), $27 million.)  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Universal Pictures' "Back to the Future III," starring Fox as  time-traveling teen Marty McFly, continued in the tradition of "Future II,"  which had a strong opening (last November) and then spiraled downward.  </P> <P> The second-place ranked "Future III" had ticket sales of $10.3 million,  following its splashy Memorial Day holiday weekend debut, in which it earned  $23.7 million over four days. This represents a tumble of more than 50%, which  doesn't bode well for the box office future of "Future III."  </P> <P> Continuing on its successful flight, Universal's "Bird on a Wire," was ranked  third, with ticket sales of $6.3 million. The action-comedy starring Mel Gibson  and Goldie Hawn, has now flown off with more than $42 million.  </P> <P> With ticket sales of $4.7 million, Touchstone Pictures' "Pretty Woman" came in  fourth.  </P> <P> Orion Pictures' Robin Williams' comedy, "Cadillac Man," came in a sputtering  fifth, with ticket sales of $2.8 million.  </P> <P> Touchstone's "Fire Birds," about Apache attack helicopters fighting the war on  drugs, also sputtered to sixth place, with earnings of $2.6 million in its  second week, after opening to $6.3 million its first weekend.  </P> <P> The Schwarzenegger film's entry also marks a victorious end to a decade-long  Hollywood quest to bring Phillip K. Dick's short story, "I Can Remember It for  You Wholesale" -- about a man with a memory implant -- to the screen. After  several false starts -- and stops -- Carolco Pictures finally succeeded in  teaming Schwarzenegger with "RoboCop" director Paul Verhoeven.  </P> <P> Set on both Earth and Mars in the year 2084, the science fiction epic  reportedly required a budget of nearly $70 million.  </P> <P> Now it must face tough opposition in the coming weeks, warring against Eddie  Murphy-Nick Nolte re-teaming in "Another 48 HRS." (opening Friday), Warren  Beatty's long-awaited "Dick Tracy" (June 15), "Gremlins II: The New Batch"  (also June 15) and Tom Cruise's race car movie, "Days of Thunder" (June 27).  </P></p>

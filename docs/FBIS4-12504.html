			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Tawfiq 'Abid] </F>   [Excerpts] PLO Executive Committee member Sulayman  al-Najjab has said that he supports political settlement,  without one- upmanship, despite his reservations about the Oslo  accord. He added that Israel is to blame for the impasse in the  Cairo talks, adding that he is against all solutions that  confiscate the rights of the Palestinian people. [passage  omitted]    In a meeting with local journalists on 9 April, al-Najjab  said the Rabin government wants Palestinian recognition of the  status quo and agreement on arrangements that lead to some sort  of civilian administration linked to a military governor, and  not a self-rule or Palestinian authority that assumes the powers  of the Israeli military authority.    Al-Najjab added: What is happening now in Gaza and Jericho  is not an Israeli withdrawal, as some people like to call it.  It is, in reality, a redeployment of Israeli troops by keeping  a distance from populated areas while maintaining control over  the land.    He added: We see trucks carrying office equipment and  cabinets leaving this center or that in Gaza to Qatif settlement  and in Jericho to 'Aqabat Jabr. "Is the Israeli occupation an  administrative one?"    He pointed out that besieging the West Bank and Gaza Strip,  including 2 million Palestinians, is meant to further isolate  Jerusalem, cause real starvation for the entire population,  bring them to their knees, and break their resistance.  Afterward, the Israelis will ask for a political price for a  partial lifting of the siege. [passage omitted]    Assessing the 'Afula operation, al-Najjab said: Striking at  civilians does not serve the Palestinian cause. The operation  has given the Zionists a chance to say that the conflict is a  racist one and not against the occupation of our land and holy  places.    He said the U.S.-Israeli demand that President 'Arafat  condemn the operation is simply "hypocrisy." The political  wisdom of President 'Arafat should have told him to be the first  to condemn the operation so that they will not use the operation  to tighten starvation and escalate killing of the Palestinian  people.    Answering a question, al-Najjab said: The relationship  between the PLO and the United States is characterized by  "warnings". Whenever there is an impasse in the negotiations  with the Israelis, 'Arafat receives another U.S. warning.  Al-Najjab said he had attended several meetings between  President 'Arafat and the U.S. ambassador in Tunis, which were  meant only to deliver a warning from the U.S. Administration to  the Palestinian leadership.

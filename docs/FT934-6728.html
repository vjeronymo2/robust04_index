			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters suffers on heavy US selling Electronic news and financial information group Reuters Holdings reeled following heavy international selling and the after-effects of a poorly received international conference call at the end of last week. Dealers said that late on Friday afternoon, UK time, one US brokerage sold the equivalent of 900,000 shares in New York in the form of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) - by contrast, average daily turnover for the stock in the UK is around 1m shares. As the sell order was being placed, Mr Peter Job, Reuters' chief executive, was holding an international telephone-link conference call with analysts in the US and UK. Mr Job is generally considered to have an understated style that verges on the downbeat. Mr Paul Norris of BZW, said: 'While the detail was positive, US investors felt the tone of the meeting was not barnstormingly bullish enough. It certainly went down a lot better in the UK.' The stock was marked down sharply before the start of dealings in the UK yesterday. It attempted to rally from the bottom in mid-morning but by then the dreary tenor of the London market had overtaken it and the stock drifted off to close 41 lower on the day at 1586p with relatively high turnover of 1.7m shares.</p>

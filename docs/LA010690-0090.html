			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAQI LEADER OFFERS IRAN NEW PEACE PLAN  </P> <P> President Saddam Hussein on Friday proposed resuming peace talks with Iran, and  he suggested that the long-hostile nations re-establish air links.  </P> <P> The Iraqi president suggested that direct meetings between representatives of  Iran and Iraq be held alternately in Tehran and Baghdad under the auspices of  the U.N. secretary-general. He also said Iran and Iraq should exchange  prisoners of war and open their borders to allow resumption of visits to  Islamic shrines in both countries.  </P> <P> Fighting in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war ended Aug. 20, 1988, when both sides  accepted a cease-fire based on U.N. Security Council Resolution 598. Peace  talks stalled immediately over interpretation of terms of the resolution.  </P></p>

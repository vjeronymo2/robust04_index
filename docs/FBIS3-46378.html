Wu Yi, Chinese minister of foreign trade and economic  cooperation [MOFTEC], told a press conference that last year  China approved 83,265 foreign-funded projects, with a total  contractual value standing at 110.852 billion U.S. dollars. The  actual amount of foreign investment used in the period was  25.759 billion U.S. dollars. The figures were 70 percent, 90  percent and 134 percent, respectively, more than in 1992.    By the end of last year, Wu said, China had accumulatively  approved over 174,000 foreign-funded projects with the pledged  and actually used foreign investment topping 217.216 billion and  over 60 billion U.S. dollars, respectively.    According to Wu, the investment came from more than 100  countries and areas, and Hong Kong, Macao, Japan and the United  States were among major sources.    Although the lion's share of the foreign investment still  flowed to coastal areas, the growth rate of foreign investment  in land- locked regions last year surpassed that in coastal  areas.    The investment was concentrated in such fields as energy,  light industry, electronics, machinery, textiles, garments,  metallurgy, building materials and real estate.    Wu said that one of the outstanding characteristics of the  foreign investment in China last year was that many  multinational corporations have come to invest in China, and the  scope of investment and the scale of projects have expanded  continuously.    Last year, Wu said, the average contracted foreign  investment  per foreign-funded project reached 1.33 million U.S. dollars, an  increase of 12.9 percent over the previous year.    She said that the volume of exports and imports from  foreign-  funded enterprises stood at 67 billion U.S. dollars-worth,  accounting for over one third of the nation's total, with  exports at 25.24 billion-worth and imports at 41.83 billion U.S.  dollars-worth, increases of 45.4 percent and 58.5 percent over  1992, respectively.    After deducting costs of equipment imports employed as  investment, imports by foreign-funded enterprises stood at 25.2  billion U.S. dollars-worth, thus exports and imports were  roughly balanced, she said.    Moreover, Wu added, in the first 11 months of last year  foreign exchange sold and brought in by foreign-invested  companies reached 8.72 billion and 3.56 billion U.S. dollars,  respectively, with the net amount of foreign exchange taken out  reaching 5.16 billion U.S. dollars.    Meanwhile, China signed loan agreements with foreign  governments for 2.01 billion U.S. dollars, and the actual amount  it used was 2.89 billion U.S. dollars, 11.2 percent more than in  1992.</p>

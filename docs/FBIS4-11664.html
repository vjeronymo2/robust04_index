			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Munsif al-Sulaymi: "Moroccan Ulema To Discuss </F> Sunni-Shiite Rapprochement in Tehran"]    [Text] Rabat -- A diplomatic source in Rabat has told  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that a delegation of Moroccan ulema will visit  Tehran at the beginning of April to attend the meetings of the  Joint Ulema Committee which was formed last year with the aim of  bringing the Shiite and Sunni sects closer together.    The Moroccan delegation to the meeting, which will be held  in  the Iranian capital in the next few days, will include Qarawiyah  [Academy] ulema and advisers from the Awqaf and Islamic Affairs  Ministry with the supervision of senior Royal Court officials.  Most prominent among the Moroccan participants will be Cheikh  Mohamed Lazrak, Ahmed El Ghazi El Houseyni, and Abdelkarim El  Daoudi.    The meetings of the Joint Committee will be attended on the  Iranian side by ulema and experts from the Assembly for  Inter-Islamic Understanding and the Sunni Affairs Committee at  the Office of the Iranian President.    Most prominent among the Iranian figures who will  participate  in the meetings will be Hojjat ol-Eslam V'eizzadeh-Khorasani,  secretary general of the Assembly for Inter-Islamic  Understanding, and Ishaq Medani, presidential adviser on Sunni  affairs.    The conferees in Tehran will discuss the possibility of  crystallizing basic features for dialogue between the ulema of  the two sects and of arriving at general theological common  grounds of jurisprudence that would form the basis of a program  for the work of the committee, which was born last year in Rabat  after lengthy meetings held at the Moroccan Academy.    Theological sources who will participate in the meetings say  that the dialogue between the Moroccan and Iranian ulema will  concentrate on trying to crystallize the points of agreement  between the Shiite and Sunni sects which had already been  underscored at the Rabat meetings, especially the principles of  Islamic unity and solidarity, tolerance, dialogue, goodwill, and  rejection of violence, coercion, and arrogance. These  principles are expected to form the basis of a practical and  elaborate program for cooperation between the Sunni and Shiite  theological and jurisprudence institutions, and it is not  unlikely that rejection of violence and intransigence will be  one of its main features. That is the issue considered to be at  the core of the disagreement between the religious and political  authorities in Iran.    The new round of Sunni-Shiite dialogue constitutes another  endeavor to enhance the call for inter-Islamic understanding and  for dialogue between the Sunnis and the Shiites originally made  by King Hassan II at the start of the new hegira century about  10 years ago. He made that call in his message to Muslims on  the occasion of the new century and he reaffirmed that call in  the summer of 1990. The past two years witnessed the beginning  of the dialogue process between Moroccan and Iranian ulema.  Last month Morocco welcomed a delegation of Lebanese Shiite  ulema who attended the Ramadan lectures which are usually  delivered in the presence of the Moroccan king.</p>

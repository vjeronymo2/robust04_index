			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Socialists gain seats in Senate FRANCE'S Socialists built on past successes to gain five seats in elections to the Senate (upper house) yesterday, Reuter reports from Paris. Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy said the election of two cabinet ministers in the poll for 103 seats - about a third of the house - made a government reshuffle likely. The Socialists won six new seats and lost one to hold, in total, 71 seats and become the second largest group in the house behind the RPR Gaullist party which lost one to retain 90. But their gains did not challenge the house's overwhelming conservative majority. Mr Pierre Mauroy, former Socialist premier, Mr Michel Charasse, budget minister, and Mr Jean-Marie Rausch, junior trade minister, were among the newly-elected senators. The ministers have a month to choose between the cabinet and their nine-year term in the upper house. Mr Charasse, who is due to present the draft budget to the cabinet this week, said he would choose his Senate seat. French farm unions said yesterday they would demonstrate on October 14 against the government's failure to negotiate changes in EC farm policies.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ambassador Tugay Ulucevik, Turkish Foreign Ministry  deputy under secretary, has stated that, in the negotiations  held in Vienna, both the UN representatives and the Turkish  Republic of Northern Cyprus' [TRNC] representatives exerted  efforts to eliminate the existing obstacles and reach a solution  on the Cyprus issue.    In a statement he issued in Ankara upon his return from  Vienna, Ulucevik said that it will be the Turkish Cypriot side  who will assess whether or not the negotiations were  satisfactory. Indicating that Robert Lamb, U.S. special  coordinator on Cyprus, also participated in the negotiations,  Ulucevik stated that issues such as eliminating the holes in the  UN secretary general's confidence-building measures package and  achieving a balance were discussed at the meetings. Noting that  certain understandings emerged at the negotiations, Ulucevik  added that only the government of the TRNC and President Rauf  Denktas can make the real assessment on the issue.</p>

The plan notes that Shanghai now has a land area of 6,340.5  square kilometers, but its coastal waters cover 7,226 square  kilometers.    "The Shanghai Marine Development Plan" constitutes a major  part of Shanghai's current urban planning, it says.    By the year 2000, the proportion of the gross output value  of  the marine economy in Shanghai in the total output value in the  city will rise by 0.5 to 1 percent [figures as received].    The focus of the development plan is on the coastal belts  and  nearby waters, involving opening up of oil and gas projects,  manufacturing of oceanic medicines, underwater projects and  surveying for mineral resources on the sea floor.</p>

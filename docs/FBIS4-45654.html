			<p>BFN     [Text] Zaporozhye Oblast -- The government commission for  the acceptance of generating set no. 6 as operational with its  capacity rated at one million kilowatts, planned for  commissioning in October, held a sitting at the Zaporozhye  nuclear plant on 24 May. The commission united representatives  of the State Committee for the Use of Nuclear Power, the Power  Engineering and Electrification Ministry, the Environmental  Protection Ministry, the State Committee for the Control of Work  Safety in Nuclear Engineering, the fire protection directorate,  and the sanitary and epidemiological service.    Mykhaylo Umanets, chairman of the State Committee for the  Protection of Work Safety in Nuclear Engineering and official in  charge of the government commission, has told a UNIAN  correspondent: "This is the first time that the government  commission has assembled since the moratorium on the development  of nuclear power engineering in Ukraine was lifted in October  1993. Under conditions of continuing recession in the economy,  the launch of a new enterprise -- the one million-kilowatt  nuclear power generating set -- is a splendid event.  Representatives of controlling bodies have noted the high  degree of the equipment's reliability and readiness for work,  with 80 percent of it having already undergone trials in the  operational mode. All the services have been fully manned with  highly qualified personnel. A new-generation water-cooled  water-moderated power reactor has been installed at the  generating set. It meets international nuclear and radiation  safety requirements and is equipped with additional automated  emergency reactor protection and fire fighting systems."    Specialists from the National Control Center at Ukraine's  Power Engineering and Electrification Ministry estimate that the  electricity to be produced by the new generating set will make a  substantial contribution to the state's single energy system.</p>

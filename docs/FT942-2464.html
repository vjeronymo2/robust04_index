			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Europe chemical recovery grows Recovery in western Europe's chemicals industry is accelerating, according to the European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic). 'The west European chemicals business is benefiting from the economic recovery currently under way,' said Mr Simon de Bree, Cefic's incoming president and chairman of Dutch chemicals group DSM. Western European chemicals output should rise by 2 per cent in 1994, faster than the 1.5 per cent seen at the start of the year and compared with a contraction of 1 per cent past year, he said yesterday. 'Our optimism is also justified by the favourable trend of stocks and order book,' he said. 'Stocks of finished products were continuously reduced during the second half (of 1993), returning to normal levels in early 1994. This destocking masks the preliminary steps of a revival.' He admitted, however, that growth in Europe was still too weak to create a large rebound or to begin to catch up with the US chemicals industry. Nevertheless, with annual sales of more than Ecu300bn (Pounds 230bn), the western European chemicals industry remained the biggest in the world. Employment is expected to fall for the fourth consecutive year, this time by 3 per cent to about 2m. This will bring the total number of jobs lost in the European chemicals industry since 1990 to 200,000. Nevertheless, Europe's unit labour costs had grown faster than prices. This had not happened in the US, and 'the global position of the European chemical industry is under threat.' Taking the place of pharmaceuticals is plastics, where new manufacturing technologies and rising prices are helping production rise by 3 per cent this year. Close behind are organic chemicals and paints, which are each growing by more than 2 per cent this year. Only fertilisers will see a fall in production, 1.9 per cent.</p>

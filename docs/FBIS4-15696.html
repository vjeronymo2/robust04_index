			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Fomin] </F>   [Text] Chita April 11 TASS -- The military seem to have  lost patience with the crisis of non-payment and the  dictatorship of the monopoly energy suppliers in Russia.  Informed sources in the administration of the Chita region have  told ITAR-TASS about two cases of army units seizing power  installations in eastern Trans-Baykalia in the first ten days of  April.    The first incident was reported in the Borzinsk district,  where the power suppliers cut electricity supplies to one of the  military units which failed to pay for the earlier supplies.  The army reacted promptly by occupying an electricity  substation.    Some days later a similar case was reported in the  Chernyshevsky district. Both conflicts were settled only after  state authorities intervened.    The army units stationed on the territory of eastern trans-  Baykalia have not been adequately financed for some time already  and owe the electric power sector about five billion roubles  (2,822 million dollars)</p>

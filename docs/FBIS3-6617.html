			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yoshio Hatano, ambassador to the United Nations, in  a speech before a working group on UN Security Council [UNSC]  reform held at the UN Headquarters on 16 March, talked about the  question of Japan becoming a permanent member of the Security  Council, and announced, "I would like to reaffirm the firm  resolve of our country." The expression was one going a step  forward from the earlier government view expressed in the  statement of July last year and elsewhere, but Prime Minister  Hosokawa told reporters, "I have heard nothing about it." A  senior official of Komeito, which is one of the coalition  parties, spoke on the speech, saying, "It should have been  consulted with appropriate offices of the ruling parties; this  was too sudden." It can be said that the charge that government  "policy is absent" in important issues that have to do with  Japan's future has once again been proven correct.    Ambassador Hatano's speech is different from government's  past expressions on the issue. The government issued a  statement [last July] stating Japan is "willing to do what it  can to fulfill its responsibilities in the UN Security Council."  In a speech to the United Nations in last September, the prime  minister said Japan is "willing to do what it can to fulfill its  responsibilities in the reformed United Nations." In  testimonies before the Diet the prime minister has used such  expressions as "we will go a natural way" and "our position is  that we will become one if recommended [by other countries]."  Hatano's speech was different from all this, and expressed  Japan's desire to become a permanent member of the council in a  direct manner.    A top official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA],  explaining this, said, "Many nations have pointed out that the  expressions of the past made `it impossible to tell whether  Japan wanted to become one or not.'" Another MOFA official  explained to reporters, "An expression like `will become one if  recommended' is not passable in the international community, and  the ambassador's expression did not go beyond what was said in  the statement [of last July]." MOFA officials are said to have  visited the prime minister's office to explain the speech as  well.    But the prime minister's office was confused. The prime  minister initially said he has "heard nothing about it," but  then changed his position to saying "it is the same as the  statement of last year." Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi  Takemura in a news conference did not try to hide his  embarrassment, admitting: "I have not heard the explanation on  the speech. What I heard was an explanation about the general  things about the United Nations and the Security Council. I  have not seen the full text of the speech yet."    The fact of the matter is that the coalition government does  not want to tackle the matter squarely from the front. Since  the matter concerns the basic policies of the coalition parties,  and thus can become an issue that causes adverse effects on the  unity of the coalition, the government appears to be facing the  problem of having to be very, very careful in dealing with this  question.</p>

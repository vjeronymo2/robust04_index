			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NFC IS THE 49ERS AND EVERYONE CHASING THEM;  </P> <P> PREVIEW: THE WEST IS BEST, BUT CENTRAL HAS FOUR TEAMS THAT COULD WIN A  CHAMPIONSHIP IF SAN FRANCISCO FALTERS.  </P> <P> The thing that makes 1990 different in the National Football League is that for  the first time in years, the dominant team of the era is positioned to win a  third consecutive Super Bowl.  </P> <P> And that's not all. With another season like last year's, the San Francisco  49ers could win their fifth Super Bowl in 10 years.  </P> <P> With the regular season starting this weekend, San Francisco's quarterback, Joe  Montana, shares a remarkable NFL record with Terry Bradshaw, who led the 1970s  Pittsburgh Steelers to four championships.  </P> <P> As Montana reached the heights in the playoffs, the 49ers routed three of the  best teams in football last winter in winning their fourth championship of the  '80s.  </P> <P> They eliminated the Minnesota Vikings, 41-13; then the Rams, 30-3; and, in a  Super Bowl anticlimax, the Denver Broncos, 55-10. And in so doing, they made  believers of nearly everyone who plays or coaches football.  </P> <P> And Montana is still on the team.  </P> <P> So is Jerry Rice. So is Roger Craig. So is Ronnie Lott, the defensive star of  all four of San Francisco's Super Bowl championships.  </P> <P> So is George Seifert, who succeeded Bill Walsh as the 49ers' coach last season.  And so is Eddie DeBartolo, the inventor of checkbook football, the club owner  whose costly commitment to winning keeps paying off.  </P> <P> Counting regular-season and postseason games, the 49ers since late 1988 are  24-3 (.889). That's one of the hottest streaks in NFL history -- considering  the quality of the teams they're beating in a league widely known for parity.  It's reminiscent of 1984, when the Detroit Tigers started 20-4 in the American  League.  </P> <P> And it's keeping the 49ers on course to join the 1929-31 Green Bay Packers and  the 1965-67 Packers as teams winning three consecutive NFL championships.  </P> <P> Can anyone stop these people?  </P> <P> In the league's dominant conference, five or six of their 1990 rivals have some  kind of chance. Three of them are Eastern teams: the Washington Redskins,  Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants.  </P> <P> The others are the Rams and possibly two from the NFC Central: the Vikings and  Detroit Lions.  </P> <P> Compared to the 49ers, all are severely flawed, although the Redskins may come  closer to the 49er ideal -- all-around balance and depth, with an accent on  productive passing -- than any other club.  </P> <P> It could well have been a Redskin year if the NFL hadn't just made a major  procedural change.  </P> <P> The league has decided to admit six wild-card teams to the playoffs this winter  -- three from each conference -- along with the six division winners.  </P> <P> And that gives the 49ers a bonus chance at the championship -- a chance that no  other title defender in 70 years ever had.  </P> <P> It's hard to believe that six NFC teams could be better than the 49ers. Even if  they lose the division title to the Rams, they will almost surely advance as a  wild card.  </P> <P> And if they finish fast in December -- if they have the momentum going into the  January schedule, regardless of any earlier injuries or other kinds of early  trouble -- the 49ers will be the team to beat in the playoffs. Again.  </P> <P> In one-through-10 order, here are their principal challengers, the principal  NFC teams that are most likely to succeed if the 49ers misfire:  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1) WASHINGTON REDSKINS  </P> <P> Quarterback: Mark Rypien  </P> <P> Coach: Joe Gibbs (102-48-0)  </P> <P> In turf language, the Redskins, under Gibbs, are usually either there or  thereabouts, finishing close when they don't finish first. And such a team is  always a threat, even when it isn't among the favorites. This isn't a very  flashy team, even in its three-receiver formations when Rypien is dealing to  Art Monk, Ricky Sanders and Gary Clark, but it is a tough, solid competitor.  And Gibbs employs highly respected assistants.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 2) RAMS  </P> <P> Quarterback: Jim Everett  </P> <P> Coach: John Robinson (71-50-0)  </P> <P> This team's early-season schedule, with a September off-week, isn't as alarming  as its injuries, and down the road, other teams will be hurt, too. If Robinson  can hold on until defensive back Jerry Gray returns, the Rams will still  contend. Much depends on the quality of Ram depth. For a while last year, depth  carried the 49ers and Redskins -- and the Rams appear to have it at least at  wide receiver. Their strength is Everett and one of the NFL's great pass  offenses.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 3) DETROIT LIONS  </P> <P> Quarterback: Rodney Peete  </P> <P> Coach: Wayne Fontes (9-12)  </P> <P> Few if any Detroit starters would make the first team at Minnesota. The Lions  aren't an NFL power. But late last season, they learned how to win with their  new run-and-shoot offense, and there could be a carry-over this season because  their opponents haven't learned how to stop it. And eventually, they expect  Andre Ware to be their quarterback. The Lions have come up with a secret weapon  under Fontes, a defense that ranks behind only Minnesota's in their division.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 4) MINNESOTA VIKINGS  </P> <P> Quarterback: Wade Wilson  </P> <P> Coach: Jerry Burns (41-28-0)  </P> <P> This team should have won at least one of the recent Super Bowls. And again  this year, it should run over Detroit and all other division rivals. It has the  players and -- on defense -- the coaching. But it hasn't been able to win  enough with its old-time offense, whose passer, Wade Wilson, is the NFL's most  underrated and even now is still fighting for his job. The coaches often misuse  receiver Anthony Carter, too. Some 1990 coaching changes provide some hope.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 5) PHILADELPHIA EAGLES  </P> <P> QB: Randall Cunningham  </P> <P> Coach: Buddy Ryan (33-31-1)  </P> <P> Football people call the NFL's many journeymen about equal in all cities and  say a winner is simply a team with a few distinguished players. The example is  Philadelphia, where few are distinguished except Cunningham and three defensive  linemen: Reggie White, Jerome Brown and Clyde Simmons. The only other blue  chips: Mike Quick, 31, a great receiver often hurt, and young tight end Keith  Jackson, whose holdout will hurt.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 6) NEW YORK GIANTS  </P> <P> Quarterback: Phil Simms  </P> <P> Coach: Bill Parcells (69-49-1)  </P> <P> There isn't much chance that the Giants will finish this far back, and in the  East it will come as no surprise if they win it all. One question is whether  their summer-long holdout pass rusher, Lawrence Taylor, worked hard enough on  his own to get into NFL shape. The Giants field the best defense in their  division, along with a plucky quarterback and a potentially big-time running  back, rookie Rodney Hampton. Little David Meggett will win a game or two on his  own.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 7) NEW ORLEANS SAINTS  </P> <P> Quarterback: John Fourcade  </P> <P> Coach: Jim Mora (38-26).  </P> <P> The race for division titles and wild-card status in the NFC doesn't run this  deep unless one of the above six clubs throws a shoe. No NFL team is better  coached than the Saints, but no team has as much to beat in its own division.  The Saints won't rise unless, or until, rookie quarterback Mike Buck matures.  Fourcade and predecessor Bobby Hebert are journeymen. Linebackers Pat Swilling,  Rickey Jackson and Sam Mills are the team's only class.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 8) ATLANTA FALCONS  </P> <P> Quarterback: Chris Miller.  </P> <P> Coach: Jerry Glanville (1st year)  </P> <P> The NFL's most improved team is led by a competent quarterback, one of the  league's ablest. Other quality is calling Atlanta home now, too: Bill Fralic  and Chris Hinton in the offensive line, Andre Rison at wide receiver, Tony  Casillas and Deion Sanders on defense and possibly rookie runner Steve  Broussard, among others. But as individuals, the Falcons are harder to handle  than most. Only if Glanville can motivate this bunch will Atlanta have  something at last.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 9) GREEN BAY PACKERS  </P> <P> Quarterback: Anthony Dilweg  </P> <P> Coach: Lindy Infante (14-18)  </P> <P> As a 1989 rookie, Dilweg nearly beat out the Packers' famous 1990 holdout, Don  Majkowski, who led them to a record four one-point decisions in a miracle  season. The pass-oriented Infante offense is a little different from the others  in the NFL -- the 49er-Ram types and the run-and-shoot types -- and a bit  harder to execute. But the test is degree of improvement, and the Packers  improve all the time. Their stars are receiver Sterling Sharpe and linebacker  Tim Harris.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 10) CHICAGO BEARS  </P> <P> QB: Jim Harbaugh, Mike Tomczak  </P> <P> Coach: Mike Ditka (84-45)  </P> <P> The Bears made their biggest mistake years ago when they went to Big Ten  running teams Michigan and Ohio State for their passers. There are no  indications that either Harbaugh or Tomczak will ever win. With Purdue's Jim  Everett, the Bears would have it made offensively. And if defensive tackle Dan  Hampton is as crippled as he seems, the defense is shot. The coach is smart and  sound but can no longer play.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ) THE OTHERS  </P> <P> WEST  </P> <P> This has become the NFL's best division, with uniformly good coaching and  strong teams. Because their 1980s coach, Bill Walsh, was the most accomplished  recruiter of his time, the 49ers recently have won the division title most  years. They're still winning with Walsh's recruits and, to be sure, his system.  The challenge for the new Seifert, or somebody in San Francisco, is to keep the  talent rolling in.  </P> <P> The late-'80s challenge for San Francisco's principal competitor, Robinson, was  to convert the Rams from a running team to a passing team, which he did. By  last year, most critics ranked the 49ers and Rams 1-2 in the league.  </P> <P> The Saints and Falcons, challenged by the California teams, have brought in  Mora and Glanville to strengthen the Southern precinct. With slightly better  material, Mora would be a regular in the playoffs. Glanville, formerly  Houston's coach, has been in the playoffs the last three years.  </P> <P> EAST  </P> <P> Unlike the West, this is a peaks-and-valleys division, with Washington,  Philadelphia and the New York Giants on the peaks and the other two far, far  below.  </P> <P> The Phoenix Cardinals are probably farther from the Super Bowl than any other  NFL team. Under a new coach, Joe Bugel, the Cardinals will attack this year in  the one-back offense that Bugel brought from Washington -- and that Dan Henning  has carried from Washington to San Diego -- and they would settle for the  Marion Butts-type that Henning turned up last year when he drafted the  original. It could be the Cardinals' top pick: Anthony Thompson.  </P> <P> But if Timm Rosenbach isn't an NFL quarterback, the hard-luck Phoenix area will  be as completely out of it as the day that Neil Lomax had to quit. The one  great Phoenix player is safety Tim McDonald.  </P> <P> At Dallas, the jury is still out on Cowboy quarterback Troy Aikman as well as  his coach, Jimmy Johnson, and the owner, Jerry Jones. But Johnson, on his  record, has an NFL future.  </P> <P> CENTRAL  </P> <P> If the NFC West is the league's strongest, the NFC Central is the strangest NFL  division.  </P> <P> The Vikings, with Mike Lynn as general manager, have rounded up more talent  than any NFL team east of San Francisco. The Lions, with Mouse Davis and June  Jones advising, are the NFL's first in the run-and-shoot formation. The Bears  have the league's best-known coach in Ditka, along with most of the recent  tradition in this old black-and-blue division but perhaps not enough else.  </P> <P> The Packers also have a distinguished past. But in pitiless-weather country,  the new Packer coach, Infante, has elected to play pass-ball along with the  Lions -- who live in a domed stadium -- and thus no one can read Green Bay's  future.  </P> <P> The other bay team, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, has been picked by many  Southerners to land in the playoffs this season. If, in his fourth NFL season,  Vinny Testaverde becomes an NFL quarterback, the Buccaneers have a chance.  Their hope is that former Charger Gary Anderson, a gifted but small runner,  will play 16 games. As coach and general manager, Ray Perkins calls every shot  in Tampa, where his three-year record is 14-33.  </P></p>

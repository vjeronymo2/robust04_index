			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VIDEO DISCOVERY: MORE VIDEOS  </P> <P> "Smithereens" (1982), directed by Susan Seidelman. 90 minutes. No rating. In  the spirit of the punk movement that inspired it, this film spews raw  spontaneity, stars a mostly non-professional cast and looks like it was made  for a few thousand dollars.  </P> <P> It focuses on Wren, a hyper, just-out-of-high-school Jersey girl trying to be a  part of the New York punk scene, and a band called Smithereens. DOUG LIST  </P></p>

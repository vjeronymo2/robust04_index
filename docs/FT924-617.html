			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Thorn sale helps Chrysalis return to black with Pounds 5.6m A PROFITABLE exit from a joint venture with Thorn-EMI helped Chrysalis, the music publishing, communications and media company, return to the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.63m for the year to August 31, against losses of Pounds 9.33m. The result, struck on sales 3 per cent lower at Pounds 65.9m, was enhanced by the Pounds 9.65m net profit on discontinued activities, taken above the line. This included the Pounds 11.58m profit from the sale of the company's stake in Chrysalis Record Companies, to Thorn in November 1991. Mr Nigel Butterfield, finance director, said that at the operating level, the company recorded a loss of about Pounds 4.8m. The group again passed the dividend, which has not been paid since 1989-90. Earnings per share of 26.02p compared with losses of 30.06p. Worsening conditions in MAM, Chrysalis's fruit machines subsidiary and the costs of investing in existing businesses were the main reasons behind the operating losses, said Mr Butterfield. Fruit machines incurred losses of Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 1.1m) and this business was expected to suffer substantial losses this year. Music publishing profits dived from Pounds 1m to Pounds 250,000, due to the investment of more than Pounds 1m in signing new talent. Recent names included the Smashing Pumpkins, who have several hits in the US, and the Sugar Merchants in the UK. Higher operating costs hit wholesale exports, which fell by Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 500,000. All other on-going business incurred deeper losses, except property, which cut its deficit by Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 300,000. However, Mr Butterfield said that the media businesses had 'turned round profits' in the current year. Excluding the fruit machine businesses, the group was capable of achieving healthy profits, he said.</p>

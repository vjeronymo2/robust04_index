			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / West offers Russia deal to cut debt burden RUSSIA'S western creditor nations last night offered to re-schedule Dollars 15bn worth of debt to allow Moscow to reduce sharply its debt service obligations next year. At the same time Germany and Russia settled an important financial dispute, agreeing that Moscow could defer for at least eight years repaying DM17.6bn (Pounds 7.2bn) owed to the former East Germany. The western offer to reschedule payments due by the end of next year was made at a meeting in Paris between officials of the Group of Seven industrial countries and a delegation of senior Russian officials. If accepted by the Russian government, the deal will cut Moscow's debt service obligations next year from Dollars 12bn to Dollars 2.75bn, said a G7 finance official. The G7 regards the offer as a generous concession. According to an earlier Paris Club plan, the Russians would have been asked to meet debt servicing costs of Dollars 4.6bn next year, while Moscow argued it could afford to repay only Dollars 2.5bn to Dollars 3bn. Russia was Dollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn in arrears by the end of last September and will have clocked up another Dollars 2bn of arrears for this year's final quarter. The German agreement was reached after two days of talks between Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow. For his part, Mr Yeltsin has renounced all claims for massive compensation for Soviet military installations in eastern Germany. Originally, Russia had claimed as much as DM18bn for the facilities, then reduced it to DM8bn, and now to nothing. The two sides were clearly delighted with their success in resolving the dispute, in spite of the latest upheaval in the Russian government. Chancellor Kohl presented his visit as a demonstration of support for the Russian president. Mr Yeltsin, at their joint press conference, responded by insisting that conservative forces had failed to halt the reform process.

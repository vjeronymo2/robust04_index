			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Isosceles wins space to negotiate restructuring A RADICAL financial restructuring of Isosceles, the leveraged buy-out vehicle for the Gateway food retail group, is to be negotiated between the company, its lenders and its shareholders over the next few months. The company, which has debts of about Pounds 1.3bn, yesterday agreed the terms of a standstill arrangement with its lenders under which it will defer interest on its loans and its capital repayments until May 28. In total Isosceles will defer payments of about Pounds 90m. The banks have also provided additional working capital facilities. Isosceles refused to put a figure on this facility for commercial reasons, but it is understood to be sizeable and sufficient. Isosceles also confirmed that Mr David Simons will join as chief executive on January 4. He replaces Mr Alistair Mitchell-Innes who will return to his non-executive role until he retires from the board in March. Mr Ernest Sharp, chairman, said yesterday: 'I am pleased that we have created the breathing space needed for a complete financial restructuring of Isosceles. All our lenders and major shareholders have recognised the need for a radical restructuring with a sense of realism and determination.' The restructuring is expected to involve a sizeable debt for equity swap, with mezzanine lenders and shareholders interests savagely diluted. This will be the third restructuring of the group's finances since the Pounds 2.1bn buy-out in 1989. The second restructuring was only finalised at the annual meeting in October, although it was negotiated in the summer. That was a relatively minor affair, involving the recasting of covenants, the deferral of Pounds 48m of interest on mezzanine debt and conversion of preference shares into ordinary shares. Mr Mitchell-Innes said that trading conditions had not worsened significantly since the summer, and the group was close to profit forecasts made then. However, he said: 'I do not think the situation was then seen to be as important as it is now.' Since the summer, Isosceles has sold Wellworth, the northern Irish subsidiary, for Pounds 128m, rather less than originally expected. A hoped-for sale of Herman's, the US sporting goods chain, has fallen through. Added to that suppliers are understood to have taken a tougher line on credit terms. Mr Mitchell-Innes said it was important that all parties understood that this restructuring would be the last. He added that 'whatever the structure, the business has to perform.' The company faced a long haul, but was still profitable at the trading level, he said. The restructuring would have to 'make sure it offers a growth way out,' which could eventually provide some value for equity holders.</p>

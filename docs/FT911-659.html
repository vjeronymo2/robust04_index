			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Water bargaining change is agreed YORKSHIRE WATER has won union approval for a 'single-table' bargaining arrangement through which three sets of pay negotiations, with craft, manual and staff workers, will be replaced by one. The change is part of a small but growing trend towards simplified pay bargaining in British industry. It is the latest in a series of initiatives which water companies have made in their relationships with employees since privatisation 18 months ago. The commitment by the nine unions to 'single-table' bargaining is part of a deal which will see pay rise by 9.5 per cent from April 1. That is higher than the average level of settlements in British industry and exceeds the inflation rate which, for the year to April, is likely to have been considerably below 7 per cent. 'Single-table' bargaining is seen by employers as a means of cutting management negotiating time and reducing demarcations and frictions between groups of workers. Yorkshire Water plans harmonisation of conditions for its 4,000 employees, and the unions will press for all workers to move towards 35-hour weeks. The working week varies now between 35 hours and 38 hours. The company is also setting up 'single-table', area-based, consultative forums as the basis for local talks between managements and workforces. Mr Richard Holmes, regional organiser of the General, Municipal and Boilermakers Union and secretary of the manual unions, said the unions had been taken aback originally by the 'single-table' proposals, but could now see benefits. Yorkshire's move follows an initiative at Northumbrian Water which saw union powers in pay bargaining reduced.</p>

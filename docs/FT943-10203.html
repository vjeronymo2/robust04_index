			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Ruberoid makes Pounds 6.5m purchases Ruberoid, the waterproofing systems specialist which was spun off from Tarmac last November, yesterday announced two purchases in the polymeric sheeting field for use in the construction industry for a total of about Pounds 6.5m. It has acquired the half interest, not already owned, in Hyload UK, from Coal Products for Pounds 4.6m and Hyload in the US from Coal Products and Tarmac for payments totalling Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.9m). Mr David Kendall, chairman, said prospects in the UK construction industry were now more encouraging although the recovery had been slow to materialise. The Belgian and Dutch businesses were performing well. However, he warned that as a result of wet weather earlier this year the level of group activity for the first half of 1994 had been slightly below expectations. Margins were generally firm with overheads under control and Mr Kendall expected 'a satisfactory outcome' for the first half. In 1993 the group beat its flotation forecast with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 7.1m.</p>

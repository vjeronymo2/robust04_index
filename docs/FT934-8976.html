			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Sherwood shares fall 41% on further profit warning SHERWOOD Computer Serv-ices shares lost 41 per cent of their value yesterday, closing down 60p at 85p after the company's second profits warning in four months. The USM-quoted financial software company said that market expectations of pre-tax profits of between Pounds 1.5m and Pounds 2.1m would not be met. At the same time, it said that Mr Charles Taylor, finance director, was resigning to take up a similar position with another, unspecified, computing services company. Mr George Matthews, chief executive, said there was no connection between the profits warning and Mr Taylor's resignation. He said there were three reasons for the company's failure to maintain its predicted trading improvement. The local government market was proving difficult and action had already been taken to reduce costs. The life and pensions business was generally good, but a large customer's decision to continue using Sherwood's bureau service rather than moving to Sherwood's packaged software had cost the company some Pounds 500,000 in licence fees. Finally, there were continued problems in the Lloyd's insurance market. The company has about 180 people working in that area and jobs would be lost as it reduced costs, Mr Matthews said. He was not prepared to indicate how many redundancies would be involved. Last year Sherwood made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3m on revenues of Pounds 20m, but profits fell to Pounds 541,000 at the half-way stage after difficulties in the Lloyd's market forced a profits warning in August. Mr Matthews said the life and pensions business would continue to show good growth, but he saw little improvement in either the local government or Lloyd's market in the year ahead.</p>

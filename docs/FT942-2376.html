			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Working Life: Computers off the trolley - Training Britain's most successful attempt at business sponsorship of schools, the Tesco Computers for Schools scheme, has been extended. If you are one of the millions of parents who have been coerced by schools into collecting vouchers for computer equipment, you may be relieved to know that the closing date will now be June 26. Schools then have until July 15 to process their applications. Computers for Schools is an undeniably successful commercial promotion, which analysts already believe has a noticeable effect on Tesco's sales volumes. The retailer is into its third year of running the scheme, and it has already been copied, with WH Smith launching a scheme for buying school books, and Boots offering sports equipment. But is it the way forward for funding the UK's often under-resourced schools? And does it provide voucher collectors with value for money? Both of these questions are harder to answer. Take-up shows there is a demand. Last year 11,000 schools - out of around 40,000 in England and Wales  -received at least some equipment under the scheme. But schools now have to teach information technology as a theme running through the national curriculum, and banks of computers for all pupils to use are a standard sight in primary schools. Tesco funding might not go that far. Cynics can also point to the massive basket-loads of Tesco shopping which need to be completed to earn a computer. The cheapest computer available needs 2,500 Pounds 25 vouchers - or Pounds 62,500 spent at Tesco. But the difficulty schools have in raising the money forces them to work closely with their local communities. And, teachers attest, that has encouraged parents to take a greater interest in schools, and, relatively painlessly, to help with funding. Some schemes linking with local employers or community groups provide superb learning opportunities. For example, St Andrew's Academy in Saltcoats, has joined with a local company, Craigie Carpets, to start its pupils on computer-aided textile designs. And some schools managed amazing organisational feats. King Edward VI School in Lichfield, Staffs, last year claimed five computers, and three multimedia CD-ROM drives. It had collected 30,600 vouchers - Pounds 765,000 spent at Tesco.</p>

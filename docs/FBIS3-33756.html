In its first  statement, distributed in Khan Yunus and Rafah yesterday, it  called for escalating armed struggle against Israel, saying that  negotiations should be carried out through the muzzle of a gun  and not across a peace table. The Abu- al-Rish faction claimed  responsibility for eight armed operations against the Israeli  Army in January.    Palestinian sources in the Gaza Strip say that the  Abu-al-Rish battalions were formed following the assassination  of Ahmad Abu-al-Rish, a member of the Fatah Hawks, by the  Israeli secret units last November.

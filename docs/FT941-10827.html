			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Review of counties' future extended More time is to be allowed for the first stages of most of the review of local government in the English counties, the Local Government Commission for England decided yesterday. The decision follows the the government's announcement that it would not appeal against the recent High Court ruling that Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, had acted unlawfully in calling for the two-tier structure of county and district councils to be abandoned in all but 'exceptional' circumstances. The government said some councils had asked the commission for more time to consider their positions because they felt the change of guidance might alter the nature of the submissions they were planning to send to the commission. The commission is to allow those scheduled to submit proposals at the end of February and at the end of March more time - an extra six weeks and an extra five weeks respectively. But because those due to make their proposals at the end of April and the end of May will have enough time to consider their position, it does not propose to alter these dates. Mr Gummer has already approved the commission's final recommendations for the creation of a unitary council on the Isle of Wight and of four unitary councils for Cleveland. He has asked it to review Derbyshire and County Durham again. The commission said draft recommendations would be produced for consultation in the late spring or summer. It believes all reviews are still likely to be completed by the original deadline of December 31.</p>

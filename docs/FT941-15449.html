			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US crop news boosts maize and soya prices US maize and soyabean prices jumped yesterday, extending their five-month rallies on news from the US Department of Agriculture that the weather-ravaged harvests of 1993 were even smaller that previously estimated. The USDA in its final report on last summer's production said US farmers harvested only 6.3bn bushels (56lb each) of maize, 33 per cent below the 1992 record, and the smallest crop since 1974. After accounting for both domestic and export demand, the agency said only 802m bushels of maize will remain in storage in the US before the next harvest. The uncomfortably low stock levels could drive maize futures prices at the Chicago Board of Trade as high as Dollars 3.40 a bushel as a means of rationing supply, and could mean the US would have to import maize to meet domestic needs, said Mr Bill Biederman, analyst for the market consultants, Allendale, Inc. In late trading maize futures prices for May delivery were 4 1/4 cents higher at Dollars 3.13 1/2 a bushel. The size of the US's other major feedgrain crop, soyabeans, was also reduced. Soyabean futures prices jumped in Chicago on news that the harvest was 1.81bn bushels (60lb each), 17 per cent below 1992 production, and 1 per cent less than the USDA's November estimate. The drop in USDA's soyabean production figure was accompanied by a 15m bushel decline in the agency's estimate of soyabean ending stocks, to 150m bushels. Analysts said the low stocks figure could push soyabean prices well over Dollars 7.50 a bushel, although short supplies of US soyabeans could be offset by higher production in Brazil and Argentina.</p>

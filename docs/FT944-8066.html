			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Unsafe factory ships detained Sixteen foreign ships, including five Bulgarian fish factory vessels or 'Klondykers', were detained in UK ports last month after failing safety inspections, the Department of Transport said yesterday, Charles Batchelor writes. Evidence of a crackdown on fish factory ships came less than three weeks after the government announced a series of other measures to tighten controls because of the poor levels of maintenance on these vessels. From next year Klondykers will have to apply in advance for licences to operate in British waters. Many governments have started to institute tougher controls of vessels entering their ports because of growing dissatisfaction with the quality of supervision exercised by the states under whose flags the vessels sail. The five detained vessels, all flying the Bulgarian flag and owned by the Bulgarian company Okeanski Ribolov, revealed a catalogue of deficiencies. They were infested with cockroaches or rodents, had unhygienic accommodation and had inadequately qualified crews.</p>

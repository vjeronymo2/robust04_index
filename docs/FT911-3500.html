			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Observer: Morse code Sir Jeremy Morse, chairman of Lloyds Bank and host for yesterday's Wincott financial journalism awards, hates gossip. Which is all very sad, since if Sir Jeremy, fellow of All Souls, were ever to put pen to public paper he would be able to shed more light on the City than most of the distinguished Wincott award winners over the years. But Sir Jeremy, who has headed Lloyds since 1977, is one of the old school of bankers who believes in reticence. He learnt his trade at the nod and wink school of Glyn, Mills &amp; Co where no one ever seemed to write notes. He remembers being taken to see Lord Hampden at Lazards where nothing of consequence was talked about. Hence, he was quite surprised when his colleague turned to him after the meeting and said it had been 'extremely useful'. Increasing openness in the City, he said, had led to loss of status by the Bank of England compared with the Treasury, because in the old days the Bank had been able to give the impression that it knew an awful lot of important things that it could not possibly discuss. Perhaps this had something to do with the Bank having Reuters screens before the Treasury. All this has changed with the rapid growth in financial journalism and Sir Jeremy was surprisingly complimentary about the contribution of the fourth estate. But then you can afford to be when you know an awful lot more secrets than the media.</p>

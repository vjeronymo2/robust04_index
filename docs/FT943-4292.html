			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Cadbury up 23% to Pounds 166.2m - Good summer weather across Europe boosted soft drink sales Higher volumes of soft drink and sweet sales helped Cadbury Schweppes lift its interim pre-tax profits by 23.2 per cent from Pounds 166.2m to Pounds 204.8m. The UK was a strong market for both sides of its business and the US showed a sharp increase in soft drinks. But some continental Europe markets and and Australia suffered from local problems. Mr Dominic Cadbury, chairman, said the second half was off to a strong start with good summer weather across Europe boosting soft drink sales. The interim dividend rises 27.8 per cent to 4.6p (3.6p) to reflect earnings growth and a re-balancing of interim and final payouts. Earnings per share were 13.42p (12.21p). Cadbury's trading margin widened to 12.1 per cent from 10 per cent thanks to cost savings as well as higher sales volume. Trading profits rose 25 per cent to Pounds 213.9m (Pounds 171.1m) on sales ahead 3.5 per cent at Pounds 1.77bn (Pounds 1.71bn) in the six months to June 18. Soft drinks in the UK were one of Cadbury's best performers despite a 6 per cent fall in prices due to stiff competition from own-label brands such as J. Sainsbury's Classic Cola. Coca-Cola &amp; Schweppes Beverages, its joint venture with Coca-Cola, raised volumes by 2 per cent and trading profits by 20 per cent, thanks in part to further cost savings. The division, which includes other business such as Sodastream, had trading profits of Pounds 51.6m, up 12.7 per cent, on sales down 3.7 per cent at Pounds 351.7m In confectionery, UK trading profits rose by a quarter to Pounds 41.5m on sales ahead 8.4 per cent at Pounds 387.9m. Chocolate sales volume gained 4 per cent in line with the market, Trebor Bassett's sugar sweets increased their market share while the Maynard brand became market leader in fruit sweets. COMMENT Once again Cadbury Schweppes has showned its talent for pushing its brands in trying conditions and developing new markets. On present form before another Spanish restructuring charge of about Pounds 25m it can produce pre-tax profits of about Pounds 500m for the full year, or 34p a share, for a prospective multiple of 13.5. But there are adverse factors to keep an eye on. In the UK soft drinks market, a combination of falling prices, stagnant revenues and ultimately finite cost-cutting measures will make it difficult for the company to push profits higher in coming years. Much more work is needed in order to pull continental European soft drinks together. Until these problems are solved, the shares are fairly rated.</p>

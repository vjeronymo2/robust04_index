			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Super dinar fails to deliver Serb-led Yugoslavia yesterday introduced a new currency - the 'super dinar'  -as part of a package of economic measures aimed at stopping hyperinflation and rebuilding the monetary system. The Yugoslav government, in an attempt to restore confidence, claimed the new dinar would be fully convertible, and backed up by DM500m (Pounds 195.3m) in hard currency and gold reserves. It would be pegged at a rate of one German D-Mark. However, yesterday inhabitants of Belgrade waited in vain for the new banknotes to arrive in the Serbian capital. The payment of pensions was postponed. There was scant hope of converting dinars into hard currency after reports that the procedure would be complicated and take days. Shopkeepers closed their doors, grappling with the complicated task of introducing two accounting systems. The economy of the rump Yugoslavia - Serbia and Montenegro - has been devastated after 20 months of United Nations sanctions, nearly three years of war and the collapse of trade between the former Yugoslav republics. Inflation ran at 1m per cent for December alone. Industrial production has dropped by about 60 per cent in relation to three years ago. Almost half the 2.4m non-agricultural labour force is without jobs. The average monthly wage last year fell to DM10 from DM550 in 1990. Last autumn, with inflation in the trillions, the government slashed 15 zeros off bank notes in a bid to keep the dinar in use. Old dinars, which yesterday were trading at 13m for one new dinar, will remain in circulation. But D-Marks have virtually replaced the national currency, and 'markici', the Serbian nickname for pfennigs, are likely to remain the most treasured commodity. Belgrade economists said the government's reform programme failed to tackle the economy's main problems, such as the need to cut public spending, subsidies and military spending. Instead it relies on steep tax rises, especially in the tiny private sector, to raise money for the empty state coffers. The programme will levy a range of new taxes on businesses, which some companies, already hit by UN sanctions, fear will drive them out of business. Mr Jurij Bajec, an economics professor at Belgrade University, cautioned: 'This programme has a chance if the government takes it very seriously and acts very responsibly.' Mr Danijel Cvjeticanin, an economics professor, said Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic was afraid to shut loss-making factories. 'Most workers are idle but are still paid. The state will now be forced to pay social benefits rather than individual businesses.'</p>

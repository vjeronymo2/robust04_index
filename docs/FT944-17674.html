			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Rome cabinet hits back at prosecutor The Italian government yesterday decided to press a formal complaint against Mr Saverio Borrelli, Milan's chief public prosecutor, over a newspaper interview on Wednesday that contained allegations about the prime minister and the justice minister. The move followed 24 hours' deliberation as Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, sought to present a united front among the members of his right-wing coalition over how to react to the controversial interview. The complaint is being filed with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, as head of the higher council of the magistrature. It claims Mr Borrelli is in breach of article 289 of the criminal code for undermining constitutional authority. Such a strong stand represents the triumph of the 'hawks' in the cabinet, led by Mr Giuliano Ferrara, minister in charge of parliamentary affairs. They have argued that the government must take tough action to curb the increasing political interference of the anti-corruption magistrates in Milan. But the unity of the government was immediately put in doubt by Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Northern League. He distanced himself from the stand of the four League ministers who signed the complaint, saying: 'The League doesn't make denunciations of any type.' At the same time key members of the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance - Mr Berlusconi's other main coalition partner - also kept their distance. The MSI has been cultivating close relations with elements in the Milan magistrature and is anxious to avoid an open confrontation, aware of the continued popularity of figures such as Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the leading anti-corruption magistrate. The complaint procedure means that Mr Scalfaro must now examine the evidence and then decide whether there is sufficient cause to take either disciplinary or legal action. Offences under article 289 carry a minimum of 10 years' imprisonment. Mr Borrelli was unrepentant over his interview yesterday and told reporters he had no intention of resigning. His comments suggested he was aware of the consequences of his words in the interview and accepted that the confrontation between the government and the judiciary was likely to continue. In the interview, Mr Borrelli claimed the magistrates' investigations were at a turning point and involved people 'at the top of business and politics'. This was a clear reference to Mr Berlusconi and his Fininvest empire, which has been under investigation for more than a year.</p>

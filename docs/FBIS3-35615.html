This will lead to the loss of 3.8 Bn  kilowatts of electric power. All Ukrainian nuclear power  stations may stop functioning in 1995, INTERFAX-Ukraine was  informed by the press service of the Ukrainian State Committee  for Atomic Power on Friday.    The press service announced that Ukraine received  practically  no nuclear fuel due to continuing non-payment of Ukrainian  enterprises to Russia. This would lead to stopping of the  nuclear power stations' energy blocks in Ukraine.    The 3rd energy block of the Chernobyl nuclear power station  is expected to be stopped on January 30, its first energy block  on March 31 and the energy blocks of the Yuzhnoukrainskaya and  Zaporozhye nuclear power stations may be stopped in May and  August.    The continued functioning of the Chernobyl nuclear power  station's 2nd energy block planned by the Ukrainian Supreme  Soviet is also becoming unfeasible, the committee's press  service pointed out.</p>

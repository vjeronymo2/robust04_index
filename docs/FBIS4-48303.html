			<p>BFN     [Text] The commercial rand has slumped to its lowest level  yet against both the dollar and sterling. It hit a low of 3  rands 67.5 cents against the dollar this morning. Reserve Bank  intervention helped lift the rand to a slightly better close of  3 rands 66.33 cents to the dollar. However, it is still the  weakest closing level ever.    The rand also suffered a deep depreciation against sterling  to trade at 5 rands 50.5 cents against the British currency.  The rand was last close to this level in September 1992 when a  crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism led to sterling  losing heavily against the rand.</p>

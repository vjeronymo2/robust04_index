			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Tigran Liloyan, Albert </F> Kochetkov and Mikhail Shevtsov]    [Text] Tbilisi 10 June TASS -- The question about the  establishment of Russian military bases on Armenian territory  has been resolved positively, Russian Defence Minister Pavel  Grachev said before flying to Tbilisi, capital of Georgia.    According to Grachev, the bases in Gyumri and Yerevan will  be  formed before 1 August. The minister expressed satisfaction  with his trip to Yerevan and said that all military problems  scheduled for discussion were solved and approved by the  leadership of Armenia.    Armenian Defence Minister Serzh Sargsyan told ITAR-TASS he  was pleased with the results of Minister Grachev's visit, which  he described as "a very important and serious visit, the main  results of which will be the deployment of Russian military  bases in Armenia, the strengthening of the Republic's air  defenses and the reinforcement of the Russian troops deployed  here."    Russian Ambassador to Armenia Vladimir Stupishin said  General  Grachev's visit to Yerevan was an important political landmark.  "It was very important from the viewpoint of strengthening our  allied relations with Armenia both in the frame of the treaty of  collective security of the Commonwealth of Independent States  and on a bilateral basis," he said.    In Tbilisi, the Russian defence minister was welcomed by  Prime Minister Otar Patsatsiya, Parliament Vice-Speaker Vakhtang  Rcheulishvili, members of the Georgian Government and the  commander of the Russian troops in the Caucasus, Colonel-General  Fedor Reut. A guard of honour was mustered on the tarmac and a  military band played the anthems of the two countries.    The motorcade then sped from the airport to the building of  the Cabinet of Ministers, where a meeting has begun between the  Russian defence minister and Georgian leader Eduard  Shevardnadze. The conversation deals with the timetable and a  mechanism of introducing CIS peacekeepers, including a Russian  contingent to the zone of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict.    On Friday afternoon, Minister Grachev is due to fly to  Gudauta for analogous coordination of actions with the Abkhaz  side.    The Russian defence minister is expected to return to  Tbilisi  on Friday evening and meet the generals and officers of the  Russian troops stationed in the Transcaucasus on Saturday.</p>

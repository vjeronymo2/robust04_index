			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Sterling It is difficult to judge whether the downward drift of sterling simply reflects the weakness of the dollar or is a sign of anxieties closer to home. Yesterday's economic figures give no obvious reason to worry. Second-quarter growth was higher than anticipated, but exports led the way. The currency markets can hardly fret about the balance of payments. Consumer spending has fallen back since the end of last year, which together with last week's retail price figures should soothe nerves about inflation. Even the political worries which unsettled financial markets earlier in the year have faded. With growth running so far above trend, inflationary pressures are sure to reassert themselves. But that should not undermine sterling so long as the market is confident that interest rates will be raised in good time. The nagging doubt may be that recent data makes an early rise unlikely, after which other considerations - notably the political party conference season - are excuses to delay. If the markets are tempted to try to force the chancellor's hand, though, considerable pressure will be required. After the retreat from the exchange rate mechanism two years ago, the exchange rate is hardly high on the policy agenda. Besides, on a trade-weighted basis sterling has lost only 5 per cent this year and is well above the low-point touched last February. While a steadily devaluing currency must give the authorities pause for thought in a period of above-trend growth, sterling's strength against the dollar might actually help keep input costs under control.</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Greenspan urges broad view of monetary policy Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, warned yesterday that central banks could not rely on any single rule or indicator in setting monetary policy. 'What has become increasingly clear is that no simple guide would enable us to put monetary policy on automatic pilot,' Mr Greenspan said in a wide-ranging discussion of the difficulties of economic forecasting before the House of Representatives government operations committee. When asked whether he put more weight on financial indicators or on statistics in gauging the real economy, Mr Greenspan answered: 'All of the above.' The Fed chairman's testimony was closely watched by financial analysts and bond market traders, because it fell in the middle of the Treasury's quarterly refunding operations and less than a week before a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed body which sets monetary policy, which is widely expected to raise short-term interest rates. But Mr Greenspan's discussion of the shortcomings of the consumer price index and the difficulties of conceptualising output proved too arid for most in the market. The Fed's approach to monetary policy might be 'closer to monotheism', Mr Greenspan said, if its statute set it a single goal, such as price stability. Instead, the Fed's founding statute lays out multiple goals, including high employment and a stable financial system. Mr Greenspan said it was regrettable that M2, one of the monetary aggregates the Fed had traditionally used to measure the money supply, had 'veered off quite significantly in recent years' and was no longer a very useful indicator. He hoped that the structural changes in the economy which have caused M2 to swing wildly would end at some point and allow M2 to re-establish itself as a predictor of economic activity. Bronwen Maddox in New York adds: Senior US regulators are considering new requirements on banks to disclose regularly their exposure to risky financial instruments such as derivatives. Regulators have been searching for ways to improve disclosure of banks' exposure. The proprietary trading desks of some banks were among heavy traders of highly leveraged financial instruments last autumn, and were hit hard by the rise in US interest rates on February 4 and the subsequent fall in markets. Regulators are considering asking banks to report their exposure quarterly or even monthly to enable investors and counterparties in trades to assess a bank's risk.</p>

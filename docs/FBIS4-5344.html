			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 10 (KCNA) -- The opposition  Democratic Party of South Korea Friday entered into a  full-dressed out-of-the-assembly struggle against farm market  opening with the inaugural ceremony of the committee for  checking the ratification of the Uruguay Round [UR] accord.    Chairman of the Democratic Party Yi Ki-taek, who was elected  chairman of the committee, in his speech at the inaugural  ceremony said that the present regime which had revealed its  diplomatic incompetency and deceived the people was entirely  responsible for the out-of-the-assembly struggle which the  opposition party had to wage to check the "National Assembly  ratification" of farm market opening.    He warned that his party would intensify the all-people  struggle if the authorities refused to shelve the signing of the  "enforcement schedule of the Uruguay Round accord" and to  proceed with the renegotiation of the Uruguay Round results".</p>

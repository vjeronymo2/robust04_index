			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Captain 1st Rank Yu. Makarov and Retired Captain </F> 2nd Rank A. Chirkov: "Reorienting Formations"]    [Text] The discussion of the Navy's new strategic concept  continued in the June issue of this magazine and the issues  associated with the role of strike aircraft carriers, the  development of a new type of combat formations and joint  utilization of fleet aviation and the Marines were examined.    In the articles along with the proposal on the reduction of  the number of active strike aircraft carriers, the opinion is  being expressed on redesignating them as amphibious aircraft  carriers. It is thought that these aircraft carriers must be  part of the amphibious forces. Other authors advocate  maintaining strike aircraft carriers as part of the fleet and  propose ways to increase the combat capabilities of carrier task  forces while supporting the operations of forces in coastal  areas. So, 8th Special Purpose Group Commander Captain 3rd Rank  Katan summarizes the experience of the utilization of a special  purpose platoon that was on board the strike aircraft carrier  "Saratoga" for four months (June-September 1992) as part of the  6th Fleet. On the aircraft carrier, this platoon accomplished  combat training missions: search and rescue of personnel, search  and capture of individual enemy facilities at sea and on the  coast, special reconnaissance, guidance and adjustment of  carrier-based aircraft strikes against enemy coastal facilities,  and also peacekeeping functions and participation in the  evacuation of the population. The missions cited were rehearsed  in exercises and during the course of the carrier task force's  daily activities on the Mediterranean Sea. Training of special  purpose platoon personnel was conducted from an aircraft, a  helicopter, from an aircraft and a helicopter simultaneously,  and from a submarine. Based on the experience obtained, the  appropriate regulation was developed for the utilization of such  groups that are permanently attached to aircraft carriers that  are part of the 6th Fleet.    While proceeding from the new Naval concept that was set  forth in the White Book, the naval forces command authorities  view the development and utilization of the new  operational-tactical unit, the so-called naval combat group --  MBG -- that is an elementary unit of U.S. sea power. A guided  missile cruiser will become the nucleus of this unit. The guided  missile cruiser's functions will include collection, processing  and assessment of information based on data that is arriving  from various sources to obtain a complete picture of the targets  that are located in the region's air-surface-underwater space  and making decisions on the utilization of electronic systems.    Besides the guided missile cruiser, the naval combat group  is  made up of ships with the Lamps system, a nuclear submarine and  a base patrol aircraft. If necessary, they envision reinforcing  the naval combat group with land-based reconnaissance aircraft,  including AWACS. They think that this composition of the group  will be capable of carrying out surveillance, issuing target  designation to conduct strikes against assigned targets and  conducting defensive operations in the water-air-land space in a  300-mile radius from the center of the group.    This group may be deployed in a potentially dangerous area,  providing in the process antisubmarine defense, antiship missile  defense and air defense and conducting airborne electronic  reconnaissance. Coordination of operations will be carried out  by a combined coordination center that is located on the guided  missile cruiser. The availability of the naval combat group will  substantially increase the combat capabilities of carrier  forces, increasing the zone of their operations and expanding  the circle of the missions being accomplished. This group can  conduct delaying combat operations during the initial period and  monitor the situation until the arrival of the carrier strike  group or other forces. The naval combat group concept was proven  during the course of two years (1990-1991) in the Mediterranean  Sea.    The regulation developed based upon the concept of  conducting  combat operations by ground forces is the guiding document for  the Marines. Its main idea consists of the joint utilization of  air and ground Marine forces and fleet carrier-based aviation.  Organizationally, this is expressed in the development of the  functioning of an air-ground operational formation which must be  rapidly deployed to the designated area to conduct combat  operations.    This operational formation is capable of accomplishing air  support missions, including providing direct air support and  also of conducting missile-bomb strikes against enemy rear  services facilities. They propose including combat aircraft and  helicopters and also ground-based subunits to accomplish the  assigned missions.    A reassessment is being conducted of the possibilities for  the utilization of carrier-based aviation as a result of the  development of Marine air-ground operational formations. So, the  opinion is being expressed that during operations in coastal  areas, it must accomplish the following missions: support ground  operations by achieving air superiority air in the designated  area; conducting strikes against enemy fixed targets that are  located in the rear area and also providing direct air support  to ground forces.    The authors of the articles think that the new Marine  doctrine provides the initiative in the conduct of combat  operations to aviators, which will certainly increase the  effectiveness of the employment of ground forces.

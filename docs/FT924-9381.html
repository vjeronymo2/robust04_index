			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / People: Scotland takes the high road to attract upmarket tourists With the tabloid press in a frenzy over the Prince and Princess of Wales' failure to exchange glances during their trip to Korea, and the financial pages wondering whether Hanson will enter a bidding war to take over Ranks Hovis McDougall, who could blame Michael Shea (above) for opting for a quieter life as the head of an up-market Scottish tourist initiative? Now 55, Shea is about to step down as Hanson's head of political and governmental affairs, although he will remain a political consultant to the group. Before joining Hanson in 1987, he was the Queen's press secretary. He has now been appointed chairman of Connoisseurs Scotland, a newly-formed private company. Backed by Scottish tourism organisations, it aims to market Scotland abroad as a high-quality destination. Connoisseurs Scotland's members - which include the Turnberry Hotel, the St Andrews Old Course Hotel, and the Gleneagles Hotel - have decided to put their rivalries aside in an attempt to entice more high-spenders to Scotland. Shea is already chairman of Scotland in Europe, the public sector body that helps Scottish companies find continental partners, and is a visiting professor at the University of Strathclyde's graduate business school. A former diplomat, and speaker of French, German and Romanian, Shea has written 14 books, including Influence (or how to work the system) and Leadership Rules, which explains the role of public relations in the making of leaders.</p>

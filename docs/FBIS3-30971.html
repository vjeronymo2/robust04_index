			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Warsaw, 12 Feb--At Saturday's meeting with  Western European Assembly Chairman Dudley Smith, National  Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk said that among the most  important problems that the Armed Forces of the Polish Republic  is facing are the process of restructuring the Army, integration  with the European security system, and technical development of  the forces that are connected with it.    Kolodziejczyk stated that no breakthrough was made in  technological cooperation with the West. Asked by Smith about  the budget of the Ministry of National Defense, Kolodziejczyk  stated that it was insufficient to maintain the current  technical state of the Army and to ensure proper training of the  forces. According to Kolodziejczyk, such a budget also  precludes an even deployment of the forces, according to the  principle of equal security of borders. The Polish minister  expressed hope that the Partnership for Peace initiative was not  only leading to NATO but also to the WEU [Western European  Union].    The chairman of the WEU Assembly, who is participating in a  two-day seminar in Poland entitled "The WEU Look at the Security  of Central and Eastern European Countries", said in a  conversation with Kolodziejczyk that he hoped Poland and other  countries in Central and Eastern Europe would be granted  affiliated status this coming May. He also stated that he would  like central Europe to start to acquire "the same significance  as western Europe". [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Sharp rise seen in orders for manufacturers BRITISH manufacturing industry is experiencing 'considerable growth' of output and orders, the latest monthly survey of UK purchasing managers shows. The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply said its purchasing managers' index rose from 51.2 per cent in February to 53.9 per cent last month. The index, based on a weighted average of movements of several components, including new orders, output and employment, was above the 50 per cent level that indicates expansion in the manufacturing economy for the second consecutive month. The output and order components of the index rose sharply in March and have now indicated increasing levels of manufacturing activity and new orders from home and abroad for five consecutive months. The output index rose to 58.6 per cent in last month from 53.8 per cent in February, while the new-orders index advanced to 57.1 per cent from 53.9 per cent. The institute, which says it represents UK purchasing managers with overall spending power of Pounds 250bn a year, said many companies had reported an improvement in foreign and domestic trade that exceeded normal seasonal trends. However, the recovery in industry's fortunes has yet to have a positive impact on employment. The employment index increased slightly last month to 47.2 per cent from February's 46.1 per cent.  ------------------------------------------------------------ CLIMB IN PRODUCTION AND ORDERS  ------------------------------------------------------------                            Output Month         PMI*(%)    Index(%)  ------------------------------------------------------------ Sep 92           45.1        44.8 Oct 92           47.7       50.00 Nov 92           49.5        53.4 Dec 92           49.2        52.8 Jan 93           49.3        50.2 Feb 93           51.2        53.8 Mar 93           53.9        58.6  ------------------------------------------------------------ *Purchasing Managers' Index.  ------------------------------------------------------------ Source: Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply  ------------------------------------------------------------</p>

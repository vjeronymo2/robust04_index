Computed wall pressure data are compared with wind tunnel  data to show that their agreement is quite good except for the  secondary post-shock value, although the analytical value agrees  quite well with the present computation.    This discrepancy may be due to a three-dimensional effect in  the wind tunnel experiments.    A comparison among numerical solutions for an inviscid flow  obtained by the use of several types of numerical flux  expressions indicates that solutions are strongly affected by  the flux scheme and a possible reason for this can be attributed  to the scheme's capability of resolving linear characteristic  waves.  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   A supersonic air intake is a device that efficiently  acquires  the air necessary for combustion in an air-breathing engine and  compresses it to the required pressure. Much research work has  been done in recent years including CFD. We here compare the  results of our two-dimensional mathematical analysis with test  results, and compare the numerical solutions based on several  schemes obtained during the analysis. We then consider what  effects the different schemes had on the solutions.  <H5>  2. Supersonic Air Intake </H5>   The model used in these calculations supports three modes,  namely a supercritical, a critical, and a subcritical mode (cf.  Figure 1). The restoration pressure is done [sic] most  efficiently in the critical state, and progressively less  efficiently as the degree of supercriticality increases. At  subcritical, it sometimes becomes impossible to obtain the  necessary flow volume. Accordingly, operation is normally done  in a supercritical state that is near-critical, with a margin  allowed prior to subcritical. When this is done, there is  interference between the boundary layer(s) and the final shock  wave inside the duct and this can trigger separation. If the  vortices induced by such separation become large enough, not  only is the flow pipe constricted so that the predicted pressure  restoration cannot be effected, but the final shock wave may be  pushed out so that a subcritical state is created. For this  reason, when designing an intake, it is necessary to reproduce  each of the modes that are determined by back pressure and find  out what the separation situation is.     <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-14A>           Figure 1. Supersonic Air Intake Operating Modes </FIG>    <H5>  3. Calculation Model, Calculation Conditions </H5>   In Figure 2 are diagrammed the shape of the model and the  calculation grid. A virtual variable-choke nozzle is provided  for the intake outlet so that any desired back-pressure can be  simulated.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-14B>           Figure 2. Calculation Model and Calculation Grid </FIG>      The main flow condition is sea-level Mach 2.  <H5>  4. </H5>   The basic equations used are the two-dimensional  Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations in which a two-layer  algebraic turbulence model is employed.[.sup]1[/]    We perform spatial integration using the finite volume  method, and implement second-order precision with MUSCL. For the  evaluation of convective factor flux at the cell boundary we use  Roe's approximate Rieman solver.[.sup]2[/] The viscosity  factor is discretized with the second-order precision central  differences.    Time integration is performed with the second-order  precision  rational Runge-Kutta method.[.sup]3[/]  <H5>  5. Boundary Conditions </H5>   As to the exit conditions inside the intake, supersonic  outflow conditions are imparted by setting the virtual nozzle.  Conventionally this should be connected to the intake downstream  at subsonic speed, but it is very difficult to set subsonic  outflow boundaries for flows containing vortices, and inevitably  a non-physics result is imparted. With the virtual nozzle the  back pressure can be controlled and it is possible to set simple  boundary conditions which make sense in terms of physics.  <H5>  6. Comparing Calculation Results Against Test Data </H5>   In Figure 3, at (a) through (c), are shown density  distributions at supercritical, critical, and subcritical  states. As can be seen, at supercritical and subcritical, when  the final shock wave becomes strong, the separation-induced  vortices are large, while at critical the vortices do not grow  all that much. The static pressure distribution at the lower  wall surface is depicted in Figure 4. In this figure the test  results for the supercritical state are represented by small  circles. Except for the pressure rise caused by the second shock  wave, the calculation results agree well with the test results.  The calculation results coincide with the two-dimensional  analysis solutions, so the differences in these results are  thought to be due either to three-dimensionality or to  measurement errors. The total pressure distribution inside the  intake is diagrammed in Figure 5. It is evident that  separation-vortex-induced distortion occurs close to the wall  surface.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-15A>           Figure 3. Density Distributions </FIG>       <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-15B>           Figure 4. Static Pressure Distribution at Lower </FIG>       <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-15C>            Figure 5. Total Pressure Distribution Inside Duct </FIG>      We found that, in the Eulerian calculations that were done  at  the initial stage of analysis, differences occurred in the  results with the Roe method and the van Leer  method.[.sup]4[/] We, therefore, added other schemes and did  the calculations using six different methods, and then compared  the results.    The first schemes we took up were the Roe method, van Leer  method, Osher method,[.sup]5[/] Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLLE)  method,[.sup]6[/] and modified Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLLEM)  method.[.sup]6[/] With the Roe method, furthermore, we  employed the Chakravarthy[.sup]7[/] and Lin[.sup]8[/]  techniques in order to satisfy the entropy conditions. With the  Roe method, it is necessary to add an artificial viscosity to  the characteristic velocity _l_[.sup]k[/] in order to prevent  expansion shock at points of sonic velocity. However, with the  Chakravarthy technique, the _l_[.sup]k+/-[/][.sup]i+1/2[/]  at the cell boundary obtained by Roe approximation is varied as  follows, namely, at sonic rarefaction  (_l_[.sup]k[/][.sup]i[/] &lt; 0 &lt;  _l_[.sup]k[/][.sup]i+1[/]),      <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-15D>           p&gt; With the Lin technique, there is a converging acceleration </FIG>    With the Lin technique, there is a converging acceleration  effect, and an effect which inhibits the carbuncle phenomenon by  which the Mach lines are distorted at the nose in hypersonic  calculations for blunt objects. We next represent the Lin method.      <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-15E>           Equation </FIG>    where       In these equations, u and a represent  the Roe-averaged velocity perpendicular to the cell boundary,  and the speed of sound, respectively. The factor  k[.sup]1[/] helps prevent expansion shock,  k[.sup]2[/] helps smooth out the shock wave(s),  and k[.sup]3[/] helps eliminate instability. The  k[.sup]p[/] factors are the same as those used in  stabilizing the convective factor calculation based on the  central differences of Jameson,[.sup]9[/] and are defined as  follows.     <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-16D>         Equation </FIG>   where p[.sup]i,j[/] is the pressure. At the    where p[.sup]i,j[/] is the pressure. At the  cell boundaries, we use averages of the values of adjacent  cells. The values of the constants are k[.sup]1[/]  = 0.25, 0  k[.sup]2[/]  5, and  k[.sup]3[/] = 15. Here we used  k[.sup]1[/] = 0.25, k[.sub]2[/] = 5,  and k[.sup]3[/] = 15.    We show the results of Eulerian calculations done in  relatively coarse meshes. The tip of the intake lip has become a  flat head having twice the thickness of the grid interval in  closest proximity to the wall (cf. Figure 6). By this means we  obtained interesting results. In Figures 7(a) through 7(f) are  depicted the density distributions based on the Roe  (Chakravarthy), Roe (Lin), Osher, HLLE, HLLEM, and van Leer  methods. The respective lower wall static pressure distributions  are plotted in Figure 8. We can divide these into three groups,  according to the separation conditions, namely (1) Roe  (Chakravarthy) and Osher, (2) Roe (Lin) and HLLEM, and (3) HLLE  and van Leer. In group (1), separation was caused by the final  shock wave, and the induced vortices pushed the shock waves  upstream, resulting in subcritical states. In group (2), slight  separation does occur, but there is convergence in the  supercritical state. In group (3), no separation occurs. The  entropy profile in the vicinity of the intake tip is represented  in Figures 9(a) and 9(b). Inside this high-entropy layer, the  velocity is slower than outside of it, resulting in a boundary  layer-like velocity distribution. We think that separation  occurs here due to a steep pressure gradient produced by the  final shock wave. The generation of the high-entropy layer  occurs when the tip angle is exceeded, and we do not think it  occurs when the tip is made sharper. The group (2) high-entropy  layers are thinner than those in group (1), for which reason we  do not think that large separation was reached. In group (3),  conversely, the high-entropy layer is thick and the peak is low.  We believe this is due to the fact that the linear wave  resolutions are inferior with scheme (3), as they are known to  be. Thus we think that the differences in local linear wave  resolution cause large changes in the numerical solutions.     <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-002C-16A>           Figure 6.

Concluding Remarks </H5>   We were able to simulate flows in each mode, without going  to  extremes, by using a virtual variable nozzle to control back  pressure. It is also possible to do unsteady calculations by  continuously varying the nozzle constriction. The results of  comparisons against test results were good, but we need -- and  in the future plan -- to work with systems of two equations on a  three-dimensionalized turbulence model in order to investigate  separation and vortices. With the inviscid flow calculations, we  compared convective-factor flux calculation schemes, and found  differences in the calculation results which appear to be caused  by linear wave resolution [differences].

			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: MESSIER EDGES BOURQUE FOR NHL'S MVP  </P> <P> Edmonton's Mark Messier stepped out of Wayne Gretzky's shadow Wednesday night  by winning the Hart Trophy as the NHL's most valuable player -- an award  dominated by his former teammate in the 1980s.  </P> <P> Messier beat out Boston defenseman Ray Bourque by two points in the closest  balloting ever for the trophy. St. Louis right wing Brett Hull was the other  finalist for the award that Gretzky won eight times with Edmonton and last year  with the Kings.  </P> <P> The voting is conducted by the Professional Hockey Writers Assn. before the  playoffs.  </P> <P> Bourque won the Norris Trophy as the NHL's top defenseman, and Hull, whose 72  goals set a league record for right wings, won the Lady Byng Trophy for  sportsmanship.  </P> <P> Montreal's Patrick Roy won the Vezina Trophy as the league's top goaltender for  the second consecutive year. And Soviet Sergei Makarov, who turns 32 later this  month, won the Calder Trophy as the rookie of the year.  </P></p>

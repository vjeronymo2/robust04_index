			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / People: Upheaval at Abbey National The departure of Stewart Gowans, 38, the man responsible for refurbishing Abbey National's public image, has precipitated an unusual amount of upheaval in Abbey National's public relations department. After seven years as head of corporate affairs at Abbey National, Gowans has set up his own consultancy - Meridian Corporate Communications. Along with partner Trevor Gardiner, he has taken offices in Leicester Square. Gowans, who had indicated some time ago that he intended to move on, quit in May and Paul Barber and Paul Burgen, two other members of Abbey's pr team, have left within the last month. Abbey National has decided to replace Gowans with an insider. Jane Ageros, 29, (below) a Cambridge classics graduate, joined Abbey in 1989, after working as a pr consultant with Broad Street Asso-ciates, the firm which handled Abbey's conversion to a public company and flotation. Leena Nagrecha has been appointed joint secretary of Abbey National Treasury Services in place of Ray Magan.</p>

			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TALK OF DRESS CODE IRRITATES AGASSI; CHANG GOES 5 SETS  </P> <P> Does the First Amendment work in France? Does it cover pink tights?  </P> <P> Andre Agassi struck a blow for freedom of speech as it applies to tennis  clothes Friday at the French Open, where he blasted his way into the fourth  round with a 6-3, 6-2, 6-0 victory over Frenchman Arnaud Boetsch.  </P> <P> That was all fairly routine. Then, in a rollicking postmatch news conference,  Agassi blasted the French Tennis Federation and its president, Philippe  Chatrier.  </P> <P> Why? Tacky, tacky. Chatrier was guilty of trying to censor Agassi's closet,  thus becoming Agassi's Mr. Blackwell.  </P> <P> Chatrier said his group is considering a dress code that would ban such  colorful garb as the faded black shorts and "hot lava" tights worn by Agassi.  </P> <P> He is considering adopting a "predominantly white" clothing rule for the French  Open.  </P> <P> Chatrier and the French Tennis Federation are "bozos," said Agassi.  </P> <P> Chatrier is also the president of the International Tennis Federation, which  governs the Grand Slam events, the Davis Cup and Olympic competition.  </P> <P> "There is growing concern about this issue," Chatrier said in a statement  released to the media during Agassi's match. "If players go too far in their  attire, then something will have to be done."  </P> <P> Agassi said he doesn't like it when someone tampers with his wardrobe.  </P> <P> "Those bozos will look for anyone to talk about," he said. "Let them talk. It's  some dull guys sitting behind a desk."  </P> <P> If it gets bad enough that the French Open stows his wardrobe on a hanger, then  Agassi said he may not be back.  </P> <P> "That would be enough to consider if I'd play," he said.  </P> <P> Agassi's sartorial rage against the Establishment became the day's unexpected  highlight, certainly a lot more interesting than his match against Boetsch, a  qualifier ranked No. 263, to Agassi's No. 5.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Michael Chang had anything but a routine day. The defending  champion dropped the first two sets to Christian Bergstrom of Sweden, then won  nine consecutive games as Bergstrom faded. Chang eventually won in 3 hours 42  minutes, 2-6, 5-7, 6-0, 6-2, 6-4. He will meet Javier Sanchez of Spain in the  fourth round.  </P> <P> Even when he was down two sets, Chang felt strangely relaxed.  </P> <P> "I kind of felt like no one expected me to come back and win, so it took a  little pressure off," Chang said.  </P> <P> Despite his defeat, Bergstrom was not totally sold on Chang's chances of  retaining his title.  </P> <P> "It's possible, but I think it will be very tough for him," Bergstrom said.  </P> <P> Jim Courier's chances do not get any easier now that he has reached the fourth  round. His opponent: Agassi.  </P> <P> As soon as Courier finished off Swedish-born Aussie Johan Anderson, 6-0, 6-2,  6-1, in a third-round match, he turned toward Coach Sergio Cruz and held up  three fingers.  </P> <P> Cruz, who left the Nick Bollettieri Academy with Courier to strike out on their  own, said the 19-year-old Floridian is a better player than he was at last  year's French Open.  </P> <P> "He's steadier, he's a bit more patient, he's mixing up his game," Cruz said.  "Last year, he was going for everything. This year, he is more concerned about  saving himself for when it is important."  </P> <P> And what could be more important than beating Agassi?  </P> <P> Courier did just that in the third round a year ago when he won a four-set  match carried over a day because of darkness. Afterward, Courier said he felt  he was playing in Agassi's shadow at the tennis academy, where Bollettieri  showered most of his attention on prize pupil Agassi.  </P> <P> Agassi responded by saying that Courier had "an inferiority complex," and a  feud was born.  </P> <P> "I can't wait to play him," Courier said.  </P> <P> Actually, Courier has gone out of his way to downplay any resentment toward  Agassi, who has remained with Bollettieri.  </P> <P> "Look, we're always going to be something of rivals because of our age  similarities, growing up as juniors and being pros together," Courier said.  "Nobody likes to lose, and that goes for when I play Andre."  </P> <P> Cruz explained Courier's feelings about Agassi: "He wants a place in the sun,  and Andre is in the way."  </P> <P> And Agassi does not plan to move. In fact, he handicapped his match with  Courier with more than his usual swagger. "I feel, to say the least, very  confident," Agassi said. "The longer it goes, the less his chances are."  </P> <P> As for Agassi's chance to continue wearing the clothes of his choice in the  fashion capital of the world, well, let's just say he may not have to alter his  plans yet.  </P> <P> There are no rules in place to cover permissible color of clothing except at  Wimbledon, where "predominantly white" is the law. And as we know, Agassi does  not play at Wimbledon.  </P> <P> So what if "predominantly white" becomes the rule at the French Open?  </P> <P> "Oh, well, that will be one Grand Slam tournament less to play next year," said  Agassi, who said fans should be the decision-makers in matters of acceptable  tennis clothes.  </P> <P> Agassi said he disdains wearing all-white tennis clothes. "I have to be honest,  that's tough for me to do," he said. "I'd still be the same person, but I'd  look more boring."  </P> <P> Colorful clothes have their place, Agassi said. They are fine on the court, but  when he hits the streets, Agassi dresses down to avoid attracting attention.  </P> <P> Agassi said he does not like to stand out in Paris, so instead he tries to  blend in.  </P> <P> "I dress like (Ivan) Lendl," he said.  </P> <P> French Open Notes  </P> <P> Steffi Graf, who pulled out of doubles competition because of sinusitis, got a  break Friday when her third-round singles match against Sandra Cecchini was  called off. Graf's match was to have been the fourth on center court, but it  was scratched for the day when the one before hers, Yannick Noah vs. Guillermo  Perez-Roldan, was still going at 7:15 p.m. because of rain delays. When that  match was finally suspended because of rain, Perez-Roldan led, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4,  4-6.  </P> <P> Fourth-seeded Gabriela Sabatini needed only 56 minutes to beat Nathalie  Herreman, 6-0, 6-1, and reach the fourth round. Sabatini was to have been  Graf's doubles partner. "It is better that I concentrate on singles anyway,"  Sabatini said. She will play Jana Novotna in the fourth round. Ninth-seeded  Conchita Martinez advanced to a fourth-round meeting with Wiltrud Probst, who  upset Zina Garrison in the first round.  </P> <P> Eighth-seeded Andrei Chesnokov, who will play Henri Leconte in the fourth  round, was as quirky as usual Friday. Chesnokov beat Jordi Arrese in straight  sets, then said he would only answer questions pertaining to the match. "I want  to go to the small swimming pool now," he said. "Then I want to take rest in  hotel. Nothing special. No drugs at all."  </P></p>

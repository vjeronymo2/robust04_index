This meeting is one of the  results of pressures for reform in Burma. The NCGUB also agrees  with U.S. Congressman Bill Richardson's proposal for a meeting  between Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the State Law and Order  Restoration Council [SLORC]. The NCGUB also firmly believes  that the political problems in Burma can only be resolved  through a comprehensive political dialogue and calls on the  international community to continue pressure on the SLORC until  this end is achieved.</p>

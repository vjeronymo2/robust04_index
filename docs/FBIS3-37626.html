			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Eduard Shevardnadze, chairman of the Georgian  Supreme Council and head of state, met Teodor Starcevic, the  head of the UN mission in Georgia, and supervisors of various UN  programs today. During the conversation the issue of the Geneva  talks on a peaceful settlement of the situation in Abkhazia,  which are to be held under the aegis of the United Nations, was  discussed. Also discussed was the forthcoming meeting between  the Georgian head of state and the UN secretary general at UN  Headquarters.    The Georgian head of state was informed about the results of  the activities of the mission during the past one and a half  years. It was emphasized that at the end of last year the UN  mission repeated its appeal for aid for Georgia. Various  countries have already responded to the appeal.    New aid programs are being drawn up. The UN mission has  planned certain measures aimed at improving the situation in the  spheres of shipping goods by railway, sea, and air. This will  ensure goods are shipped without losses and safely.  Specifically, the UN mission has purchased 10 diesel  locomotives that will make it easy to move goods in the  situation of severe fuel shortages not only in Georgia but also  in Armenia and Azerbaijan.    It was also indicated that UNICEF [UN Children's Fund] has  drafted a long-term program for shipping baby food, shipping  medicines for children, assisting children's hospitals, and  immunization.    At the end of the meeting, Eduard Shevardnadze thanked the  UN  mission and its head for what has been done. He requested that  to eliminate delays or losses of goods, private firms should be  excluded from humanitarian activities and only state structures  should be relied on. Shevardnadze emphasized that diesel  locomotives purchased for the Georgian railways would eliminate  problems not only from our country, but also from Armenia and  Azerbaijan.    A letter was sent to UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali  requesting speedier UN participation in the settlement of the  Abkhazian conflict.</p>

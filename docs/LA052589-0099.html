			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Malibu business leaders who elected Martin Sheen honorary mayor last month,  looking forward to a little high-profile promotion, are now talking about  "impeaching" him and replacing him with Johnny Carson. The Malibu Chamber of  Commerce picked Sheen last month to promote its "Shop Malibu" campaign and to  make appearances at civic affairs. Instead, the actor, known for his liberal  activism, declared Malibu a nuclear-free zone. The recall drive gained momentum  when Sheen called for the beachside haven of the stars to become a "sanctuary  for aliens and the homeless." Meanwhile, the roadside marquee for the Malibu  Inn and Restaurant, which last week urged "Dump Martin Sheen," read earlier  this week: "Johnny for Mayor." Carson says he's not interested in any  mayorship, honorary or otherwise. Claudia Puig  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Anna Melnikova and Gennadiy </F> Yezhov]    [Text] Moscow April 15 TASS -- "The CIS summit, which is  about to end here, can already be described as successful,"  presidential press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov told a press  conference at "President-Hotel" here today. He noted that the  successful solution of the problem of guarding the external  borders of the CIS testified to a new understanding of the idea  of the commonwealth's unity. "It can already be said that we are  nearing the finishing line. A joint memorandum on the  participation of CIS members in the protection of the external  borders in the Central Asian region and also a memorandum on the  protection of external borders with Ukraine and Belarus has  already been signed. Corresponding documents are ready to be  signed."    "Thus," Kostikov said, "the system of a single guarded  border  is being restored. Moldova is expected to join this memorandum."    Asked about Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev's  initiative to set up a Euro-Asian Union, Kostikov said with  certainty: "As far as I known, this problem was not raised in  any of the speeches as it was formulated by the Kazakh  president."    Kostikov said that President Yeltsin rounded off the summit  meeting by saying: "Let's take upon ourselves as much  cooperation as it is in the interests of our states."</p>

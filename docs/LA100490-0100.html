			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STRICTER SCHOOL DRESS CODE WEIGHED;  </P> <P> GANGS: NORWALK-LA MIRADA OFFICIALS LOOK FOR WAYS TO PREVENT CONFRONTATIONS ON  CAMPUS.  </P> <P> Officials in the Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District are re-examining an  8-year-old clothing and grooming policy for ways to limit gang dress to reduce  gang confrontations at school.  </P> <P> The officials hope a stricter dress code will prevent students from identifying  one another as gang members on their way to and from school and in classrooms.  </P> <P> The district's dress code requires students to be neat, clean and appropriately  dressed for school activities. The changes under consideration would ban  specific types of clothing associated with area gangs. Although gang fashion  varies, one common style is the hair net or bandana, oversized pants, and  untucked shirt with only the top button buttoned. The other extreme is black  shoes, carefully ironed pants and a white T-shirt.  </P> <P> The school board study arose after six gang-related killings occurred in the  Norwalk area in recent months, including one that claimed the life of a  12-year-old boy in late August.  </P> <P> Norwalk had about 2,000 gang members, according to a Sheriff's Department  estimate last year.  </P> <P> All schools in the district already have some form of dress guidelines, said  Chris Roubidoux, director of elementary education. Some of them, for example,  prohibit the use of caps and hair nets.  </P> <P> At a board meeting Monday, members suggested ways to focus the study. President  William A. White suggested helping families adjust to the new look expected of  their children. Board member Lupe Flores-McClintock requested information on  other school districts that have dress codes, and their effectiveness.  </P> <P> More than a year ago, the ABC Unified School District approved a dress code to  protect students from gangs both on and off school grounds. The Long Beach  Unified School District also has restrictions on gang attire.  </P> <P> But Elias Galvan, director of secondary education in the Norwalk-La Mirada  district, cautioned that a dress code only "begins to address the problem" of  gang violence. "Communicating with youngsters and their parents is the answer."  </P> <P> Discussion with the school board, staff, parents and the community is expected  to continue through this month, and the board is expected to draft a policy in  November. The code, if approved, would take effect next year.  </P> <P> In other action, David Plaza spoke on the Norwalk Alternatives to Gangs  Program, a new 15-week curriculum geared to fourth-graders. Plaza, who will  teach the program, said research has shown the fourth grade to be the most  vulnerable age when it comes to gang influence. "By the fifth and sixth grade,  (they have) already experimented with gangs and drugs," he added.  </P> <P> The program is due to start in Moffitt, Nottingham and Edmondson elementary  schools the week of Oct. 22.  </P> <P> Also discussed was a drug and alcohol prevention program for fourth-graders  that is due to go to the classrooms in January.  </P></p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Shoprite shares fall on further profits warning Shoprite, the discount food retailing chain which operates mainly in Scotland, yesterday issued its second profits warning in four months, saying it expected only to break even at operating level this year. Shares in the Isle of Man-based group fell 4p to 28p as it issued a statement warning that trading was still 'very difficult'. Shoprite's shares peaked at 243p in February, when they were the best performers in the food retailing sector, but slumped after the group rushed out its interim results prematurely in May because they were below expectations. After a planned sale and leaseback deal on stores fell through in June, Shoprite said in July it was cutting back its store expansion, selling non-core assets, and expected full-year profits to be significantly below last year. Mr Charles Good, managing director for Scotland, said yesterday that as the group now looked likely only to break even at operating level in the year to October 30, it had decided to issue a further statement. Shoprite, a classic 'hard' discounter with more than 80 stores in Scotland selling a limited number of goods in no-frills surroundings, has suffered badly from the intense price competition - centred on basic goods - in the grocery market over the past year. Mr Good said trading had remained 'extremely difficult' over the summer, although he was pleased with the results of Shoprite's latest initiatives, including a television advertising campaign, repositioning of its product range, and further price cuts on basic products. 'We have got to hope that we have been through the trough,' he said. He added that the disposal programme was progressing 'satisfactorily' with some significant deals in the pipeline.</p>

Speaking of the work for May and June, he pointed out: While  exercising strict control over credit volume, the scale of fixed  assets in particular, Shanghai will try its best to meet the  needs of circulation funds of those state-owned industrial  enterprises turning out marketable products, offer help to those  state-owned enterprises that have a good chance of switching  from red to black, and work together with competent authorities  in helping enterprises which have suffered losses for a long  time and, for the time being, are in no position to repay the  loans so that the basic needs of their workers' livelihood are  ensured. Meanwhile, more credits will be made available to  pillar industries in suburban counties, foreign trade and export  enterprises, and other newly emerged growth sectors.    Deposits at the various specialized banks in Shanghai have  increased by 22.63 billion yuan this year, up 85 percent over  the corresponding 1993 period. Of which, the accumulated  increase of urban savings deposits rose by a record 10.9 billion  yuan, showing an increase of 23.9 billion yuan.

Funding needs for the power, cotton, steel industries, and for  reserve funds of daily necessities as grain, edible oil, and  non- staple foodstuffs were also met in timely fashion.    In addition to implementing reform of the banking structure  in orderly fashion this year, Shanghai has expanded efforts in  developing the market and opening up wider to the outside world.  The China Foreign Exchange Trading Center, which Shanghai  undertook to set up, has hooked up with 12 cities since it  officially went into operation on 4 April; over the past month  and more, transaction prices have been stable and the total  volume of turnover was US$3 billion and HK$2.66 billion.

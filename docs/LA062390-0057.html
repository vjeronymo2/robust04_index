			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAN QUAKE TOLL REACHES 29,000;  </P> <P> DISASTER: INTERNATIONAL HELP POURING IN TO DEVASTATED REGION. THE RED CROSS  SAYS 400,000 MAY BE HOMELESS.  </P> <P> International rescue and medical teams poured into the Iranian capital Friday  as rescue workers and dazed survivors struggled to dig thousands of dead and  injured from the rubble of the devastatingly powerful earthquake in northwest  Iran and the official death toll rose to nearly 29,000 -- the highest for an  earthquake in 14 years.  </P> <P> A dozen towns and hundreds of villages were devastated by the temblor that  spread across two provinces of a broad agricultural region near the Caspian Sea  early Thursday. The Red Cross in Geneva, quoting the Iranian Red Crescent  Society, said about 400,000 people are believed homeless.  </P> <P> Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported Friday that the  known dead number 28,950. It said 25,241 bodies have been counted in Gilan  province, on the Caspian Sea, and 3,709 in Zanjan province. That toll surpasses  the 25,000 killed in Soviet Armenia in December, 1988, and is the highest known  worldwide since July, 1976, when an earthquake in China reportedly killed  242,000.  </P> <P> The U.N. Disaster Relief Organization in Geneva said it was told by the Iranian  Foreign Ministry that the death toll is expected to reach 35,000, with 105,000  people injured. A total of 28,198 people were injured in the two provinces,  IRNA said.  </P> <P> More shocks followed the big quake. Interior Minister Abdullah Nouri said a  main road in the disaster zone, cleared Thursday, was blocked by a fresh  landslide Friday, wire services reported.  </P> <P> President Hashemi Rafsanjani visited the hardest-hit area, including the town  of Roudbar in the Caspian province of Gilan. He said "nothing worth mentioning"  was left of towns and villages he saw during a helicopter flight over the quake  zone. Gilan province and adjoining Zanjan have a population of about 4 million  people.  </P> <P> He told reporters that Iran, proud of its self-reliance since Ayatollah  Ruhollah Khomeini's 1979 Islamic Revolution, would accept foreign help for  quake victims.  </P> <P> "The catastrophe is so serious . . . " Rafsanjani told IRNA. "International  help is needed. We should accept the help that is offered."  </P> <P> However, Iranian authorities appeared to vacillate Friday between welcoming the  outside help -- including representatives from countries with which Iran has a  hostile relationship -- and rejecting it as unnecessary.  </P> <P> Four of Iran's bitter enemies -- the United States, Israel, Iraq and Saudi  Arabia -- sent offers to help. In Washington, State Department officials said  the U.S. government is donating about $300,000 worth of supplies to the  American Red Cross for shipment.  </P> <P> The first team to arrive in Tehran from the international medical relief  organization, Medicins du Monde, was blocked from entering the main earthquake  area by authorities.  </P> <P> "My biggest fear is that we will not be allowed to work," said Dr. Jean  Porrini, leader of the 12-person unit that included a surgical team. "We are  getting very contradictory information from the ground. The first team we sent  in was apparently blocked."  </P> <P> Disaster specialists from France, Switzerland, Belgium and Britain arrived late  Friday night on commercial flights and special charters. They carried equipment  ranging from a complete field surgical theater to satellite communication  discs. Several arrived with dogs specially trained to sniff through rubble for  the trapped victims.  </P> <P> Some rescuers such as a 17-member International Rescue Corps of Marlow,  England, brought sophisticated heat-sensing and sound detection equipment that  the Iranians do not have.  </P> <P> The International Rescue Corps team from England brought its own satellite  transmission system after encountering serious communication problems working  in Armenia during the earthquake there last year. However, although they were  sponsored on the trip to Iran by an agency of the United Nations, team leader  Bryan Kirby said Friday he was not sure the group would be allowed to set up in  Iranian territory.  </P> <P> "We would like to work tonight if they would let us," said Kirby, "but we  haven't been able to get any reliable information. We have casualty estimates  of from 1,000 to 37,000 dead over a wide area of Iran."  </P> <P> One crowded commercial flight to the Iranian capital from Paris was filled with  worried Iranians hoping to find their families.  </P> <P> "I was sitting in my hotel room in Paris and saw the home where I was born  completely destroyed," said one Iranian man. "I was horrified, but what could I  do?"  </P> <P> Rafsanjani said the greatest need is for heavy equipment -- especially cranes  to lift huge pieces of rubble.  </P> <P> Iran told the Swiss-based League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies that  it needs medicine, tents, blankets, food, trucks, cranes and bulldozers. It  said it does not need doctors and other experts or blood supplies, sniffer dogs  or used clothing.  </P> <P> Iranian television showed doctors tending victims on stretchers in a makeshift  hospital in a parking lot. Masked rescuers in white aprons pulled dust-covered  bodies from under concrete slabs. Corpses were laid on blocks of ice in open  trucks.  </P> <P> Television showed scenes of devastation, including the remains of an entire row  of hillside village houses that collapsed and slid down the hill.  </P> <P> Rescuers scooped up rubble and used police dogs to find victims. They gently  fed water to one man who was trapped in a mass of stones and earth, only his  head protruding.  </P> <P> At Manjil in Gilan province, Parvin Nemati clutched the headless body of one  daughter wrapped in a blanket. Her husband and relief workers unearthed the  body of another daughter, 10-year-old Fatemeh, an Iranian correspondent  reported.  </P> <P> A man in Roudbar told Iranian television "a rock as big as a building" crashed  into his home, killing four of his six children. His wife said she lay in the  ruins for hours with one of the surviving children beside her.  </P> <P> "There is not a single house in this area which has been left standing," farmer  Ali Mohammadi said in Roudbar.  </P> <P> Television showed villagers looking at houses turned into heaps of mud bricks  and wooden beams by the quake, which was measured at a magnitude of 7.3 by  Tehran University; the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., put it at 7.7.  </P> <P> Farhad Shad, a spokesman for the Geophysics Center at Tehran University, told  IRNA that 140 aftershocks were registered after the main temblor.  </P> <P> Hospitals overflowed with victims. Tehran Radio said some of the injured were  flown 600 miles from the disaster zone for treatment.  </P> <P> At the large Khomeini Hospital south of Tehran, a continuous line of ambulances  drew up to the doors bearing victims from the earthquake. Doctors at the  hospital said most of the victims suffered crushed bones and head injuries.  </P> <P> A young mother hovered over her pale 4-month old baby.  </P> <P> "The baby was asleep with my husband when the earthquake started. I grabbed him  and started to run outside, but a wall fell on us and crushed his head," she  said.  </P> <P> The attending doctor said the young baby girl, Nadia, had suffered multiple  fractures of her skull and that her intelligence would probably be impaired as  a result.  </P> <P> Fourteen of the hospital's physicians had been dispatched to the earthquake  area itself.  </P> <P> Tehran airport was thronged with people trying to reach the quake zone to learn  the fate of relatives. Officials turned them back, saying the planes were  needed for relief workers.  </P> <P> This report was supplemented with reports from Times wire services.  </P></p>

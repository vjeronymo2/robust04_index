			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / BA in talks to avert strike BRITISH AIRWAYS flights are expected to operate normally this weekend in spite of a vote yesterday by the company's cabin crew and ground staff in favour of a strike, writes Robert Taylor. The TGWU general union said 'no hasty decisions' would be taken and there was no 'gung-ho mood'. Talks were continuing with BA in an attempt to resolve differences over alleged threats to cut pay and change employment conditions in newly formed BA subsidiaries. In a postal ballot with a turnout of only 51 per cent, 62 per cent of those who voted backed the union's call for a strike. Industrial action short of a strike was supported by 84 per cent. BA said it was 'disappointed' at the ballot result, but added that the low response showed there was 'no clear mandate for strike action'.</p>

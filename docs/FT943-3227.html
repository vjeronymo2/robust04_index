			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Political Notebook: Mr Jenkins' ghost at the Treasury So that's it. A large chunk of the Conservative party is living in 'cloud-cuckooland'. Those on the Tory backbenches foolish enough to join local activists in demanding tax cuts are not engaged in serious politics. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the man who actually decides what comes out of Gladstone's Budget box at the end of November, has spoken. His party should stop whining. The significance of the chancellor's words on taxes and his action on interest rates runs deeper than his obvious concern to massage pre-Budget expectations. Most in the Conservative party do not yet realise it but Mr Clarke quite deliberately crossed a political Rubicon this week. He has rewritten the government's electoral strategy. Viewed from 11 Downing Street the Tories' hopes of clawing back its unprecedented 34-point deficit in the opinion polls now rest on delivering year in, year out, precisely what the chancellor has promised: steady growth and low inflation. There can be no quick tax fixes, no loosening of the monetary reins. Everything is staked on an unexciting but durable economic recovery and a return to sound public finances. Competence and credibility are to be put before transparently crude electoral bribes. It must be said that as far as this year goes the chancellor was stating the obvious. No one with any sense at Westminster expected tax cuts in November. Nor is there any prospect of a reversal of the increases already in the pipeline. Public borrowing should undershoot the official Pounds 36bn forecast but the Treasury will still spend about Pounds 30bn more than it collects in taxes. So for all the talk about rifts between neighbours, Mr John Major is as persuaded as his loquacious chancellor that now is not the moment for tax handouts. As for this week's rise in interest rates, Mr Major had no choice. Prime ministers never like higher borrowing costs. The present one, facing the deepest electoral chasm since opinion polling began, must really hate them. But that is to miss the point. Mr Major sold the pass when he agreed to allow publication of the minutes of Mr Clarke's monthly chats with Mr Eddie George, the Bank of England governor. The conventional wisdom is that publication had weakened the Treasury's position vis-a-vis the Bank of England. That is true, although it is important to distinguish the official Treasury - which invariably shares the Bank's judgment - from the chancellor of the day - who may well not. But the important implication of the change is that it removes the prime minister's power of veto. Once the chancellor and bank governor are seen to agree the occupant of Number 10 cannot demur. So those searching for Downing Street conflicts, real or imagined, should look to the stance of fiscal policy as the point of tension. Not now, but in November 1995 or 1996. Mr Clarke has absorbed the Treasury orthodoxy that serious tax-cutting may well be impossible before a general election due by the spring of 1997 at the latest. He has concluded that delay might turn out to be good politics as well as prudent economics. After the broken promises of 1992 the voters do not believe this government. Much better then to go into an election with the public finances in strong enough shape to allow a credible promise of tax cuts that will stick, than to try to con the voters with a transparently temporary cut before polling day. There is a broader political strategy here. In Mr Clarke's mind the government must do three things before the election if it is to have a hope in hell of winning. Alongside the recovery, the voters need to feel secure that it will last. Then they must be convinced that next time the government for once will deliver on its manifesto promises. It all sounds pretty sensible stuff. But of course there is a catch. What may sound perfectly logical from a politician with a reputation for keeping his nerve may not hold quite the same appeal for a party terrified of electoral defeat. If Mr Clarke is not careful people will soon be drawing comparisons with the then Mr Roy Jenkins' stewardship of the Treasury in the late 1960s. He balanced the budget and lost the Labour government the 1970 election. The briefest glance at the agenda for the annual Tory conference in Bournemouth next month reveals the depth of the angst among the party's footsoldiers. Local activists still willing to tramp the streets in support of the most unpopular government in living memory want some good news to sell. They are fed up telling a disbelieving and disgruntled electorate to bide their time. Those with a preference for bribery over hair-shirt economics will find plenty of allies around the cabinet table. When the time comes Mr Major may be among them. Mr Clarke, of course, hopes the choice will not be necessary, that public borrowing will come down fast enough to remove the contradiction between fiscal prudence and tax cuts. There is a good chance it will. If not? Well Mr Major could always promote Mr Clarke to the Foreign Office when Mr Douglas Hurd stands down in a year or so.</p>

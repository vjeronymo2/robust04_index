			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Markets (Serious Money): Putting the case for equities MANY PRIVATE investors will be disillusioned with shares. If they were sucked in at the top of the bull market in 1987, they will still have seen only a small profit after five years. And of course, many will have sold out immediately after the Crash, at a loss, and vowed never to touch equities again. Now there are some interesting alternatives to shares, such as National Savings and index-linked gilts. But for those who intend to live off their savings for a long period, history shows that it would be foolish to ignore equities altogether. For periods of a decade or more, they beat building society returns by a street. It is one thing to decide to invest in shares; quite another thing to know how to go about it. Over the next few pages, we suggest both the practicalities and a variety of strategies for stock picking. Picking your own stocks probably requires an equity portfolio of at least Pounds 10,000 and many would argue that Pounds 25,000 or more is required. For those with less than that sum, or those who do not want the aggravation of making their own stock selections, an investment or a unit trust is the sensible route into equities. In the last financial year, investment trusts were the fashionable vehicle. Investors seized the chance to put Pounds 6,000 into new issues and qualify for the full Personal Equity Plan allowance, while existing trusts were limited to Pounds 3,000: 21 trusts raised a total of Pounds 780m. This was a classic case of tax relief distorting a market, rather as life assurance premium relief once steered investors towards endowments. Now that the distortion has been removed, and the political prospects for the next five years are stable, it may be a time for a rethink of some of last year's investment decisions. Broker Credit Lyonnais Laing, in its new yearbook for 1992, is dubious about the merits of some of the 1991-92 new issues and believes that the bubble may be about to burst. Analyst Peter Walls worries that 'sophisticated capital structures were used to convince relatively unsophisticated investors that discounts are irrelevant.' The point here is that the market value of investment trusts and the value of their portfolios are not the same thing. The price of investment shares is set by supply and demand, and can move up and down even though the assets in the portfolio are unchanged. Traditionally, the value of the investment trust shares has been lower than that of the portfolio. In the jargon, the shares trade at a discount. Say the trust had 100m shares and assets of Pounds 100m. Assets per share would be 100p, but the share price might trade at 90p, a discount of 10 per cent. Buying investment trust shares at a discount thus allows the investor to get extra assets for his or her money. But many of the new issues have been trading at a premium to their asset values. In other words, investors are paying, say, 100p, for assets of 90p. The argument has been that by creating a split capital structure - issuing separate classes of shares for income and capital growth - trusts have increased overall demand for their shares and thus eliminated the problem of the discount. Walls argues that this might be an illusion. When one lumps all the split capital shares together, you end up with a conventional investment trust. This is especially true for investors who bought a package of split shares; they have the equivalent of an ordinary share in a conventional investment trust. The conundrum therefore is: why own package shares in a split capital issue at a premium, when one can buy shares in a conventional investment trust at a discount? As Walls expresses it, the investor knows 'that over the remaining life of the trust, the market value of the package has to underperform the underlying assets of the trust'. There was a sensible reason for buying such trusts last year, when the new issue was the only way of getting a tax free Pounds 6,000 portfolio. I felt at the time that the M&amp;G Income Trust had attractions to income-seeking investors, since it offered a 6.55 per cent tax free yield, the equivalent of 10.9 per cent gross to top rate taxpayers. The package shares now stand at 102p, slightly above the issue price of 100p. But they are trading at a premium to assets of 7 per cent. Now that the government has changed the rules, there is a case for transferring the sum into a conventional investment trust which is standing at a discount. You might see a short term drop in income, depending on the new trust selected, but transfer charges would be relatively low and long term capital growth might be higher (because of the discount effect). Whether or not a transfer seems sensible depends on how much of your portfolio is tied up in the trust. If it is a substantial proportion, then a transfer may provide a useful diversification of risk. If the investment is only a small proportion of your portfolio, then one may decide that M&amp;G is as likely to manage the money well as anyone else. And one should check the costs of any transfer very carefully; high charges would eliminate the potential benefits. These arguments apply to all the new issues of last year which are on a premium, not just M&amp;G Income. Changes in tax rules often require investors to be flexible about their portfolios.</p>

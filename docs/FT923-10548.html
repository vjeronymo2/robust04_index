			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): High-powered commercial slogans reach for the sky When the Boston police received several telephone calls last week reporting UFO sightings, they knew what to tell the panicked sky watchers - the strange object was not a UFO, it was a Virgin Lightship blimp. Dirigibles are making a comeback. Ten years ago, only Goodyear Tire and Rubber clung to that form of advertising. More recently two companies - Virgin Lightship and Airship International - have begun hiring out blimps as an advertising tool. Fuji Film now owns and runs its own dirigible, and Goodyear has added two more to its fleet. The popularity of dirigibles is based on more than just the romance of the past. Virgin Lightship runs three in the US and Europe. Besides Virgin Atlantic, clients for the dirigible include McDonald's restaurants of Canada, the telecommunications group MCI, Coca-Cola, Renault cars and the Daily Star of London. Virgin Lightship, which is based in Orlando, Florida, and Telford, England, was the brainchild of Richard Branson, a well-known balloon aficionado. Though smaller than others in the market, the company's dirigibles are the only ones lit from within, making them easily visible at night. The company's main competitor is Airship International, operating dirigibles for Metro Life Insurance and Anheuser Busch, which uses the blimp to advertise its Budweiser beer brand and Sea World, its amusement park in Florida. The Virgin blimp is producing results. The awareness of the airline in Boston, where the blimp was to be seen, after a month of marketing was four times greater than in Los Angeles, where it was not seen. Goodyear has also found its blimps effective. 'Name recognition for our company goes up at least 10 per cent after our blimp has spent two to three weeks in a city,' said Micky Wittman, manager of the company's airship programme. 'We get a lot of attention from the press,' said Ms Ingraham of Virgin Atlantic. 'And, of course, we love the UFO sightings.' Dirigibles are expensive to operate - between Dollars 150,000 and Dollars 250,000 a month. But companies say the money is worth it because of deals with television companies. Dirigibles make perfect television camera platforms. They are petrol-efficient, can stay up almost indefinitely, and are steadier than helicopters.</p>

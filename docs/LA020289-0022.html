			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR WHEELS: AGENCY MAY OFFER HELP IN THE CLUTCH  </P> <P> Question: I am having a big dispute with a service garage over a new clutch  that they installed in my Ford Mustang. They claim that they can't guarantee a  clutch because it could be ruined by the way I drive. But it failed after only  one day, and I think they just botched the job. I am out $375. Is there  anything I can do? -- B.C.  </P> <P> Answer: It is true that a motorist can so badly mistreat a clutch that it will  quickly fail, but a brand-new clutch almost never fails in a single day.  Moreover, unless the clutch lining was worn out, you have a very strong case to  pursue.  </P> <P> Almost every state, including California, has a government agency set up to  help motorists with repair disputes. With all the problems motorists are having  getting today's complicated cars fixed, you can imagine that these government  offices are swamped. Still, they are often able to help.  </P> <P> In California, you need to contact the Bureau of Automotive Repair, which  licenses and regulates automobile repair facilities. Their areas of  jurisdiction include whether repairs were properly made and whether they were  properly priced. Their toll-free telephone number is (800) 952-5210. The agency  has 10 operators on duty, in addition to 21 offices around the state where a  motorist can walk in and file a complaint. They typically handle more than 100  complaints a day.  </P> <P> After receiving a complaint, the agency contacts the motorist to get his side  of the story and then contacts the repair garage. Because it is in charge of  regulating and licensing the garages, the agency has some clout in getting the  garages to agree to reasonable settlements.  </P> <P> The bureau does not get involved in new-car warranty disputes; those are  handled by a different state agency. And problems in registration disputes are  handled by yet another agency, the Department of Motor Vehicles.  </P> <P> If you don't resolve your dispute through the Bureau of Automotive Repair, you  can always sue in small claims court. It's a lot easier than you think. Under  state law, the garage is not allowed to hire an attorney and neither are you,  so it is a fair contest of your allegations against the garage's defense.  </P> <P> Q: My 1982 Toyota Corolla fails to restart after it is warmed up. The dealer  has checked the battery, changed the cable from the battery to the starter and  changed the starter. It seems worse in hot weather. Do you have any ideas? --  E.V.  </P> <P> A: Hot restart problems in which the engine does not turn over are generally  traceable to a poor electrical connection in the high-amperage cables that  carry current from the battery to the starter. You say that the lead from the  battery to the starter was replaced, but you should also change the ground  cable from the battery to the body. It is also possible that the electrical  charging system was checked out but that the battery is not capable of putting  out adequate current. Hot weather imposes a big load on the battery because  resistance in the cable and electrical connections rise.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Update  </P> <P> A motorist recently wrote that his Audi, equipped with a fuel-injection system,  had been running poorly and that a mechanic said his combustion chambers needed  to have the carbon cleaned out. Audi has strongly recommended that its owners  use gasoline that contains detergents, which help keep fuel-injection systems  and combustion chambers clean. In addition, Audi dealers will clean engine and  fuel-injection system carbon deposits one time at no charge. Some Audi owners  have received notices in the mail. If you have any problems getting this  service, you should contact Audi's factory representatives.  </P></p>

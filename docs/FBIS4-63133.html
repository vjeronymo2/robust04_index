			<p>BFN     [Text] Tbilisi (DPA) -- According to Georgian Foreign  Minister Aleksandr Chikvaidze, the West should back the former  Soviet republics against Russia. This is what he said in a talk  with Hans-Jochen Vogel, former chairman of the Social Democratic  Party of Germany [SPD], in Tbilisi on 6 May. "Our republics  need support; then Russia will also take them into  consideration," he said. The foreign minister suggested "a  program of the West comparable to the Marshall Plan for setting  up market economy infrastructures." He said that this was  particularly necessary for the "explosive" Caucasus region.    Following his two-day visit to Tbilisi where he also met  with  chief of state Eduard Shevardnadze, Vogel planned to fly on to  Moldova on 6 May.</p>

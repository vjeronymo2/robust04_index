			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> CUSTOMER, SHOT BY GUARD IN DISPUTE OVER A 10-CENT LIME, WINS $440,000  </P> <P> A man shot by a supermarket security guard in an argument over a 10-cent lime  was awarded $440,000 by a Dade County Circuit Court jury.  </P> <P> Joseph Climpson, 35, sued the market, the guard and the Nationwide Personal  Security Corp. In a four-day trial, six jurors found all three responsible last  week.  </P> <P> On Feb. 7, 1987, Climpson went to the Food Giant store to buy 10 limes for $1.  In the parking lot outside, he counted his purchase and found only nine limes.  </P> <P> He returned, demanded another one and got into an argument with the cashier.  Then he stalked out with a 10th lime in hand.  </P> <P> Convinced that the cashier had made an accurate count, security guard Hugo Lino  Salazar, 40, followed Climpson outside. The guard unholstered his gun and fired  twice.  </P></p>

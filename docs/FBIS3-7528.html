At the meeting, expected to last until Tuesday, South Korea  wants to confirm that Russia will assume responsibility for  repaying economic cooperation loans that Seoul extended to the  former Soviet Union, according to government officials.    South Korea will also press Russia to repay arrears on the  loans totaling 390 million U.S. dollars outstanding at the end  of last year, the officials said.    Rough sailing is expected at the meeting, however, as Moscow  is likely to request a further delay in making payments, they  said.    South Korea agreed to extend 3 billion dollars in economic  cooperation loans to the former Soviet Union in 1990. Of that  amount, it offered 1.47 billion dollars including 470 million  dollars in tied loans.    Russia paid back only 17 million dollars in cash and another  13 million dollars in aluminum ingots in 1992. Since then,  Moscow has kept postponing any payment on interest or principle,  the officials said.    The Russian delegation to the meeting, led by Vice External  Economy Minister M.E. Fradkov, planned to confirm Russia's  responsibility for the loans while asking for a grace period  similar to that given by the Paris Club of creditors.    The Paris Club, comprised of 19 Western creditor nations,  agreed last April to extend a grace period requiring Russia to  pay back by September 1993 some 50 percent of arrears and  principal of their loans outstanding at the end of 1992. Russia  is to pay back the rest over five years with a two-year grace  period.    The Seoul government, taking into consideration Russia's  economic difficulties, is studying a plan under which Moscow  could make payments in commodities and in the form of a lease on  land on which South Korea is building a trade center, the  officials said.    The trade center, being pushed by the Korea Foreign Trade  Association, is to be built on a 2.5-hectare plot near Moscow  University and Russia is asking a lease of 50 million dollars a  year, they said.</p>

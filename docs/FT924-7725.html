			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / UK Company News: A Yorkshireman's idea of glasnost - 'If we can't avoid it, let's . . . put all issues on the table'. Neil Buckley reports on British Gas THERE is more than a touch of Yorkshire bluntness to Mr Cedric Brown's description of the management culture of British Gas. 'Bureaucratic, slow-moving, committee-ridden, resistant to change,' is what can only be described as his no-nonsense assessment. These criticisms are not new, but to hear them from the man responsible for the day-to-day running of British Gas is new, and may presage more sweeping change ahead. Indeed, Mr Brown uses the word 'change' almost as often as Mr Bill Clinton. British Gas reports its third-quarter results this week, and most analysts are forecasting losses of between Pounds 90m and Pounds 200m for what is traditionally a low-demand period. Net income for the year is still expected to be about about Pounds 1bn; but beyond that British Gas faces great uncertainty as the structure of the UK gas market changes. In his first interview since taking over as chief executive in August, Mr Brown told the Financial Times that his biggest challenge was to change the culture of British Gas. The attack of glasnost that has broken out in the company is the first stage of that process - something the 57-year-old Yorkshireman, who began his career as a gas distribution engineer in 1953, is happy to take personal credit for. 'If it had been a corporate desire, if it had been discussed, the British Gas culture would have taken over and the words would have been different words, and there would have been a lot of paddling around, and it would never have emerged.' The most significant changes that may be imposed on British Gas are outside the company's control, but Mr Brown was largely responsible for the decision to put the company in this position. The day before he officially took over as chief executive, he announced that British Gas had taken the unprecedented step of submitting itself, and the whole of the UK gas market, to a wide-ranging inquiry by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The move, he says, was a reaction to 'piecemeal' regulatory changes imposed by Sir James McKinnon, the industry regulator, and the Office of Fair Trading, which left the company facing deep uncertainty over its future. Although Sir James was already proposing a reference to the MMC on the issue of the rate of return British Gas could earn on its pipeline and storage business, Mr Brown feels he seized the initiative by seeking a comprehensive inquiry. 'My feeling was, if we can't avoid it, let's have one reference that puts all the issues on the table, and let's see where that gets us. 'At the end we might not like the answer, but at least we might then be out of the uncertainty.' Other than defending its record, Mr Brown is not prepared to say what British Gas will be telling the MMC. But he accepts the possibility that the commission could order a radical shake-up of the company, even its break-up. 'We view the inquiry positively. We will face up to whatever they say. By nature I'm an optimist, so whatever comes out I will view it optimistically, because I see opportunities whatever.' While the future overall shape of British Gas may now hinge on the findings of the MMC, however, Mr Brown is pressing ahead with his own programme of change. As managing director of regional operations he had already seen through a reorganisation that resulted in the loss of 2,000 jobs. One of his first moves as chief executive was to call in McKinsey, the management consultants, to conduct a wide-ranging review of BG's 4,000-strong corporate centre. Every function will be under scrutiny. Job cuts are almost certain, and Mr Brown said his intention was to make BG's central management 'lean and mean'. 'But not just lean and mean in the numerical sense - it will certainly be that - but focused on what the corporate centre should be.' Two weeks ago Mr Brown further stamped his identity on the company through a reshuffle of the top jobs. The changes may look like a game of musical chairs, but Mr Brown insisted they and the McKinsey review are part of the same plan: to take a 'can-opener' to the management and 'get rid of the spaghetti'. This means cutting the bureaucracy, reducing the number of committees, devolving more responsibility to the heads of British Gas's different business units and at the same time making them more accountable, and promoting more young blood. Management may need an overhaul, but Mr Brown is proud of BG's record on safety and service - reiterating one of British Gas's proudest boasts that it is second in terms of customer approval ratings only to Marks and Spencer, the retailing chain. 'My objective is to overtake Marks and Spencer,' he said. 'We are closing the gap.' That British Gas should be anxious to outperform a leading retailing chain while at the same time trying to take on the oil majors at their own game is a measure of the size and scope of British Gas now. Whatever the MMC decides, BG is likely to face a fall in earnings from its UK gas business, which has made the drive for international expansion all the more urgent. Mr Brown says British Gas is on track to achieve the target set by Mr Evans of increasing the share of group earnings from exploration and production and Global Gas to 40 per cent and 20 per cent respectively. Another Brown review is taking place of Global Gas, the international gas supply and services division, to identify the best openings and strategies. One important aim is to begin to tie together exploration and production and Global Gas in some areas, making British Gas a company that explores for gas, produces it, and supplies it right to the burner tip. On the exploration side, BG's chief executive says the company has enough reserves and exploration acreage to enable it to become a significant force in oil and gas exploration. The jewel in the crown is Karachaganak, the 20,000bn cubic feet gas field in Kazakhstan for which British Gas and Agip have exclusive negotiating rights. 'I have always believed that as I am promoted into a different job, whatever I am . . . it was good enough to get me into that job, so for Christ's sake don't change. You've been lucky so far, so stay with it, and maybe you will go a bit further.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikita Yermakov] </F>   [Text] Paris 24 March, TASS -- Russia's foreign policy  passed several stages in the last two years, Vladimir Shumeyko,  head of the Federation Council, the upper house of the new  parliament, said.    Speaking at a news conference in Paris on Thursday, Shumeyko  said that Russia had been forming its foreign policy since it  had declared sovereignty in June 1990. The process was hampered  by political complications within the country, which distracted  attention from foreign policy.    But Russia has now approached the stage when it should build  genuine democracy and a free civil society. The adoption of the  Constitution and parliamentary elections have started the  process of strengthening Russian statehood. Russia is a  powerful, strong and sovereign state which remains open for  cooperation, Shumeyko said.    Speaking about Russia's accession to the Council of Europe,  Shumeyko noted that previously Russia asked for allowing it to  join the council on special terms. But now the situation is  different. "At the talks in Strasbourg with the Council of  Europe leaders several days ago we did not ask for any  exceptions for Russia. All admission procedures will be  observed and the question of Russia's admittance to the Council  of Europe will be included in the agenda by the end of the  summer," he said.    Much will change in the Council of Europe after Russia joins  it, Shumeyko continued. "Without our country it is impossible  to solve European problems. It is impossible to do without  taking into account Russia's opinion. This particularly  concerns changes in Eastern Europe, including the states that  have emerged in the former Soviet Union. There are laws by  which empires emerge, but there are no laws by which they would  disintegrate. Therefore, there are many problems to be  discussed at the Council of Europe," Shumeyko said.    Asked about President Boris Yeltsin's health, Shumeyko  replied that he is in good health, adding that some politicians  are trying to destabilise the political situation in the country  which has become more stable than a year ago.    Commenting on the results of the recent elections to local  bodies of power in Russia, Shumeyko said that people did not  show up at polling stations because they are tired of politics.  However, he stressed that it is not the voters who are to be  blamed but politicians who do not offer positive programmes.</p>

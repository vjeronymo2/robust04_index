			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / UK Company News: National Bank NZ improves by 24% NATIONAL BANK of New Zealand, part of Lloyds Bank, lifted after tax profits by 24 per cent to NZDollars 102m (Pounds 36.1m) for 1992, largely due to the purchase of the Rural Bank from Fletcher Challenge. National Bank bought the Rural Bank, the country's biggest lender to the farming sector, for NZDollars 450m in December, under a deal which included the Rural Bank's post tax profits of NZDollars 24m for the six months from July 1. The Rural Bank has 40 per cent of the rural finance market. National Bank's profit would have been down slightly by NZDollars 2m without the inclusion of the Rural Bank's profit. Nevertheless, the overall result meant National Bank's return on average shareholders' funds was up from 14.3 per cent in 1991 to 16.5 per cent. Mr John Anderson, chief executive, said that the bank continued to outperform its competitors. Profit before tax was up Dollars NZ33m to NZDollars 153m. This compared with a first half profit of NZDollars 90m, which did not include any earnings from the Rural Bank. Sir Spencer Russell, National Bank chairman and a former chief executive and subsequently Governor of the Reserve Bank, said the result was creditable in the face of a marked increase in competition in the finance sector in the year. National Bank's other operating earnings amounted to NZDollars 206m, virtually unchanged from 1991. Provisions for bad and doubtful debts were NZDollars 36m, down NZDollars 2m. Staff expenses rose by NZDollars 12m to NZDollars 165m. Total operating costs were NZDollars 354m (NZDollars 316m). The National Bank and the ASB Bank, which is partly owned by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, have been the only two banks in New Zealand to have held their lending rates following the general upward lift after the Reserve Bank tightened monetary policy in early January.</p>

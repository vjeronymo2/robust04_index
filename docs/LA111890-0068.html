			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: ARCADIA;  </P> <P> TEACHER CONTRACT APPROVED  </P> <P> The Arcadia Unified School District board last week approved a new teachers'  contract that includes a 5% pay raise for teachers.  </P> <P> The one-year pact also includes a less expensive health plan and up to 40%  higher stipends for coaches and other special personnel, bringing compensation  levels close to the county average.  </P> <P> First-year district teachers will now earn $31,832.  </P> <P> "This is the first time the contract has been settled this early in recent  memory. No outside negotiators were involved on either side," Supt. Terry  Towner said.  </P> <P> The agreement also satisfied Caroline Auburn, president of the Arcadia Teachers  Union. "It was a great challenge for both sides to resolve this in a way that  was amiable," she said. "Neither side felt like they had given away the shop."  </P> <P> Teachers voted to ratify the contract Nov. 2. Negotiators had settled on a  tentative agreement Oct. 18.  </P></p>

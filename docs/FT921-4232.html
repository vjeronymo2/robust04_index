			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Gonzalez backs embattled bank chief THE Madrid government yesterday closed ranks in support of the embattled governor of the Bank of Spain, Mr Mariano Rubio, who is at the centre of a scandal over the failed Ibercorp banking group. The government denied that Mr Rubio's departure from the bank was imminent. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, refused Mr Rubio's offer to resign last month and confirmed him as governor until his term expires in July. 'Mr Rubio's situation remains the same. Nothing has changed,' a spokeswoman said. Earlier Mr Carlos Solchaga, economy minister, denied that the cabinet was divided over maintaining the governor in his job during the next four months. Mr Rubio had offered to resign after an investigation by the Stock Exchange commission into the broking arm of Ibercorp, a financial services group run by close friends of his and which managed his personal portfolio. The commission is investigating alleged share price manipulation, discrimination in favour of certain clients and other possible fraudulent practices. The latest allegation is that Mr Rubio's sister, her husband and a first cousin were the administrators of a Luxembourg-based investment fund whose shares in Ibercorp were bought back by the group two years ago before the share price collapsed. The Stock Exchange commission is also investigating this investment company, but Mr Rubio's lawyer said the governor could not be held accountable for the activities of his relatives. Banco Ibercorp, the group's merchant bank, was taken under the wing of the Bank of Spain last week when it was unable to meet outstanding loans and its broking activities were suspended pending the investigation.</p>

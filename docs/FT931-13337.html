			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Arts: Why short is beautiful - Clement Crisp states his case for the triple bill BALLETIC triple bills have not been popular with audiences for 20 years and more. The tradition has grown up among Western ballet-goers - and it is one entirely owed to the Royal Ballet's example in performing 19th century classics, and then finding in Ashton, Cranko, MacMillan, Bintley, choreographers able to extend the full-evening creation - that a 'real' evening at the ballet means a long dramatic work, involving all the resources of a company. This nonsensical view has been accepted by ballet companies world-wide, driven by the box-office imperative. Major troupes trot out variously tiresome versions of the old war-horses, buy in evening-long works from other companies, and the public flocks. Smaller ensembles sell titles rather than ballets to their audience, and with little conscience offer shrunken and shoddy productions under familiar names. (I report, with unwavering gaze, that there is a version of Nutcracker currently on view in Europe which also involves elements from A Christmas Carol). The triple bill, which once offered a range of balletic experience, a variety of dancing, a choice of choreography, a happy display of dancers' artistry in varied roles, flourishes only with New York City Ballet, where Balanchine's genius was expended in making a treasury of short pieces that remain the supreme example of classical ballet in our century. Elsewhere, box-office receipts will tell a tale of failing attendance for evenings comprising three contrasting works, no matter how great their merits. Prohibitive seat-prices mean that audiences will go for what they think are the big, safe, cast-iron productions. If it's swans, it must be good, is their motto. And, as these columns never tire of saying, the reverse is true. The Royal Ballet has, with a bravery every ballet-goer must commend, made a serious effort in recent years to wean its public off swans and Veronese lovers through intelligent (usually]) triple bills. Much of the history and artistic achievement of ballet in our century is to be found in such works. The current Covent Garden programme of Apollo, Judas Tree, Symphony in C is a fine one - it will be on view twice next week - and it is in the main very well danced. (I record that, after the fashion of the one-time Nureyev circuses, advertisements announce that 'Irek Mukhamedov will dance at every performance'). Certainly Mukhamedov's presence - in either Apollo or Judas Tree - is reason enough to go. Both ballets gain in significance from his artistry. On Thursday, he was replaced as the Foreman in Judas Tree by Zoltan Solymosi. Solymosi's interpretation lacks the fervour that drives Mukhemedov's reading  -it misses, as yet, something in emotional and dynamic ferocity - but it is a worthy account of the role. The revelation of the performance was Leanne Benjamin's appearance as the woman, a characterisation of extraordinary sexual and technical pungency. Each pose and provocative movement, the shifts between belligerent sluttishness and invulnerable dignity, were superbly understood and stated: the ballet seemed to be about the woman as victim - and ultimate victor - rather than about betrayal. It was a beautiful and piercingly credible impersonation. Mukhamedov's view of Balanchine's Apollo at this performance was one which saw the role in a single span, and gave it emotional and physical momentum from first moment to last. He exposed the dramatic substructure of the choreography. He showed us the reason for every action by the young god, and without communicative fuss - nothing over-emphatic - he provided an armature for the dance action. It was a reading more powerful, more dense, than any I have seen before. It would look out of place in New York City Ballet performance today, but this Royal staging does not aim for the speed or the purged clarity that is now the NYCB style in the piece. We are shown Apollo as drama rather than rite: and the choreography is rich and resonant enough to sustain both interpretations. As Terpsichore, Viviana Durante made an elegant, pure-toned debut. About Symphony in C, most radiant of ballets, I am less happy in these current performances. Girls are being sent out to do women's jobs - ballerinas are in short supply at Covent Garden - and to do Balanchine justice, we must see diamond clarity and unforced grandeur. It is, nonetheless, a work of cumulative joys, and it ends an admirable triple bill on the happiest of notes. This triple bill is given final performances at Covent Garden on January 27 and 28.</p>

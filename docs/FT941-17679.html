			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / International Company News: Italian steel group sells subsidiary Ilva, the heavily loss-making Italian steel group, has made a further step towards its dismemberment and privatisation with the sale of its Cogne special steels unit. Cogne, which specialises in stainless steel products, has been bought by Marzorati, a private steel group based in the Ticino region of Switzerland. No price for the transaction, reported by the Ansa news agency, has been revealed and Ilva was unavailable for comment yesterday. The Cogne subsidiary is one of a number of Ilva assets for sale as part of the group's restructuring plan. Under the scheme, Ilva has been broken up into separate companies, all of which are to be privatised.</p>

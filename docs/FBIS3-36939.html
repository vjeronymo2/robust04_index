			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 9 TASS -- The implementation of  laws of the Russian Federation, of the Russian president's  decrees and orders by executive authorities is verified by the  Control Agency. The agency has summed up the results of its work  for a year. ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA publishes fragments from the  report on Wednesday.    The economic reform is in the focus of the Control Agency's  attention. It follows the implementation of the president's  decree on urgent measures for land reform. Radical  restructuring of agricultural production has been carried out as  a result of implementing provisions of the decree. Measures to  privatise considerable part of land used by collective and state  farms have been implemented. As many as 23,798 economies, or 93  per cent of their total number, have been reorganised and  reregistered as of October 1, 1993. As many as 14,540  joint-stock companies, peasant economies associations,  partnerships and farming cooperatives have been formed on the  basis of reregistered economies. 267 thousand peasant (farmer)  economies having a total of 11.2 million hectares of land have  also been set up.    At the same time surveys indicated that the pace of the land  reform is not quite rapid in a number of regions. Sometimes new  forms of farming economies are not backed by heads of local  administrations.    There were delays about providing plots of land to citizens  in the Altay and Krasnodar territories, Omsk and Vladimir  regions. Executive authorities and heads of collective and state  farms are to blame for this. Sometimes they even put oblstacles  to the distribution of plots of land. Sanctions envisaged for  law violations have not been appllied.    Gross violations of the land legislation were made during  the  privatisation of land.    The pace of the setting up of peasant economies in the  country has slackened. As many as 47 thousand peasant economies  were formed in the first quarter of 1993, 28,300 in the second  quarter, 7,200 in the third quarter and only 3,400 in October  and November. What is more, 15,700 peasant economies gave up  their plots of land by late 1993. Farmers are not given the  necessary material and technical support, are unsatisfactorily  supplied with funds and other resources. Quite often they are  given plots unsuitable for farming. As many as 117 peasant  economies, or 6.2 per cent, were liquidated for this reason in  the Ryazan region by early October in 1993. More than 500  peasant economies, or 16 per cent, were liquidated in the  Sverglovsk region.    Funds allocated by the state to aid farmer economies are  quite often spent for other purposes. The enhancing of the  efficiency of farmers is checked by delayed payment for the  produced and marketed output. The state owes more than 800  billion roubles to grain growers.    Efforts of officials of the control agency were also aimed  at  veryfying the implementation of the Russian president's decrees  "On the Speedy Privatisation of State and Municipal  Entreprises", "On Organisational measures To Transform State-Run  Entreprises and Voluntary Associations of State Entreprises into  Joint-Stock Companies", "On the Regulation of Lease and  Privatisation of Property of Leased State and Municipal  Entreprises". During checks special attention was given to  enhancing the effectiveness of privatised facilities.    Checks indicated that committees for the management of the  state property of territories and regions in many cases failed  duly to organise privatisation of state property and  veryfication of the procedure. Questions of turning  entreprises into joint-stock companies are resolved with delay.  State funds resulting from privatisation are sometimes used for  other purposes. The Russian president's decree envisaging that  the transformation of state-run entreprises and their voluntary  associations into joint-stock companies be completed in 1992 has  not been fullfield completely in all of the surveyed regions.  According to the information of the Russian State Property  Committee, out of the 4,859 entreprises that were to be turned  into joint-stock companies, only 2,545 joint-stock companies, or  just over half the expected number, were registered as of  December 1, 1993.</p>

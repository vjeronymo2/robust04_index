			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Letter: Think ahead on terrorism Sir, Within a year we have seen bombings in London, Manchester, Warrington and, now, lightning has struck twice in the City of London. Just like last time, the atrocity has caught a number of concerns with their organisational pants down. The various disaster recovery and business continuity services should be well known by now, yet a great many companies are still failing to prepare adequate contingency plans. Businesses must learn that disasters do happen and that terrorism represents only the most visible of risks. I suspect that, even with the latest tragedy still filling our television screens, there are still companies prepared to risk their corporate existence, rather than invest a fraction of turnover in business continuity planning.

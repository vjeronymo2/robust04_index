			<p>BFN     [Text] First Vice-Premier Oleg Soskovets has called on the  agro-industrial complex not to permit "by any means" a  repetition of last year's grain losses, which totalled 20  million tonnes, or 20 pct of the gross harvest (99 million  tonnes in bunker weight).    Soskovets was addressing a conference on preparations for  harvesting held at the Russian government building.    The conference was critical of the agrarian sector's level  of  preparedness for harvesting.    The grain combine harvester fleet has been reduced by 29  thousand vehicles since 1993 and of the remaining ones less 50  percent are operational. As a result each machine will have to  harvest 260 hectares (compared to the standard 131) and the  harvesting season will take a whole month, whereas the optimal  harvesting period is no more than 15-17 days.    Soskovets asked manufacturers to urgently supply farm  workers  with 1,575 grain harvesters on credit supported by government  guarantees, and called on the economics and finance ministries  to pool efforts with the Central Bank of Russia to look into the  possibility of financing the agro-industrial complex on  favorable terms. The Russian government, Soskovets said, will  take a number of urgent measures to make preparations for  harvesting already this week.    He strongly criticized the AIC leaders, in particular, such  sub- units as the Rosagrosnab and Roskhleboprodukt joint-stock  companies and the associations of Rosagrokhim which had assumed  new names but failed to become full-fledged market structures to  this day. Soskovets said that there was no united  agro-industrial complex in the country, only fragmented  structures in no way responsible for the farmers' end product.</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: UK mortgage market Britain's building societies cannot be enjoying the recovery very much. Not only are the clearing banks - and ironically Abbey National in particular - taking an increasing share of new mortgage lending. They are also suffering a remorseless deposit outflow as customers are lured away by unit trusts and National Savings. After the ravages from the weak housing market, it is tempting to conclude that the societies face an intensifying structural decline. Such a conclusion would be premature. The latest pressures reflect, above all, the interest rate cycle. With the mortgage rate 2 percentage points above base rates, banks, which can borrow freely in the wholesale markets, can earn a handsome margin. That they devoted little effort to retaining retail deposits as interest rates came down suggests their current behaviour is more opportunistic than a systematic attempt to increase market share. Presumably the banks would lose interest in mortgage lending if base rates went up and their margins were eroded. That would also see a flow of savings deposits return to the building societies. They can afford to wait: their mutual status means they are not obliged to deliver constant growth. The slight improvement in the housing market even seems to have slowed the consolidation process down. Only three mergers have been completed this year compared with five in 1992 and seven in 1991.</p>

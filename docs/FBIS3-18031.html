The warning came as senior ministers stepped up their  efforts  -- in advance of Sinn Fein's annual conference near Dublin this  weekend -- to persuade the IRA's political wing to accept the  Downing Street declaration.    Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr  Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, used speeches in Birmingham and  London to offer fresh reassurance to nationalists about the  government's aims and intentions.    Sir Patrick sought to cover new ground in explaining how  London expected north-south relations to develop. He emphasised  that a settlement could provide new safeguards against  discrimination.    As unionists in Ulster reacted suspiciously to Sir Patrick's  remarks Mr James Nicholson, UUP [Ulster Unionist Party],  chairman and leader of the party's team in the political talks  process, warned that London and Dublin should "in no way" take  the position of the province's largest party for granted.    Mr Nicholson, an MEP [member of European Parliament], said  from Brussels that the UUP would not return to roundtable talks  unless there was "a strong possibility that the process would  move forward in a positive manner."    He emphasised that the UUP had not endorsed the declaration.    Mr Nicholson complained that his last meeting with Mr  Michael  Ancrarn, the Northern Ireland minister co-ordinating the talks  process, was "quite frankly, a waste of time." He said: "The  process was going nowhere. The whole thing does not add up as  far as we are concerned."    Sir Patrick said there was a role for "new institutions  which  will recruit...the talents of all the people in the island of  Ireland, so as to develop purposefully and profitably the  relationship between the two parts of the island."    He said that as trust and confidence grew north-south  institutions could "help transform the relationship between  nationalists and unionists and -- but only if it was so agreed  they could take on an increasingly dynamic role on the island  and beyond it."    There was "no necessity for these institutions to impinge on  either country's sovereign independence."    Sir Patrick said a political accommodation "might well"  include "some form of entrenchment of human rights." He added:  "There could be agreement to ensure that the nationalist and  unionist identities would genuinely and in practical ways, enjoy  parity of esteem."</p>

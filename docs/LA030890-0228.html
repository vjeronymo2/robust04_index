			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> THATCHER CONDEMNS TAX VIOLENCE  </P> <P> British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher today condemned violence during  weeklong protests against an imminent new poll tax but faced more angry scenes  as she began a three-day visit to Scotland.  </P> <P> Speaking in Parliament, Thatcher said violence at town halls across England is  "a negation of democracy."  </P> <P> Dozens of people have been arrested as angry crowds fought with police and  invaded council chambers in a growing wave of protest as municipal authorities  met to set the new tax's local level.  </P> <P> Thatcher, whose waning popularity has been linked directly to the new tax, said  the violence has been organized by left-wing extremists for their own political  ends. She also attacked 28 opposition Labor Party members of Parliament who  have called on people to break the law and not pay the tax.  </P> <P> The prime minister was answering questions shortly before flying to Scotland,  where anti-tax campaigners threatened demonstrations throughout her visit.  </P> <P> The tax, which comes into force in England and Wales on April 1, will finance  local services by replacing property taxes with a personal charge on all people  of voting age. About 20 million non-property owners will be paying as much as  $810 a head toward local services for the first time.  </P></p>

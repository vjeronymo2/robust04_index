			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yig'al Wilfend and ITIM] </F>   [Excerpt] Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] has claimed  responsibility for the attack Monday night near the settlement  of 'Ateret north of Ramallah.    A leaflet distributed yesterday in the Gaza Strip, Ramallah,  and East Jerusalem noted that the attack near Bi'r Zayt in which  five settlers were wounded had been perpetrated by 'Izz-al-Din  al-Qassam troops.    The leaflet added that this was "the beginning of the  implementation of the plan to expel the settlers from all the  territories," as had been promised in a previous leaflet in  which the settlers were given an ultimatum to leave by 15 March.  The authors contend that this ultimatum had already caused  several families to leave Qiryat Arba'. However, the leaflet  noted, Hamas does not consider this sufficient "and will  continue to strike until the last settler leaves." [passage  omitted]</p>

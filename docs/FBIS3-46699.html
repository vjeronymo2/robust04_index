			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 4 (YONHAP) -- With the United States  and North Korea reportedly nearing agreement on the North Korean  nuclear question, South Korean Government officials have begun  to work out measures on the assumption that the issue will be  resolved soon.    The Foreign Ministry, which handles the North Korean nuclear  problem, is said to expect that Washington and Pyongyang will  hold another working-level contact in New York this week to wrap  up their negotiations.    But ministry officials are taking the cautious approach as a  last-minute glitch could develop in the U.S.-North Korean talks  with a change in the ever unpredictable North Korean attitude.    The Seoul Government began to undertake preparations for a  working-level contact with North Korea for exchanges of special  envoys, if and when the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) is able to send its inspection team to Pyongyang,  following negotiations between the IAEA and North Korea.    The government will work on plans for future inter-Korean  ties, anticipating improvement in North Korea's relations with  the United States and Japan in the event that the North Korean  nuclear issue is resolved in the first half of this year.    Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Monday that his ministry  will map out diplomatic countermeasures because there is a  strong possibility that North Korea could improve its ties with  the United States and Japan this year.    The South Korean Government has said it would not oppose any  improvement of relations between North Korea and the United  States or Japan, but Seoul has, in actuality, coolly reacted to  any such moves by its traditional allies, according to ministry  insiders.    The latest, prevailing way of thinking among Foreign  Ministry  officials is that Seoul has to work out a policy and  consistently follow it since relations between Washington and  Pyongyang could improve at an accelerating pace once the nuclear  issue is cleared up at a third round of their high-level talks.    Over at the National Unification Board [NUB], meanwhile,  officials believe chances are great that the United States and  North Korea will reach a complete agreement. Accordingly, they  are preparing for conditions that Seoul could table at a  working-level inter-Korean contact.    But NUB officials are also "extremely careful" in their  approach because there always is a chance that the North Koreans  could throw a wrench in their negotiations at the last minute.    Some of the most serious problems that, NUB officials  believe, could come up in the inter-Korean working-level contact  could be the purpose of the exchanges of special emissaries.    The exchanges of special envoys have been discussed both by  South and North Korea. But it has not precisely been defined  what they will discuss once the proposed exchanges take place.    One of the main topics South Korea wants them to discuss is  simultaneous and mutual inspection of nuclear facilities.    But the NUB officials expect that North Korea could very  well  counter their proposal with President Kim Il-song's so-called  10-point program that calls, among other things, for unification  through federal system in which two Koreas have one state but  two governments.    There indeed are difference of views on the nature of  mission  of the special envoys, one NUB official admits. But North  Korea, nevertheless, recognizes the need for exchanging special  envoys, if only because it wants to realize the third round of  high-level talks with the United States, he said.    There is a strong possibility that South and North Korea  could stand far apart even when they agreed to exchange special  envoys.    That is part of the reason NUB officials are at pains to  provide viable proposals for simultaneous inspections between  the South and North that could be supplementary to IAEA  inspections, he added.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RABBI KAHANE'S CONTRIBUTIONS  </P> <P> It is symptomatic of the leftist detractors of the Jewish people, many of whose  vociferous exponents are unfortunately themselves Jewish, that they  misunderstand the phenomenon of Rabbi Kahane.  </P> <P> Sprinzak's assessment of Kahane's popular support is absolutely wrong.  </P> <P> We know that this is true due to the fear of the so-called "right-wing" party  and its collaboration with the leftists to attempt to liquidate Rabbi Kahane  through parliamentary maneuvering. It is this "right-wing" that had the most to  fear of the rabbi: a substantial loss of financial support and portfolios in  government. His prophetic prediction of an emasculated Likud government,  financially subservient to the largess of U.S., has been proven correct. This  poses as a real danger to Israel.  </P> <P> The truth that the leftists and their Arab supporters fail to see is that there  cannot, nor will there be, any peaceful coexistence between Arabs and Jews in  our land.  </P> <P> The leftists and Jewish apologists refuse and abhor the concept of the  revelation of Mt. Sinai, decreeing the exclusivity of the land of Israel to the  Jewish people. What they mistakenly mistake for "neo-religious ideas about  redemption" and the "indivisibility of the land of Israel" as undesirable are  nothing more than a genuine, healthy Jewish reawakening of their identity as a  people, a reacceptance of the yoke of G-d's kingdom.  </P> <P> For those of us whose tears are not yet dried, the painful loss of Rabbi Kahane  will only mean a redoubling of our efforts in the causes he dedicated his life  for.  </P> <P> RABBI NACHUM SHIFREN, Director, Center for Jewish Activism, Santa Monica  </P></p>

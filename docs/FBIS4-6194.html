			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 16 (YONHAP) -- More than 100 North  Korean loggers in Russia will be brought to South Korea,  presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik said Saturday [16 April].    Chu made the announcement one day after Seoul said it had  decided to accept all escapees from North Korean logging camps  in Siberia wishing to settle in South Korea.    "As a result, the government will bring to South Korea more  than 100 North Korean loggers who have applied for settlement in  South Korea at the South Korean Embassy in Moscow," Chu said.    Chu also said the government expects more escapees from  North  Korean logging camps to seek refuge in the South "since we have  decided to accept them."    "Even in that situation, the government will accept all  North  Korean loggers with the exception of those with serious  problems," he said.    Chu clarified that "those with serious problems" include  criminals such as "infamous offenders."    The Seoul government understands, however, that most of the  "infamous" offenders committed "crimes" because they were hungry  and tried to steal food, he said.    The South Korean Embassy in Moscow has conducted an initial  screening of the North Korean loggers seeking refuge in the  South and found almost no "infamous offenders," Chu said.</p>

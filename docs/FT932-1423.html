			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / International Company News: Packard Bell and ZDS to form alliance ZENITH Data Systems, the microcomputer arm of Groupe Bull of France, and Packard Bell, a leading US manufacturer of low-cost personal computers, are forming a strategic alliance to improve the competitiveness of both companies in desktop and notebook computer markets. Groupe Bull said yesterday it was taking a 19.9 per cent stake in the US company to mark its commitment to the deal. It refused to disclose the value of the stake. Under the terms of the alliance ZDS and Packard will jointly design and manufacture desktop PCs, giving both companies the benefit of their combined engineering expertise and the high-volume, high efficiency manufacturing techniques used by Packard Bell. The US company is an acknowledged expert in mass marketing through direct channels. ZDS will supply Packard Bell with private label versions of the French company's well-regarded notebook and subnotebook computers. The US company already has an agreement with IBM for the supply of badge-labelled notebooks but Mr Jacques Noel, ZDS chief executive, said the deal with Packard Bell would not affect it, nor Groupe Bull's equity relationship with IBM. The agreement with Packard Bell would enable it to find economies through greater manufacturing volumes. ZDS, at that time a US-owned company, was a pioneer in low cost PCs but has been losing market share to Compaq and Apple in recent months. Its market share at present is about 8 to 10 per cent. Mr Noel thought it could be at least double that figure. Mr Beny Alagem, Packard Bell president and chief executive, said the company, with sales of Dollars 930m last year, had less than a 5 per cent share of the portable market and it was important it increase its share. The Bull deal would lead to an expansion of its assembly and test operations in The Netherlands. The company is a leading supplier of low-priced 'clones' of IBM's market leading PC designs. It is the third-largest US supplier in unit terms of PCs, according to market research organisation International Data Corporation.</p>

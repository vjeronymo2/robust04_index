			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Blue Circle Pounds 70m sale in S Africa BLUE CIRCLE Industries, the cement and home products group, has sold its 42.3 per cent stake in a South African associate for Pounds 70m. The purchaser is Murray &amp; Roberts, which has been BCI's joint venture partner in the South African business since it acquired Darling &amp; Hodgson. The two parties had been talking since November. BCI made the original investment in 1913. It said yesterday that it preferred to be a lead shareholderin its investments and that the South African company would benefit from having one shareholder in the driving seat. The investment contributed Pounds 11m to BCI's operating profit and Pounds 7m to after-tax earnings in 1991, as well as a dividend stream of Pounds 3m. Its carrying value at the December year-end was Pounds 33.8m. The cash will initially help to reduce BCI's net debt, which stood at roughly Pounds 300m before the transaction. Shareholders' funds at the previous year-end were Pounds 949.6m, counting Pounds 90m of convertible capital bonds as equity.</p>

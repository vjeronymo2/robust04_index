			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Where the main thrust of the DTI's new competitive policy will be focused ...: Sectoral divisions 'MANDARINS meet the manufacturers' ran the headline on a DTI press release issued last week to announce the arrival for work on the Rover production line of two civil servants. More usually, the two men form part of the DTI's vehicles division, one of 15 sectoral units set up a year ago to build a constructive partnership between industry and government. Ten of the 19 people in the vehicles division have on-line experience, with companies such as Honda, Nissan and Unipart. Their 'hands-on' experience represents the sharp end of Mr Heseltine's move to win back for his department the respect of industry - the basis of his ambitions to create a new partnership between the state and business. The 15 divisions cover most of UK manufacturing and much of the service sector - from vehicles, air, chemicals and steel to electronics, offshore supplies, textiles and retailing to all the energy markets. With the unmourned demise of the National Economic Development Office and its own sector working groups, the intention is to use the DTI divisions as a conduit between DTI and industry and as a source of quality market intelligence to assist competitiveness at home and overseas. There will also be plenty of emphasis on so-called benchmarking - continually comparing company and industry performance against best practice and recommending ways of improvement. The ambition, according to a senior official with responsibility for some of the industry divisions, is to make them so informed and knowledgeable that the private sector will value their contribution. 'There has to be some added value on our part. We cannot just parrot the views put to us by the usual range of petitioners.' He adds: 'When the managing director of a division of a major company feels it is worthwhile to spend some time talking with someone in his sponsored division we will be getting somewhere.' The sectoral divisions are also expected to provide an important channel for feeding industry's case into other parts of central government, offering advice on the potential impact on business of other departmental proposals. So far, so easy. The new regime will need time before it can be fairly judged but the DTI acknowledges it still has much to do to earn its spurs and to overturn the image of unhelpful, uninformed civil servants whose own productivity is measured in vacuous conversations.</p>

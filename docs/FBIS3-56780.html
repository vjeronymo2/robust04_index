Yesterday parliamentarians and government officials expressed  their opinion of that. The opposition, including Nodar Natadze,  the leader of the National Front, considers Georgia's entrance  to the rouble zone as a loss of independence.    Vice-Premier Amiran Kadagishvili in his statement doubted  that Russia would accept Georgia to the rouble zone. In the  opinion of the Georgian Finance Minister David Jakobidze, the  concurrent introduction of the Russian rouble and the Georgian  coupon is necessary.    In the interview to the SNARK reporter Nodar Djavakhishvili  said that Russia proposes unacceptable terms. He is of the  opinion that monetary and credit emission is to be cut down, the  budget deficit should be minimal and crediting has to be stopped.</p>

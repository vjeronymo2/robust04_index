			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE VOTES TO HELP CHINA STUDENTS STAY  </P> <P> The Senate, ignoring objections raised by President Bush, voted unanimously  Tuesday to modify the Administration's new program allowing more than 40,000  Chinese students in the United States to delay their return to China.  </P> <P> By a 97-0 vote, the Senate agreed that the students would be permitted to  remain in the United States until June 5, 1990, without being required to make  any statement that might brand them as dissidents. After that, their departure  could be delayed until as late as June 5, 1992, unless both the President and  the attorney general certify that the political climate in China no longer  poses any danger to them.  </P> <P> In all cases, students under orders to leave the United States would be given  60 days to appeal their cases before their extended stay is officially  terminated. In addition, the Senate measure eliminates a provision in current  law requiring them to return to China for at least two years before seeking  immigrant status.  </P> <P> The provision was designed to answer the many complaints that Chinese students  have expressed about the delayed departure program that Bush created after the  June 3-4 massacre in Beijing's Tian An Men Square.  </P> <P> While many Chinese students want to delay their return home in the wake of the  killing of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people during the military assault,  and many are worried by the ensuing political crackdown, most believe that by  filing for delayed departure under the President's program, they might be  branded traitors by the Beijing government. Under Bush's plan, they must  declare their unwillingness to go home.  </P> <P> Moreover, many Chinese students fear that by entering the program outlined by  Bush, they are agreeing to return home after one year -- even if conditions  there have not improved.  </P> <P> As a result, very few Chinese students have applied to the Immigration and  Naturalization Service to take advantage of the Administration program.  </P> <P> The Senate measure represents a bipartisan compromise. Some senators such as  Slade Gorton (R-Wash.) had been seeking sweeping legislation that would allow  all Chinese students to apply immediately for permanent residency status. But  such proposals were strongly opposed by others, including Alan K. Simpson  (R-Wyo.), assistant minority leader and the Senate's leader on immigration  issues.  </P> <P> Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) acknowledged that the Senate measure  does not have the support of the President, but he insisted that Administration  officials had raised only "some slight reservations" about these changes in  Bush's program.  </P> <P> Both Dole and Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), who  co-sponsored the Senate amendment, said that the changes they propose are in  keeping with the original objectives of the President's program.  </P> <P> Mitchell indicated that many Chinese students had lobbied him personally for  these changes.  </P> <P> "I believe we should respond generously to this request by the Chinese students  who are living among us and bravely standing up for freedom and democracy in  their homeland," Mitchell said.  </P></p>

			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Observer: Breakdown The London-based Institute of Quality Assurance is always banging on about Total Quality Management - or TQM to its disciples. Strange therefore that a review copy of 'Quality 2000 - Management for Success', just published for the Institute (at Pounds 40 plus post and packaging), arrived with its hardback cover on back-to-front and upside down. Could this be a comment on the state of British management theory by its Hong Kong-based printer?</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yesterday, in Milwaukee, U.S. Vice President Al  Gore made a statement in connection with the U.S. President's  upcoming tour of certain European states and the NATO summit  meeting to take place in Brussels.    We asked the spokesman of Romania's Presidency, Mr. Traian  Chebeleu, to comment on that statement. Chebeleu said, "we  learned with interest and satisfaction about the statement made  by Mr. Al Gore, vice president of the United States of America.  We consider that statement to be a clear expression of the U.S.  stance, having the value of a pledge, in the sense of which,  Romania's security, as well as the security of all other  countries in this part of Europe, is not indifferent to the  United States. We consider that statement as a major support for  the efforts we are making to strengthen the stability and  security of our country in the context of the convulsions taking  place in our vicinity and, on a broader plane, to strengthen  Romania's democratic society."    The statement made by the presidential spokesman to our  radio  also points out that the position expressed by the U.S. vice  president responds to our preoccupations and was made in the  spirit of the recent message addressed by Romania's president to  the President of the United States and the other heads of states  that are members of NATO.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Sanctuary finds home in the US The successful private placement of Dollars 75m of senior debt with four US institutional investors by Sanctuary Housing Association brings a new type of borrower to the US capital markets. 'It is a horse of a different colour,' explained Mr Conrad Owen, assistant director in Hambros Bank's bond division. The bonds, which mature in 2011, were issued at 120 basis points over the interpolated US Treasury bond rate. Proceeds were then swapped into sterling, raising the equivalent of Pounds 47.9m. The use of an independent AAA-rated swap counterparty was described as a 'key aspect' of the deal. Exact terms were not disclosed but the funds were achieved at terms 'competitive to those available to Sanctuary in the UK', said Mr Owen. In recent deals in the UK, housing associations have borrowed long-term funds at 150 to 170 basis points over equivalent gilt rates. However, funding has frequently been difficult to obtain, said Mr Owen. Banks are prepared to make loans over five to seven years, while the UK debenture market will look at deals of 20 to 25 years. 'Between this range, funding has really not been available in appreciable quantities from any UK source,' said Mr Owen. Government backing for housing associations was seen as positive by investors, said Mr Owen. UK housing associations have obtained 50 per cent of their funding from a government grant since 1988. The government stake is subordinate to private financing. 'This was an important element in the sale pitch. It was a big issue,' explained Mr Owen. In addition US institutions were impressed by the low level of rent arrears and vacant property which Sanctuary boasts, in common with other housing associations. Mr David Knowlton, director of finance at Sanctuary, said he had little doubt that US investors will be keen to do further transactions and hoped 'other associations are able to tap in to what is undoubtedly a major source of funding'.</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Japan's MPs pass budget after delay caused by scandals THE lower house of the Japanese Diet yesterday approved a Y72,218bn (Pounds 318bn) budget for the year starting on April 1, after weeks of delay caused by the recent spate of political scandals. The budget is expected to pass smoothly through the upper house. Even if objections are raised there, the bill will automatically become law in 30 days, under the Japanese constitution. The budget includes plans to boost the economy mildly through increased public works spending, funded by a modest increase in public borrowing. The Finance Ministry is also encouraging government agencies to start projects as early in the new financial year as possible in order to give a fillip to the economy. The ministry resisted industrialists' demands for a bigger increase in public works spending to compensate for an expected decline in corporate investment. But with the economy continuing to weaken, there are growing demands in the ruling Liberal Democratic party for a supplementary budget later in the financial year. The ministry, which opposes increases in public borrowing, has so far resisted such demands. But it will come under renewed pressure as soon as the main budget become law early next month. Those LDP leaders who favour increased public spending would like to see work on a supplementary budget to be well in hand before elections to the Diet's upper house in July. Yesterday's lower house vote followed an agreement late on Thursday between leaders of the LDP and opposition parties. The opposition agreed to drop demands for immediate cuts in defence spending and for tax cuts for part-time workers. In return, the LDP pledged to consider the opposition proposals in future budget planning. Defence spending is already under review in the light of the easing of international tensions which has followed the end of the Cold War. Japanese wholesale prices fell 1.6 per cent in February from the same month last year due to declining oil prices and weakening economic activity. Domestic wholesale prices dropped 0.6 per cent. Japan's Fair Trade Commission will submit a bill to parliament raising the maximum fine for monopolistic practices 20-fold to Y100m (Pounds 440,500), a commission spokesman said. The ruling Liberal Democratic party negotiated with the anti-trust watchdog to lower the ceiling and approved the bill on Thursday night. Washington has been pressing Tokyo to impose higher criminal penalties on price cartels and other monopolistic practices which it says act as trade barriers. A corporation found controlling a market by bid-rigging and price manipulation faces a maximum fine of Y5m. The US imposes criminal penalties of up to Dollars 10m.</p>

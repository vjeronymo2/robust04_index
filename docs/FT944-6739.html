			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (7): Bottle bank dilemmas - Recycling economics are being challenged When people think of the contributions they might make towards saving energy, they often turn to recycling, as well as more direct measures such as insulating lofts and turning off lights when they leave the room. Young children frequently lecture their parents on the need to take bottles to the bottle bank, such is the enthusiasm with which schools have embraced recycling. Yet scientists and economists are increasingly questioning whether recycling household material does have an environmental benefit, and if it does, whether that benefit justifies spending the considerable sums which modern recycling systems can demand. That equivocation, it should be said at the start, does not on the whole apply to recycling of industrial materials. Many companies have been able both to cut down their use of raw materials through recycling and to cut costs. A prime example is the use of water; the Water Services Association, which represents the 10 largest water and sewage companies in England and Wales, says that many industrial companies have turned to recycling discharged water since charges for abstracting water and for discharging waste have risen. However, the debate about the virtues of recycling domestic waste has intensified in the past year since the government began to explore the adoption of mandatory recycling quotas for packaging. Consumer goods manufacturers and big retailers could now face a levy to fund the cost of recovering and recycling waste packaging, which has been put at up to Pounds 100m a year. In July last year, Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, told manufacturers and retailers to devise a voluntary system to increase the volume of packaging waste recovered or recycled to between 50 per cent and 75 per cent, in line with EU targets. But industrialists have criticised the targets as potentially meaningless, given the difficulty in measuring volumes of waste, and differences in the definition of waste between different types of packaging. There have also been concerns about the inflationary effect; some industry estimates put the extra cost of a shopping basket at 1p for every Pounds 10. None of those estimates is yet firm, nor has the distribution of those additional costs been agreed. Both industrialists and ministers have an eye on the catastrophe of German attempts to introduce mandatory recycling targets, which left unwanted mounds of waste paper trundling along the roads of neighbouring countries in search of a market. But the size of the costs, and the controversy about who should bear them, means that all those embroiled in the debate are taking a harder look at whether the environmental benefits of recycling justify extra costs. Take glass for example, one of the most difficult cases, despite the popularity of bottle banks. Glass is manufactured by heating silica (essentially sand) and sodium carbonate. It is recycled by remelting broken shards of glass containers. Whether this produces a net saving in energy or not is debatable, particularly taking into account the fuel used in collection of the waste glass. The Centre for Social and Economic Research on the Global Environment at University College, London, in a report in June for Nuclear Electric, the generator, said that if a household recycled 52 glass bottles a year this could save the emission of 6.2kg of carbon a year (carbon dioxide is one of the gases implicated in global warming). But it pointed out that these savings would quickly be eroded if people drove to the bottle bank. Moreover, much recycled glass is coloured brown or green from beer or wine bottles, but the demand from manufacturers is for clear glass, for use in food containers. CSERGE comments that 'recycling, though one of the most well-known energy saving measures, has only a small impact on carbon dioxide emissions. Installing low energy lighting in the home, for example, is over 200 times more effective than recycling.' There is least debate over the attractions of recycling aluminium cans, the most valuable category within household rubbish. According to industry estimates, recycling can save 95 per cent of the energy used in original manufacture. In the US, manufacturers suggest that the average smelter to make new aluminium uses as much power as a town of 500,000 people. A smelter also costs around 10 times as much as a re-melting plant. That gives can manufacturers clear incentives to collect used cans. Last year, for example, the US industry is estimated to have paid out about Dollars 900m for used cans collected by individuals, schools, churches and scout troops. About two thirds of cans overall are recycled, the industry estimates. But there is more debate over other categories of waste, such as paper. Although environmentalists argue that newspapers and magazines could incorporate a higher proportion of recycled material, paper makers say that if paper is recycled more than three or four times, the fibres become too short for use in newsprint. Local councils in the UK which have vigorously pursued recycling of domestic waste point out too that if such schemes become widespread, the UK could find that it has created its own version of the German problem: mounds of expensively-sorted waste for which there is little demand.</p>

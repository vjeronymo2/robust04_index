			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RECYCLED PERRY MASON A TV HIT  </P> <P> Television these days has taken to recycling its series, and none have been  more successful than Perry Mason.  </P> <P> "The Brady Bunch" was a recycled hit in two TV movies but so far has failed to  burn up the Nielsens as a weekly series.  </P> <P> "The Incredible Hulk" made the final sacrifice and died for ratings last month  in "The Death of the Incredible Hulk," which was the fifth most popular  made-for-TV movie during the February sweeps.  </P> <P> "The Love Boat" made a Valentine voyage and turned up ninth on the TV movie  list for February.  </P> <P> Raymond Burr and his alter ego Perry Mason made their first appearance on CBS  as a series on Sept. 21, 1957, but the latter-day adventures of Mason and Della  Street and company began on NBC on Dec. 1, 1985, with a two-hour movie aptly  titled "Perry Mason Returns."  </P> <P> The show scored a whopping 27.2 rating and a 39 share. Thirteen Perry Mason  films have aired on NBC since then.  </P> <P> Not only has America proved it loves its "PM" TVs, but the show also provides a  new kind of TV format -- the recurring movie that is not a one-shot venture and  not a full-fledged series. CBS has been successful with the same format in the  recurring Janek cop series starring Richard Crenna.  </P> <P> The latest in the Mason series is "Perry Mason: The Case of the Desperate  Deception," to air Sunday at 9 p.m..  </P> <P> The show was shot in Paris and has Perry appearing before the bench in a French  court, defending a U.S. Marine officer accused of killing a Nazi war criminal.  Motive? The Nazi was responsible for the cruel treatment of his mother in a  German forced labor camp.  </P> <P> Like many of the earlier Perry Mason films, the flick brings in added interest  with some high-caliber guests -- in this case Yvette Mimieux, Ian McShane and  Academy Award winner Teresa Wright as the wronged mother.  </P> <P> Wright, now 71, called making the Perry Mason film "great fun" and said it was  nice to work with Raymond Burr again.  </P></p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Property hopes There were further positive comments on the commercial property market, with Smith New Court detecting a slow revival in its latest report. Like NatWest Securities, which came to similar conclusions earlier this week, Smith suggests that net asset values are at present taking second place to cash flow in analysts' judgment of property stocks. The broker recommends Slough Estates, off a penny at 186p, MEPC, steady at 370p, and along with NatWest, British Land, 6 forward at 232p. In second liners, both brokers prefer Allied London Properties, steady at 55p, and Frogmore Estates, also unchanged at 345p. Barclays Bank shares were given a mid-morning mauling, sliding to 414p at one point after a flurry of selling triggered by rumours that the bank had been summoned to the Bank of England because of concerns over its loan book. A denial of the story brought a swift rally in the shares which ended the session only 4 easier at 420p. Turnover was an unremarkable 7m. Along with the rest if the sector, Barclays shares have come under pressure since NatWest published disappointing bad debt figures on Tuesday. Barclays' preliminary numbers are expected on March 4. Credit Lyonnais (CLL) added to the pressure on Barclays reaffirming its belief that the bank should retain core capital and therefore cut the dividend. CLL told its clients to either sell or switch from NatWest and Barclays and to buy Lloyds, Abbey National, Royal Bank of Scotland and TSB. Abbey, due to report preliminary figures on March 2, added 3 at 388p, helped by aggressive buying of the stock options. SG Warburg jumped 8 to 628p, after 635p, reflecting the fees accruing from its role in the ICI/Zeneca rights issue. British Gas shares made early progress, touching 292p, but later eased to close unchanged at 289p as the market assessed the sharp decline in the group's preliminary results. Analysts said the profit shortfall reflected the unexpectedly large restructuring charge and there was general satisfaction with the dividend increase. But specialists were alarmed at the chairman's statement on dividend policy. One said: 'A company that is haemorrhaging cash, with profits below expectations and a dividend under threat from the Monopolies Commission mean that investment in it is a real act of faith.' Royal Insurance closed unchanged at 285p after the preliminary figures which were accompanied by a Pounds 100m bond issue. This was seen as lifting the threat of a rights issue in the short term. Analysts pointed to the underlying improvement in the insurance business, with current year estimates being lifted to around the Pounds 100-Pounds 110m mark. General Accident suffered again from worries that a big rights issue, in the region of Pounds 400m to Pounds 500m could appear with the preliminary results expected on March 2. Prudential jumped 8 to 317p after good figures from its US subsidiary Jackson National. Shell's preliminary numbers were given a relatively good reception by the market and the shares edged up to close at 583p. Turnover, still boosted by talk of switching out of Royal Dutch, reached 7.1m shares. One analyst said the dividend was at the top end of expectations but cautioned about the continuing losses in the chemicals business. BP held at 275 1/2 p despite broker recommendations to switch out of the shares and into Shell. Bargain hunters helped cause a rally in several of the photo copier related stocks which fell heavily on Wednesday on fears that the OFT may launch an investigation into their activities. Gestetner put on 5 to 136p, while Southern Business Group also gained 5 to 84p. The market continued to appreciate the restructuring plans at British Aerospace. The shares closed 2 up at 267p, following the payment of a 3p interim dividend. The final dividend payment of 4p which was announced on Wednesday is due on Monday. The company is holding another session on its trading outlook for analysts today. Rolls-Royce was also busy with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said to be positive on the stock. The shares added 4 to 132p in trade of 5.1m. Talk that Abu Dhabi was about to place an order for 8 Super Lynx helicopters with Westland Group, boosted the shares. They gained 4 to 150p, with turnover reaching 4.4m. Volume in conglomerate Tomkins rose to 7.1m as the shares eased 5 to 261p, with most of the day's selling having been conducted through a leading US house. Worries about the poor state of the German automotive industry left GKN shares 4 lighter at 462p. Inchcape added 4 to 598p after announcing that its Inchcape rBerhad subsidiary was to sell its timber business to local Singapore investors for around Pounds 24m. There was more tired talk of rights issues around Allied Lyons, although dealers said more hurtful was a rumour of a downgrade by agency broker James Capel. The shares dropped 5 to 585p. A line of over 1m shares hung over Bass for most of the session and weakened the shares, off 3 at 574p. MARKET REPORTERS: Christopher Price, Peter John, Joel Kibazo, Steve Thompson.

Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> HONECKER HAS TUMOR REMOVED  </P> <P> Former East German leader Erich Honecker underwent a successful operation for a  malignant kidney tumor today, the official East German news agency ADN  reported.  </P> <P> Doctors had said Honecker, under investigation on charges of profiteering and  abuses of power during his 18 years as East Germany's hard-line Communist  leader, had been too ill to be jailed and he was released from house arrest  last week. It was not immediately clear whether Honecker, 77, would be jailed  after his recuperation.  </P> <P> ADN, quoting a Health Ministry spokesman, said, "The tumor was radically  removed. The operation was carried out successfully."  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Economics Andrey Chernyavskiy by </F> V. Savchenko under the rubric "Economics: The Market, Reforms":  "The Most Dangerous Thing Now Is Not To Do Anything"]    [Text] Crimeans are expecting concrete actions from the new  government today. And one must say that a start has been made.  The Program of Economic Reforms for 1994-98 was considered and  approved at the meeting of the government. Ahead lies its  approval by the Supreme Council.    We addressed several questions to one of the program's main  developers, Minister of Economics Andrey Chernyavskiy.    [Savchenko] Andrey Vasilyevich, which initial steps must be  taken for the economy of Crimea to emerge from its crisis  condition? Are these envisioned in the program?    [Chernyavskiy] Yes, the program earmarks tasks for the  medium-range future that must be carried out during the course  of this year. First of all we must improve legislation,  contribute to the establishment and strengthening of economic  ties with suppliers of raw material and consumers of products,  implement a complex of measures for improving the system of  credit for enterprises, and try to supplement their working  resources. These tasks ensue from an overall analysis of the  situation in Crimea, which is given in the first part of this  program.    The situation in Crimea, as throughout all Ukraine, is  indeed  difficult since the transition to a market economy is proceeding  more painfully than in Russia. This is related to the slow  progress along the path of reforms. Privatization is being drawn  out. In spite of the fact that the old levers for management of  the economy have been lost, certain elements of the old system  remain. For instance, the fixed exchange rate between the  karbovanets and foreign currencies, the system of ministries,  and the system for distribution of financial resources and  regulation of wages. Last year Ukraine experienced  hyperinflation, which is causing a sharp drop in the standard of  living of people, primarily those who receive incomes from the  budget. But they include physicians, teachers, and pensioners.  The only positive tendency in Ukraine's modern economic policy  is its course toward strengthening the karbovanets. But this, in  turn, is having a painful effect on the financial resources of  enterprises and incomes of the population. Enterprises are  experiencing a deflation shock. Prices continue to rise out of  momentum. The production slope has become ingrained and, since  the beginning of the year, industrial production has decreased  by more than 30 percent.    [Savchenko] And which enterprises are already standing idle?  Foton?    [Chernyavskiy] Foton is still in operation, but the  Dzhankoyskiy machine building plant has been shut down.  Completely.    The government is faced with the problem of normalizing the  activity of Crimean enterprises and agriculture during this  transition period and setting up a financial-credit system. In  our opinion, it would be a good idea to bring foreign banks into  the territory of Crimea. They would be the conductors of foreign  investments, they would make it possible to reduce credit rates,  and perhaps they would also make it possible to effectively  invest the funds of both the population and the enterprises.  But, so far, this intention of the Crimean Government is  encountering stiff resistance from Ukraine. In the banking  sphere its government is conducting a policy of isolationism and  refusal to allow foreign banks on its territory.    The amount of internal capital needed to open a new bank has  also increased. It is equivalent to 3 million ECU's. At the  market exchange rate this is $1 million. Not everyone can meet  this requirement.    I should also like to mention the fact that Crimea is not  getting its fair share of credit resources. It is necessary to  enter a negotiating process with Ukraine so that the republic  will receive them at least on the same level as other oblasts.  This would make it possible for enterprises and trade  organizations to breathe more freely.    [Savchenko] Do you discuss the crucial problems of the  present day with the leaders of the enterprises?    [Chernyavskiy] Yes. Conversations with directors show that  there are many obstacles to their normal activity. The Crimean  economy is extremely open and many enterprises are oriented  toward trade primarily with Russia. They receive raw material  from there and Russia is a sales market for their finished  products. But, as of today, trade with Russia is extremely  difficult if only because of the demand for prepayment  introduced by Ukraine. Russia can be a sales market if goods are  delivered there without demanding prepayment. As a result of  this requirement problems have arisen for the Foton plant,  although Russian trade is ready to buy Simferopol television  sets in order to sell them there.    The government will contribute to concluding agreements,  including on the territorial principle. Perhaps on this basis we  will succeed in setting up mutual deliveries of finished  products so as to invigorate industry and agriculture.  Additionally, we will search for financial resources for  resolving the agrarian situation. Perhaps steps will be taken to  work on incomplete construction projects. It would be hard to  speak of this with complete confidence at this point.    [Savchenko] Will privatization be started in Crimea? The  previous deputy corps, as we know, placed a moratorium on it.    [Chernyavskiy] Privatization is being dragged out  disgracefully in the Crimea. The Ministry of Economics has  prepared a privatization program that will be submitted to the  government for discussion and then to the Supreme Council. We  already have a thick file of applications from enterprises for  privatization, although I must say that the directors have  various attitudes toward this process. The four trade ports that  ended up on the list for privatization according to the edict of  the president of Crimea (and Ukraine also) are categorically  against it. And world experience suggests that the majority of  ports in the world are not private property. But the enterprises  are basically in favor of privatization.    Since Ukraine considers a number of enterprises to be its  property it could begin the privatization process itself.  Certain steps have already been taken in this direction,  incidentally. By an edict of the Ukrainian president a state  petroleum and gas holding company has been created in which the  Chernomorneftegaz Association accounts for more than half of the  property. This alarms us extremely.    [Savchenko] You have exchanged the chair of a scholar for  the  post of minister--is that the fashion today?    [Chernyavskiy] It seems to me that the activity in the  ministry is interesting and forward-looking, and, of course, I  am counting on doing something useful for Crimea, for otherwise  it would not be worth getting into this. But our Moscow team  began to work in a very difficult period. The situation may get  worse for a number of reasons that are beyond our control. The  government of the transition period is very much under the gun.  It can always be accused of allowing things to get worse than  they were. We are in a difficult situation because our work with  the Supreme Council is not going smoothly and we do not know  when it will. But the most dangerous thing now is not to do  anything. The government will take steps in all the directions  earmarked in the program.    [Savchenko] Is your ministry's team fully staffed?    [Chernyavskiy] It is very difficult to recruit people. The  salary of the minister is about 1 million karbovantsy. The  workers will receive even less.    Naturally, it is difficult to find educated, energetic  people  who are willing to work for such wages.    [Savchenko] How much time does the Moscow team intend to  spend working in Crimea? Will you last long?    [Chernyavskiy] I do not know how long we will last. But  catching up with things, learning about the enterprises, drawing  up more concrete action plans, implementing them, setting up  stable contacts with Kiev, and evaluating the first results of  the reforms will take a minimum of about two years. We would  like to be useful to Crimea, the Crimean economy, and the people  who are living on this peninsula.</p>

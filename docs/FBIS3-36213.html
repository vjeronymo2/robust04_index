			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev, 2 Feb -- The deputies considered and approved  amendments and additions to the law of Ukraine on the taxation  system. An explanatory note indicates that according to the law  the taxation system is built on the principles of social  justice. The law determines the conditions of taxation, the  taxpayers, and the procedure of registering the objects of  taxation. Two types of taxes are envisaged: state -- which are  determined by the Supreme Council of Ukraine and are valid on  the entire territory of Ukraine -- and local taxes and fees --  for example, advertisement fees, health resort fees, etc. The  explanatory note indicates that the adoption of the law on the  taxation system will promote the building of a taxation system  that would comply with the demands of a transitional period.    The deputies approved changes to the procedural code of  Ukraine in connection with the adoption of the law of Ukraine on  the election of people's deputies. The code is supplemented  with the "Statement on the abrogation of the decision of the  district electoral commission on the registration of a candidate  for people's deputy" and the "Complaints about the decisions and  actions by the Central Elections Commission."    The deputies began considering a draft concept of developing  the fuel and energy complex of Ukraine up to the year 2010.    Deputy Minister of Economy Volodymyr Hureyev made a report.  Minister of Power Engineering and Electrification Vilen Semenyuk  and Mykhaylo Kovalko, the chairman of DerzhKomNaftoHas [state  oil and gas committee], delivered the second and third reports.  The deputies approved a resolution consisting of two points:  agreement in general with the draft concept of developing the  fuel and energy complex of Ukraine up to the year 2010 and  charging the cabinet of ministers with elaborating and approving  a national program for the "Implementation of Ukraine's energy  policy" proceeding from the above concept. An explanatory note,  signed by acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zuyahilskyy, indicates  that in the future it would be expedient to satisfy the national  economy needs for electric power through the use of coal -- 50  percent, uranium -- 40 percent, and the rest -- through the use  of other energy sources. It is envisaged to satisfy the need  for coal up to the year 2010 completely at the expense of our  own resources. For this purpose it is necessary to begin  digging 25 new mines. The possibility of building new thermal  power stations is not ruled out, in particular, the building of  a station in Chernigov Oblast that would solve the social issues  of the collective of the Chernobyl nuclear power station, which  will carry out intensive preparations for a stoppage. Ukraine's  needs for oil and gas will be satisfied mainly at the expense of  their import.    Fifteen trillion [as received] karbovantsi are required for  the development of the coal industry by the year 2005 at the  prices of the first quarter of last year. The extraction of  coal in 2005 will amount to 160 million tons. Nine trillion  karbovantsi are required for the development of the gas and oil  industry. This will allow the output of oil in 2010 to increase  to 7.5 million tons and gas to 30 billion cubic meters.  Expenditures for carrying out measures to develop electric  power engineering will amount to approximately 25 trillion  karbovantsi.</p>

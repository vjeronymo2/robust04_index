			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: MOVIE SET SCOUT STILL LOOKING FOR DREAM  </P> <P> Like most kids, Laura (Lolly) Powell, dreamed of being in the movies.  </P> <P> But now that she's close to the movie-making action, Powell has a different set  of dreams.  </P> <P> "If I had a choice, I'd like to be a co-host with (TV talk show host) David  Letterman," mused the Fullerton woman who gets paid to find filming sites and  buildings in Orange County for movie-makers.  </P> <P> She works in the Orange County Film Liaison Office and despite her close  connection with movie people, Powell finds the movie-making process somewhat  uninteresting.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of standing around," said the Pepperdine University graduate who  majored in sports medicine. "I just want to see the finished product."  </P> <P> Standing around and being idle is not one of Powell's traits.  </P> <P> She kept an active life after college including European travel, working as a  law firm researcher, writing manuals for an automobile advertising association  and formulating direct mail campaigns for an advertising agency. She also  worked as a personal trainer in health clubs but said she was more interested  in putting out the club's newsletter than helping keep people fit.  </P> <P> As a matter of fact, Powell, 29, would rather be a writer. Part of her job in  the film office is writing and taking pictures for the county's monthly  employee newsletter.  </P> <P> "I like writing and would rather be on the other side of this interview," she  said. "That may be my future. Seeing something you have written in print or a  picture you have taken validates what you do."  </P> <P> Until then, she's making a name for herself with the movie folks.  </P> <P> "I guess they find themselves comfortable working with me," said Powell who  often finds herself trying to fill seemingly impossible requests.  </P> <P> In fact, she's trying to find a building with lots of glass in front and back  that can be destroyed.  </P> <P> "They want to film a truck driving through the front door and out the back,"  she said. "It's sometimes hard to convince the building's owner that it can be  returned to its original condition."  </P> <P> Powell, who said she is rarely surprised with some of the film requests, which  include blowing up a building, appears to be filling the bill.  </P> <P> As of June, the county has issued 16 film permits, just one less than all of  last year and Powell feels that the number will double this year.  </P> <P> "It would be my hope it would triple," she said.  </P> <P> Powell likes to get out on film location.  </P> <P> "I try to make contact with the people that I deal with," she said, while  walking through a film setting in front of the Santa Ana Hall of  Administration.  </P> <P> Since accepting the film liaison job a year ago, Powell had a more than passing  interest in her travels through the county.  </P> <P> At times she has to be aware of location problems such as having a palm tree  near a spot where the producer wants a Midwestern look. "I'm always looking for  a site location some film company might use," she said.  </P> <P> In fact she is putting together a location guide of Orange County sites and has  developed a network with the various cities in the county for filming  locations.  </P> <P> Powell said part of her efforts is not only to keep filmmaking in California,  but to make Orange County one of its prime locations.  </P> <P> Acknowledgments -- Fullerton Police Sgt. Joe Klein won three gold medals in  discus, shot-put and hammer throw in the recent International Law Enforcement  Olympics in Canada. In winning the discus, the 15-year police veteran, a Yorba  Linda resident, successfully defended his champion's title won 2 years ago in  Australia. The games are held every 2 years.  </P></p>

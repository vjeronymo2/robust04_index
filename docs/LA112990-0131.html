			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW BOOK IS THE LAST WORD ON UCLA SLANG;  </P> <P> LANGUAGE: A PROFESSOR HAS TRANSLATED THE TERMINOLOGY USED BY JOE AND JOSEPHINE  BRUINS AT PRETTY PEOPLE UNIVERSITY.  </P> <P> Not too long ago, linguistics professor Pamela Munro didn't know a "beauhunk"  from a "goob."  </P> <P> Then she started assigning her students at UCLA to collect slang terms. And  last fall, after students in her Linguistics 88A seminar had collected and  compiled an extensive list, they decided they had the makings of a book.  </P> <P> The result, a dictionary called "U.C.L.A. Slang," is a hot item in the  bookstore at "Pretty People University" (UCLA). Now, even the most uncool  "remos" (nerds) on campus who may "jones for" (really want) popularity can use  the dictionary to learn what's hip.  </P> <P> More than 2,300 copies have been sold locally. The dictionary has been so well  received that Harmony Books, which is a part of Random House, has picked it up  for publication and will release a more comprehensive version under the title  "Slang U," expected to reach bookstores by early February.  </P> <P> Although excited over the dictionary's success, Munro is taking the hoopla --  not to be confused with "brewhaha," which at UCLA means beer -- in stride.  </P> <P> "I think everybody is interested in slang," she said. "A lot of the expressions  in the dictionary are funny."  </P> <P> The dictionary is popular not just among the school's "beauhunks" (gorgeous  men) and "bettys" (gorgeous women), "goobs" and "dweebs" (nerds of any sex),  and "way fashionable studs." Parents are also getting in on the action.  </P> <P> "I've had a number of parents say they bought the dictionary so they could  understand what their child is saying," Munro said. "Some read it and say they  can't believe people are saying these things."  </P> <P> A linguistics professor at UCLA since 1974, Munro said she was turned on to the  richness of slang in 1981 by Connie Eble, a professor at the University of  North Carolina at Chapel Hill who publishes papers on campus slang each year.  </P> <P> The use of slang is nothing new, Munro noted. One of its functions is to help  define distinct social groups.  </P> <P> Munro said the ephemeral quality of slang is unpredictable. "Some slang words  stay around and some don't," she said. "It's really hard to say which ones will  last."  </P> <P> Although some of the entries in the dictionary are common to campuses across  the nation, Munro said many are unique to "Joe and Josephine Bruins" (UCLA  students).  </P> <P> Slang, she said, comes from a variety of sources. Some terms are adaptations of  existing words, some are compounded or come from standard vocabulary and others  are words picked up from television and movie characters.  </P> <P> For example, Munro cited a popular word that is not listed in the campus  dictionary but will be in the Harmony Books version: "Sally," a name given to a  woman who is compulsive and meticulous. It comes from the movie "When Harry Met  Sally," Munro said.  </P> <P> Although the study of slang is only a small portion of her work, Munro said it  has been enlightening.  </P> <P> "If you study any kind of language, you learn a great respect for the human  brain," she said. "There are clever minds that come up with these slangs, and  you think, 'How did someone come up with this?' "  </P> <P> No doubt the students at UCLA think it's "no biggie." They come up with slang  terms "24-7" (all the time, derived from 24 hours a day, seven days a week).  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'U.C.L.A. SLANG': A SAMPLER  </P> <P> Here is a sampling of words and expressions found in "U.C.L.A. Slang":  </P> <P> adonis -- extremely nice-looking, breathtaking; used as a noun or adjective.  </P> <P> bag on -- to talk badly about, criticize.  </P> <P> be illin -- to be in a bad or unfortunate situation, to act stupid.  </P> <P> couch commander -- a TV remote control, or the person holding it.  </P> <P> duck -- a geek, or totally uncool person.  </P> <P> filet -- cute girl.  </P> <P> foof -- superficial person.  </P> <P> fossil -- person who has been in college more than four years.  </P> <P> get sloppy -- to have sex.  </P> <P> homie -- close, dependable friend, buddy.  </P> <P> life jacket -- condom.  </P> <P> location joke! -- You had to be there.  </P> <P> mick -- easy class or course (short for Mickey Mouse).  </P> <P> M.O.S. -- member of the opposite sex.  </P> <P> nail jelly to a tree -- to do the impossible.  </P> <P> nasty -- sexually attractive.  </P> <P> nisty -- very ugly.  </P> <P> Tina Tridelt -- someone female who is incredibly superficial-looking or acting;  may or may not be in a sorority.  </P> <P> University of Second Choice -- University of Scholastic Compromise, etc. are  references to a certain rival institution across town.  </P></p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Cambodia acts to attract 'good' foreign investment The Cambodian government has completed a draft investment law which it hopes will help its efforts to change the country's image from the home of the killing fields to an investment opportunity. The law, which will be presented to donor countries at an aid conference in Tokyo later this week, provides a wide range of incentives to what Mr Sam Rainsy, finance minister, calls good investors. 'What I hope is that the good investors will drive out the bad,' he said. Mr Rainsy, who has acquired a reputation as a fighter because of his outspoken criticism of his predecessors, wants to encourage investors interested in the long-term development of Cambodia. He wants to keep out those who are only interested in making a quick profit and then leaving. Many of his criticisms are directed against Thai investors, who have gained a reputation for short-term interest. Mr Rainsy complains about a Thai 'mafia' operating in Cambodia, which he says did corrupt deals with the old government. Mr Rainsy insists that he is not saying good investment depends on the origin of the investor: 'I don't want to say that good or bad depends on the nationality. So far, we have seen many bad investors from neighbouring countries and many good investors from Europe and Japan, but I can give some examples of bad investors coming even from Europe and America.' Nonetheless, he has made bitter enemies among the Thai community, especially in one company which he says is the centre of the Thai 'mafia' in Cambodia. Mr Rainsy alleges that he is the subject of at least one murder contract. He says his efforts to improve the investment environment will soon make Cambodia more of a magnet to foreign investors than Vietnam: 'People talk a lot about investment in Vietnam but in five or six years, Vietnam has attracted only Dollars 1bn in foreign domestic investment, which is very little compared to its size.' 'In Vietnam, there are many problems for foreign investors,' he says. 'First of all, Vietnam is still a communist country, with no political freedom. In a country where there's no political freedom, it doesn't create the right environment for the private sector to prosper. So far, Cambodia has attracted very little foreign investment and the projects which have been started have largely been in Mr Rainsy's 'bad' category, buying up the country's natural resources for sale at a quick profit. There is also no sign of foreign companies setting up offices in Cambodia at anything like the speed they are arriving in Vietnam. Nevertheless, given three to five years, the hyperactive finance minister insists he could turn the economy around. Some of his hopes rest on this week's donors meeting So far, the international community has poured nearly Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) into Cambodia - including one of the largest United Nations operations the world has ever seen. Mr Rainsy believes the new government will show the world that its investment has been worthwhile. 'We will show the international community that Cambodia is worth helping. In order to show that, we have to demonstrate our will and our ability to help ourselves first,' he said.</p>

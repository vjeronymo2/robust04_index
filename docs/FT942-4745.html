			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Vodafone throws down gauntlet: Group dares rivals on cuts - Cellnet says none needed / Analysts surprised Vodafone, the UK mobile communications group, said it expected to make no cuts in mobile phone tariffs this year and dared its rivals to cut theirs. At yesterday's results meeting Mr Gerry Whent, chief executive, said: 'They dare not cut another single penny, otherwise they will never see a profit.' Cellnet, Vodafone's main rival in the mobile cellular market, immediately responded that it was 'happy to see that Vodafone shares our view that no price cuts are needed'. The announcements took some analysts by surprise, given that some mobile phone tariffs have fallen by more than a third in the past year, which has seen the launch of Mercury One-2-One and Hutchison Microtel's Orange. However, one analyst said the statements were a 'clear bid' to reassure the new operators that they need not resort to tariff cutting to build UK market share. Vodafone announced a 13 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 363.3m for the year to March 31. Turnover increased 28 per cent to Pounds 850.5m, or 19 per cent leaving aside acquisitions. Mr Chris Gent, managing director of Vodafone's UK activities, predicted that the UK cellular market would grow by about 50 per cent this year, with Vodafone broadly maintaining its 59 per cent share of the value of new business, although its share of overall subscribers might fall. Last year it saw 40 per cent growth to 1.17m in subscribers to its UK network. Vodafone claimed to have 57 per cent of the lucrative UK cellular business market, despite falling to 54 per cent of subscribers as a whole - with most of the loss having gone to Cellnet. Mr Whent said the company faced two challenges: transferring new UK customers from its analogue to its new digital networks; and building up its international holdings to equal its UK cellular business in terms of the value of overseas markets covered. Vodafone has stakes in newly opened networks in Sweden, Germany, Hong Kong, Greece, Australia, South Africa and Malta. Start-up costs trebled to Pounds 45m last year and are projected to reach Pounds 80m this year. The group had year-end net cash of Pounds 111.1m, down from Pounds 152.2m. Vodafone is bidding for licences in Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and Ireland, and said it was in talks about up to four acquisitions. Earnings per share rose 10 per cent to 24.34p (22.07p). A final dividend of 4.23p makes a total of 8.35p, up 20 per cent. Vodafone is proposing a two-for-one scrip issue. Its shares slipped 4p to 518p yesterday. Lex, Page 24</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sanita Upleja: "LNNK Faction Announces Crisis in </F> Parliament and Government"]    [Text] Riga, 2 Feb -- The Movement for Latvia's National  Independence [LNNK] faction in the Saeima [parliament] is of the  opinion that due to the ill-considered actions of the  government, there is a crisis in the Saeima, as well as the  government, the LNNK deputies announced at a press conference  today. The deputies stated at the conference that the  opposition is going to establish a "shadow cabinet." However,  they still have to wait for the right moment -- among other  reasons, because of lack of resources. The LNNK deputies said  that the government itself could solve the situation by  seriously reconsidering its actions.    The LNNK faction has also disseminated a statement, in which  it asks all inhabitants of Latvia to express their views on the  actions of the Latvia's Way and Farmers Union coalition, as well  as those of the government that was established by this  coalition. The LNNK also urged representatives of all Saeima  factions to respect the interests of the Latvian nation, instead  of supporting "various interest groups."    As Maris Budovskis stated at the conference, the reason for  the government crisis is the great haste with which the  government strives to take over all possible power. As an  example, M. Budovskis pointed to the cabinet's 28 December 1993  decision to put the Radio and Television Council under the  control of the Ministry of Education, Science, and Culture. In  his opinion, this is a dangerous precedent which shows their  desire to control the mass media. According to M. Budovskis,  the Parliamentary Commission of State Administration and  Municipality has informed the government that several  parliamentary commissions have protested against this  subordination of the Radio and Television Council. He also  recalled the unfortunate laws passed by the cabinet, under  Article 81 of the Constitution during parliamentary recesses,  and expressed doubt as to their legality and the need for such  haste in passing them.    M. Budovskis stressed that many of the government laws were  passed in contradiction to Article 81, because they introduced  changes in laws that had already been passed by the existing  Saeima. Moreover, several of these laws had been drafted and  submitted at the time to the Saeima and were awaiting  discussion. By adopting those laws, the government has shown a  lack of trust in the Saeima's competence and has reduced the  powers of the municipalities. M. Budovskis also stated that the  ill-considered behavior of the cabinet apparently has created  conflict in the Latvia's Way faction, because certain voting  results bear evident signs of a breakdown in faction discipline.  At the same time, Aristids Lambergs predicted that in the very  near future the ruling coalition would find itself in danger of  splitting, and that it should think of attracting partners from  other factions. LNNK Deputy Anna Seile expressed the opinion  that currently "the government dictates the rules to the  governing coalition," while the coalition should be the one to  regulate the activities of the government that was created by it.</p>

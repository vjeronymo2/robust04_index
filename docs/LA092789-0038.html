			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Willard White, a basso remembered in Los Angeles for appearances with the New  York City Opera, has recently concentrated his career in Great Britain. His  repertory has grown to embrace such disparities as Mozart's Osmin, Wagner's  Wotan and Gershwin's Porgy, a role he has sung in two complete recordings. Now,  following in the formidable footsteps of Paul Robeson, he has taken the leap to  the so-called legitimate stage. Trevor Nunn, the director of "Starlight  Express" and "Les Miserables," has cast White as the Moor of Venice in  Shakespeare's "Othello" in Stratford-on-Avon. Shauna Snow  </P></p>

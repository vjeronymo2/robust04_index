			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / UK's misguided attack on Brussels It too often seems the Brussels Commission can do no good in British eyes - it is attacked by British ministers both when it is wrong and when it is right. The widely reported strictures made by Kenneth Clarke, the British chancellor, on Community documents at a finance ministers' meeting in Brussels a week ago today, is a case in point. Ministers had in front of them at least two separate economic documents. One was a 'Note on the Economic Elements of the White Paper' that the Community president, Jacques Delors, will be presenting at the forthcoming EU summit, but which will fortunately not be binding. The second was a draft 'Framework for the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines' required under the multilateral surveillance clauses of the Maastricht Treaty. The White Paper draft deserves all the invective of which Mr Clarke is capable, and more. Indeed Jacques Delors himself seemed to a few of those present to be distancing himself from it. Some people have divined behind the thick fog of its prose a call for compulsory shorter hours. That is the least of its faults. The document has all the hallmarks of the Social Affairs Directorate. Its prose is Eurospeak at its very worst and it is difficult to imagine in what language (if any) it was originally written. There is no diagnosis of the causes of unemployment and no meaningful policy prescription. An example is paragraph five: 'Our intuition, backed by the renewed dynamism shown by the European economies from 1985 to 1990, is that Europeans can conceive a model of development in line with their traditions, preserving their social model while adapting it, fully integrating technological progress and the environment, offering to all the prospect of integration in society through work, social activity, participation as a citizen.' That is one of the clearer sentences. Indeed the authors throw in every worthy development of which they can think, such as 'the accelerating pace of the information-technology industry, the audio-visual sector and biotechnology' - the modern equivalents of the traditional American invocation of motherhood and apple pie. The subtext is of course clearer. The authors would like to defend all the most unfortunate European institutions (miscalled 'social') such as minimum wages, the enforcement of nationwide collective bargaining agreements, heavy overhead employment expenses and labour market restrictions. But fearing to do so too explicitly, they try to be all things to all men. By contrast, the Economic Guidelines - obviously drawn up by the DG2 directorate - were as different from the white paper as chalk from cheese. The original draft called for a reduction of two to three percentage points in average Community short-term interest rates, with the lead taken by Germany. This would signal to economic agents 'that the worst is over, that monetary policy had been loosened as much as it was possible and that nothing would be gained by further postponing any investment decisions which may have been contingent on the availability of the best financing conditions'. I would have preferred some justification for these figures - which could easily have been given in the context of an objective for a non-inflationary growth path for nominal GDP. But they are somewhere in the right ball park. Unfortunately Germany, the Netherlands and the UK managed to get this suggestion removed from the final draft. In doing so the British chancellor has scored an own goal. For it is only in the context of European or worldwide interest rate reductions that the restrictive effect of British fiscal tightening can be offset without taking the irresponsible risks with sterling that a British dash for ultra cheap money would entail. On the labour market front, the original guidelines called for an average increase in real wages of one percentage point per annum less than the rise in productivity. This is as near DG2 could go in embracing the notion of pricing people into work. An implication of the guideline would be a trend rise in the share of profits in the national income. The suggestion was however too much for the ministers who downgraded the suggestion to the historical statement that such moderation in real wage gains had occurred in 1982-89. The one area where the ministers firmed up the guidelines was the insertion of an explicit inflation target of two to three per cent per annum by 1996, a magnificent victory in the last war. The headline controversies were about the Commission's original target of at least 15m new jobs, to halve unemployment by the year 2000. Obviously this is an aspiration: the red meat is in the policy proposals (and of course in purely market-generated changes). Still, in the words of the poet Robert Browning, 'a man's reach should exceed his grasp'. But even the aspiration was too much for ministers who watered it down to a numerical illustration. The whole episode raises the wider question of the minimalist British attitude to the European Monetary Institute which starts work this coming January in Frankfurt. The work of this Institute offers the best hope of a concerted European monetary policy designed to support non-inflationary growth; and its efforts in the not-so-distant future could be far more important for the outlook for production and jobs than the parochial detail of the UK Budget. But has anyone so briefed Mr Clarke?</p>

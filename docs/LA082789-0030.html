			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PETER'S PRINCIPLES  </P> <P> I have been with (United) for over 30 years, some years as a flight attendant,  now in customer service on the ground. I want to thank Peter Greenberg for his  column (Savvy Traveler, Aug. 13). His statement "in fact there is a whole new  breed of unruly passengers" is so true, I see this every day at work at the  (Los Angeles International) airport. Tell Peter Greenberg I'd like to buy him a  drink on his next (United) flight. However, Allen Neuharth may find his dish on  his lap!  </P> <P> CAROLE PAQUIN  </P> <P> Manhattan Beach  </P></p>

			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Arts: Today's Television The last night of the year has become one of the prime moments for avoiding television if you can, but today, if you pick your way through the schedules, you should be able to avoid all that ghastly false merriment. Starting at 7.55pm BBC2 offers a performance of La Traviata recorded in La Fenice, Venice, one of the most charming opera houses in Italy, though small. Coloratura soprano Edita Gruberova sings Violetta, the doomed courtesan, tenor Neil Shicoff is Alfredo, and baritone Giorgio Germont takes the part of his namesake Giorgio. Direction for television is by Derek Bailey, one of the best in the world, with staging and design by Pier Luigi Pizzi, and the orchestra and chorus of the Fenice is under Carlo Rizzi. A treat. When that ends at 10.05pm Channel 4 will be just 15 minutes into its New Year's Eve Triple Whammy which manages to celebrate the new year three times by stationing cameras in Cape Town (new year at 10pm GMT) Prague (11pm) and Dublin (midnight). With luck this should avoid all traces of heather and fat men reading gags off autocue.</p>

			<p><P> May 15, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A federal judge has sentenced two former Oakland police officers to 120 days of  electronic "home detention" for lying about their sick leave and dictated an  apology they must make to the Police Department and the public. U.S. District  Judge John Vukasin issued the unusual sentence rather than send Johnnie F.  Clark and Theresa Jeffery to prison for perjury. They were convicted of lying  in connection with a discrimination suit they and seven other black officers  filed in 1985, accusing the city of racial bias in hiring and promotions. The  suit was later dismissed for unrelated reasons. Clark and Jeffery, who are now  married, were fired from the force in 1987.  </P></p>

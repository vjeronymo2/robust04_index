			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Hurd Mideast peace trip MR Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, arrived in Cairo last night at the start of a four-nation trip designed to bolster US peace-making efforts in the Middle East and to express concern over human rights violations in Kuwait, Roger Matthews writes. After talks today with Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel Meguid and President Hosni Mubarak, Mr Hurd will travel on to Jordan, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia before returning to London on Sunday. Britain is broadly supportive of the efforts of Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, to convene a Middle East peace conference and by visiting Amman Mr Hurd will be signalling the importance of Jordan in any resolution of Palestinian demands for self-determination. The attitude of King Hussein to the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait has left a coolness in relations between Amman and Washington which Britain would like to be eased. In Kuwait, Mr Hurd can be expected to add his weight to British efforts to win a larger share of post-war reconstruction contracts, but will also be blunt about international concern over persecution of non-Kuwaitis deemed to have co-operated with the occupying Iraqi forces.</p>

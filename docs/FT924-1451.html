			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Western Europe's new car sales up by 1.2% SALES of new cars in western Europe increased by 1.2 per cent last month, with higher demand in Germany and France compensating for a heavy decline in sales in Italy. According to industry estimates, sales in the first 11 months of the year, at 12.53m, were 1.3 per cent lower than in the corresponding period a year earlier. New car sales last month rose to an estimated 974,000 from 963,000 a year ago. However, carmakers are becoming increasingly gloomy about the outlook for new car demand in west Europe in 1993. According to Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman of the Peugeot group of France, new car sales in west Europe are forecast to fall by more than 4 per cent next year. Most car producers have already imposed short-time working, and Ford this week became the latest to announce a big cut in its workforce, with plans to eliminate more than 10,000 jobs in Europe by the end of next year. Ford's Spanish subsidiary said yesterday that it would cut 1,200 jobs next year, of which 950-1,000 would be lost at its car and engine plants at Valencia. Ford's Spanish workforce has already been reduced to 9,680 from 10,084 at the end of 1990. Despite the steep fall in new orders in Germany, new car sales in Europe's single biggest market rose last month by 4.7 per cent to 285,730. Demand is being pulled forward from January in advance of a rise in value added tax. Ominously, new car sales fell heavily in Italy, showing a decline of 11.7 per cent. Italy, the second largest car market in Europe, has long enjoyed steady demand, but sales have now been lower than a year ago for four months in succession. Demand is also weakening in Spain, where car sales fell by 1.3 per cent in November. Sales had increased strongly in the early months and in the first 11 months were still 9.9 per cent higher than a year ago. In the weak UK market, new car sales rose by 6.3 per cent in November, although sales for the first 11 months were still 1.3 per cent below the very low level of last year. Registrations in the UK have been higher than a year ago in three of the past four months, although the stronger demand is mainly coming from the fleet sector. Across west Europe, new car sales in November were lower than a year ago in nine of 17 markets. The Volkswagen group of Germany, which includes Audi, Seat and Skoda, has consolidated its lead in the west European market and has boosted its share to an estimated 17.4 per cent in the first 11 months of the year from 16.3 per cent a year ago. Despite its sales success, the group has warned this week that it has slumped into loss in the final quarter of the year. It is facing widespread short-time working at its German plants and further job cuts, as it seeks belatedly to tackle its uncompetitive German cost-base.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS                          January-November 1992  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Volume      Volume       Share (%)      Share (%)                     (Units)     Change(%)    Jan-Nov 92     Jan-Nov 91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET        12,535,000      -1.3         100.0          100.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MANUFACTURERS: Volkswagen*(incl.   2,181,000       +5.7          17.4           16.3 Audi,SEAT&amp;Skoda) General Motors      1,557,000       +0.7          12.4           12.2 (Opel/Vauxhall, US++++ &amp; Saab)  -Opel/Vauxhall     1,490,000       +1.4          11.9           11.6  -Saab**               47,000       -3.2           0.4            0.4 Peugeot (incl.      1,521,000       -0.1          12.1           12.0 Citroen) Fiat (incl.

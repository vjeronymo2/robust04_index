			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Letter: Interest rate signal in Germany Sir, Your leader ('A beleaguered government', July 7) seemed to share the consensus view that German interest rates would be slow to come down. Obviously, your leader writer had not read the reports of Volke Ruhe's meeting with Conservative MPs in which he said that another 5,000 unemployed in the western part of Germany was not significant in the context of 4m unemployed in the eastern part. His figures on unemployment are almost certainly more accurate than the more official statistics. Taken together with the federal elections due in 1994, they provide a strong indication that German interest rates will be cut sooner rather than later and that the cuts when they come will be significant.

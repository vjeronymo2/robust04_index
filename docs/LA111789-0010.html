			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SALK OFFERS TOP JOB TO N.Y. SCIENTIST  </P> <P> James Edwin Darnell, a molecular biologist with a strong administrative  background, has been offered the presidency of the Salk Institute, acting  President Renalto Dulbecco said Thursday.  </P> <P> "Final negotiations are going on now" between Darnell, a scientist at  Rockefeller University in New York City, and officials at the prestigious La  Jolla biomedical research center, Dulbecco said. "I hope there would be a  decision within a short period of time."  </P> <P> Darnell, who has been meeting with institute officials and researchers for the  past week, was the unanimous choice of the institute's faculty, Dulbecco said.  "He has also met with the search committee and they've been very pleased with  him," Dulbecco said. The search committee was created by the institute's board  of directors.  </P> <P> The institute began its search for a new president a year ago, shortly after  former President Frederic de Hoffmann resigned after 18 years as president.  Hoffmann died in October after contracting AIDS during a blood transfusion.  Dulbecco earlier this year agreed to serve as interim president.  </P> <P> The faculty was strongly impressed by Darnell's research and administrative  credentials, according to Dulbecco. Darnell, 59, "was at the top of the list"  drafted by the faculty, Dulbecco said.  </P> <P> Darnell once was chairman of Columbia University's department of biological  sciences. In 1974, he joined Rockefeller University, where he conducts research  on the molecular structure of cells.  </P></p>

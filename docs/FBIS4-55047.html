			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["lic"-signed report: "Unlike Klaus Kinkel, Czech Diplomacy </F> Regards the Sudeten German Issue as Closed"]    [Text] Prague -- According to Michal Lobkowicz, senior  director of the cabinet [vrchni reditel kabinetu] of the Czech  minister of foreign affairs, the leadership of Czech foreign  policy regards the issue of Sudeten Germans as closed.  Lobkowicz thus reacted indirectly to German Minister of Foreign  Affairs Klaus Kinkel's statement of Wednesday [4 May], in which  he called the issue of the deported Germans' freedom to settle  and property rights an "unsolved and open" problem in relations  between the two countries.    According to some sources, Kinkel's statement is proof that  Bonn wants to discuss the Sudeten German issue at government  level. "The Czech Republic regards the issue of the Sudeten  Germans as closed. This is not some optimistic assertion, it is  our position," Michal Lobkowicz stated literally.    "I do not consider it highly probable that the German side  would wish to reopen the Sudeten German problem," he added. The  senior director of the cabinet of the minister of foreign  affairs refused to specifically comment on Kinkel's statement on  the ground that he had not yet received its exact wording.  "However, the Ministry has already taken steps to obtain more  detailed information about the whole matter. This information  should become available within the next few hours or days,"  Lobkowicz went on to say. At a meeting on Thursday [5 May] with  a group of politicians from the Bundestag group of the ruling  Christian CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social  Union] parties who represent expellees' organizations, Minister  Kinkel said, furthermore, that the Federal Government would  continue to stand up for the interests of Germans who had been  expelled from eastern countries after the war. It will also do  everything it can to support the interests of those afflicted  and to bring about an interstate dialogue on this problem. At  the same time, however, Kinkel said that Germany's foremost task  in relation to its eastern neighbors was to support and assist  in the reforms and in stabilizing the situation in those  countries.</p>

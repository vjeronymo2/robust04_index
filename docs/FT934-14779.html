			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Nissan and Sunderland FC cry foul in a local derby NISSAN MOTOR UK and Sunderland football club, two determined and powerful teams, are in a head-on clash. At issue are Sunderland's plans to build an all-seater stadium next door to the carmaker's Pounds 900m plant to satisfy the requirements of the Taylor report on soccer ground safety. Sunderland FC wants to leave its Victorian ground at Roker Park in the city centre and develop a Pounds 70m 40,000-seat stadium, entertainment and conference complex with an 11,000-space car park on green belt land alongside the carmaker's 800-acre site. The proposal has appalled Nissan, which chose Wearside nine years ago for Europe's first and biggest Japanese car factory and now employs 4,600 people. It says it did not think in 1984 that it needed to buy the adjacent site - on which the club now has an option - as it was designated green belt land. Nissan says the stadium would block future expansion and jeopardise its just-in-time component supply schedules by creating traffic chaos on surrounding roads. Nissan says it has seven component suppliers within a three-mile radius making deliveries to feed the production line. 'There's a tolerance of minutes - if the delivery doesn't arrive within that time, we stop the factory,' says Mr Les Nicholls, Nissan's engineering director. Mr Nicholls says the car plant and the leisure complex are incompatible. 'We can't both be successful. Either one will fail, or they will both gradually drift into mediocrity.' Mr Bob Murray, Sunderland chairman, yesterday attacked Nissan for opposing the club's plans, which, he said, would create 2,000 jobs. He said the company should do more for Wearside, given the 'couple of hundred million pounds' of public money it had received. The club unfavourably compared Nissan's contribution of 'under Pounds 12,000' to the club with Toyota's near-Pounds 100,000 investment in Derby County. Mr John Wood, a Sunderland club director, said: 'Nissan make great play of their just-in-time deliveries. We're very aware of that. No-one can always have unimpeded access anywhere.' To cap its public relations offensive, the club announced that Mr Murray planned to give a 51 per cent stake in Sunderland to a charitable trust so the people of the north-east could regard the new complex as 'their' centre. Nissan, which spends Pounds 100,000 a year on charities in the area, rejects the claim that it should do more for Wearside. The club's application will be considered by Sunderland city council's environment committee in December or January. The planning position is unclear; although green belt now, the land is earmarked in the draft unitary development plan as a strategic site for a large development. The plan may be called in by the environment secretary, possibly leading to a public inquiry, but first the city council must decide its view. The man with the unenviable job of guiding it is director of architecture and planning Mr Ed Robson - ironically the man who co-ordinated the local authorities' battle to win the Nissan investment.

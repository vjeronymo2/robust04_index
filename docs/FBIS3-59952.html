			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Algeria has announced today its intention to join  the international non-proliferation treaty. This announcement  came on the occasion of the inauguration of El-Salam nuclear  reactor at Ain Oussera. More details with Ahmed Khida:    Khida: First, we stress that Foreign Affairs  Minister Salah Dembri officially declared today in three  languages Algeria's intention to join the international nuclear  non-proliferation treaty. He was third to speak at the  inauguration ceremony of the diplomatic missions--which were all  invited, and most of whom attended--and before international and  national journalists.    Dembri: Therefore, I officially announce  today--in the name of the highest authorities in the  country--our intention to join the nuclear non-proliferation  treaty.    Khida: Therefore, after the El-Nour nuclear  reactor in Algiers, with its weak one MW capacity, another  nuclear reactor was officially inaugurated in Ain Oussera,  Djelfa Province. It is called the El-Salam reactor and has a  capacity of 15 thermal MW. The inauguration coincided with the  35th anniversary of establishing Algerian-Chinese relations in  1958. This reactor was the product of Chinese companies. The  representatives stressed ongoing Algerian- Chinese cooperation  and revealed that IAEA experts had visited the Ain Oussera  nuclear reactor many times during the stages of its  construction, and they had become convinced that this  achievement was for purely peaceful purposes of research.    For his part, Algeria's Foreign Minister Dembri said that  the  El- Salam reactor had (?accepted) at the Algerian Government's  request to meet the guarantees of the IAEA.    National Education Minister Ahmed Jebbar, who was the first  to speak, stressed that the construction of the El-Salam nuclear  reactor was a logical culmination of the considerable efforts  exerted over 20 years in training, science, and technology.    Therefore, this new nuclear reactor is aimed at nuclear  research, which has become a major component of all systems.  The research to be carried out by this new reactor concerns the  fields of medicine, X-ray treatment, and research development in  the fields of agriculture and industry.    Finally, we record the absence of the general director of  the  IAEA, Mr. [Hans] Blix, who on this occasion sent a message to  the Algerian Government in which he stressed his belief that  this new achievement constitutes an important landmark in the  development of nuclear research and control technology.</p>

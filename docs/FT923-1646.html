			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Maastricht - After the French Vote: 'Recovery is under way but sluggish and uneven' Extracts follow from the communique of the interim committee of the board of governors of the International Monetary Fund: 'IN industrial countries, recovery is under way, but it remains sluggish and uneven, unemployment is unacceptably high, and recent exchange market tensions have increased uncertainty. Inflation and interest rates have declined significantly in a number of countries. . . the recent currency turmoil forcefully illustrates the importance of reinforced policy co-ordination, a firm implementation of the medium-term strategy, and continuing efforts toward economic convergence in Europe. The committee welcomed the actions recently taken to reduce market tensions and noted the resolve of major industrial countries to co-operate closely and to take appropriate additional actions as needed to strengthen growth without rekindling inflation and to foster greater currency stability. . . key countries need to co-operate closely. . . to bolster confidence and improve the balance between their fiscal and monetary policies, thereby facilitating a narrowing of interest rate differentials. Monetary and fiscal policies should aim at a lasting decline in long-term interest rates through a reduction in public sector borrowing and a further lowering of inflation expectations. Vigorous action must be taken to eliminate structural rigidities that impede employment and productivity growth. An early, successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round (of trade reform) would be an invaluable contribution. The committee welcomed the steady and successful implementation in many developing countries of sound economic policies and structural reforms. The committee praised the progress being made by the countries of central and eastern Europe in reforming their economies under Fund-supported programmes. There has been progress against inflation and there is some evidence that the sharp contraction of output may be coming to an end. However, the prolonged weakness of activity in some countries underlines the need to carry through further reforms quickly. The committee welcomed the evidence of further gains under the debt strategy. A number of developing countries, however, have yet to secure decisive solutions to their debt problems. The committee commended the Paris Club's provision of greater debt relief for low-income countries in the framework of strong adjustment programmes, and its readiness to consider a reduction of the stock of debt after a suitable period of adjustment.'</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / 500 jobs to go at GEC Alsthom UP TO 500 jobs are to go at GEC Alsthom's Large Steam Turbine Group at Trafford Park, Manchester, because of a sharp drop in orders as a result of the move to combined-cycle power stations, Chris Tighe writes. GEC Alsthom, a Franco-British company jointly owned by GEC and Alcatel Alsthom, is to concentrate all its UK steam turbine production at its other British steam turbine plant in Rugby, Warwickshire. The 500 job losses will be over the next two years. A total of 150 employees will be retained at the site, to service low-pressure turbines. Yesterday's announcement does not affect other parts of the Trafford Park site, where GEC Alsthom employs 2,450 people.</p>

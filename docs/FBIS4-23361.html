			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] All major banks remained closed today following a  strike staged by unionizable employees. The strike which went  into effect this morning caused frustrations to hundreds of  customers. At one Barclays Bank branch in Nairobi, a manager and  two other employees were held hostage by customers demanding  that the doors be opened. Unionizable employees gave a notice  on Tuesday [31 May] saying they wanted a 70 percent pay rise.  Their employers did not agree to the demand saying that they  will not be able to afford it.

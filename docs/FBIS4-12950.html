			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "King Husayn Rejects U.S. Offer To </F> Carry Out Inspection Inside al-'Aqabah Port"]    [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Well-informed Jordanian  sources confirmed yesterday that the Jordanian monarch, King  Husayn, has rejected a clause stipulating setting up a U.S.  inspection position inside al-'Aqabah Port, because that impairs  Jordanian sovereignty and provokes the Jordanians' feelings.    The sources said that U.S.-Jordanian contacts over the past  few days resulted in an initial agreement containing a number of  points on arrangements in Jordanian territorial waters and  inside al-'Aqabah Port. Their aim is to ascertain Jordan's  compliance with the Security Council resolutions concerning the  economic embargo imposed on Iraq.    The sources added that the point that angered the Jordanian  monarch is the proposal that U.S. soldiers and observers be  allowed to inspect containers inside the port.    Early in the week reports said that an agreement had been  reached between Washington and Amman to ease the al-'Aqabah Port  blockade.    Meanwhile, a Jordanian Foreign Ministry source has ruled out  a visit to the region at the end of the month by U.S. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher, despite the official U.S.  announcement of the date of the visit.    The source told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the delay in signing  an Israeli-Palestinian agreement on arrangements for withdrawal  from Gaza and Jericho is bound to change the date and program of  the anticipated visit. The U.S. secretary was expected to  attend the signing ceremony in Cairo, that is in addition to a  number of European foreign ministers.    The Jordanian sources said that the continuation of the  al-'Aqabah blockade is the result of Jordan's repeated rejection  of the U.S.-Israeli pressures -- which have reached the point of  going beyond diplomatic behavior -- designed to force Jordan to  hasten to sign a separate peace agreement with Israel, as they  are not content with the signing of the agenda.    The sources added that whenever the course of the  negotiations with the Palestinians in Cairo and Paris becomes  complicated and the signing of the principles agreement, which  was expected to take place on 20 April, is delayed, more  pressure is exerted on Jordan by every possible means to push it  toward signing a peace agreement.</p>

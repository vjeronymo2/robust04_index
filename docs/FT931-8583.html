			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: BF Goodrich to spin off Geon Vinyl arm BF GOODRICH, the Ohio-based specialty chemical and aerospace products group, yesterday announced that it is going to spin off its Geon Vinyl division. Goodrich expects to gain as much as Dollars 310m from an initial public offering Geon's stock, as well as Dollars 200m in special distributions before the completion of the offering. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Geon Company said BF Goodrich intended to offer about 50 per cent of Geon Vinyl stock to the public, if market conditions were favourable. Geon is expected to assume about Dollars 30m of BF Goodrich's existing debt. Geon Vinyl produces vinyl resins and compounds which are used in a variety of applications, including construction products, business machine components and appliance parts. The division is based in Independence, Ohio, and operates 14 manufacturing plants in the US, Canada, and Australia. Geon Vinyl has 2,500 employees, while BF Goodrich has about 13,200. BF Goodrich said Geon Vinyl had revenues of Dollars 950m in 1992, down slightly from Dollars 981m in 1991. Geon Vinyl logged a net loss of about Dollars 3.3m last year, and a loss of Dollars 26.5m in 1991. BF Goodrich itself had revenues of Dollars 2.5bn in 1992, with net income of Dollars 2.5m and a per share loss of 23 cents. Mr John Ong, BF Goodrich chairman, said his company intended to use the proceeds of the Geon Vinyl spin-off to expand Goodrich's specialty chemicals and aerospace businesses. Whirlpool, the leading US producer of home appliances, expects its American sales to increase between 3 per cent and 4 per cent in 1993 from the previous year, Reuter reports. Mr William Marohn, chief operating officer said that recovery in the US would boost sales in the industry by between 3 and 4 per cent this year. 'Based on what we have seen so far in the first quarter, my sense is that we are still living with that projection,' he said. Its North American sales were around Dollars 2bn with group sales of Dollars 7.3bn last year.</p>

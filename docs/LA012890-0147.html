			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CANYONS BEATS OXNARD FOR 3RD WIN IN A ROW  </P> <P> Chalk up another win for the revamped College of the Canyons lineup.  </P> <P> Canyons reeled off its third consecutive Western State Conference victory since  moving 6-foot-3 sophomore Aaron Clark from guard to center, emerging with a  72-64 win over Oxnard on Saturday night at Canyons.  </P> <P> Freshman guard Nick Sanderson led Canyons (11-14, 4-4 in conference play) with  21 points and Steve Valenzuela added 17.  </P> <P> "(Clark) adds a new dimension to our game at center," said Canyons Coach Lee  Smelser, whose team started conference play 1-4. "He's quick and a good outside  shooter. It helps bring the opposing center outside and opens things up inside.  It was originally a desperation move, but it turned out to be a good coaching  decision."  </P> <P> Sanderson is the leader in another area as well. The conference's top  free-throw shooter, Sanderson was eight of eight from the line as Canyons  converted 20 of 23 free throws.  </P> <P> Canyons hit only one field-goal attempt in the final 8 minutes 36 seconds but  sank seven of eight free throws down the stretch to preserve the win.  </P> <P> Canyons led at the half, 44-42, but went on a 10-4 run in a 4:12 span to start  the second half and open an eight-point advantage.  </P> <P> The Cougars extended the lead to 11, 65-54, with 8:52 to play on Valenzuela's  reverse layup off a back-door pass from Chris Dyer.  </P> <P> Oxnard (12-11, 3-4) pulled to within six, at 70-64, but Sanderson sank a pair  of free throws with 30 seconds remaining to seal the win.  </P> <P> Oxnard's Randy Carter, who came into the game with a conference-leading  24.9-point scoring average, had 26 points and teammate Joe Daughrity  contributed 15.  </P> <P> Larry Allbritton, Steve Kelly and Clark, scored 12, nine and seven points  respectively.  </P></p>

			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Further sale nets Lucas Pounds 9m - On target to complete Pounds 100m divestment programme by October LUCAS INDUSTRIES, the engineering group which is refocusing on its core activities, is on target to complete a Pounds 100m divestment programme by the end of October. This follows yesterday's sale of its aerospace engineering and heating systems businesses. The Luton-based business, which has assets of Pounds 8.8m, employs over 300 people and had turnover of more than Pounds 17m in 1992, has been sold to a management-led buy-out team backed by UK financial institutions for Pounds 9m, and will trade under the new name Aerospace Composite Technologies. The management buy-out of the engineering and heating business, which is mainly involved in manufacturing high technology aircraft windows and de-icing systems, means that three of the original four businesses identified for divestment in October last year have now been sold. Lucas' UK Autocentres business was sold to Lex Service for Pounds 13m in March, the fluid power systems business went to Sophus Berendson for Pounds 40m the following month, and several smaller disposals have been completed during the year bringing the total raised through the divestments to about Pounds 70m. The defence fabrications business based in Burnley, which manufactures missile cases, and an acoustic instruments company in Hertfordshire remain for sale together with the aerospace switchgear, ignition and wiring businesses in Coventry and Newcastle-under-Lyme which were added to the list of candidates for sale in March. Proceeds of the sales are being ploughed back into Lucas' core operations in the aerospace and automotive markets rather than being used to reduce debt, and year-end gearing is expected to remain about 44 per cent. Yesterday's sale to the existing management was the first MBO arranged by Lucas in conjunction with NatWest Ventures and Montague Private Equity, which co-led and jointly funded the institutional equity requirement for the new company. The existing management, led by Mr Phil Barrington, managing director, has taken a minority shareholding in ACT and Bank of Scotland has provided debt and working capital facilities. ACT is a leading supplier of high technology cockpit windows for aircraft, including windows with radar-defeating 'stealth' coatings and de-icing equipment for aircraft including Concorde, Tornado fighters and the Westland's new EH101 helicopter. The company also manufactures electroluminescent lighting for aircraft and other applications.</p>

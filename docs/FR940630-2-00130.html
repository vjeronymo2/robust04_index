			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202(d), I have determined that, based on the licensee's consent to the issuance of this Order and the public health, safety, and interest, this Order shall be immediately effective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to sections 53, 161b, 161i, 161o of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR Part 70, it is hereby ordered, effective immediately, that License SNM&hyph;124 is modified by addition of the following conditions, to require Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc. to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. By November 1, 1994, submit a technically derived characterization plan. The characterization plan must provide a program to reasonably define the extent and nature of the contamination in Pond 4 and other areas of the plant site used for waste management and disposal, denoted as the crosshatched area on the attached plane outline of the licensee's facility. (Appendix I)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Perform all current decommissioning and decontamination of the Pond 4 area within Building 410 in accordance with the ``Decommissioning/Interim Measures Workplan for the Pond 4 Area, Solid Waste Management, Units 2, 4, and 6,'' dated December 7, 1993, Revision 1 of the Interim Workplan dated June 16, 1994, and the letter dated June 1, 1994, signed by Andrew Maxin and addressed to Robert Pierson, ``Responses to NRC Questions/Comments, dated May 20, 1994,'' which are hereby incorporated by reference and made part of this Order. The licensee may make changes to the Interim Workplan without notification to the NRC as long as those changes do not decrease the effectiveness of its safety program as determined by the NFS Safety and Safeguards Review Council (SSRC). Proposed changes which decrease the effectiveness of its safety program shall not be implemented without prior approval of the NRC. Revisions to the Interim Workplan implemented without NRC review and approval shall be reported to the NRC within 15 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Not undertake any decommissioning and decontamination activities of the Pond 4 area outside of the confines of Building 410 prior to the approval by the NRC of a remediation plan for such outside areas. The remediation plan must include an evaluation of estimated worker and public radiation exposures that takes into account the experience from work performed within Building 410 for partial remediation, and for the partial remediation of Impoundments 1, 2, and 3. The remediation plan for outside areas must describe and analyze the impact of the proposed remediation of the outside areas on groundwater.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Install and use an environmental air sampling device in a location that will most effectively monitor airborne releases from Building 410. To ensure that all potential pathways are monitored, Trailer T&hyph;20 must be moved so that it does not obstruct the free flow of air around the air sampling device presently located immediately north of Trailer T&hyph;20, or the air sampling device must be repositioned to accomplish the same objective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Return processed soil only to the remediated areas within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Building 410 or ship to a licensed burial site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Analyze excavated material for radioactivity levels and submit data to NRC for review prior to removal of Building 410 and the licensee's securing of the groundwater drawdown system. After reviewing data, NRC will determine when Building 410 may be removed and when the licensee may secure the groundwater drawdown system, and if additional measures are needed to avoid unacceptable groundwater contamination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Not release any liquids to the sanitary sewer system prior to the approval by the NRC of the licensee's evaluation and demonstration that the release will conform to 10 CFR 20.2003.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. In the absence of, or in lieu of, monitoring effluents in air at the point of release to the ambient atmosphere from Building 410, not allow concentrations of radioactive elements in air within Building 410 in the immediate vicinity of areas under remediation to exceed the exposure rates in 10 CFR 20.1302.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Director, Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards, may, in writing, relax or rescind any of the above conditions upon demonstration by the licensee of good cause.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

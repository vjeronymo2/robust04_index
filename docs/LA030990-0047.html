			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MOORPARK RALLIES PAST CANYONS, 5-4  </P> <P> Good fortune turned into misfortune for College of the Canyons in the final  inning of a Western State Conference baseball game against Moorpark on  Thursday.  </P> <P> After rallying to take a one-run lead in the top of the ninth, the Cougars  watched Moorpark score twice in the bottom half of the inning for a 5-4  victory.  </P> <P> Mike Suarez, who had gone hitless in four previous at-bats, singled home Donald  Smith from second base with the winning run.  </P> <P> Moorpark, which improved its record to 7-7, 3-1 in conference play, can  sympathize with Canyons. The Raiders have lost four games this season in which  they led in the final three innings.  </P> <P> "This was a big win for us, we really needed it" Moorpark Coach Ken Wagner  said. "There is a big difference between being 2-2 and 3-1."  </P> <P> Chris Bannon scored the tying run after reaching base on a bobbled ground ball  and advanced to third when Canyons pitcher Mike Teich overthrew first base on  Jason Jones' bunt.  </P> <P> Canyons (11-6, 3-1) took its only lead in the top of the ninth. Bill Horvat  homered to start the inning and Ron Robart scored the go-ahead run on an  infield out.  </P> <P> Moorpark's Darin Furlong hit for the cycle, including a fifth-inning double  that scored Henry Shelb to give the Raiders a 2-0 lead.  </P> <P> Robert Teasdale (4-1) pitched two innings in relief of Moorpark starter Jeff  Berman to pick up the win. Teich pitched 8 1/3 innings for Canyons, scattering  nine hits and striking out eight.  </P> <P> Canyons had several opportunities to break the game open but stranded seven  baserunners in the last three innings.  </P> <P> The Cougars, benefiting from three consecutive walks in the sixth inning,  picked up their first run without a hit.  </P> <P> Charlie Fowlks grounded out to score Robart, but Berman retired the next two  batters in order to end the inning.  </P> <P> In other games:  </P> <P> L.A. City 5, Mission 0 -- Daine Turner had two of host Mission's four hits in a  Southern California Athletic Conference loss. Brad McGahan doubled and Rudy  Sanchez singled for Mission (9-6-1, 1-1).  </P> <P> Valley 8, Ventura 5 -- Valley's E. J. Pape hit a three-run home run in the  fifth inning that erased a 3-2 deficit and gave host Valley (6-9-2, 2-1) the  Western State Conference win. Mark Cavaretta and Pape each had two hits.  </P> <P> SOFTBALL  </P> <P> Keene State 6-0, Cal Lutheran 4-6 -- DeeAndra Pilkington tossed a three-hit  shutout to give host Cal Lutheran a split in a nonleague doubleheader.  Pilkington also had four hits in the two games. KIRBY LEE  </P></p>

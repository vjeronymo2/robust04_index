			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl at CDU rally in </F> Aachen to mark the beginning of the European election campaign  -- live]    [Excerpts] Ladies and Gentlemen, we have gathered here in  the historical square in front of Aachen Cathedral to open the  election campaign for the European elections on 12 June at this  first major CDU [Christian Democratic Union] rally. [passage  omitted]    We do not want a centralized European state, in which each  and every thing is regulated from Brussels; we want a Europe in  which the peoples are with each other in togetherness, in which  we as Germans or Belgians, as Dutchmen, Luxembourgers, or  Frenchmen make our contribution to Europe. We want this Europe  to be a Europe in which the children born at this hour in Aachen  take it for granted that they carry their home of Aachen and the  language of their mothers, their mother-tongue, in them  throughout their lives -- so that home means what the  associations of that word are for us Germans: The space in which  we grew up, the neighbors, our own family, the countryside.  [passage omitted]    The Maastricht Treaty has given us the basis and we will  continue to develop this treaty over this decade, with more  rights for the European Parliament, with an assumption of more  responsibilities and competences, in a (?sensible) way, but not  in such a way that we want to have a centralist European  superstate, but so that in a wise way we will develop a federal  Europe of the kind that we have tested out here in Germany.    Ladies and Gentlemen let me say this. This Europe has been  as successful as it has with the Germans in the last 20 or 30  years because here in Germany the German mark has grown more and  more into the leading European currency. The fact that the  German mark is today, alongside the Japanese yen and the U.S.  dollar, one of the world's leading currencies is of the greatest  importance for Germans and Europeans. This is why the following  statement holds true, and I will continue to say it loud and  clear, as is stated in the Maastricht Treaty: We will only agree  to a European currency when this currency is of the same quality  as the German mark. That is a decisive precondition of our  policy. [applause] [passage omitted]    Ladies and Gentlemen, in spite of positive developments in  the economic sphere, concern about jobs remains. We know from  our experiences over past years that when the economy is back on  track and prosperity returns following an economic decline,  unemployment cannot be reduced overnight, that it takes time for  the new positive development to take hold fully. For that  reason the issue of combating unemployment, halting  unemployment, and creating new jobs remains the paramount task  for us, for the CDU. But jobs cannot be talked into existence,  or talked into existence through placards. It must above all be  insured that the economy is back on track and that companies --  not least small- and medium-sized industries -- are capable of  creating new jobs and hiring people. [passage omitted]    The precondition for getting the economy back on its feet,  and I add this quite frankly, is that following the experiences  of the economic crisis that is now coming to an end, we do not  assume we can carry on as before. [passage omitted] We know  there are hundreds of thousands of citizens, including those who  have a secure job now, who would quite willingly switch to a  part-time job. [passage omitted]    I am grateful for the fact that in the wage settlements of  the past few months, especially in the pay settlements for the  chemical and engineering workers, greater flexibility is now  finally a reality and we can now adapt to the future in a much  more dynamic way. That is the point -- the maxim must be to  secure the future. [passage omitted]    Ladies and Gentlemen, the competition -- thank God, for  indeed we wish this -- is knocking at our door. We do indeed  wish to see the successor states of the Soviet Union, namely  Russia and Ukraine, make progress. We do indeed wish to see the  rule of law, democracy, and a market economy established. For  if they do not succeed, if the reforms collapse, and if the old  structures return, be they military dictatorship or a communist  regime, then everything is going to be much more expensive than  at present, and the vicious circle of missiles and rearmament  will begin all over again.    We wish to see peace and freedom prevail in Central, East,  and southeastern Europe and for their peoples to build their  lives in a free country. However, that assumes that they build  up their industries which, to put it bluntly, means that they  are going to be our competitors. I will be speaking in Mannheim  tomorrow, in May Square, just a few meters distance from the  premises of one of the big European companies. This same  company also has a branch in Brno. Both factories manufacture  the same product. In Mannheim the hourly rate for a trained  metalworker is 43 German marks [DM], in Brno DM3. And that is  not on some far-distant planet but a distance of just a few  hundred kilometers. These two figures illustrate to anyone how  the competitive situation is shaping up.    Naturally, prices in Brno will rise since prosperity means  higher wages, and naturally wages in Mannheim cannot be lowered.  But we must reflect on how to cleverly improve in many ways our  competitiveness. Anyone who believes that the required standard  has already been achieved and that one could now rest on one's  laurels complacently awaiting future developments is betraying  the future of Germany. Therefore, we from the Union say that we  must be able to rethink to safeguard our future, and we will do  everything necessary in this way. [applause] [passage omitted]</p>

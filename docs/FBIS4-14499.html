			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Lekant in the "Trouble" column: "The </F> Situation in Sevastopol Causes Concern, But There Is Still  `Normal, Russian Spirit' in the Fleet"]    [Text] For Crimea's economy, Sevastopol, inseparably  linked with the Russian Black Sea Fleet, is a focus of acute  problems. This may have been the reason for the many sharp  statements made by Mr. Kuznetsov, military adviser to the  Crimean president, in a conversation with your correspondent.  The former commander of a Soviet Army corps stationed in  Crimea, after his unit was placed under Kiev's jurisdiction  Major General Valeriy Kuznetsov swore allegiance to Ukraine.  And soon after stating that he will not fight with Russia under  any circumstances, he was removed from his post. Later, in  summer 1992, he was elected people's deputy to the former  composition of the Crimean Supreme Soviet.    According to him, the complexity of the Black Sea Fleet's  position today is primarily related to the fact that as of 1  September 1993 Ukraine stopped its financing. It is done by  Russia through Privatbank in Dnepropetrovsk. Meanwhile the  exchange of rubles for coupons "is proceeding at a robber's  rate," constituting approximately half the market rate (the  commercial price of the ruble is 20 to 23 karbovanets). In  addition, the Black Sea Fleet is charged exorbitant land taxes.  What is more, "at the highest tax rate, although no land  assessment has been made." As a result, the fleet does not have  enough funds even to pay monetary allowances to commissioned and  warrant officers.    For its part, Kiev cannot provide even for its own five or  six ships (against a hundred or so Russian ones, not counting a  border guard brigade). In this connection, "Admiral  Beskaravaynyy, commander of the Ukrainian Navy, proposed to  Eduard Dmitriyevich Baltin to buy one or several of them."    Furthermore, Mr. Kuznetsov expressed concern over the fact  that since May 1992 Ukraine has substantially built up the land  component of its Armed Forces in Crimea. At present its  strength on the peninsula, including construction troops, is  approximately 50,000 -- "half of what there was in Afghanistan."  Moreover, many units have been deployed anew: a mechanized  marine brigade in Feodosiya, and an air-mobile unit in Saki.  And this given that under the Crimean Constitution and a  corresponding Ukrainian law, any changes in the disposition and  strength of armed elements, as well as the formation of new  units in Crimea, is subject to coordination with Simferopol.    According to Mr. Kuznetsov, the Black Sea Fleet is taking no  retaliatory moves and will not violate the agreements signed.  In particular there are no plans to create military structures  under President Meshkov's control.    Crimea's presidential adviser is inclined to attribute the  actions by Kiev politicians to the fact that "they may be afraid  of the processes that are unfolding in Crimea." The peninsula  "slowly but surely is drifting toward Russia, without declaring  its secession from the country. Ukraine will disintegrate by  itself. It is economically incapable of existing as a state. De  jure, it exists, but de facto, you can see for yourself. A  hungry Ukraine and a bubble of nationalism that has burst.  Nothing else has remained," Mr. Kuznetsov believes.    Going back to the problems of Sevastopol, Mr. Kuznetsov said  that there were two USSR naval schools there. One of them --  popularly known as "Holland" -- trained specialists for nuclear  submarines. The other -- named after Nakhimov -- prepared  missile and artillery men. Ukraine has seized both schools and  merged them into one. The "Holland" school, in his estimation,  costs more than the entire Black Sea Fleet with its land and sea  components, and all of this multibillion equipment and property  is in fact falling into disrepair. Meanwhile, this year Ukraine  is going to enroll a mere 135 cadets in the school, as against  800 and more previously.    Responding to a question about the morale in the Black Sea  Fleet, the Crimean presidential adviser stated solemnly, "The  morale in our fleet is normal, Russian. As for the Ukrainian  Army, there is practically no morale there."</p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (8): Men who bucked the system - Anthony Robinson criss-crosses small-town Poland and finds the spirit of enterprise still very much alive and well OVER the past two years much of Poland has become what Harold Wilson, the Labour prime minister during Britain's 'swinging sixties', contemptuously dismissed as a 'candy floss economy'. In place of the old heavy industry and bureaucratic distribution channels, Polish entrepreneurs have revolutionised the wholesale and retail system, formed thousands of private construction, transport, travel and other service companies and stepped up industrial production by more than 25 per cent a year. Some, like Andrzej Czernecki, a senator for the Beer Lovers' Party who runs a medical equipment plant in Warsaw, make internationally competitive high-tech equipment. But most produce the 'thousand-and-one little things' from chocolate biscuits to bath plugs which the central planners forgot. A week spent criss-crossing small-town Poland as well as the big industrial areas showed the spirit of enterprise alive and well, but frustrated by the government's slowness in creating a framework for business. Many are also worried in case unemployment and growing income differences bring a return to the politics of envy, and the stifling of entrepreneurship.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- INDICATORS OF PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                     1989     1990     1991*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Private sector share of:   GDP**                             28.4     34.7     40.0 Employment   Including private agriculture     47.2     49.9     50.0   Excluding private agriculture     31.1     33.6     33.2 External trade   Total                                       8.6     28.4   Exports                                     4.8     14.4   Imports                                    14.4     42.2 Investment                          35.3     41.3 Production   Industry                          16.2     17.4     19.4   Construction                      25.5     31.0     43.0   Trade                             59.5     63.7     75.0   Transport                          6.8      9.9     12.0  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * Projected. ** 1984 constant prices  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Central Statistical Office  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

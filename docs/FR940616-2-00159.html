			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (e) Project Components <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD seeks to implement a fair housing marketing lab to examine new methods for offering privately operated federally assisted and insured multifamily housing, within the Chicago metropolitan area to all eligible residents of the area. For the purpose of this NOFA, the Chicago metropolitan area includes the City of Chicago and Cook, DuPage, Will, Kane, McHenry and Lake Counties. This area was selected because of its extensive past experience in implementing areawide interjurisdictional programs to promote fair housing and increased housing choice and because of the existing infrastructure for carrying out such programs. It is hoped that a new approach to affirmative fair housing marketing will result in a breakdown of jurisdictional barriers to housing opportunities and promote initiatives that diminish residential segregation and encourage residential diversity. The $1 million offered through this NOFA will be targeted toward affirmative fair housing marketing activities affecting either multifamily housing alone, single-family housing alone, or both simultaneously. In addition, an applicant may focus its proposed activities on either the entire metropolitan area or specific target areas which it may designate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Lab involves three distinct elements:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The first element of the lab entails the establishment of a metropolitan areawide clearinghouse that will:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Develop and administer a metropolitan areawide affirmative fair housing marketing plan affecting participating privately-owned federally assisted and insured multifamily housing. A complete description of this Plan is found at Section IV (a)(2) of this NOFA. The plan would not include assisted housing owned by the public housing authorities in the Chicago metropolitan area, since at this time the Department's Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Regulations do not apply to PHA-operated housing. Furthermore, the Department plans to conduct similar, larger-scale experiments on metropolitan-wide strategies which will combine both privately-operated and PHA-operated housing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Develop and maintain the following databases:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) A metropolitan areawide database of all families eligible for privately operated HUD-assisted (including insured) multifamily housing who have used the services offered by the clearinghouse. The database would be compiled through any of the following methods:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Encouraging families already on waiting lists of participating projects to take advantage of the housing opportunities offered by the clearinghouse. Under this concept, the project manager would notify in writing all families on his or her individual project waiting list of the existence of the clearinghouse and the availability of both the services and the expanded housing choices it will offer. The notice would also say that any family which was found to be eligible for any housing opportunity offered by the clearinghouse would not lose its position on the individual project's waiting list and would in fact be ``crosslisted'' for all projects for which the family was eligible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A participant may opt to continue to maintain its own project waiting list while using the other application intake services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

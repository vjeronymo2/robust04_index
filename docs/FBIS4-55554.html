			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with National Assembly member Mehmed Hodzha by </F> Miroslava Badzheva; place and date not given: "Mehmed Hodzha:  The Movement for Rights and Freedoms Will Get No More Than 1.5  Percent in Elections"]    [Excerpts] [Badzheva] Mr. Hodzha, now that you have been  expelled from the Movement for Rights and Freedoms [DPS], will  you form an alternative to the movement?    [Hodzha] We left the DPS parliamentary faction with the  clear understanding that the DPS cannot survive with this  leadership. Therefore, we demanded an extraordinary conference.  Indeed, not only we demanded such a conference, but also the  representatives of local branches in various regions. However,  obviously this will not happen. I am convinced that there will  be no new national conference. This means that we are left with  the second variant -- to offer our former and potential voters  something different than the present DPS. Both in the DPS  parliamentary faction and Central Council there are honest  people, but this in itself is not enough. An alternative must be  proposed. I can tell you that this idea exists already several  months. It has already matured, now we must only put it into  effect. We will convene a new meeting to which we will  naturally invite people from all regions in the country who  adhere to positions similar to ours. We want to attract the  dissatisfied people who reject the policy of the DPS leadership,  and most of all, those who are dissatisfied with the cooperation  with the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP]. All Europe, not only  Bulgaria, understood that this cooperation is already a fact.  This leadership is simply genetically committed to cooperating  with the BSP. The same phenomenon will also exist in the next  parliament.    [Badzheva] What will be your new party's name?    [Hodzha] This is not important. The basic principle around  which we will rally, will be that this is an anticommunist party  that is not based on an ethnic foundation. Many Bulgarians  already demonstrate interest in the new party.    [Badzheva] Who are the people that will form the core of  this formation?    [Hodzha] I will not divulge any names, everything is still  within the framework of ideas. Let us wait a bit longer.    [Badzheva] When will you announce officially its  establishment?    [Hodzha] In the next few weeks.    [Badzheva] When will you hold the planned meeting?    [Hodzha] Again, in the next few weeks.    [Badzheva] Is the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] helping  you in forming the "alternative DPS"?    [Hodzha] We do not need any helpers. We are sufficiently  prudent and able people, and can manage alone.    [Badzheva] However, nevertheless, you plan to cooperate with  the SDS?    [Hodzha] We would like to work together with the SDS, but  this is not an unconditional desire.    [Badzheva] What conditions will you pose?    [Hodzha] The blue [SDS] coalition must share our intentions  and ideas. We will stress the democratic principles, human  rights, and resolving social and economic problems -- all this  that existed at the beginning, when we were together with the  SDS.    [Badzheva] Would you participate in the next elections on  the same ticket with the SDS?    [Hodzha] I cannot answer this question. Let the SDS assess  whether it needs me or not. [passage omitted]    [Badzheva] What do you think, if elections were held now  what percentage of the vote will the DPS get?    [Hodzha] No more than 1.5 percent. I think that this is the  last participation in the parliamentary elections with this  leadership.    [Badzheva] You claim that the new formation will not be  based on an ethnic foundation. Will its program contain the  demand on proclaiming the ethnic Turks in Bulgaria a national  minority -- a thesis you defended when you were still in the DPS?    [Hodzha] Personally, I support collective rights. Now the  Council of Europe is preparing precisely such a document  regarding the collective rights of the minorities. [passage  omitted]    [Badzheva] Do you still claim that the higher DPS circles  are corrupt?    [Hodzha] Since I am magnanimous, I will take cigarettes to  some of the DPS leadership members when they are in prison.    [Badzheva] Will you support your claims with documents?    [Hodzha] Yes, when the time comes. [passage omitted]</p>

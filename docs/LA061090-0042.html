			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SWITCHEROO MAY MAKE WILSON AN OUTSIDER  </P> <P> California Republicans are trying to pull a switcheroo. It could cost them the  country's most important election this year.  </P> <P> Last Tuesday, the California GOP nominated Pete Wilson for the governorship.  Not Pete Wilson, private citizen, mind you, but Pete Wilson, U.S. senator.  </P> <P> By running for the governorship without resigning, Wilson has three advantages:  He gets to hold onto his seat in the Senate and gets a shot at both the  governor's chair in Sacramento and at the power to decide who becomes the next  senator from California.  </P> <P> In other words, Pete Wilson has hedged his bets. If he loses, he still gets to  keep the job of senator.  </P> <P> The GOP's Washington-for-Sacramento switcheroo has an added advantage, of  course. It has the beauty of giving voters a small, but limited role, in the  process. They get to decide which of the two big jobs, governor or senator, to  give Pete Wilson.  </P> <P> But beauty lies in eye of the beholder. Voters haven't liked switcheroos in the  past, and they may like them this year even less.  </P> <P> While it's still early, 1990 is turning out to a bad year for the political  insider, the familiar face with the familiar name who's gotten a bit too  familiar with his power and position. That's what we're seeing in the polls.  It's what we saw in Tuesday's California primary. John Van de Kamp, the  well-connected attorney general who lost to former San Francisco Mayor Dianne  Feinstein in the Democratic primary had the endorsement of every liberal group  that ever held a meeting in California. Feinstein, the self-proclaimed  outsider, only won the endorsement of the voters.  </P> <P> As the first woman to run for governor of the country's largest state, Democrat  Feinstein has the potential to energize the outsider vote.  </P> <P> By refusing to resign his seat in the Senate, by refusing to throw his job as  well as his hat in the ring for governor, Pete Wilson becomes the perfect  target of a Feinstein juggernaut of outsiders. The more he attacks her for  being an amateur, the more he will advertise himself as far too much the  professional, too much the kind of guy who's comfortable pulling a political  switcheroo.  </P></p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Government backs global market in BT share sale THE GOVERNMENT has abolished regional syndicates in its forthcoming sale of BT shares in favour of one global market, with managers competing to sign up the biggest institutional shareholders. SG Warburg, global co-ordinator, yesterday confirmed that for the first time in any UK privatisation, 11 global managers will compete with each other to get the top 500 institutions around the world to put in bids for BT shares. The government is expected to sell most, if not all, of its 22 per cent BT stake - worth more than Pounds 5bn. The sale may take place as early as July. In the last BT sale, the institutional offer was split between 10 syndicates throughout the world in which the lead managers had exclusive rights, apart from the global co-ordinator, to market the shares. This time round Warburg will be responsible for running the book building exercise in every region of the world. The ten other global managers are Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Cazenove, Daiwa Securities, Deutsche Bank, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, NatWest Securities, Paribas Capital Markets, NM Rothschild and UBS Limited. Mr Maurice Thompson, a director of Warburg Securities, said: 'We hope this will unleash competition within protected markets.' The global managers 'will keep their ears and eyes open' for any institutions which try to push the BT share price down by deliberately selling short before the sale. Warburgs reserved the right to 'penalise such action'. See Lex</p>

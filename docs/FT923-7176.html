			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / UK takes cautious troops decision: London wants to be seen doing something to help a settlement in Bosnia THE DECISION by Britain to send up to 1,800 troops to Bosnia-Hercegovina is a cautious and limited exercise aimed at boosting the UN's already overstretched capacity to protect international humanitarian relief operations. It is also designed to reassure public opinion that Britain, as current president of the European Community, is prepared to be seen to be doing something which, in the long term, could form the basis for some negotiated settlement in Bosnia. But western diplomats and defence experts last night conceded that the British gestures would do little in the way of stopping the fighting and killing in the former Yugoslav republic. 'If London wanted to help in the humanitarian effort, maybe this will help,' an EC diplomat said. 'But I am doubtful  - and we are all in the same position  - if this will stop the fighting.' Mr John Major, the prime minister, had four options: Provide light military support and escorts for the aid convoys, and with the consent of the three sides which are fighting in Bosnia; Provide relief convoys, and go through to besieged towns, but without the consent of any side. Those convoys would also defend themselves in the process; Provide relief supported by heavily armed relief convoys which would fight their way to their targets; Set up permanent security corridors in parts of Bosnia-Hercegovina. The last three options were ruled out partly because it would require at least 100,000 ground troops and, besides, the UN operations in Bosnia would have to be withdrawn because their impartiality would be completely undermined. Moreover, British officials last night stressed that option one would only be implemented 'on the understanding that all three sides in the conflict in Bosnia consented to these forces, which would be operating under the auspices of the UN blue helmets,' an official said. Officials from the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees had earlier in the week asked western governments not to endorse any international military intervention because it would also undermine the UNHCR's own operations throughout the republic. 'We had to take into consideration all these aspects. We have stuck to the humanitarian effort because we are afraid of ending up in a Vietnam or Beirut situation,' a British defence attache said last night. Indeed, the British government last night insisted that the 'maximum' of 1,800 would be sent to Bosnia, thus confirming Mr Major's reluctance to become embroiled in the war. The British response to the bloodshed in Bosnia was greeted with mixed response by defence specialists and EC diplomats. Mr James Gow, a specialist on the Yugoslav army at Centre for Defence Studies at London's Kings College, said the British initiative did not really add up to anything substantial. 'The decision by the government gives the impression that it is prepared to do something. But if you look at it in detail, it does very little. It is predicated on too many ifs,' he said. British troops will only be sent if requested by the UNHCR, and they will escort aid convoys which are operating with the consent of all sides in Bosnia. Essentially, Britain has decided to act within the strict confines of last week's UN Security Council meeting which stated that 'all measures necessary' would be used to protect the aid convoys. Force, or the use of force, was not mentioned in the resolution. Moreover, western diplomats last night said that by acting under the UN flag  - which meant that British troops would wear blue helmets, the UN colours  -they were bound to remain impartial in the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina. British diplomats said London's decision corresponded to those of other European capitals. But the question now facing western governments is how this decision will be interpreted by Bosnia's Serbs, who continue to besiege Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, Gorazde, in eastern Bosnia, and Bihac, in the north of the republic. 'Is this another green light for the aggressor to grab more land and expel more people?' a US diplomat asked. 'Will this mean that Bosnia's Moslems have nothing left to lose so they will fight to the bitter end to defend themselves?'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The conclusion of the Uruguay round of GATT talks  and the creation of the World Trade Organization, which took  place in Marrakech, will have important consequences for  Argentina. Tariffs applied on international agriculture and  industrial trade will drop, and world agriculture protectionism  will also start to decrease. Both aspects are very important for  the Argentine economy.    A document disseminated by the Foreign Ministry contains a  paragraph that has been annulled, but can still be read -- a  suggestive fact -- which says: "This negotiation will require  the introduction of important changes in current norms, and the  adjustment of diverse economic activities."    Developed countries will reduce their average tariffs on  industrial products by 40 percent and their mean tariff on  agriculture products by 36 percent. There will be a drop in  internal subsidies and a reduction of subsidized exports.  Access to markets will be facilitated through the conversion of  all non-tariff obstacles (quotas, variable rates, etc.) into  tariffs and the progressive reduction of all tariffs.    The signing of the Sanitary and Plant Sanitation Agreement  is  important for Argentina because the country will now have a  forum in which to complain when sanitary measures imposed on its  exports are, in fact, non-tariff obstacles (a very frequent  case).    It is being forecast that as a consequence of these  agreements, world incomes will increase by $230 billion and  world trade by about $745 billion by 2005. According to the  Foreign Ministry analysis, however, more important than the  figures is the fact that the climate of trade war and unilateral  measures that threatened the economy in the past few years has  been overcome.    In the area of tariffs, Argentina committed itself not to  exceed certain protectionist ceilings. The situation does not  change a thing, however, because the tariff system adopted by  GATT is 35 percent, a full 10 percentage points above present  tariff levels in Argentina and the common external tariff system  that is being negotiated in the Mercosur [Common Market of the  South].    The document offers some details on the issue of  agriculture.  It says that the United States offered the country quotas for  peanuts, peanut butter, and cheese in exchange for an increase  in tariffs on peanuts and by-products. Europe also compensated  Argentina for damages caused by European subsidies on oil  producing crops. Besides, the country will receive an additional  quota of 11,000 tonnes of high quality beef and participation in  the quota of 500,000 tonnes of corn for Portugal.    Argentina also received substantial tariff concessions from  the United States, Japan, and the European Union on grape must,  leather, apples, pears, orange juice, and essential and  vegetable oils.    Argentina will receive another important benefit with the  world commitment to reduce budget spending on export subsidies  by 36 percent and the actual volume of subsidized exports by 21  percent. These benefits will come after a transitional period.    But the greatest benefits will come through the Sanitary and  Plant Sanitation Agreement, as it will permit negotiations for  the export of products that are today banned from markets such  as those of the United States, Japan, and Korea. A condition is  the creation of a local information service that will answer all  requests for information made by other countries regarding  sanitary procedures in effect in our country.    The agreement on customs valuation includes a clause that  will favor Argentina, as it will allow it to request more  information from importers when there are reasons to doubt the  declared values are accurate.</p>

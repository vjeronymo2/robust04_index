			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Menem unveils medium-term plan to spur 43% growth ARGENTINA'S President Carlos Menem unveiled at the weekend a medium-term strategy which he promised would generate economic growth of 43 per cent and create 1m jobs in his last two years in office. He wants to bring annual inflation down to 4 per cent by 1995, when his term ends. Opening a new session of Congress on Saturday, Mr Menem said he would further open the economy to foreign trade and reduce taxes to help lower companies' operating costs. The thrust of his strategy is to force companies to become more competitive and invest more. Alarm is growing over Argentina's increasing reliance on foreign capital and its current account deficit, forecast at Dollars 8bn-Dollars 11bn (Pounds 5.1bn-Pounds 7bn) this year against an estimated Dollars 8bn in 1992. Mr Menem announced gradual cuts in corporate taxes and said companies would be able to buy foreign capital goods and trucks without paying any import duties. Local capital goods manufacturers, though, will be entitled to a subsidy of 15 per cent of their sales to offset the impact of foreign competition. Mr Menem also said government-owned banks would increase lending to small and medium-sized farms and companies. The government's Banco de la Nacion Argentina will lend these sectors Dollars 4.5bn this year, rising to Dollars 6.2bn in 1995, at below market interest rates.</p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Cash cuts will hit some embassies SWEEPING reductions in UK diplomatic centres abroad, including embassies, are being forced on the Foreign Office by the public expenditure restrictions and cuts due to be announced by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in his Autumn Statement next week, Robert Mauthner writes. Some 27 diplomatic centres - including embassies, consulates-general and consulates, many of them in Africa and Latin America - may close as a result of the cuts. Between Pounds 13m and Pounds 14m could be saved in this way. The precise budget to be allocated to the diplomatic service and other Foreign Office departments and services, such as the British Council and the BBC's external broadcasting services, is still the subject of negotiations. However, according to some informed estimates, the cuts to be made in spending on the Foreign Office's services, except for the Overseas Development Administration, over the next three financial years could amount to nearly Pounds 100m. The bulk of the savings - an estimated Pounds 40m to Pounds 50m - would be achieved during the last year of the period, 1994-95. Among the services likely to be hit are embassies in the smaller countries of the Third World, consulates in western Europe and commercial services in the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Foreign Office's budget amounts to only 0.5 per cent of total government expenditure, but officials argue that the UK's overseas representation has a symbolic value far outweighing the money spent on the diplomatic service. With German and French governments each deciding recently on an increase of 6 per cent in their spending on the diplomatic service, the Foreign Office is particularly worried about its capacity to promote UK interests abroad.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by N. A. Armand and K. I. Palatov, Radio </F> Engineering and Electronics Institute, Russian Academy of  Sciences]    [Abstract] The last summary of research activity of the  Radio Engineering and Electronics Institute, Russian Academy of  Sciences, covered the years 1983-1984. This review covers the  years 1984-1992 inclusive and the most significant results  obtained in each of the fields and subjects listed below are  summarized. 1. Planetary radar and space radio physics (mapping  of Venus by Venera 15 and Venera 16; study of Halley's comet  (Vega project); study of Venusian atmosphere and ionosphere;  study of the solar wind; study of physical conditions on Mars in  connection with the "Fobos" project; radar observation of  planets for checking accuracy of the relativistic theory of  motion of planets; study of near space using artificial earth  satellites). 2. Remote sensing of atmosphere and surface (study  of electromagnetic emissions of different surface cover types in  microwave range; active (radar) methods for remote sensing of  atmosphere and surface; ecological and climatological aspects of  remote sensing of land surfaces; remote sensing of ocean floor).  3. Radio wave propagation (propagation of radio waves in  millimeter range; propagation of optical waves in atmosphere;  study of atmosphere as medium for radio wave propagation). 4.  Statistical radio physics (study of ULF and UHF electromagnetic  noise (study of natural ULF and UHF electromagnetic fields;  research on stochastic electromagnetic processes; study of  complex signals and conditions for their discrimination from  noise; development of analyzers of natural fields and weak  signals and instruments for detecting earthquake precursors). 5.  Electrodynamics of artificial media and structure in microwave  range (electrodynamics of microwave antennas, resonators and  waveguide elements; materials for microwave range (highly  absorbing and with small losses; diffraction problems in  microwave range).</p>

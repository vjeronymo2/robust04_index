			<p>BFN     [Text] Today Russian President Boris Yeltsin proposed at  the meeting of the Russian Security Council that moves for  settlement of the Bosnian crisis ought to be more energetic.  Interfax learned that the Bosnian crisis had not been on the  agenda.    Yeltsin pointed out that the Russian position on the issue  remained the same. He also stated that utilization of military  force, or such a serious air strike, without its prior  discussion in the UN Security Council was unacceptable.    The Russian Security Council considered possible  developments  in Bosnia. Sources in the Russian Security Council told  Interfax that the military approach to settlement in  ex-Yugoslavia had been estimated as unproductive.    Yeltsin emphasized that a summit with the participation of  Russia, the U.S. and other parties concerned could play an  important role in solution of the crisis.    Interfax learned that almost all members of the Russian  Security Council had spoken on the Russian policy in the  Caucuses. Yeltsin stressed that the lack of a single state  policy in this region was regrettable. He proposed that  priorities of Russia's policy in the Caucuses be defined. This  concerns not only the Trans-Caucasian region within the  composition of Russia but also within the composition of the  Caucasian independent states.    The members of the RF Security Council pointed out that a  balanced and weighed approach to developments in the Caucasian  Region in general was needed.    Yeltsin said not only the interests of the Russian and  Caucasian independent states must be taken into consideration  but also that of other states concerned.    To define the policy of Russia it was necessary to know the  real problems of the region, Yeltsin underlined. All moves  there must be based on unification of the Caucasian peoples  instead of their separation. No prosperity would be possible  for these peoples under a policy of disintegration leading to  violation of the territorial integrity and further confrontation  between the peoples and the states, he stated.    Yeltsin stressed that a single Caucuses would be in the  interests of Russia and all peoples living in this region. He  said primary attention must be paid to the proposals which could  bring the conflicting parties together. For instance, when  resolving the Ossetian-Ingush conflict it was necessary to take  into account both old and new traditions. Influential leaders  must be invited to participate in the talks. Everything  possible must be done to bring about economic development of  Caucuses and for providing jobs for the population, all of which  could eliminate the existing problems, Yeltsin suggested.    Commenting on the relations with Chechnya, Yeltsin  emphasized  the necessity for a single basis for further dialogue with  representatives of the official Groznyy so that Chechnya  remained within the composition of Russia.    On support for Russian Cossacks, it was stressed that a  special federal program must be worked out. The members of the  Security Council stood for participation of Cossacks in the  state structures, in particular in the army, in the border  defense troops and in the law-enforcement bodies.</p>

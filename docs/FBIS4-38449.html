			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 31 TASS -- Georgian forces which have  occupied positions above the village of Lata in the Kodor Gorge  fired over 100 howitzer shells on local Abkhazian settlements  over three days, TASS was told by the press service of the  Abkhazian parliament on Tuesday.    Georgian units tried to drive Abkhazians out of their  positions overnight, but were repelled, it added.    The village of Lata again became the strategic point for  which the conflicting sides are fighting. The Georgian forces  which were pushed up into the mountains want to seize it for a  further offensive down into Abkhazia. Abkhazians, naturally,  are defending the stronghold.    Military experts predict that combat activities will  intensify in the gorge soon as the important location provides  an access to the Black Sea. The forecasts are proved by several  days of artillery preparations by Georgian forces.</p>

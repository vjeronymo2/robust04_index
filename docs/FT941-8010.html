			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Scottish assembly row brews A political row was brewing at Westminster last night over government plans to sell the building in Edinburgh which had been converted in the 1970s to house the proposed Scottish assembly. Mr Tony Baldry, environment minister, used a Commons written answer to announce that the government was offering the Old Royal High School for sale to the City of Edinburgh District Council, its original owners. Labour pounced on the decision saying that it showed the government's 'lack of commitment to addressing the constitutional issue in Scotland.' Mr George Robertson, shadow Scottish secretary, said: 'It will not divert us from our clear intention to set up a Scottish parliament in an appropriate building.' Mr Alistair Darling, Labour MP for Edinburgh Central, said the move was widely seen as 'quite deliberately provocative' and 'part of a bid to polarise Scottish opinion between the status quo and separatism.' He said it was disingenuous of the government to offer the building to the district council which had 'limited funds to buy anything'. The government, which is offering the building at market value, acquired it from the council in 1976 for Pounds 650,000. The Pounds 3.75m adaptation and refurbishment was completed in 1978. In 1979 a devolution bill failed to clear the hurdle requiring 40 per cent of the electorate to back it.</p>

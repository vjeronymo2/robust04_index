			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of Bahrain (2): Long-term strategy is set to evolve - The Economy Cheerfully, Mr Ibrahim Abd al-Karim, minister of finance and national economy, accepts that Bahrain is at a critical moment in its economic development. But he insists that he is not in the least pessimistic about the future. For an economy recovering from the regional impact of an eight-year war between Iran and Iraq, followed by President Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, the headline figures as presented by the minister do not look at all discouraging: real growth this year should reach 2.5 per cent, inflation will be less than 2 per cent, unemployment is between 1 per cent and 6 per cent, depending on how it is calculated, and oil prices continue to look reasonably firm. It is against this background that Bahrain will attempt to evolve a new long-term development strategy over the next few years, as against the short-term responses forced on it by the past decade of regional conflict. 'Instead of having to apply doses of morphine, the cabinet can now really begin to develop a strategy for the future,' says Mr Abd al-Karim. Some elements of that strategy are in place. For example, Bahrain allows 100 per cent foreign ownership of companies, permits overseas consultants, engineers and other professionals to establish themselves without local sponsors, has launched an industrial development bank, and as a reaction to the number of offshore banking units leaving the island set up a promotional unit designed to stem its decline as a financial centre. Under consideration or in the pipeline is a board of trade that will promote the country's private sector and a cautious programme of privatisation. Mr Abd al-Karim says that a start has been made by selling some shares in hotel companies and this may be expanded to take in shipyards, dairy products and date processing. After that, the government's 40 per cent stake in the national telecommunications company may be reduced, as well as the shareholding in the National Bank of Bahrain. 'However, the approach will be slow. It will take time,' says the minister. Two closely related factors appear to have determined Bahrain's shift of economic emphasis. First, the growth in the size of the budget deficit and second, the need to find alternative sources of revenue to offset the inevitable decline in the contribution from oil. Private sector economists in Bahrain claim to have difficulty in making the published government figures add up, especially in relation to the budget, but according to Mr Abd al-Karim the gap between revenue and expenditure in the last financial year was BD65m, somewhat better than the forecast BD100m. Although the government has no trouble in meeting the deficit through local borrowing, mostly by issuing short-term treasury bills, it is anxious to ensure that it is capped at no more than BD100m, and then progressively reduced as a percentage of gross domestic product. PRIVATE sector sceptics remain unconvinced that the government can meet this target while financing key development projects and maintaining free public services for a growing population - 'there's no way that these figures can be made to add up,' says a prominent local businessman. 'Either there have to be some large hand-outs by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, or even more projects will have to be postponed or cancelled.' The cabinet has been looking, in conjunction with the International Monetary Fund, at possible measures to increase revenues which could be introduced without risking political stability. Most traditional western methods appear to have been ruled out, such as a tax on incomes or a value-added tax. Charging anything more than a nominal amount for utilities would be another politically adventurous step to make. Import duties on items such as alcohol probably have scope for further increases and modest amounts can be raised through property and licensing. 'The other real snag for Bahrain is that it cannot get seriously out of step with its neighbours. People here will not accept a significantly different system from the one that operates in, say, Saudi Arabia. If it is free in Riyadh then it has to be free in Manama,' says a diplomat. Under the traditional system of government patronage it is difficult to see great scope for improvements on the revenue side. But there is an inevitability about the decline in revenues provided by oil which currently provide 65 per cent of the total. Mr Abd al-Karim says he is grateful that production techniques have been able to check the decline in output at the level of 42,000 barrels a day as that provides a breathing space for the new policies to be implemented. Government spending, of course, is another matter and outside official circles there is critical discussion of priorities, waste and the dispensation of patronage. Mr Isa Abdullah al Borshaid, under-secretary for finance and national economy, says there are three criteria for investment decisions: economic viability, job creation potential and the ease with which new projects can integrate with existing industries. Of those requirements there is no doubt that the government is increasingly looking at the potential for creating jobs. The need is threefold: first to mop up some of the pool of unemployed, to provide work for the increasing number of young people coming on to the market each year, and to check the increase in the size of the expatriate workforce. Because of budgetary constraints, the government has imposed a ceiling on the numbers of public sector employees, still the preferred occupation for the majority of Bahrainis, and is funding training schemes in such areas as banking and hotels. It realises that there are unlikely to be enough suitable opportunities on the island to meet future demand and is therefore pushing the other members of the GCC to accept greater labour mobility. The private sector is also well aware of the relative attractiveness of employing expatriates who, in general, are willing to work longer hours for less pay than Bahrainis and can be dismissed more easily. Officials say that far more nationals are to be found in a greater variety of jobs than 10 years ago, but there is a lack of enthusiasm for some types of work and unrealistic expectations on the part of some returning graduates. The evolution of Bahrain's economy could depend as much on changes in personal attitudes as it does on the strategy mapped out by ministers and their expatriate advisers.</p>

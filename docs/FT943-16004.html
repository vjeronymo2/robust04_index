			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / International Company News: Alcoa, Western Mining to join forces in alumina Alcoa, the US aluminium producer, and Western Mining, the Australian minerals group, have announced plans to combine their alumina and alumina-based chemicals operations in a worldwide partnership. In 1993, the operations had combined revenues of USDollars 2.7bn. The proposed merged business would account for about one-quarter of the world's alumina production, Western Mining said. The business would be 60 per cent owned by Alcoa and 40 per cent by Western Mining. Alcoa would receive a Dollars 360m payment from Western Mining. The two companies have been shareholders in Alcoa of Australia since its formation in 1960, with Alcoa holding a 51 per cent stake and Western Mining building up a 48.25 per cent holding. Mr Paul O'Neill, Alcoa's chairman, said the new arrangement would allow the two companies to 'explore all opportunities in alumina and chemicals without regard to differing ownership positions around the world. 'We believe this global alliance will enhance our flexibility to take advantage of our current low cost positions in alumina and chemicals and accelerate future growth in both of these key markets.' Under the agreement, Alcoa will have overall management responsibility for the enterprise, which will be under the direction of a five-member strategic council appointed by the two companies. Three members would come from Alcoa. Operations likely to be included in the enterprise are Alcoa of Australia; Alcoa's interests in bauxite and alumina operations in Texas, Suriname, Guinea, Brazil and Jamaica; Alcoa's industrial chemicals businesses in the US, Australia, Japan, the Netherlands, Germany, Singapore, India and possibly Brazil; and Alcoa Steamship. In connection with the deal, Melbourne-based Western Mining announced yesterday that it plans to make a ADollars 720m (USDollars 522m) rights issue. The new shares will be issued on a one-for-eight basis at ADollars 5.80 a share. Western Mining shares had closed at ADollars 7.42. The deal and fund-raising follow a period of controversy for the Australian group, which has been forced to settle a number of lawsuits on disadvantageous terms. Most notably, it was obliged to relinquish the rich Ernest Henry copper/gold deposit in Queensland, after its exploration team trespassed on the lease area. Western Mining's interest in Alcoa of Australia, however, underpinned the group's recent profit improvements: in the half-year to end-December, after-tax profits rose 25 per cent to ADollars 66.3m, with the Alcoa of Australia investment contributing almost ADollars 90m, compared with ADollars 56.5m a year earlier. However, Western Mining has warned that Alcoa's contribution would turn down sharply in 1994.</p>

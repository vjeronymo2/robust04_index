			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Russian oil quotas spark controversy The Russian government is to carve up the domestic oil market among Russian oil companies, requiring each to supply a certain percentage of the market. International financial institutions say the move breaches the spirit of the agreements between them and the government and jeopardises the future of crucial negotiations over big loans to stabilise the economy next year. The decision, communicated at the weekend by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, to his deputy premiers, would allow the Russian companies freely to export the surplus after fulfilling their domestic quotas. In literal terms this would lift export quotas, a pledge made by President Boris Yeltsin in July. However, the replacement of export by domestic quotas would mean that the oil price would be kept to around its present low level of 20-30 per cent of world prices. This would in turn preserve a structure which gives rise to extensive illegal export of oil, with huge profits being made from the difference in domestic and world prices. It also reintroduces into a relatively free, if chaotic, domestic market Soviet-era controls on supply - justified by the strategic importance of the product. Both Russian and international financial officials, speaking on terms of anonymity, expressed disappointment over the decision yesterday. It means that a Dollars 600m (Pounds 366m) oil rehabilitation loan negotiated with the World Bank will not now go through. What is more serious, negotiations between a team of officials from the International Monetary Fund and the government on loans of up to Dollars 13bn meant to support the 1995 budget and stabilise the currency in the coming year will restart today under a cloud. 'If this decision, which does not require a special decree or agreement from the parliament, cannot go through,' said one official, 'then what chance is there for real agreement on much more difficult issues which do require such decisions?' According to Russian reformers, senior ministers fear that the simple lifting of export quotas will cause the oil price to shoot up towards world levels, producing high inflation and social unrest - and that so much oil will be exported there will be serious shortages in the coming winter. The reformers believe that a combination of export tariffs and lack of pipeline capacity would keep a check on prices, though they accept that prices will, and should, rise significantly. However, both the international officials and the reformers believe the government decision was taken because of heavy pressure from the oil lobby, whose managers benefit hugely from the price differential. A Russian financier said, 'The system benefits almost everyone involved - except a few reformers who believe in a free market.' The decision will also benefit the foreign oil companies which have joint ventures in Russia. They had been told that, were quotas to end, they would be replaced by a system in which exports were based on what percentage of total domestic production their output represented, threatening a huge drop in their earnings, most of which come from the agreed export of 100 per cent of production. Russia produces roughly 300m tonnes of oil a year and exports around 100m tonnes, - a level which has stayed relatively stable even as production continues to drop, reflecting lack of investment in new fields.

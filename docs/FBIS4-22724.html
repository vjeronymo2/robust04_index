			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vadim Chernobrov: "The Only One Sitting At the </F> End of the Chain Was a Wise Tomcat: Today Nothing Can Restrain  Scientists Who Are Rushing to the Transoceanic Lukomorye"]    [Text] "Relative to science in Russia: until the day I die,  nothing will change there. And I'm never going back there  again!' Those words ended the interview given to American and  Russian newspapers by Academician Aleksey Abrikosov, the head of  the theoretical group at the (Argoni) national laboratory in the  United States, and the former head of the High Pressures  Institute in the Moscow suburb of Troitsk. Of course, the job of  heading a famous institute is much more prestigious than that of  heading a small group consisting of 14 persons. But all this, in  the scientist's opinion, is in the past.    What prestige can we be talking about if, during the last  years before his emigration, the academician met with his  renowned associates Roald Sagdeyev and Yakov Sinayev most  frequently while waiting in line for groceries? Add to that the  incomparable difference in the "equipment level" (expressed that  way, in parentheses) between our own laboratories and the  American laboratories with regard to computer technology,  instruments, and materials, as well the tremendous difference  (by a factor of many times) in the salaries, and you will get  the answer to the question of "Why do these and other scientists  now meet one another at conferences in German and American  institutes?" Because the number of specialists from the  Institute of Theoretical Physics imeni Landau and the Leningrad  Physical Tekhnikum imeni Ioffe is so large that scientific  arguments begin in English, but end up in Russian. One would  scarcely expect a meeting like this to occur in any Texas  supermarket...    As Mikhaylo Lomonosov said (incidentally, he too did  probationary work abroad), if you lose something in one place,  you will invariably gain something somewhere else. The largest  "gain" occurred in Germany, Israel, and the United States: many  personnel problems were also resolved at the expense of Russian  scientists in Greece, Australia, Finland, and Canada. But it is  one thing when our professors, like poor relatives, leave no  stone unturned at various companies (in the United States  approximately one-half of the Russian scientists do not have a  permanent job). One can in this instance act a bit arrogantly  and offer an academician the job of junior scientific associate.  But it is a completely different thing when the same "oppressed  and outraged" individual is invited to take a managerial chair  somewhere in a "threshold" country (that is, a place where  nuclear weapons are being developed).    Of course, the number of people who have set out for the  "threshold" third countries is definitely not a million (the  Americans were afraid of that number) or even a thousand: last  year Iran "bought" approximately 50 specialists for $5000 a  month to assemble nuclear warheads; Libya "bought" specialists  from the Kurchatov Institute to work within the confines of one  project near the Gulf of Sidra for $100,000; Algeria, Ukrainian  specialists to develop a nuclear power plant... They barely  managed to remove from an aircraft a group of engineers who were  departing for North Korea to work in accordance with a  contract...    According to evaluations given by the RAN [Russian Academy  of  Sciences] Institute of Comparative Political Studies, the  intellectual migration from Russia in 1993-1995, with various  alternatives in the development of the political and economic  situation in the country, can constitute from 90,000 to 600,000  specialists with higher education. We might note that this is  with higher education in general, where there already a million  nuclear scientists (although just one smart professor, by his  departure, can considerably mix up the politicians' cards). At  the same time the internal drain, the move of former scientists  into commercial kiosks, shops, and simply to the church porch,  will be several times greater --from 300,000 to 2 million. That  is, at the maximum we can lose during that three-year period no  more than 2.6 million scientists, and as a minimum... just  390,000? "Rumors about the demise of Russian science are greatly  exaggerated. But it actually has been knocked flat on its back  and is scarcely breathing" -- one can understand the restrained  "optimism" of I. Goldmen, the general director of the  international ScienceInform Agency, since, with the favorable  development of events, Russia may end up, as a result of the  "brain drain"... on the positive side of the ledger!    It is expected that from 200,000 to 500,000 Russian-speaking  specialists from the near abroad will emigrate to Russia, but  "nowhere farther than that." True, for us there is no hope that  at least they will self-relentlessly throw themselves into the  breach in Russian science.    Intelligent planning does exist in a free market economy:  relying on forecasts of a Russian "brain drain," a number of  countries have already reduced the number of students studying a  number of specialties. Why study for five to ten years and spend  money on a young specialist, when you can get, from distant and  mysterious Russia, one who is already more experienced and  also... a bit cheaper?    This is also, of course, a counteraction to this process:  hundreds of Russian scientific "masters" are already getting  salary increases as a result of their title and also "for  nondeparture," and thousands of scientists of a slightly lesser  rank are receiving money from the state budget, while the  scientific institutions themselves are attempting at any cost,  by using true statements or false ones, to get bank credit. But  how serious are these actions? According to evaluations made the  European Council's Commission on Education, the loss from the  "brain drain" will constitute for Russia $50 billion! In the  meantime, however, in order to avoid those losses, we have  expended amounts of money that are smaller by a factor of  hundreds or thousands. That means that, with the passage of  time, we will be like the miser in the famous saying, and will  end up paying twice as much.    But even this is not the most important thing. If, for a  long, long time you remove from any country the most intelligent  people, as a result of the process of selection you will have a  situation in that country in which, as the Europeans say, "the  only thing left between their ears will be hair!"</p>

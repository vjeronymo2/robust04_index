			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Sabotage forces Shell to shut down two crude oil flow stations The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria, a unit of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, has shut two crude oil flow stations in south-eastern Nigeria after an oil spillage caused by sabotage, Reuter reports from Lagos. The stations at Benisede and Opukushi were shut last week in order not to worsen the spillage caused by broken pipes, which were cut by unknown persons, Shell said. The Daily Times newspaper said the two stations normally produce about 66,000 barrels of crude oil per day. Shell said such spillages were not uncommon.</p>

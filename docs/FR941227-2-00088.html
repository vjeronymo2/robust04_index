			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Florida manatee is found primarily in coastal areas of Florida and southeast Georgia, although individuals range seasonally westward into Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana on the Gulf coast and north through the Carolinas, into Virginia and Chesapeake Bay along the east coast. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manatees are large aquatic herbivores that feed opportunistically on a wide variety of submerged, floating, and emergent vegetation in marine and freshwater habitats. This includes seagrasses, emergent vascular plants, benthic algae, and various floating plants. Shallow grass beds with ready access to deep channels are preferred feeding areas. Manatees frequent canals, creeks, embayments, and lagoons, particularly near the mouths of coastal rivers and sloughs, for feeding, resting, cavorting, mating, and calving. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When ambient water temperatures drop below 20  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C (68  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F) in autumn and winter, manatees aggregate at natural or artificial warm water refuges or move to southern Florida. Most artificial refuges are created by warm water outfalls at power plants or paper mills. Large winter aggregations of 50 or more animals occur at these sites in central and southern Florida, and several smaller aggregations with 15 or fewer animals in northern Florida and southern Georgia on the east coast. The northernmost refuge used regularly on the west coast is at Crystal River. Most manatees utilize the same warm water refuges each year. Some individuals use different refuges from year to year while others use two or more refuges during the same winter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During summer months, manatees may be found almost anywhere in Florida where water depths are greater than 1&hyph;2 meters. They normally occur alone or in pairs, although interacting groups of five to ten animals are not unusual (in mating herd situations, for example). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Efforts have been made to develop a reliable estimate of manatee abundance in Florida. When conditions are favorable a statewide aerial count of manatees at significant aggregation sites is conducted following winter cold fronts, to assure the greatest likelihood that as many individual manatees as possible will be at these sites. The highest single-day count of manatees from a statewide aerial survey is 1,856 animals in January 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The long-term survival of manatees in Florida is uncertain. Known mortality, which averaged over 170 animals per year between 1988 and 1992, is more than double what it was in the late 1970s. Because of current population size estimates and the species' relatively low reproductive rate (manatees produce only a single calf every 2.5&hyph;5 years per mature female), present mortality may exceed the populations' ability to produce new animals. The major threats to Florida manatees are collisions with watercraft, which account for about 25 percent of known manatee deaths in Florida annually, and destruction and degradation of habitat caused by widespread development throughout much of the species' Florida range. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Data on manatee mortality in the Southeastern U.S. has been collected since 1974 and indicates a clear increase in manatee deaths over the last 15 years. Although both natural and human-related causes are significant components of manatee mortality, most of the increase in mortality can be attributed to increases in watercraft-related deaths and perinatal deaths. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A prominent cause of natural mortality in some years in cold stress. Following a severe winter cold spell in 1989, 46 manatee carcasses whose death was attributed to cold stress were recovered. Significant mortality from exposure to cold also occurred in the winters of 1977, 1981, and 1984. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised plan is based on recommendations of the Florida Manatee Recovery Team. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comments Solicited <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service solicits written comments on the revised recovery plan described.

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / International Company News: Peugeot rises 2.2% midway PEUGEOT, the French carmaker which also includes Citroen, managed a 2.2 per cent rise in net profits in the first six months of this year and warned that the outlook for the rest of 1992 was gloomy. Net earnings rose to FFr2.32bn (Dollars 461m) from FFr2.27bn in the first half, on sales up by 3.7 per cent to FFr82.6bn. Sales were stagnant in France, fell in Germany and Britain, but rose strongly in Spain and Italy. As a result, Peugeot's export sales rose by 11 per cent to FFr50bn, on which it increased its share of a slightly shrinking western European market from 11.2 per cent to 11.9 per cent. Registrations of Peugeot cars in western Europe rose by 5.3 per cent to 874,000 units. Cash flow rose by 9.5 per cent over the period, to FFr7.83bn, while group debt rose to FFr10.27bn from FFr9,39bn, due to an increase in working capital requirements and a rise in depreciation charges on the heavy internal investments of recent years. Peugeot said it was cautious on the outlook for the rest of the year. It saw no sign of recovery in France or Britain, while the slowdown in German consumer demand was gathering pace. Demand in the formerly buoyant Spanish and Italian markets had braked sharply, due to their government's economic austerity measures.</p>

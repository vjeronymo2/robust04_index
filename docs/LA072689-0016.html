			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> HAWKINS BRINGS END TO YANKEE LOSING STREAK  </P> <P> In recent years, the New York Yankees have resembled a revolving door. There  seems to be a team coming, a team going and another on the field.  </P> <P> But owner George Steinbrenner and other Yankee executives haven't given up on  Andy Hawkins, the right-handed pitcher they signed as a free agent last winter.  </P> <P> Hawkins, who won 14 games with the San Diego Padres last season, was hit hard  in his first two starts for the Yankees. In the first, he gave up nine runs and  11 hits in 4 1/3 innings. In the second, he gave up six runs and nine hits in 4  1/3 innings while the Yankees fell to 1-7.  </P> <P> Tuesday night at Cleveland, the 29-year-old Hawkins pitched a five-hitter to  beat Greg Swindell and the Indians, 5-1, as the Yankees ended a seven-game  losing streak.  </P> <P> The Yankees knocked out Swindell (13-3) in the fourth inning. Swindell, who had  won nine of his last 10 decisions, was largely responsible for the Indians'  move in the American League East.  </P> <P> Steve Sax and Don Mattingly led the Yankee assault. Sax had four hits and stole  three bases, and Mattingly hit his 13th home run and drove in two runs. Jesse  Barfield homered for the final Yankee run.  </P> <P> "Seven games is a long time," said Hawkins, who is 12-9. "I felt I had to pitch  well tonight. It's not the most critical time of the year yet, but we needed to  get started."  </P> <P> Minnesota 9, Baltimore 3 -- Kirby Puckett, the major leagues' leading hitter,  homered and drove in four runs at Minneapolis as the Orioles lost their sixth  in a row.  </P> <P> The Orioles, the best fielding team in the majors, made two first-inning errors  to help the Twins score twice. The Twins broke it open with four more in the  fifth.  </P> <P> Allan Anderson (10-9) won for the first time in a month. He needed help in the  seventh inning after giving up three runs in 7 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> Puckett, who averaged 28 home runs the last three seasons, hit his seventh of  the season.  </P> <P> Boston 10, Kansas City 0 -- Wade Boggs is sometimes referred to as a singles  hitter. But, in this game at Boston, the perennial batting champion went for  extra bases.  </P> <P> For the first time, Boggs had four extra-base hits in a game. He had three  doubles and a triple to lead a 16-hit attack.  </P> <P> Mike Boddicker (9-7) breezed to his fifth consecutive victory and his second  complete game. He gave up nine singles.  </P> <P> "This game was just what the doctor ordered to put us on the move," said Boggs,  who lifted his average to .330. "I hit the ball hard and it found the holes."  </P> <P> George Brett returned to the Royals' lineup, but Bo Jackson, bothered by a  bruised thigh, did not play.  </P> <P> Detroit 7, Milwaukee 2 -- Fred Lynn hit a three-run home run in the first  inning at Milwaukee and it was just what the Tigers and pitcher Doyle Alexander  needed to both end six-game losing streaks.  </P> <P> The Tigers, the weakest hitting team in the league, batted around in the fifth,  scoring four times to build a 7-0 lead.  </P> <P> Alexander (5-10) gave up six hits and only one earned run in seven innings.  </P> <P> Chicago 7, Seattle 6 -- Ozzie Guillen doubled to open the eighth inning at  Chicago and eventually scored the winning run on a double play to give the  White Sox their 10th win in 11 games since the All-Star break.  </P> <P> Donn Pall (3-1) gained the victory in relief.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Belo Horizonte -- Finance Minister Rubens  Ricupero on 13 May defended agrarian reform as he condemned the  cordon established by nearly 300 people who claim to be landless  peasants around the Finance Ministry on 12 May in Brasilia. The  demonstrators were demanding a solution to the national land  situation. According to Ricupero, the riot was incomprehensible  because the Finance Ministry has nothing to do with agrarian  reform.    "Personally, I am in favor of agrarian reform. At least on  this point the peasants and I agree, because we both oppose the  UDR [Rural Democratic Union]. The peasants should demonstrate  against the UDR, against Caiado (meaning former UDR president  and former Deputy Ronaldo Caiado). On 13 May, the CUT [Sole  Workers Central] secretary general said during an interview that  the intention is to defeat the government stability plan. What  is the real intention behind that," the minister asked.    Ricupero on 13 May visited Belo Horizonte to explain the  economic stabilization plan to Minas Gerais business people. In  the totally full assembly hall of the Minas Gerais Business  Federation, he paused during his explanations to speak again  about the incidents in Brasilia. He referred to agrarian reform  and asserted that sooner or later this problem will have to be  solved in Brazil.    "With apologies to the people close to the UDR, but agrarian  reform is necessary in this country," he said.    In his opinion, the government acted correctly by ordering  the Army to intervene in the Federal Police problem. According  to him, the government cannot allow this kind of abuse. He  believes that the federal policemen on strike have demonstrated  narrowmindedness by harming the population: "The people end up  by siding against the strikers." [passage omitted]</p>

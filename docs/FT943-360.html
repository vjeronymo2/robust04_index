			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / International Company News: Sega and Atari link in wake of patent row Sega Enterprises, the leading Japanese video game manufacturer, and Atari Corporation, a US competitor, have agreed to form an 'affiliation' under which Sega will purchase Dollars 40m of Atari stock. Under the terms of the agreement, which follows the settlement of a patent dispute, Sega will acquire an 8 per cent stake - about 4.7m shares - in Atari. It will also pay close to Dollars 50m to acquire worldwide, non-exclusive rights to more than 70 of Atari's patents. Last year Atari filed suit against Sega, charging that its patent controlling the way in which video-game action moves across the screen was infringed by Sega. As part of the agreement, Atari will drop its legal claims. The companies also plan to license software for a specified number of video games to one another, so that the games will be available for both Sega and Atari machines. The companies said the agreements, which are subject to regulatory approval, will form the basis of a working relationship. Atari said it would use some of the funds from the agreement to expand its marketing programme for the important Christmas season. It hopes to gain ground with its 64-bit game system, called Jaguar, which it claims is technically superior to the 32-bit systems offered by Sega and Nintendo. For Atari, an early leader in the video game market that lost ground to Nintendo and Sega in the 1980s, the agreement provides a much needed cash injection. In June, it said it had enough cash to fund its operations through to the end of this year. Atari's revenues plummeted to Dollars 28.8m last year, from Dollars 127.3m in 1992, as it withdrew from the personal computer market. Losses in 1993 were Dollars 48.8m. Sega's revenues for the year ended March 1994 were Y354bn (Dollars 3.6bn), giving a pre-tax profit of Y42.5bn, down 23 per cent.</p>

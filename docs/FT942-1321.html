			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: Argentaria seeks to delay next phase of sell-off Argentaria, the state-controlled Spanish banking group, wants to hold back its next phase of privatisation until next year, while it lays the ground for new expansion plans, chairman Mr Francisco Luzon said yesterday. A third share flotation, reducing the government's stake to a minority, was expected by the end of this year. Almost 50 per cent of the shares were placed on the stock markets in two heavily-oversubscribed tranches last year, bringing in Pta296bn (Dollars 2.2bn) to the Spanish treasury. Some 24 per cent of the capital is in foreign hands. Mr Luzon indicated this might rise to 30 per cent in the next privatisation phase. He said he envisaged that the government would retain at least a 20 per cent share 'for a relatively long time', in the interests of stability. Argentaria was formed three years ago through an amalgamation of the state's banking interests. Privatisation would have to take place gradually whatever government was in place, Mr Luzon said, referring to the possibility of an early general election. An election now would probably replace the current Socialist government with a conservative Popular Party administration. At the bank's first open annual shareholders' meeting today, Mr Luzon will set out his strategy in the wake of Argentaria's failed bid in April for control of Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), the banking group restructured after Bank of Spain intervention late last year. The contest for Banesto was won by the private-sector Banco Santander. Mr Luzon said Argentaria aimed to become more competitive, winning market share in new business areas and reinforcing its international and investment banking sides. It was 'in a buying mood', he said, indicating that expansion in retail banking might entail acquisition of a bank or an additional branch network. However, it had no specific plans. Argentaria was also looking at non-banking investments in service sectors such as mobile telephones. At the same time, Argentaria would be ready to sell its 24 per cent stake in Banco Atlantico, a Barcelona-based bank controlled by Arab Banking Corporation, if it were offered a good price.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lorraine Braid] </F>   [Text] Oudtshoorn March 22 SAPA -- Law and Order Minister  Hernus Kriel has appealed for calm from everyone after the  release of the shock Goldstone Commission interim report  concerning three police generals' alleged involvement in gun  smuggling.    "I am asking for everyone to be calm, including the generals  and the SAP [South African Police], because the ANC [African  National Congress] is using this opportunity to try and cut our  throats," he told about 500 people in the Oudtshoorn Civic  Centre on Tuesday [22 March] night. "Don't let us be guilty of  a hearing and sentence without tested evidence. The Goldstone  report shocked the SAP and myself, because everything Mr Justice  Richard Goldstone says in his report is diametrically opposed to  the policies of the National Party [NP] and State President F.W.  de Klerk. When Mr de Klerk received the report, I was with him  and he had no other choice but to act the way he did."    Mr Kriel said if the accusations contained in the  commission's interim report had been ignored, the government  would have been accused of a cover-up and would have placed the  SA Police in an even weaker position. It was of cardinal  importance to get to the truth as soon as possible.    Mr Kriel said it was on his recommendations that an  international investigating team be appointed -- in the interest  of the SAP. The result of the investigation has to be above  suspicion of any cover- up, he said.    "The report should he handled as soon as possible because of  the paranoia of the ANC and Democratic Party to prove the SAP is  a bunch of criminals. The investigation must restore people's  trust in the SAP."    Mr Kriel said the Goldstone Commision interim report showed  up painful shortcomings in the whole commission system in South  Africa. "I am not blaiming Mr Justice Goldstone but the system  lends itself to things not going right. People get a report  based on untested evidence and allegations which are made public  and then, people are tried in the media and not in court. That  is wrong."    He said the weakness of commission's report was that  people's  careers were also ruined, adding that he was also not blaming Mr  Justice Goldstone because he had to carry out the procedure. Mr  Kriel said he was also not blaming President de Klerk who had to  make a decision. "I am sorry for the victims of such a system.  I think it should be the responsibility of a government of  national unity to see that a better commission system is  introduced, where evidence is tested according to legal  practice."    Mr Kriel said he would not resign because of the report.  "Any cabinet is appointed or fired by the state president. I  will not resign if the ANC demands it, or over a report not yet  tested in a court of law."</p>

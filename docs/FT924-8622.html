			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Puzzled by the appliance of science - A look at Morgan Crucible's rather confusing acquisition policy and a proposed purchase that will boost the materials technology group's position in the US ceramics market BARRING SLIPS, Morgan Crucible, the materials technology group, is to bring another company into the fold. Morgan is about to pay Dollars 2.3m (Pounds 1.48m) to buy assets from Frenchtown Ceramics, a subsidiary of Stackpole Corporation of Massachusetts. Frenchtown will add technology and market position to the group's US technical ceramics business, Morgan tells us. Like many of Morgan's previous 25 acquisitions in the last six years, the Stackpole purchase is destined to be less than perfectly understood. Such has been the proliferation of deals, that even diligent investors can be forgiven for losing sight of what exactly Morgan makes and what it is going to do next. Mr Bruce Farmer, the gritty chief executive from Birmingham with a doctorate in material science, is the first to accept that Morgan Crucible is not the best understood company. And yet, the formula - exploitation of the properties of materials in new markets and new products - has given Morgan a manufacturing position in 37 countries, sales in 83 more and one of the UK's more enviable currency profiles since the recent devaluation of sterling. With a market capitalisation of Pounds 575m and profits - if not earnings - still growing, Morgan is also within sight of the FT-SE 100 Index. Part of Morgan's problem is that terms like 'materials technology' and 'application engineers' do little to clear the fog. The Pounds 346m-plus spent on acquisitions has, furthermore, tended to obscure where earnings growth has been generated. Yet these acquisitions have put Morgan into a dominant position in a number of its markets. Following a period of self-imposed abstinence from paper-driven acquisition  -Mr Farmer had a run in with the City last year after two rights issues in 10 months - Morgan's four divisions currently look like this: More than half Morgan's sales come from ceramics - the group of materials which include oxides of metals and demonstrate great compressive strength and hardness, or resistance to high temperatures and corrosion. Thermal ceramics, the largest division, has more than 50 per cent of the world ceramic fibre market, plus a large slice of the market for heat resistant bricks used in crucibles and refractories. Its traditional industrial markets have, not surprisingly, been mauled by the general economic downturn as furnace utilisation has fallen. Operating profits for the full year are expected to fall 9 per cent to Pounds 21.5m from sales of Pounds 205m, according to Nikko Europe. But Morgan has managed to limit this fall, by comparison with other producers of refactories, largely through the introduction of new applications. Ceramic fibre is now being used as insulation in the construction industry, and has already been installed in roofs at EuroDisney. The most interesting development, however, is car safety air-bags - which inflate between driver or passenger and dashboard after a controlled explosion. Morgan makes the heat filters that contain the heat of the explosion. Thermal Ceramics estimates this market will be worth Dollars 25m to it in the US by 1996. The company is already making heat shields that cradle catalytic converters and is developing ceramic fibre-reinforced metal for stronger, lighter pistons. 'This company has tended to be in heat treatment in process industries,' says Mr Farmer. 'Suddenly it will find itself in the auto industry in a big way.' Technical ceramics offers perhaps the best future growth prospects. The group is developing the bio-medical market with pacemaker components and artificial hip joints and new applications in power generation. However, growth from new products is currently almost offset by the slow-down in the aerospace and white consumer goods markets and demand for traditional products like electrical insulators. Operating profits are likely, however, to increase 43 per cent to Pounds 16.5m on sales of Pounds 165m as a result of the Pounds 35m spent last year on two acquisitions - Dulmison in Australia and Wesgo from GTE Products. Without these acquisitions, profits would have fallen by 6 per cent. Again, Mr Farmer argues that compared with competitors like Hoechst in Germany, Morgan's decline has been minimal. Speciality materials and technologies produces a vast array of industrial lubricants and other aids for manufacturing processes. Newer products include solder flux removers and cleaning swabs for the computer and electronic industries, and non-slip epoxy deck coatings for oil rigs and naval vessels. Recession in the defence markets and in the nuclear industry has held the division back. It has also suffered from low margins at Holt Lloyd, the car care business. Morgan is talking with a potential buyer of this business. Operating profits are, nevertheless, expected to increase by 8 per cent this year to Pounds 20m largely as a result of growth in new products. The carbon division's dominant world position in the manufacture of carbon brushes for electrical motors has been built through a network of plants internationally. The business has low margins but very high volumes - the Morganite plant in North Carolina, for example, last year made 175m brushes and 40m electrical commutators. Demand for smaller horse power and consumer motors has held up, partly because of a dramatic increase in the number of motors that go into any one automobile. And production of commutators has taken off. Recession has, however, badly hit the company in larger brushes for railroad and traction uses. In commutators, the group is planning a near-doubling of US capacity to take on a troubled private producer. 'This is one example where organic growth is better than acquisition,' says Mr Farmer. Operating profits are likely to fall 9 per cent to Pounds 16m this year on sales marginally ahead at Pounds 120m. By comparison, Le Carbone-Lorraine, a subsidiary of Pechiney, incurred a loss at its last half-year and Mr Farmer believes Morgan has been gaining market share. Morgan divisional breakdown does not immediately suggest a bullish outlook for earnings. But for an industrial company, Morgan has shown a surprising resilience which Mr Farmer puts down to geographical and product diversification. Much of this is the result of little understood and little noticed acquisitions which can incrementally improve market share, or capacity utilisation or competitive position. What is more, in the short term investors do not need to look to recovery in Morgan's markets because of sterling's devaluation. 'We are the reverse of GM - what is good for the UK is bad for Morgan Crucible,' Mr Farmer says. Not only will devaluation boost Morgan's translated overseas profits it will also increase competitive edge of Morgan's British production, much of which is exported.</p>

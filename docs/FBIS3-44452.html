			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by XINHUA reporter Duanmu Laidi (4551 2606 0171 </F> 1229): "Dissolving the Three-Tiered Structure Is Inevitable for  China To Reexercise Its Sovereignty Over Hong Kong"]    [Text] Beijing, 4 Jan (XINHUA) -- For the sake of Hong  Kong's long-term prosperity and stability and its smooth  transition, the Chinese Government has held talks with Britain  for as long as seven months on the 1994-95 elections in Hong  Kong. After the talks broke down as a result of side issues  that Britain created, Chris Patten brazenly submitted to the  Hong Kong Legislative Council [Legco] his "political reform  bill," which goes against the three principles [adherence to the  Sino-British Joint Declaration, convergence with the Basic Law  of the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR),  and the observance of the agreements and understanding reached  by China and Britain]. According to the Sino-British Joint  Declaration and the Basic Law, Britain's administration in Hong  Kong will end on 30 June 1997, the political framework of the  British Hong Kong Government will also terminate at that time,  and the three-tiered frameworks created in the 1994-95 elections  will also be dissolved. This is inevitable for China to  reexercise its sovereignty over Hong Kong and bring the British  rule there to an end, and it will be an important step that  China will take to execute the Sino-British Joint Declaration  and the Basic Law and to carry out the "one country, two  systems" principle.    Hong Kong's three-tiered political structure made up by its  district boards and two municipal councils as well as by the  Legco is a major issue relevant to Hong Kong's smooth transition  in 1997. According to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, during  Hong Kong's latter transitional period, all measures taken to  ensure its smooth transition in 1997 should be examined and  discussed by China and Britain. However, refusing to consult  China on this major issue, Britain incessantly schemed to "make  transitional arrangements on its own" in an attempt to keep  China out from participating in transitional affairs. This move  itself has violated the Sino- British Joint Declaration and the  Basic Law. If Hong Kong's three- tiered framework should end on  30 June 1997, China cannot be totally uninvolved with the issue;  but because there is the issue of the transition of members of  the three-tiered council to the post-1997 period, China and  Britain have held 17 rounds of talks on the 1994- 95 elections  in Hong Kong. Now that Britain has undermined the talks and  there is no through train to speak off, the three-tiered  framework has to be overturned and rebuilt. This is to say that  the three-tiered framework of the British Hong Kong Government  will end on 30 June 1997, and the Chinese Government will  rebuild the political framework of the HKSAR in accordance with  the Basic Law and the relevant decisions of the National  People's Congress on 1 July 1997.    The British side has been hoping that by forming a group  during the 1994-95 election, the new HKSAR Government in 1997  would have no other choice but to swallow the bitter fruit  created by Britain so that people acceptable to Britain can  continue to control the future HKSAR Government and Legco, and  Britain's ruling power can continue in Hong Kong. Now they are  infuriated, knowing that their wishful thinking is just an  illusion. So they have counterattacked, claiming that "the  Basic Law will be violated if the tenure of the three-tiered  council members cannot straddle 1997," and that "China has  expanded the kitchen" and "threatened members of the  three-tiered council." But like the proverbial donkey in  ancient Guizhou, it has exhausted its tricks. The outcome has  gone against its wishes, the life of colonialism will soon end,  and Britain will eventually gain nothing in this respect.    When Britain's ruling power in Hong Kong terminates on 30  June 1997, all the political structures of the British Hong Kong  Government there, including the Legco, the district boards, and  the municipal councils, will have to wither away on their own on  1 July 1997. Britain will have no right whatsoever to meddle in  our business and make unilateral arrangements for Hong Kong's  political structure after 1997.    The Basic Law has embodied the sovereignty which China will  reexercise over Hong Kong, and when China does what has been  prescribed in the Basic Law, it simply is not "expanding the  kitchen" as certain people have clamored in saying. As for the  claim that China has "threatened members of the three-tiered  council," that is even more absurd. Even if China and Britain  have reached an agreement through consultations, whether members  of the Hong Kong Legco can go on to become Legco members of the  HKSAR after 1997 will still have to be confirmed by the  Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR. Because Britain has  refused to cooperate with China and has acted on its own, it is  totally justified that the three- tiered structure and the term  of the council members must be discontinued after 1997.    We must say that because the Basic Law embodies and codifies  the "one country, two systems" principle into law, abolishing  all laws which contravene the Basic Law and all organs created  by these laws is an act which firmly safeguards the Sino-British  Joint Declaration and the Basic Law as well as the principles  governing "one country, two systems," "the administration of  Hong Kong by Hong Kong people," and the "high degree of  autonomy." Any mudslinging, attack, rumormongering, or  distortion cannot stop the Britain's colonial rule from  collapsing and the political doom of the pro-British and  anti-China elements.    "One thousand sails are passing by the sunken ship, and  10,000 trees are sprouting in front of the sick wood." The day  when China reexercises its sovereignty over Hong Kong will be  the time when the principle of "one country, two systems" will  be formally carried out. One important requirement is that we  must make genuine efforts to safeguard China's national  sovereignty and territorial integrity so that this principle can  be implemented in Hong Kong. This is a responsibility that  cannot be shirked by any Chinese countrymen. Acting as the  masters of their own country, all Hong Kong citizens who are  patriotic and who love Hong Kong will be concerned with Hong  Kong's smooth transition, they will actively participate in all  preparations for the transfer of political power in 1997, and,  with a new spiritual outlook, they will also greet the day when  China reexercises its sovereignty over Hong Kong.</p>

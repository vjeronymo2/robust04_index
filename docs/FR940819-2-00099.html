			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Microsoft's Licenses Impose a Penalty or Tax Paid to Microsoft on OEMs' Use of Non-Microsoft PC Operating Systems <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 21. Microsoft's licenses impose a penalty or ``tax'' paid to Microsoft upon OEMs' use of competing PC operating systems. ``Per processor'' licenses require OEMs to pay a royalty for each computer the OEM sells containing a particular processor ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , an Intel 386 microprocessor) whether or not the OEM has included a Microsoft operating system with that computer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 22. Microsoft's per processor contracts penalize OEMs, during the life of the contract, for installing a non-Microsoft operating system. OEMs that have signed per processor contracts with Microsoft are deterred from using competitive alternatives to Microsoft operating systems. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Contract Length of Microsoft's Anticompetitive Per Processor Contracts Magnifies Its Exclusionary Effects <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 23. Microsoft further impedes PC operating system competitors by executing long-term contracts with major OEMs, and by requiring minimum commitments and crediting unused balances to future contracts, which effectively extends the contract term and makes it economically unattractive for an OEM to install a non-Microsoft operating system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 24. Microsoft's exclusionary licenses are often for a duration of three years or more_a period of time equal to, or exceeding, the product life cycle of most PC operating system products. Microsoft often extends the term of its OEM licenses through amendment. Thus, Microsoft's anticompetitive per processor contracts can extend to beyond five years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Microsoft's Exclusionary Contracts Foreclose Other PC Operating System Vendors From a Substantial and Critically Important Segment of the Market <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 25. Access to the OEM channel is critical to the success of a competing operating system. The overwhelming majority of PCs are sold with a pre-installed operating system. Thus, to reach the ultimate consumer of an operating system, it is important that competitors have access to OEMs. Operating system vendors, as well as OEMs, confirm that successful entry is extremely difficult in the absence of ``proper support'' in the OEM channel in the form of public commitments to sell a new operating system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 26. Since 1988, Microsoft has induced major OEMs to execute per processor contracts, many of which extend for several years. These OEMs are critical to the success of a new operating system entrant; it would be virtually impossible for a new entrant to achieve commercial success solely through license agreements with small OEMs that are not covered by Microsoft's per processor agreements. According to Microsoft, in fiscal year 1993, per processor agreements accounted for an estimated 60% of Microsoft's MS&hyph;DOS sales to OEMs and 43% of Window sales to OEMs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 27. Competing operating system developers, finding the largest OEMs contractually bound by Microsoft's exclusionary licenses, are disadvantaged in their efforts to bring to the consumer less expensive and/or better quality operating system products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 28. The effect of Microsoft's licensing practices has been to exclude competitors by unreasonable and anticompetitive means and to lessen competition in the relevant market. Microsoft's practices deter OEMs from entering into licensing agreements with competing operating system providers, discourage OEMs who agree to sell non-Microsoft operating systems from promoting those products, and raise the price of computers sold with competing operating systems, thereby depressing the demand and restricting the output of these products. Microsoft's licensing practices have effectively foreclosed a substantial share of the relevant market; they are exclusionary, anticompetitive, and not justified by legitimate business considerations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Microsoft's Anticompetitive Non-Disclosure Agreements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 29. ISVs develop applications, which motivate consumers to purchase PCs. Microsoft has sought to have several commercially important ISVs and their employees agree to non-disclosure agreements that would restrict their ability to work with competing PC operating systems as well as restrict their ability to develop competitive products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30. Microsoft moved to impose these restrictions in connection with its ``beta tests'' of its new operating system, the next version of Windows, code-named Chicago. Microsoft anticipates commercially releasing Chicago in late 1994 or early 1995. Beta tests of new versions of an operating system, which are conducted prior to the commercial release of that new version, help both Microsoft and the ISVs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 31. For the ISVs, the beta tests provide, among other things, critical information about the interfaces in the operating system that connect with applications_information which the ISVs need to write applications that run on the operating system. Early access to the beta tests is especially valuable to the ISVs if they are to be able to release their applications within a short time after the commercial release of a new Microsoft operating system, such as Chicago. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 32. For Microsoft, the beta tests enable ISVs, informed experts, and selected members of the media to provide important feedback about the advantages ad drawbacks of the operating system. In addition, the demand for Microsoft's operating systems depends to a significant extent on the availability of applications designed to work with it. Accordingly, it is in Microsoft's interest to provide ISVs early access to beta tests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 33. At the same time, because Microsoft necessarily must disclose certain confidential information during the course of the beta tests, it has legitimate interests in maintaining that confidentiality. In the past, Microsoft has protected its interests through non-disclosure agreements that prohibit those participating in the beta tests from disclosing such confidential information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 34. In connection with its beta tests of Chicago, however, Microsoft sought to impose on certain leading software companies far more restrictive non-disclosure agreements than it had previously used. The terms of these non-disclosure agreements would preclude developers at these companies from working with operating system companies, other competitors of Microsoft, and competing technologies for an unreasonably long period of time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / International Company News: Investors in south-east Asian equities count their profits - Choices shareholders face after a record year in the region's stock markets THERE is nothing like sitting on a fat, unrealised profit to make an investor nervous, and a fat paper profit is precisely what you should have if you put your money into south-east Asian equities at the start of the year and kept it there. The phenomenon of soaring stock prices has not been confined to Hong Kong, the biggest market in the region. Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines have all repeatedly reached record highs; Manila's composite index, for example, is up 75 per cent from its year's low in January. Indonesia, although not yet in record territory, has risen 70 per cent. Trading volumes have swollen too. In Kuala Lumpur, the number of shares traded has sometimes exceeded levels in New York and Tokyo, forcing stockbrokers to sleep in their offices at night as they struggled to keep up with the paperwork; earlier this year some of them even chartered helicopters to shift scrip around Malaysia. The Stock Exchange of Thailand is planning to extend trading hours from the current five hours a day. Singapore, extended its trading to 12-hour sessions on two days this week to cope with the start of trading in the newly-privatised Singapore Telecom. Investors, who are understandably considering selling their south-east Asian shares to realise profits, are faced with a familiar dilemma: they cannot think of anything they would rather buy, but they fear a regional stock-market crash or at least a sharp correction in the weeks ahead. Indeed, this week has seen reverses in many of the region's markets as investors have decided to book some of the profits following the recent strong advances. Most of the stockbrokers analysing such risks start by looking at the reasons for this year's extraordinarily robust performance by south-east Asian equities. Some of them are obvious. Except in the Philippines, the region's economies have shrugged off recessions in the Japanese, US and European markets and are typically growing by 8 per cent a year. Some of the causes are peculiar to particular markets. In Malaysia, stock market activity has been fuelled by political manoeuvring and the distribution of financial favours ahead of this month's elections for posts in the United Malays National Organisation (Umno, the dominant party in the government). In Singapore, the government has launched a campaign to promote share ownership and freed an extra SDollars 20bn for investment in equities by relaxing controls on the use of money from the Central Provident Fund, the social security system to which citizens are obliged to contribute. Such special factors, however, are only part of the story. Stock market analysts agree that south-east Asian markets, like equity markets elsewhere, are 'liquidity-driven'. In other words they are beneficiaries of the worldwide fall in interest rates which has tempted large sums of money out of bank deposits and into equities. Previous rallies in south-east Asia have often been prompted by local speculators driving up the price of secondary stocks, with foreign investors tagging along behind saying: 'We know this company is fundamentally unsound, but we're going to buy it anyway because we know local share-ramping will increase the value of the shares.' This time, the situation is different. Foreign investors, particularly US mutual funds increasing their exposure to the economies of south-east Asia, have led the charge, buying blue chip shares such as Bangkok Bank or Philippine Long Distance Telephone. The new money makes a profound impact. Although the capitalisation of south-east Asian markets is growing fast - and some of them can now absorb the Dollars 1m plus buy orders demanded by big international investors - their small size means that a rush of foreign buying can have a disproportionate effect on share prices and market indices. 'The reason that it has a dramatic influence in these markets is that they are small,' says Mr Nigel Wightman, chief executive of Rothschild Asset Management Asia Pacific in Hong Kong. Indonesia's market capitalisation, he points out, is about the same as Chrysler's. Tight restrictions on foreign access to stocks in South Korea and Taiwan further accentuate the rise in the other fast-growing equity markets of Asia. Mr Korn Chatikavanij, managing director of Jardine Fleming Thanakom Securities in Bangkok, says low world interest rates are the basic reason for the rapid rise of stock market values in south-east Asia, as elsewhere. 'But we've always in this region been like a warrant to the world stock markets,' he says. 'We go up more and we go down more.' Mr Korn and other analysts say the principal risk of a sharp fall in the value of south-east Asian stocks will come from abroad. If world interest rates rise, foreign money may try to get out of Asian stocks as quickly as it is now trying to get in; just as demand for relatively illiquid stocks forces prices to rise exceptionally sharply, so selling pressure forces prices sharply down. A further problem in south-east Asia, with the notable exception of Singapore, is that several markets are poorly regulated. Foreign investors are partly shielded from this by the preponderance of blue chips in their portfolios, and both Thailand and Malaysia have recently established securities commissions in an attempt to improve company disclosure and control insider dealing. In Bangkok, however, it is still common for a company's shares to rise or fall sharply shortly before the disclosure of a good or bad item of news about the company. 'The foreigners realise that they (the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission) have a difficult job to do and they are not going to do it overnight,' says Mr Neil Semple, senior analyst at HG Asia in Bangkok. 'Probably there's a lot of people they should throw in jail, but realistically that's not an option.' No-one would be surprised if a sharp fall in regional equity values revealed a few companies with difficulties that they were able to hide in a bull market. 'At the moment, the tide is rising and all boats are rising with it,' says Mr Wightman. 'At some stage in the next year or two some of the dodgy stuff is going to be found out.' In spite of such fears, in spite of this year's sharp rise in regional markets, and in spite of the vulnerability of equities to interest rate rises, many stockbrokers remain bullish about south-east Asia. Some have uprated the region, arguing that it is no longer self-evident that Asian companies - which operate, after all, in fast-growing economies - represent riskier investments than companies in Europe, the US or Japan. Price/earnings ratios are not excessive either in comparison with the industrialised world or when compared with previous ratios in the Asian markets themselves, and price levels can be justified by strong corporate earnings growth. 'I don't sense that any of these markets is yet overbought,' says Mr Wightman. In Bangkok, Mr Semple, postulating a future Stock Exchange of Thailand index level of about 1,400 (this week it has been around the 1,300 level, closing yesterday at 1,284.93) estimates a modest average Bangkok price/earnings ratio of 16 in 1995, against about 20 at present. Any fall in Asian stock markets prompted by an outflow of foreign funds is likely to be limited by the fact that Asians are becoming increasingly wealthy and active in their own markets. Even during the recent surge of foreign buying, foreign investors in the Thai market were accounting for only about a fifth of turnover. Nor is there much evidence that foreigners are losing interest. US fund managers are looking closely at emerging sectors across the region as governments privatise everything from airlines to petrochemical plants. Only a rash investor, however, would rule out the possibility of a sustained sharp downward correction in equity values across the region after such a bull market. 'The Americans and Japanese are buying. That could be a sign that we are at the top of the market,' said the director of one stockbroking firm in Bangkok. 'They are always in last.' He laughed at his own joke and put the phone down. Stockbrokers in south-east Asia are busy right now. See World Stock Markets</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Kaduna State government has set up a new task  force on fuel supply headed by the state military administrator,  Colonel Lawal Ja'afaru Isa. The task force was inaugurated  today at the end of a joint meeting between the administrator,  NNPC [Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation] officials, and  oil dealers and marketers in Kaduna. Members of the task force  include all state commissioners, directors general, NNPC  officials, and representatives of oil dealers and marketers.    Under the new guidelines, no loaded tanker would leave the  NNPC depot without the presence of the administrator. In  addition, a loaded tanker must be accompanied by a commissioner  or a director general from the depot to the discharging points.  All escorting officers are duty bound to inspect all the  compartments of a tanker to ensure that all its contents were  off-loaded at the destinations.    Col. Isa directed all filling stations to henceforth  commence  operations from 7 o'clock each morning and close down at 7  o'clock in the night. They are also required to sell only 100  naira worth of petrol to each vehicle at a time. He warned that  the offending dealers would have their licenses seized, while  their filling stations would be converted to government filling  stations.</p>

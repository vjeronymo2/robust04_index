			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 21 (XINHUA) -- The current visits by  Chinese Premier Li Peng to four Central Asian countries are by  no means directed against any other country, Chinese Foreign  Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said here this afternoon.    Wu was addressing a weekly press conference, at which he  denied a report that Li's visit was aimed at contending with  Russia for influence in the countries of the Commonwealth of  Independent States.    The spokesman said that the Chinese premier's visits are  return visits for those made by the leaders of the countries in  question, and the purpose is to enhance mutual understanding  with these countries, and promote good-neighborly friendship, as  well as develop mutually beneficial co-operation.    "Therefore, the visits are by no means directed against any  other country," Wu said.    "The friendly co-operation in various fields between China  and Russia is developing steadily."    He went on: "We are keen to see the continued development of  the friendship between Russia and the Central Asian countries,  which are neighbors of both China and Russia."</p>

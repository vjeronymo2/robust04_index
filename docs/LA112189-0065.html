			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIGNATURE EFFORT FAILS IN BERNSON RECALL BID  </P> <P> A Northridge businessman's attempt to recall Los Angeles City Councilman Hal  Bernson failed Monday, and Bernson said he will ask a council committee to  study possible changes in the city's recall process to prevent what he called  "political harassment."  </P> <P> Backers of the recall effort, led by Walter N. Prince, owner of a janitorial  service, were unable to collect the signatures of 17,622 registered voters from  Bernson's northwest San Fernando Valley district. Petitions with the required  number of signatures had to be submitted to the city clerk's office by 5 p.m.  Monday in order to force a recall election.  </P> <P> Prince did not submit any petitions to the clerk's office Monday, saying he had  gathered only about 13,000 valid signatures.  </P> <P> "We're shy of the mark," he said.  </P> <P> Prince said his group, Citizens United to Recall Bernson, gathered 22,000  signatures, but about 9,000 of those were from people who lived outside  Bernson's district or who were not registered to vote.  </P> <P> Prince has accused Bernson of siding with large landowners and developers on  zoning issues such as the proposed 1,300-acre Porter Ranch residential and  commercial development. He also criticized Bernson's plan to use a  redevelopment agency to upgrade a run-down area along Parthenia Street in which  Prince owns property.  </P> <P> Bernson last week put the redevelopment plan on hold to give property owners an  opportunity to upgrade the Parthenia Street area themselves. He said the recall  effort stemmed from a narrow group of property owners, including Prince, who  are resisting improvement of the area.  </P> <P> On Oct. 28, Prince published a second notice of intention to recall Bernson, in  effect starting a new recall effort in which he has until March to obtain the  necessary number of signatures. Prince will not be allowed to include the  signatures his group gathered for the failed recall effort.  </P> <P> Bernson called the second attempt to recall him "political harassment" and said  he will ask the council's Rules and Elections Committee to study whether  provisions in the City Charter should be changed to prevent repeated recall  efforts.  </P> <P> "Certainly, there should not be the ability for the same people with the same  complaint to issue new petitions upon the failure of a previous attempt,"  Bernson said. "This basically amounts to extending the political process during  the entire term of the officeholder."  </P> <P> The charter currently bars a second recall attempt from starting within six  months of a special recall election in which the council member prevails. But  it permits repeated recall attempts after previous ones fail to force an  election.  </P> <P> Bernson also said the charter should require backers of failed recall drives to  turn in their signatures to the city clerk. He said he doubted Prince collected  as many as he claimed.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to make a big deal about it," Bernson said, but "it's important  that these changes be made."  </P> <P> Prince also has complained about the recall process. The requirement that  recall proponents collect more than 17,000 signatures -- 15% of the district's  registered voters -- is onerous, he said.  </P> <P> In 1987, Bernson won reelection with nearly 12,000 votes.  </P></p>

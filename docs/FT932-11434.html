			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / US Money and Credit: Prices marked higher as fears of inflation subside THE US bond market has been lacking direction for several weeks now. Last week, as little categorical information emerged on either the political or economic fronts, there was no reason for this to change. With all sorts of political question marks hanging over the Clinton economic package, traders attempted to focus on more tangible data about the economy's progress. For the first four trading sessions, this was mildly discouraging. The gold price rally spurred fears that inflation may be creeping back into the system, while the consumer confidence figures for April showed a fairly significant rise, reinforcing this impression. By Thursday night, the yield on the benchmark 30-year long bond had risen from 6.79 per cent at the end of the previous week, back to 6.91 per cent. But on Friday, bond prices suddenly reversed direction, taking heed of the Commerce Department's latest report on gross domestic product. This showed the value of goods and services produced in the US advanced at an annualised rate of 1.8 per cent in the first quarter 1993. This compared with the significant 4.7 per cent rate seen in the last quarter of 1992. For bond traders, it was confirmation the steam had gone out of the recovery, and that the trek out of recession would be slow, uphill work. With the embryonic inflation fears temporarily allayed, traders marked bond prices higher, pushing down yields. The long bond ended at 103 1/32 , up by almost half a point, where it yielded 6.88 per cent. The coming week, however, may be more testing. Friday will bring the April jobs data, widely expected to show a rebound for the weather-depressed slide in the previous month. The question is, how big will the revival be? The consensus centres on a fairly modest recovery, coming mainly in the construction sector and with manufacturing employment growth remaining lacklustre. Most pundits are predicting the overall unemployment rate will be unchanged at 7 per cent. However, any significant progress in the jobs market could reawaken the inflation fears. On a different front, bond traders must also absorb the Treasury's plans for this month's quarterly auction and its related report on how its borrowing costs can be reduced. Most traders agree the report will focus on the role which longer-dated securities - and the 30-year long bond in particular - will play in the government's future funding efforts. In an effort to prune borrowing costs, the Treasury could choose to issue more shorter-dated, low-yielding securities. If so, smaller auctions of 30-year bonds could tighten the market for the stock and push prices higher. That said, treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen has pledged there will be no radical change - although he has never specified exactly what this might mean, and there are strong political reasons for saving the maximum number of dollars this way. Conversely, with interest rates at a low ebb, this could be a poor time in the interest rate cycle to start shortening the maturity of government debt. Analysts at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, for example, advise that the 30-year bond offering be reduced by Dollars 1bn to Dollars 8.25bn, the 10-year note by Dollars 500m to Dollars 10.25bn, and the size of the three-year note issue be unchanged at Dollars 15.5bn - an overall package of Dollars 34bn. A WEAKER-than-expected purchasing managers' report boosted longer-dated US Treasury prices yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  13/16 at 103 5/16 yielding 6.859 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up  3/32 at 100 7/32 , to yield 3.743 per cent.</p>

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Close vote likely on Poland's big sell-off scheme POLAND'S coalition government is hoping that its wafer thin parliamentary majority will hold in next week's vote on the country's controversial mass privatisation scheme. The scheme envisages the transfer of 600 state enterprises to foreign-managed investment funds, with shares in the funds handed out at a nominal fee to the population. The plan seeks at one blow to widen share ownership, reduce the state sector, streamline enterprise management and improve the ability of the companies to raise investment funds. Over 50 foreign investment banks and consultants, including Kidder Peabody and Kleinwort Benson, have offered to run the 20 or more funds. These will exist for 10 years. After then the shareholders can decide whether to liquidate the funds. Parliament has been working on the draft legislation since last autumn. A debate last week revealed doubts among both the opposition left and government supporters from the nationalist ZChN party. Government officials fear opponents could remove some of the plan's key elements. Several ZChN deputies have threatened to vote against the plan unless foreign managers are excluded from the scheme. Meanwhile the SLD group, encompassing the former communists, approves of the use of foreign managers but wants to limit the scheme to a pilot project encompassing only 200 plants. The SLD also argues that the shares should not be distributed until 1995 after the funds' initial performance has been reviewed. The World Bank is linking approval of successive tranches of a projected Dollars 450m structural adjustment loan designed to finance a domestic bank debt reduction plan to the scheme being implemented by parliament.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the Cuban </F> Workers Federation [CTC], at the opening of the morning session  of the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP] in  Havana on 1 May; monitored in progress -- recorded]    [Text] ...Furthermore, we have the immense satisfaction of  having a representation of labor union leaders and friendly  personalities who have come in large numbers to bring us their  solidarity and encouragement on this 1 May. [applause] They  symbolize all the workers and progressive forces that are  mobilizing around the world to support our resistance, condemn  the blockade, and defend their own hope in Cuba. Our most  sincere thanks, esteemed brothers.    Before this session, Comrade Fidel showed us the path to  walk. To his political view and his trust in the masses we owe  the idea of the workers' parliaments, which were held with great  success. In thousands of assemblies, workers expressed with  profound feeling their appreciation to the commander in chief  for giving them the opportunity to discuss the country's  economic problems freely and openly. Thanks to that suggestion  by Comrade Fidel in December, today we have a vast arsenal of  ideas and proposals. We have discovered and put to work an  important productive reserve; above all, we have reached a level  of information and comprehension never before achieved on the  nature of the problems we face, the conquests we should  preserve, and which are our main alternatives to overcome the  crisis.    The recent extended plenum of our National Committee of the  CTC, during which we held an extensive exchange with the  commander in chief on the results of the workers' parliaments,  concluded that there is already a true national consensus upon  which we can begin to build. For the Cuban labor movement, this  process has also been an injection of energy and the discovery  of methods that should serve to perfect our work further. We are  sure that we now have the resources to reach the best conditions  and to apply -- gradually and intelligently, but with  determination and firmness -- the measures of restructuring and  order that the people await: those that may emanate from this  assembly and those that are already being carried out in tens of  thousands of work centers with the understanding that only  through more work and with an inevitable quota of sacrifice will  we be able to overcome this exceptionally difficult situation.    The sacrifice is not what could intimidate us, because our  people sacrifice themselves day after day. What can scare us is  the possibility of losing our fatherland, which is finally free;  the Revolution that brought work, justice, and dignity for all  Cubans; and the socialism that transformed us into a people of  comrades and brothers. For that reason, let us not vacillate in  making the decisions that the country needs, in the certainty  that no sacrifice will be too great if we preserve the historic  conquests of the Revolution, and that nothing can break a people  with no other vision than victory.    Viva International Workers Day! [crowd shouts: Viva!] Viva  our glorious, invincible Revolution! [crowd shouts: Viva!] Viva  Fidel! [crowd shouts: Viva!] Socialism or death, fatherland or  death, we will win!</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Participating in Management <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA proposes that, as used in this proposed rule, ``participation in the management of an UST or UST system'' means the actual involvement in the management or control of decisionmaking related to the UST or UST system by the holder. Participation in management does not include the mere capacity or unexercised right or ability to influence UST or UST system operations. This proposal contains a list of activities that is not all-inclusive, but which generally describes activities that are not considered to be evidence that a holder is participating in the management of an UST or UST system. In addition, to address those other activities not specifically listed, a general test of management participation is proposed. The general test specifies that a holder is considered to be participating in management, within the scope of this proposed regulatory exemption, when it exercises decisionmaking control over the borrower's UST or UST system, or where the holder assumes overall management responsibility encompassing decisionmaking authority over the enterprise that includes day-to-day operation of the UST or UST system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed rule, activities that are evidence that a holder is participating in the management of an UST or UST system, and thus acting outside the scope of this proposed regulatory exemption, include: Exercising management control or decisionmaking authority over operational aspects of an UST or UST system, or securing a lease agreement, contractual arrangement, or employee relationship with any other person to manage or operate the UST or UST system. Such activities indicate that a holder is involved in or exercising decisionmaking control of operations of the UST or UST system in which the holder has a security interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of this proposed rule, a holder performing the functions of a plant manager, operations manager, chief operating officer, chief executive officer, and the like, of the facility or business at which the UST is located is considered to be exercising management control or decisionmaking authority over the operational aspects of the UST or UST system and therefore, participating in management, unless the responsibilities for the position specifically exclude all UST responsibilities. Control over the operational aspects of management should not be confused, however, with those activities which constitute administrative or financial management or involvement in non-operational activities. Such activities may be engaged in by a holder in the course of managing a loan portfolio and do not exceed the boundaries of the security interest exemption. Such activities may include providing financial or other assistance, environmental investigations or monitoring of the borrower's business and collateral, engaging in ``loan work out'' activities, foreclosing on a secured UST or UST system, winding down operations following foreclosure or its equivalents, or divesting itself of the foreclosed-on property containing an UST or UST system. These, as well as other actions related to a holder's financial and administrative obligations, are discussed in more detail in the following section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General Test of Management Participation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . It is not possible to specifically cover in this proposed rule or any regulation every conceivable situation in which a holder might act, or to make specific provisions for every action that a holder might undertake that might make it ineligible for the protection of the proposed security interest regulatory exemption, voiding the security interest exemption. A general test or standard of participation in an UST or UST system's management has therefore been formulated to provide a framework within which to assess the consistency of a holder's actions with the limitations of the proposed regulatory exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposal's two-prong test or standard of management participation provides that while the borrower is still in possession of an UST or UST system (i.e., pre-foreclosure), a holder participates in the management of an UST or UST system only where the holder either exercises decisionmaking control over the UST or UST system, or where the holder's actions manifest or assume responsibility for the overall management of the UST or UST system's day-to-day operations. The general test adopts a functional approach which focuses on the holder's actual decisionmaking involvement in the operational (as opposed to the financial or administrative) affairs of the borrower's UST or UST system. The first prong looks to whether the holder has exercised decisionmaking control over the borrower's environmental compliance. If so, the holder is ``participating in the management'' of the UST or UST system as defined in the proposed rule. Similarly, the second prong looks to where the holder is functioning as the overall manager by exercising management at a level encompassing the borrower's environmental obligations, or over all or substantially all of the operational aspects of the borrower's enterprise, regardless of whether decisionmaking control over compliance with the regulations governing the UST or UST system has been explicitly assumed or not. This level of actual involvement in the management of the UST or UST system is sufficient to constitute management participation for purposes of this proposed regulatory exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the first prong of the general test, a holder cannot remain within the scope of the exemption if it controls the borrower's environmental compliance activities associated with the UST or UST system. Under the second prong of the general test, the ability to carve out environmental compliance responsibilities from other operational aspects of the borrower's business or enterprise demonstrates that the holder has manifested or assumed operational responsibility at a management level that includes environmental matters, and in doing so is considered to be participating in the UST or UST system's management. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, management participation does not include the unexercised right to become involved in operational UST or UST system decisionmaking. In other words, if the holder does not exercise its rights to participate in the management of the UST or UST system, it still may qualify for the security interest exemption. Whether the exercise of rights that a holder might have_whether under contract or other agreement (if any) or otherwise, including the enforcement of loan terms and covenants or other rights_rises to the level of participation in the UST or UST system's management is measured by reference to the general test. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: EVC sees flotation value of up to Fl 1.2bn EVC, Europe's leading manufacturer of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), yesterday forecast its forthcoming flotation on the Amsterdam stock exchange would value the group at between Fl 1bn and Fl 1.2bn (Dollars 595m-Dollars 718m), although losses this year could reach Fl 500.1m. The Dutch-based Anglo-Italian joint venture, owned by ICI of the UK and Enichem of Italy, blamed the likely losses on extraordinary items totalling Fl 477.4m - mainly due to a Fl 243.5m write-down on fixed assets and Fl 76.3m of rationalisation costs. On a pro-forma basis the company said it expected to make operating profits of Fl 88.3m, reversing three successive years of losses. Mr Peter Hollins, director of EVC's polymers division, said the improvement at the operating level had been driven by increased demand for PVC and cost savings at its manufacturing plants. While predicting further rationalisation benefits, he warned that increasingly strict environmental regulations could slow growth in demand. The group's preliminary prospectus, published yesterday, shows that demand for PVC has been flat or falling in the past four years, although it expects it to increase 1.8 per cent this year. Mr Hollins said there had been a positive response from institutional investors, which will be offered 7.2m of the 9m shares being issued. The company predicted the offer price would be between Fl 70 and Fl 80 a share. The offer is expected to raise up to Fl 720m, which will be used to reduce group borrowing to Fl 296.2m - equivalent to gearing of 28 per cent. ICI and Enichem will each retain 19.24 per cent of the newly floated group, and both have undertaken not to sell their stakes before 1996. EVC, meanwhile, will be locked into supply contracts with its parent companies for more than 80 per cent of its raw materials.</p>

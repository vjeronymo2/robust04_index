			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: 2 BARRIOS: KNIVES GIVE WAY TO GUNS  </P> <P> When my sister was in junior high school she came home one afternoon, crying  and frightened. She told my mother that two older girls, also students, had  pulled knives on each other in the back of the bus and had gotten into a fight.  </P> <P> No blood was shed. The bus driver broke it up. My sister didn't want to go back  to school, but my mother said she had no choice.  </P> <P> She had to ride the bus because our family of nine had only one car, and my  father needed it for work.  </P> <P> The rest of us were concerned with how my sister, the oldest, would fare in the  following days. But nothing terrible happened to her, or to us.  </P> <P> This was south Texas in the early 1960s. There were tough words and knives and  cool nicknames and cigarettes dangling from the lips of hip-talking girls with  teased hairdos. Guys tended to grease their hair into pompadours.  </P> <P> But there weren't any automatic weapons or innocent victims of drive-by  shootings or drug dealing or even drug use, as far as I knew.  </P> <P> Switch to Southern California, Orange County, almost three decades later. A  17-year-old is gunned down at a pay phone. An 8-year-old boy is seriously  injured when the bullet from another drive-by shooting tears through him and  grazes a woman sleeping in the same house. A 15-year-old boy is killed outside  another party.  </P> <P> Police in Santa Ana double the number of officers assigned to go after gang  members. On weekends, they send out officers to pick up youths who look  suspicious.  </P> <P> My newspaper writes stories about a community alarmed about gang violence. I  write about it too.  </P> <P> But do I understand it? I don't.  </P> <P> Last week, at the funeral of Cesar Salgado, a 15-year-old who died from a  bullet wound, a group of girls, friends of his, approached me when I was  talking with some of Cesar's male friends.  </P> <P> "Just don't say lies about us," one of them said, almost threatening.  </P> <P> Just because some of them dressed the same, walked the same, talked the same,  didn't make them all criminals, she said.  </P> <P> More than anything, I think she was talking about stereotyping people and  neighborhoods. I remember that. I recall overhearing some kid in the  predominantly Anglo school that I attended saying that you had to ride in an  armored tank if you were going to go down Main Drive, the street where I grew  up.  </P> <P> That's funny, because what I remember about my barrio is springtime, when  mothers would pile cut flowers from their own yards in their daughters' arms,  so that we could walk in a procession, singing songs in Spanish, to the church  down the street.  </P> <P> I can't recall a single white-collar worker among the parents on Main Drive.  For the most part, the people who lived there were trying to do the best they  could for themselves and for their families.  </P> <P> The two girls at the back of that bus that day may have been La Susi and La  Gata, two toughs from our neighborhood. They went on to other fights in other  places. They never graduated from high school, as far as I can remember. Their  boyfriends, also our neighbors, were involved in fights too, sometimes at  wedding dances, or Quinceaneras -- 15th birthday party celebrations.  </P> <P> Tires were slashed at these dances sometimes. The adults -- my parents'  generation -- worried about the turf fights between the Main Drive boys and  rival bands of youths from Clarkwood or McNorton, other nearby barrios. They  worried it gave the rest of us a bad name and a bad time.  </P> <P> I'm sure some folks in the neighborhoods where some of these recent shootings  occurred in Santa Ana feel the same way.  </P> <P> I have talked with people in this county who work with youths, dynamic  community leaders who are coming up with innovative ways to combat what is  infecting a whole generation in certain neighborhoods.  </P> <P> It has to do with lack of self-esteem, they say, no one believing in some of  these kids, a leadership vacuum that is being filled by thugs instead of  positive role models. I understand some of that.  </P> <P> And, of course, there is the peer pressure to belong.  </P> <P> At Cesar's funeral, a woman my age, who graduated from Santa Ana High School  and now works at a bank, said she didn't approve of the kids we saw dressed  alike in their matching black sweat shirts or white T-shirts, and the girls  they hung with.  </P> <P> But she remembered the tremendous pressure all of her life to become like them.  When she was a student at Cal State Fullerton, she recalled, other Chicanos at  parties would inevitably ask, "Who do you claim? Who do you claim?" Which gang  did she affiliate with, in other words.  </P> <P> The idea of belonging to such a group can be at once seductive and  intimidating.  </P> <P> But kids killing kids? Who can understand that?  </P></p>

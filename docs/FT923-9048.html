			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Mexico awards big contract as Nafta deal nears THE Mexican finance ministry has announced a Dollars 500m contract for computer services - the largest awarded in this sector - to Systemshouse, an Ottawa-based company with offices also in the US. It is this kind of deal the US and Canadian governments are counting on to illustrate how jobs are to be created across borders by a North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Negotiations on the pact were still continuing yesterday in Washington, but the real sales jobs - to the US and Canadian publics - are yet to come. President George Bush has the additional task of convincing a Democratic Congress that not only will Nafta benefit the US economy but that it also contains sufficient safeguards for US workers and the environment. Congress has constitutional jurisdiction over trade, but it ceded initial control to President Bush in June, 1991, when it gave him 'fast-track' negotiating authority. A completed deal will set in motion a complicated procedure which, in theory, means that Congress will vote yea or nay on legislation needed to implement an agreement. Because of widespread fear that jobs would be lost to Mexico, the president's request for fast-track authority was highly controversial. It was granted only after he made concessions and promised an adjustment package for displaced workers and the inclusion of environmental provisions. The usual procedure for fast-track is as follows. After a pact is agreed, the president gives Congress at least 90 calendar days' notice of his intention to enter into the agreement. During that time, all relevant committees - and there are many - would hold hearings. Nafta would then be signed by the countries' three leaders and returned to Congress for 90 legislative days. Then administration, congressional and private sector representatives would meet to write implementing legislation. This includes a formal acceptance of the pact and any legislation needed to fulfil its terms. However, the fast-track procedure was established by rules of both houses. Key Democrats have argued that they can change those rules and will do so if the president does not produce satisfactory labour and environment provisions. This would allow them to make amendments. Mr Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, last week raised a ruckus, when he warned that he would write controversial provisions into the implementing legislation. (This was done in the case of the US-Canada Free Trade Agreement in 1987.) It can be assumed that no deal could get past him, but he is also known to be a willing compromiser, who starts the negotiating process with tough demands. In any case, it is being suggested that the Bush administration will initial a Nafta deal to reap its political benefits but hold off sending it to Capitol Hill until a new Congress convenes next year.</p>

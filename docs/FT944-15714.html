			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / International Company News: US satellite TV group looks to Europe Hughes Communications,the main backer of the DirecTV satellite television system in the US, is believed to be interested in expanding into Europe. Preliminary approaches have been made to the two satellite television operators in Europe, Eutelsat and SES, the Luxembourg-based organisation that runs the Astra satellite system. Both organisations have satellites due to be launched within the next few weeks but both are understood to be full. SES plans to launch a fifth satellite in July 1995 which will probably offer digital services and Eutelsat intends to launch a digital satellite in 1996. Interspace, a specialist newsletter, said yesterday that Hughes was interested in trying to launch direct-to-the home satellite television services to European countries not well served by satellite television, such as Italy, Spain and eastern Europe.</p>

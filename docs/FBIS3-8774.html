			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At the end of his visit to Poland, Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia,  said that economic arguments favor the formation of a great Slav  community, in which Poland would also take part.    [Reporter Andrzej Kruszynski] I have visited all of the Slav  countries from Poland to Bulgaria, the Russian politician said,  and everywhere I saw stagnation, factories not working. Now,  when the ideological system has collapsed, we can transfer the  resources that until now have been earmarked for armaments to  meet the economic needs. It is easier for us Slavs to reach an  understanding because our languages are so close. At the same  time, we will spend less on transportation in trade between us  than in trade with the West.    Economic issues, including the strengthening of links  between  the banking structures of Poland and Russia, were discussed  during meetings of the Russian politician with business  representatives and, as he described it, with politicians of the  new Poland. According to Zhirinovskiy, they are politicians from  outside the present political setup. However, he declined to  name them.</p>

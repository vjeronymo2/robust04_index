			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUNIOR HIGH STUDENT WHO STABBED TEACHER GIVEN 8-YEAR SENTENCE  </P> <P> A ninth-grade student convicted of stabbing his Olive Vista Junior High School  teacher in the back when she attempted to discipline him during class was  sentenced Thursday to the California Youth Authority for eight years.  </P> <P> The 15-year-old youth was convicted last month of assault with a deadly weapon  on a school employee after admitting to the March 6 stabbing of his English  teacher, Cynthia Edwards, 37, of Palmdale. A 3-inch knife was embedded to the  hilt in the back of Edward's shoulder.  </P> <P> She was hospitalized for five days after the incident, and prosecutors said  Thursday that she may never return to work because of the physical and  psychological damage she has suffered.  </P> <P> Before the youth's sentencing in Sylmar Juvenile Hall, Deputy Dist. Atty. Craig  R. Richman read a letter that Edwards had written to the court:  </P> <P> "I am still enraged and frustrated when I think of such a senseless act that  has plunged my life down a rather nebulous path toward the future," the letter  read. "Am I bitter? Am I angry? Yes. My career has possibly gone. Fifteen years  of dedicated teaching has been violently pre-empted because a young man did not  want to accept a meager punishment . . . for his disruptive behavior in class."  </P> <P> Edwards, who has had only limited use of her right hand since the attack,  wrote: "I am still in the initial recuperative stages, psychologically and  physically, of my victimization in this mishap."  </P> <P> Edwards had called the boy to the front of the classroom after he had disturbed  other students discussing Homer's "The Odyssey" by using profanity. The teacher  was writing a referral slip to send the boy to another room for the remainder  of the class when he walked up behind her and stabbed her in the back.  </P> <P> The boy showed no emotion as Judge Morton Rochman pronounced sentence at the  end of the two-hour hearing attended by the youth's parents and three sisters.  Although committed for a maximum detention time of eight years at a California  Youth Authority facility, a prison for young people, the boy could be eligible  for parole in two to four years, authorities said.  </P> <P> The boy's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Mark R. Frazin, expressed  disappointment with the judge's decision to send his client to a Youth  Authority facility. "The judge was responding to pressure from the public and  not the needs of the minor," Frazin said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Counseling Urged  </P> <P> Earlier, Frazin argued that the boy needed extensive psychological counseling  and should be placed in another, less severe county-run facility, where he  could receive such help.  </P> <P> During the hearing, Frazin called several witnesses, including two Olive Vista  Junior High School teachers, to testify on his client's behalf.  </P> <P> Michael Williams, a physical education teacher, said that he had known the boy  only a short time but that "he was always concerned about improving himself and  becoming a better athlete."  </P> <P> Teacher Rochele Minutella said she had known the youth for three years and had  a close relationship with him. Minutella described the boy as "very loving and  warm."  </P> <P> Minutella said the boy had come to her before the stabbing and complained to  her about Edwards, saying that the teacher was harassing him. Minutella said  that the boy "asked for help to get out" of Edwards' class but that the "school  didn't respond to his need for help."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Not a Violent Person'  </P> <P> She said when the boy came to her immediately after the stabbing and told her  what he had done, "I didn't believe him because he is not a violent person."  </P> <P> However, Richman said, since the youth was taken into custody, he has engaged  in several fights with Juvenile Hall employees.  </P> <P> Richman said that on April 7 the boy allegedly threatened to kill staff members  when he is finally released from custody. In another incident on April 20, the  boy had to be restrained from hitting employees, Richman said.  </P></p>

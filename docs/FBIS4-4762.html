			<p>BFN     [Text] China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations  (ASEAN) will establish two committees to strengthen their  cooperation on economic/trade and science/technology, Foreign  Minister Prasong Sunsiri said yesterday.    He made the disclosure after emerging from an hour-long  discussion with visiting Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Tang  Jiaxuan. The two ministers discussed a wide range of issues in  both bilateral and regional aspects.    Sqn Ldr [Squadron Leader] Prasong reaffirmed to the Chinese  envoy that Thailand would not invite Taiwan to the ASEAN  Regional Forum (ARF) as Thailand strictly followed the "one  China policy".    "I told the Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister that China  should  not be worried about a report that Taiwan would join the ARF  meeting because Taiwan is not regarded as a sovereign state," he  said.    Thailand is scheduled in July to host the ARF where the six  ASEAN countries and their seven dialogue partners, two  consultative partners and three observers would talk about  regional security issues. China holds a consultative status  with ASEAN.    During yesterday's talk, Mr Jiaxuan mentioned that China did  not think that any economic sanctions against North Korea would  solve the problem on the Korean peninsula, a senior foreign  minister official said.    Mr Jiaxuan earlier in the morning held the annual bilateral  meeting with Permanent-Secretary for Foreign Affairs Pracha  Khunakasem.</p>

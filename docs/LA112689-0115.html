			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> PENGUIN FANS WANT MORE FOR THE MONEY;  </P> <P> NHL: CRITICS SUGGEST THAT MARIO LEMIEUX'S RICH CONTRACT IS THE ROOT OF HIS DROP  IN PRODUCTION.  </P> <P> The first seven weeks of the National Hockey League season have been unsettling  for Pittsburgh center Mario Lemieux, with critics suggesting that his new $12  million, five-year contract has made him complacent.  </P> <P> Lemieux's production has fallen alarmingly, his 40-point total putting him  second in the NHL and five points behind Wayne Gretzky of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> That's bad? Well, it is by Lemieux's standards. After 21 games last year he had  56 points, despite missing two games because of an injured wrist. Lemieux  finished the season with 199 points and captured his second straight scoring  title.  </P> <P> Concerned by the dropoff -- his goal total has tumbled from 22 to 11 -- and an  apparent lack of energy, Lemieux wondered about his physical condition and  underwent a battery of tests, which revealed nothing untoward.  </P> <P> About the same time, Lemieux let it be known that he was unhappy with Coach  Gene Ubriaco's decision to tighten up the Penguins' defensive play.  </P> <P> Lemieux also continually found himself with different wingers as Ubriaco sought  a productive combination. So Lemieux said: "It takes time to adapt. Most NHL  teams have one or two set lines and then, if they don't work for a while, they  switch."  </P> <P> Those criticisms were translated in some quarters as a demand to management to  trade him or get rid of Ubriaco. Lemieux, who recently moved into a new mansion  in Pittsburgh and insists he loves the city, denied such sentiments.  </P> <P> If nothing else, the rumors of trouble woke up the Penguins, who won three  straight games for the first time this season before dropping a 6-3 decision to  New Jersey on Wednesday night.  </P> <P> Lemieux has recorded at least one point in his last 10 games and he had a goal  in five straight until Saturday's 5-3 victory over the New York Islanders.  </P> <P> Still, things have not turned completely around, and the favored Penguins might  have a lot of trouble finishing first in the Patrick Division.  </P> <P> A major problem has been the failure of the Penguins' special teams. Last  season Pittsburgh set an NHL record of 120 power-play goals and connected 21  times while shorthanded. Lemieux had 31 goals and 49 assists with the extra  man, as well as 13 shorthanded scores.  </P> <P> This season the Penguins have recorded only 20 power-play goals, three by  Lemieux. They rank last in the NHL in penalty killing, allowing 29 extra-man  goals in 99 opportunities. They have yet to score shorthanded but have given up  a league-leading six shorthanded goals.  </P> <P> Lemieux is not the only player struggling. Rob Brown, a 49-goal scorer last  season, has managed only six, ending a three-week drought with a goal  Wednesday. Andrew McBain, obtained from Winnipeg in a six-player deal in June,  has two goals, after netting 37 last season. Both are right wings, but Ubriaco  tried them at center in an effort to escape the doldrums.  </P> <P> Although defenseman Paul Coffey has been flying in the last few games, the  Penguins are sadly lacking in overall team speed. Sending Dave McLlwain to  Winnipeg and losing Dave Hannan to Toronto in the waiver draft compounded that  problem.  </P> <P> With goalie Tom Barrasso (wrist surgery) and defenseman Zarley Zalapski  (fractured collarbone) on long-term disability, the Penguins have struggled in  their end of the ice. But the New York Rangers and Philadelphia have overcome  far greater losses.  </P> <P> Most of the blame for the Penguins' problems probably should fall on the  shoulders of General Manager Tony Esposito. His trades have cost the team speed  and defensive ability and his decision to rehire Ubriaco for two years -- after  the chaos that typified last season -- has been criticized.  </P> <P> "I know I have to get things rolling," Esposito said. "We have to win. That's  the bottom line. I've been in this business long enough to know we have to turn  this around now."  </P> <P> The three-game winning streak provided some breathing space. But the Penguins  cannot afford a relapse. The fans who last year chanted "Sign Mario" could  easily be inspired to alter their message to "Espo must go," so recently  effective against his brother, Phil, in New York.  </P> <P> Still Lemieux is the man who ultimately is responsible for getting the Penguins  on a winning course. He is the one whose sensational play turned a largely  empty Civic Arena (6,839 average in pre-Lemieux 1983-84) to the current  virtually automatic sellout of 16,015. And he is the one who is getting the big  bucks to keep the puck rolling.  </P> <P> "Hopefully I'm going to be in Pittsburgh a long time ... the rest of my life,"  Lemieux said after signing his blockbuster contract. "All I want to do in the  next five years is keep improving and build a championship team here."  </P> <P> Presumably those sentiments still prevail today.  </P></p>

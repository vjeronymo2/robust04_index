			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / TGWU confirms merger proposal LEADERS OF the TGWU general workers' union yesterday officially confirmed plans for a merger with the GMB general union. The formal announcement follows months of speculation about a courtship between the two unions, which have a combined membership of 2m across British industry. Mr Bill Morris, TGWU general secretary, said: 'There is a clear industrial logic for the T&amp;G and the GMB to work towards a merger.' Mr Morris said he hoped the merger would take place far sooner than Mr John Edmonds, GMB general secretary, has suggested. Mr Edmonds said he did not expect to see the two unions still separate at the end of the century. The announcement is a response to the financial difficulties all unions face. The TGWU last year spent Pounds 11m more than its income. Unions in the rail, coal and electricity industries are considering a joint campaign to protest against what they see as threats to jobs - from privatisation, pit closures and generating electricity from gas.</p>

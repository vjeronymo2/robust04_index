			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Observer: Margin of error South Africa's ultra-right Conservative Party is fighting for its life in next week's referendum; should it or should it not end apartheid? But one can be forgiven for wondering whether all hearts are really in it; a leading Conservative MP, Koos van der Merwe - the party's spokesman on many a television debate - has placed a private bet that his party will lose the referendum by a large margin. The Johannesburg office of the BBC is running a sweepstake on the poll, which pits the ruling National Party in the 'yes' camp, against the Conservatives who urge a 'no' vote. Van der Merwe bet that the Yeses would have it, by 58 to 42 per cent.</p>

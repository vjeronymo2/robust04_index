			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> MAYORAL CANDIDATES SEEK DOUBLE VOTES  </P> <P> In the barrage of mailers going out to Anaheim residents in these last days  before Tuesday's election there's an added plea from the two mayoral  candidates: Don't just vote once, vote twice.  </P> <P> "Vote TWICE for Fred Hunter on Nov. 6," read Hunter's ads, with two squares  marked, one for mayor and one for City Council.  </P> <P> "Elect for Mayor, Irv Pickler, Re-elect for City Council, Irv Pickler,"  declares another campaign mailer, with two examples of two sample ballot boxes  checked.  </P> <P> Under Anaheim's election laws, the mayor must be a member of the City Council.  Hunter's and Pickler's council terms expire this year.  </P> <P> For voters who want to support one of those candidates for mayor, they need to  mark the ballot twice for the same candidate -- once for the candidate's  council seat and once for the mayor's seat.  </P> <P> But what happens if one candidate wins the mayoral contest but fails to win a  council seat?  </P> <P> "If the person who receives the highest amount of votes for mayor is not  elected to a City Council position, the mayoral election is declared a nullity,  and the City Council would then appoint a mayor," said City Atty. Jack L.  White.  </P> <P> White said that situation has never arisen in past elections, and that voters  seem to have a grasp of the complex ballot.LISA MASCARO  </P></p>

			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Copper leads rally in base metals THE COPPER market led most London Metal Exchange contracts to higher ground this week as a cut in US interest rates gave added impetus to the existing upward trend. In advancing by Pounds 46.75 to Pounds 1,315.25 a tonne for three months metal copper continued to defy the bearish influence of sterling's strength against the dollar. After adjusting for that factor the rise on the week works out at Pounds 58 a tonne. A morning bout of profit-taking had been absorbed before the price reached that level, the highest for three months in sterling terms and for 18 months in dollar terms. Encouraging copper's rise was news that a strike could start at Poland's KGHM combine on July 20, although that was countered by the agreement of a labour contract at Asarco of the US. Another bullish influence was the threat of supply tightness developing later this month and in September and this was reflected in the short-lived establishment yesterday of a 'backwardation' - a price premium for cash over metal for forward delivery. The copper market's improved sentiment spilled over into other metals, notably aluminium and nickel, the former's three months position ending the week Dollars 69.75 up at Dollars 1,347.25 a tonne and the latter's Dollars 423 up at Dollars 7,719 a tonne. But some traders were dubious about the sustainability of this trend. Mr Angus MacMillan, analyst with Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, thought copper's present price could be justified but saw no good reason for aluminium or nickel prices to be buoyant as both markets were still suffering from substantial imports from the CIS. The only LME market to sustain price falls this week was zinc, which continued to reflect the unwinding of the options-related supply squeeze that prompted the exchange to impose nearly three weeks ago a descending ceiling on the one-day backwardation during the June/July period. The cash price rose with the other base metals on Monday, reaching a 20-month high of Dollars 1,391.50 a tonne, but then went into reverse. By yesterday's close it was showing a Dollars 56 fall on the week at Dollars 1,300 a tonne and its premium over the three months price, which had reached Dollars 189 a tonne before the LME acted to end the squeeze, had shrunk by another Dollars 42 to Dollars 15.50 a tonne. Platinum was the star performer in the precious metals market, with the price fixed yesterday afternoon at Dollars 386 a troy ounce, up Dollars 19 on the week. On Thursday it had reached a 13-month high of Dollars 387.90 an ounce. The chief factor behind the rise was concern about the situation in South Africa, which accounts for about 70 per cent of the world's platinum supplies. Although analysts thought the unrest was unlikely to result in a miners' strike they said the possibility made it too risky to go short during the present rally. Mr Andy Smith, analyst at the Union Bank of Switzerland, had serious doubts about the price rise, however. He thought the market was not taking sufficient account of weakening Japanese economic activity and suggested that Thursday's 0.5 per cent cut in the US discount rate 'smells of panic in the face of a slowing US economy,' and was therefore negative for the platinum price. He said the discount rate cut was positive for gold, which rose Dollars 2.35 this week to Dollars 346 an ounce, but added that a rising gold price would stimulate selling by producers and stockholders. At the London Futures and Options Exchange the cocoa market put in its strongest performance of the year so far as producers resisted the temptation to sell into a technical rally. Dealers saw the rise, which lifted the September position by Pounds 55 to Pounds 590 a tonne, mainly as a reaction against the 16 1/2 -year lows reached last week. The rally appeared to have run out of steam on Thursday, when a small setback was registered, but after a shaky start yesterday the upward trend was resumed and the September price ended Pounds 15 up on the day. Further talks on the renegotiation of an International Cocoa Agreement with price stabilisation clauses, are to start on Monday in Geneva. Coffee prices also moved ahead, encouraged by US investment fund buying, before slipping back yesterday in thin trading. London's September futures position closed yesterday at Dollars 717 a tonne, down Dollars 5 on the day but Dollars 31 up on the week.  ------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  ------------------------------------------- (As at Thursday's close)  ------------------------------------------- tonnes Aluminium  +13,150 to 1,300,525 Copper      -1,125 to   259,125 Lead        +1,625 to   144,650 Nickel        -546 to    27,750 Zinc        +1,400 to   332,050 Ti         n  +610 to    13,400  -------------------------------------------</p>

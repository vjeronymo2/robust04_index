			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow subdued as Toronto aims at 4,000 Wall Street US stock markets ended a difficult week in subdued fashion yesterday, with share prices little changed across the board in light trading, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.28 at 3,490.89. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 0.98 higher at 447.60, while the Amex composite ended down 0.42 at 430.578. The Nasdaq composite put in the best performance, ending 6.08 higher at 694.80. Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange was only 206m shares. A week in which the markets posted both losses and gains ended on a flat note. Investors and dealers mostly ignored the overnight news that President Clinton's deficit-reduction economic package had narrowly passed the Senate, because the plan is likely to face further changes before it finally emerges from Congress, probably in August. The day's only economic news was positive  - the National Association of Realtors announced that sales of existing single-family homes rose by 4.6 per cent last month, a bigger increase than analysts had expected. Signs of strength in the housing market, however, failed to stimulate buying interest in the equity markets, which remained dogged by concerns about corporate earnings. The second quarter reporting season is expected to start in earnest within the next two weeks. Bond prices were also subdued, although the upward momentum in longer-dated Treasury securities was maintained. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  11/32 at 105 3/8 , and the yield was down to 6.702 per cent, close to its all-time low. Profits warnings continued to affect certain stocks. Hershey Foods slumped Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 47 1/8 after the company said that its second quarter earnings could be 5-10 cents below the 34 cents a share it earned as operating income a year ago. Airline stocks continued to suffer from a renewed air fares war and recent warnings of slowing sales from the industry, although declining oil prices have given the sector some support. AMR, parent of American Airlines, fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 61 7/8 , Delta dropped Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 47 3/8 , UAL Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 121 3/8 and USAir Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 16. Precious metals and mining stocks were firmer in the wake of higher gold prices. Newmont Mining climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 51 3/4 , Newmont Gold put on Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 45 3/4 , ASA added Dollars 1 at Dollars 47 3/4 , Homestake Mining edged Dollars  3/8 higher to Dollars 19 and Pegasus Gold rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 22 3/4 on the American Stock Exchange. Canada TORONTO ended the week on a winning note. Based on preliminary data, the TSE-300 index was up 12.19 points to 3,991.77 after briefly breaching the 4,000 mark. On the week, the index rose about 85 points. Volume fell to 70.813m shares from 80.227m shares on Thursday and trading value was CDollars 777.8m against CDollars 919.1m. Golds rose 2.11 per cent and banking stocks increased 1.18 per cent. Energy was also higher: Westcoast Energy rose  3/8 to 20 1/2 and Northstar Energy jumped 2 1/4 to 30 3/4.</p>

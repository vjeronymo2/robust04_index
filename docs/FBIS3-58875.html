The letter was  given to the press yesterday but was embargoed until 1200 today.    In the letter, Denktas said that the Turkish Cypriot side is  ready to cooperate with the UN secretary general in reaching an  agreement on the confidence-building measures, which it accepts  in principle. Denktas pointed out that in order to achieve this  aim, he is ready to start negotiations with Greek Cypriot leader  Kliridhis. We think it will be beneficial to hold the  negotiations in Lefkosa [Nicosia], Denktas said.    The president told the UN secretary general that the  government program which was approved by the Turkish Cypriot  Republican Assembly anticipated that he, Denktas, be the  negotiator, and that he has accepted this task. We are pleased,  Denktas says, that the UN secretary general shares the  understanding of the Turkish Cypriot side regarding the  confidence-building measures. We have observed, he adds, that  the various understandings and concepts which we meticulously  emphasize are also included in the reports the secretary general  submits to the Security Council.    President Denktas stressed that the measures to be  implemented should not eliminate the limited means of the  Turkish Cypriot side, that the arrangements to be made in  connection with Maras [Varosha] and the Lefkosa [Nicosia]  International Airport should help lift the embargoes against the  Turkish Cypriots, and that sanctions should be imposed on the  side that undermines the interests created by the implementation  of the measures.    Denktas said in his letter that the fenced area of Maras  which are to be given over to UN rule should be areas of contact  and cooperation fitting the two communities' common interests.  If the Turkish Cypriot side is prevented from benefiting from  Lefkosa International Airport, Denktas said, then this region  should be returned to Turkish Cypriot rule.    The president pointed out that one of the basic principles  on  which both sides agreed during the negotiating process was that  a comprehensive solution should be sought by discussing the  issue with all its aspects as a whole. It is obvious, Denktas  said, that the approach to implement measures that will build  confidence between the two sides will not change this basic  principle. He added that the United Nations also admits that  the confidence-building measures aim to reach a comprehensive  solution easier.    Denktas said: I would like to stress that we have noted the  guarantees in your reports saying that partial agreements will  not be posited in the future, during our search for a  comprehensive solution.    Denktas recalled that as cited in the 13th paragraph of the  secretary general's report of 1 July 1993, the aim of the  confidence-building measures is not to grant political  advantages to the sides and that within that framework, the two  sides will not be forced to make political concessions. Also,  Denktas said, the two sides will not be forced to change their  positions regarding each other's political status. The two  sides reserve their positions regarding a comprehensive solution.    Denktas went on to say: On the other hand, I would like to  stress that in our assessment of these measures, we took into  consideration that one of the results of implementing the  measures will be the elimination of the obstacles before the  Turkish Cypriots in the commercial and economic fields, and in  foreign travel.    Denktas stressed that he attaches great importance to the  reassurances the UN secretary general made that the advantages  to the two sides will be important, equal, fitting, and  guaranteed in practical terms.    Denktas said: The Turkish Cypriot side's security  considerations within the framework of the solution of the  Cyprus problem is a vital issue that the United Nations takes  into consideration as well. Whether in connection with measures  that aim to increase mutual confidence, or within the framework  of the search for a comprehensive solution, security is a  priority issue for the Turkish Cypriot side. This security  factor is as valid in connection with the confidence-building  measures on which we now work. The importance we attach to this  issue, particularly in connection with the Maras issue, was  conveyed to the UN secretariat general in a list of questions we  asked on 23 October 1993. Considering the history of the Cyprus  problem, I am convinced that you will attach the necessary  importance to this factor which is of vital importance to the  Turkish Cypriots.    Denktas concluded his letter by saying that he would be  pleased to confer with the secretary general by accepting the  invitation he will extend to him at an appropriate time.</p>

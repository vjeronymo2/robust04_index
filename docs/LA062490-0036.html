			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAVE A SEAT, BABY  </P> <P> The Pantages Theater gets a thumbs down. If you go to that theater holding a  6-month-old, sleeping infant, you cannot enter.  </P> <P> They send you back to the box office to buy another seat for the infant.  </P> <P> We were there with our three children to see "Peter Pan," having already bought  five seats at $37.50 each, which the Pantages would not exchange. Rather than  disappoint the children and waste a lot of money, we had to buy the unusable  seat.  </P> <P> I asked why they would do this to patrons. They said "for insurance purposes."  None of the staff could explain what this means.  </P> <P> Insurance purposes or not, an infant must be held on someone's lap and is far  too young to be a member of the audience. We wasted money on an empty seat at  the Pantages.  </P> <P> STEPHEN TESSLER  </P> <P> Arcadia  </P></p>

Following the meeting that lasted for more than one hour,  'Aziz told journalists that his meeting with the secretary  general was beneficial and positive. He added that he briefed  the secretary general on Iraq's position in detail, and  emphasized that the United Nations should fulfill its  obligations toward Iraq because Iraq fulfilled its obligations  toward the United nations.    'Aziz emphasized that the main subject is lifting the siege  on Iraq in accordance with Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687,  especially since Iraq fulfilled all its commitments as  stipulated in this paragraph and in accordance with the text and  spirit of Resolution 687.    The deputy prime minister explained that the Security  Council  should consider this in order to end the suffering of the Iraqi  people. He said he briefed the secretary general on the full  picture of Iraq's cooperation with the United Nations,  especially the Special Commission and the international agencies  operating in Iraq.    'Aziz added that Iraq's relations with the agencies are  good,  and the concerned authorities cooperate with these agencies, and  this is evidence that Iraq is prepared to cooperate with the  international organizations.    'Aziz said Iraq has furnished the evidence of its  cooperation  with the international community, in accordance with UN Charter  and the international law, but some Security Council members  still maintain their hostile position toward Iraq, and they  should respect the Security Council resolutions and the  international law and stop interfering in Iraq's affairs.    The deputy prime minister expressed hope that the  international community and all Security Council members would  study the situation well in order to lift the siege on Iraq.    Tariq 'Aziz also conferred with (Francesco Paolo Voly),  Italian ambassador to the United Nations at his residence in New  York today. 'Aziz is scheduled to meet later with Detlef Graf,  German ambassador to the United Nations, and (Jean Damasan  Besiman), Rwanda's ambassador and Security Council member.</p>

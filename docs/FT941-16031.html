			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Arts: Today's Television So many hostages to fortune are offered up these days before the launch of a major drama series such as BBC2's Middlemarch - Pounds 6m budget, whole towns deprived of television aerials, entire roads camouflaged under 19th century style gravel - that you tremble for the broadcasters in case it isn't a huge triumph. George Eliot's novel has been adapted by Andrew Davies who dramatised 'To Play The King', and the cast includes Michael Hordern, Elizabeth Spriggs and Patrick Malahide (9.00). That is preceded by the first in a new series of Ruth Rosenthal's architecture series, Building Sites, which this time has USA tagged on the title. Today Philip Johnson enthuses over Grand Central Station (8.50). ITV's crime series 99-1 gets into its stride with Leslie Grantham as a discredited policeman going undercover to suss out the criminal underworld (9.00). Dispatches reckons that traces of oestrogen in water supplies may be contributing to infertility. Given the over-population of the world do you suppose they will see this as a good thing? (C4 9.00).</p>

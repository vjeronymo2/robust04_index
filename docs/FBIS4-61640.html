			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [BIZNES-TASS report: "More and More Loss-Makers"] </F>   [Text] The number of loss-making industrial enterprises in  Russia has more than doubled in the first quarter of the year,  the report "On the State of the Russian Economy" prepared by the  Russian Federation Ministry of Economics and obtained by  BIZNES-TASS states. As of late March these include 18.6 percent  of all industrial enterprises -- as opposed to 8.2 percent at  the end of 1993.    The largest percentage of unprofitable enterprises has been  registered in the fuel and energy complex -- 30.7 percent of  them as against 17.2 percent at the start of the year, in second  place is the food industry (20.8 percent as against 5.9  percent), third is metallurgy (17.2 percent as against 4.2  percent), and fourth is machine building (16 percent as against  6.2 percent).    The report stresses that the first quarter of 1994 has been  the period which has seen the most considerable reduction in  industrial output at any time during the course of the reforms  -- which is to a considerable extent related to the intensive  impact of demand constraints on the economy.</p>

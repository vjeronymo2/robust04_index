			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, April 16 (AFP) -- The United Nations  called for NATO air strikes over the UN-declared "safe haven" of  Gorazde, a spokesman said here Saturday [16 April], shortly  after the downing of a NATO jet over the eastern Bosnian Moslem  enclave.    The NATO spokesman said the downed Harrier jump-jet, from  which the pilot reportedly ejected, was shot down during a  "non-offensive" operation over the enclave.</p>

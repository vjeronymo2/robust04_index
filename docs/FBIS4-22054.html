			<p>BFN     [Text] Via a communique, the Mexican Front Against  Governmental Corruption [Frente Mexicano Contra la Corrupcion  Gubernamental -- FMCCG] yesterday claimed resposibility for the  assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio during his visit to the  Lomas Taurinas neighborhood in Tijuana.    Sources within the Mexican Government report that a  document,  which was sent to the editorial staffs of PRENSA HISPANA and  Radio Campesina, both headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona,  indicates that the front was established recently and that it  opposes the president of Mexico, his cabinet, and the PRI  [Institutional Revolutionary Party].    The document states: "The front was created autonomously  through the initiative of members of the government of the  Mexican Republic, members of the Mexican Army, and 7,000 Mexican  `illegal alliens' [indocumentados] now residing in the United  States."    Members of Chicano communities in Arizona, California, and  New Mexico who were questioned about this said they knew nothing  about this new organization. PRENSA HISPANA is a small weekly  distributed among the Mexican-American community and Radio  Campesina belongs to the Peasants Union established by Cesar  Chavez.    The document says Mario Aburto Martinez, who is currently  being held in Almolova in connection with the Colosio slaying,  is a member of this front and was the person who opened fire on  the presidential candidate.    The document says: "The FMCCG (along with its member Aburto  Martinez), weary and desperate because of the alarming economic  situation facing the Mexican people for the past 24 years, is  adopting measures against the government and claims  responsibility for the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio."    The group claims to have deployed death squads throughout  the  country and vows to attack its targets should its demands not be  met.    The document points out: "Over the past six years, we have  prepared ourselves to realize, fight, and die for our ideals by  punishing those politicians who are in power and are using this  power to their advantage to abuse, steal, and commit  injustices." Although the document says members of the group are  willing to die for their cause, it adds, "of course, they will  die before we do."    The five-page document addressed to the Mexican people says  Colosio was the first of several targets, and it adds that the  attack on the politician marked the start of a fight to the  death against the "corrupt traitors of the Mexican Government."    The group warns that there will be no peace in the country  until its demands are met and until the members of the  government change their positions.    The document adds: "All demands must be met or the loss of  thousands of Mexican lives will be inevitable. The only person  responsible for this will be you, Carlos Salinas de Gortari."    Among the front's main demands is the establishment of an  OAS  commission to oversee respect for the human rights of prisoners.  Other demands include the addition to the Constitution of an  article attributing responsibility to and punishing members of  several Mexican governments for crimes of embezzlement and  mismanagement of public funds.    The front wants capital punishment established for "traitors  of the homeland," and it calls for the confiscation of personal  fortunes estimated at $1 billion amassed by former Presidents  Luis Echeverria Alvarez, Jose Lopez Portillo, and Miguel de la  Madrid, as well as by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and  Fidel Velasquez, leader of the CTM [Confederation of Mexican  Workers]. The group also levels charges against former Jalisco  Governor Guillermo Cosio Vidaurri, other former state leaders,  and federal senators and deputies.</p>

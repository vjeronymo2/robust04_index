			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Blue Arrow Verdicts: Five who spent a year and four days before the court GUILTY: Mr Jonathan Cohen, 48, was chief executive of County NatWest during the Blue Arrow affair and noted for his forceful manner. The rapid staff turnover under his leadership earned County a 'revolving door' reputation. Mr Cohen resigned from County in February 1988, moving to Charterhouse, the merchant banking arm of Royal Bank of Scotland, as vice-chairman. He resigned in August 1989 after publication of the DTI report. In court yesterday his counsel revealed for the first time that this resignation had been prompted by the Bank of England. Mr Cohen has since worked as a financial consultant on a freelance basis. Mr David Reed, 44, was head of corporate finance at County throughout the deal but resigned after being criticised in the DTI report. Mr Reed was noted for his forceful style and willingness to push the rules to the limit. At the time of the Blue Arrow deal he was riding the crest of a wave, having sewn up several deals and won a succession of clients. He was a 'home-grown' product of County, having joined the bank in the mid 1970s. He went straight into accountancy after leaving school and worked in Peat Marwick Mitchell's Sydney office before joining County. Mr Nicholas Wells, 37, was the corporate finance director at County who organised the Blue Arrow rights issue. At the time he was tipped as a rising star in merchant banking. Young and pushy, and with an apparent charm, Mr Wells appeared the archetypal corporate financier of his generation. After reading economics at Cambridge he trained as an accountant with Peat Marwick. He went into corporate finance by joining Lazards in 1979, moving to County in 1982. He moved to Barclays de Zoete Wedd in early 1988 but resigned in July 1989 after being criticised in the DTI report. Mr Wells has since worked on a freelance basis for people such as Mr Michael Ashcroft, the ADT chairman. Mr Martin Gibbs, 62, was head of corporate finance at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew at the time of the issue, but was near the end of his career. After almost 20 years with P&amp;D, he was looking forward to retirement, which he took in 1989. Phlegmatic rather than aggressive, Mr Gibbs was seen as typifying the City's old-school style of working, rather than fitting the image of a brazen 'Big Bang' operator. One trial witness said of him that 'he wouldn't park on a double yellow line'. He joined P&amp;D in 1959 as a junior analyst after three years as an accountant with Pannel Kerr Forster. He studied engineering and economics at Cambridge. NOT GUILTY: Mr Christopher Stainforth, 38, was a corporate finance director at P&amp;D helping organise the issue. He resigned from P&amp;D after 10 years following criticisms in the DTI report. Mr Stainforth trained as an accountant with Peat Marwick before moving into corporate finance with Schroders. Since resigning from P&amp;D, Mr Stainforth has been involved in running a number of companies. He intends to relaunch his career in the City.</p>

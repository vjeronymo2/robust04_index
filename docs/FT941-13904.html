			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / How To Spend It: Hello country cousins - What do you need to wear to avoid looking like an untutored townie? Avril Groom advises on how to dress for the great outdoors The country hick in town has been a source of fun for centuries, from The Country Wife to Crocodile Dundee. Less has been made of the reverse situation but now the wellington is on the other foot. Increasingly insulated from rural reality, the town mouse is likely to make sartorial mistakes when faced with the countryside. Country dressing has codes which slowly change and which may no longer fit the townie's stereotyped vision. The owner of a West End country outfitters who divides his time between London and the shires says he now sees far more khaki wax and loden in SW1 than in Wiltshire. The aims of country dressing are to keep warm and dry, and to merge discreetly with the surroundings. There are several ways stylistically to achieve this but all are based on the same principles - the build-up of practical layers to vary depending on the weather. So far, outer layers have mostly exercised the minds of technical fabric experts. A fine membrane of waterproof but 'breathable' Goretex or dry-cleanable Sympatex now lurks, unseen and efficient, inside both traditional tweed shooting coats and casual padded parkas. Tough, Goretex-lined cottons have threatened the supremacy of wax finishes though traditionalists still swear by heavy 'farmer's weight' wax for real rain and thorny terrain, and more colour variety has given these coats a new lease of life. The waterproof leather which Timberland pioneered 20 years ago now makes coats as well as boots and ways of keeping it supple through years of wetting and drying are being developed. The inner layers of all-weather clothing are now coming under scrutiny. Cotton fleece fabrics are popular to provide warmth and filter moisture away from the body, but they are bulky. Fleece finishes are now being applied to thinner cofton knit fabrics to wear as underlayers. So-called thermal underwear has also evolved, with finer, softer fibres, such as silky-feeling Tactel, and a higher aesthetic element. In fashion's current layered mood everything can be on show not least, when the going gets warm, a lace-edged fine-knit 'body' or a ribbed collarless T-shirt. Knickerbox's deep green, lace-trimmed thermals or Levis' dark rib-knits are good country colours. Style is as essential as practicality. The art of country layers is that they should look artless but still as if they belong together. The effect may have taken time and thought to achieve but no-one should ever know this. The easiest way is to pick one of the classic country styles and stick broadly within it, adding one or two surprise elements to prevent stereotyping. For instance, young countryfolk like the pioneer style of padded parkas, chunky sweaters, lumberjack shirts and tough cord or fatigue-style trousers. Break this outfit up with a still-bulky, heraldic-looking sweater based on a point-to-point jockey's jumper, or a soft tartan jacket that conveys more of British tradition than backwoods US. The popular Navajo-style mix of blanket jackets and denim needs sleek, plain suede or Aran-pattern knits to stop it looking like the costume for a B-movie version of Hiawatha. The swathes of knitted layers, mostly cashmere, which the rich favour for country wear need to be in subtle mis-matched neutrals and contrasted with a coarser-textured, bulky overlayer to have the sharp edge of current fashion. And the twills, cords and waxes of English country-house style shape up with a new palette of rich autumn shades and a touch of bold knit pattern or lumberjack check. The quickest way to spot an untutored townie is by the feet. Fine leather shoes well-spattered with mud are inappropriate. People whose dress code demands polished leather can choose Sam Walker's shiny but water-repellent brown boots, or Cole-Haan's robust but elegant-looking styles. The more rugged still choose Timberland or the even tougher French Paraboot, footgear of the French Foreign Legion.</p>

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Merrill Lynch rises 30% to Dollars 221m SHARES in Merrill Lynch, the biggest securities house in the US, rose yesterday after the company reported a 30 per cent improvement in fourth-quarter net income to Dollars 221.4m. Merrill's strong final quarter, which lifted full-year 1992 profits to a record Dollars 952.4m, goes against the grain of recent results from other Wall Street firms, which have been reporting lower earnings for the final three months of last year. After a special Dollars 58.6m charge to cover changes in accounting procedures related to post-retirement benefits, net earnings for last year came to Dollars 893.8m, still far in excess of Merrill's previous record year, which was 1991 when profits totalled Dollars 696.1m. Investors responded positively to Merrill's results yesterday, with buyers lifting the firm's shares more than Dollars 2 in early trading before a late sell-off brought the stock back down to close at Dollars 67 7/8 , showing a net gain of Dollars  7/8 . A breakdown of Merrill's fourth-quarter results revealed the bulk of the improvement in earnings came from a 50 per cent rise in net interest and dividend profit to Dollars 287m, and a 47 per cent jump in 'other' revenues, which included earnings from the firm's port-folio management service, and net gains from investments. The biggest share of Merrill's revenues pie continues to come from brokerage commissions, which rose 5 per cent in the last quarter of 1992 to Dollars 583m as investors continued to shift their funds into equities due to low interest rates. Earnings from principal trading activities rose slightly to Dollars 411m. Merrill said the trading for its own account of swaps and other derivatives, of municipals, foreign exchange and over-the-counter securities all produced higher revenues than last year. In common with the rest of Wall Street, Merrill experienced a downturn in its investment banking business, where revenues fell 4 per cent to Dollars 359m, primarily due to lower levels of debt and equity issuance by corporations in the last few months of 1992. Revenues from asset management and custodial fees rose 6 per cent to Dollars 210m. Over the year, client assets under fee-based management at Merrill grew by 12 per cent to reach Dollars 138bn at year-end. The overall increase in business volume during the quarter meant the firm's non-interest expenses rose 6 per cent to Dollars 1.7bn. The biggest chunk of Merrill's cost-base was taken up by employee compensation and benefits, which rose 7 per cent to Dollars 1.1bn. Japanese closures, Page 23</p>

			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Letter: No massive state support for Air France Sir, We were most surprised to read a letter from Mr Thomas McDonogh (June 24), chairman of an Irish transport users' committee, stating, quite erroneously, that Air France was one of roughly seven airlines in Europe that are 'technically bankrupt'. He also added, erroneously, that 'these national airlines receive massive support from the various governments, a support which is denied to the private sector'. All of this is nonsense. Air France is in no way technically bankrupt. Neither does it receive more support from the French government that any private company would receive from its shareholders. Last year, the French state, which owns 99.4 per cent of Air France shares, decided to participate in a FFr2bn (Pounds 205m) increase of Air France capital as a shareholder's contribution to an Air France Group three-year investment programme worth FFr40bn. This capital increase was reviewed in depth by the European Commission, which ruled that it was not state aid. In other words, it is the normal contribution of a shareholder to the development of his company. FT readers will, I am sure, be interested to know that Air France had not received a capital injection from its shareholders since 1985. On the contrary, since 1984, the airline has paid out FFr1bn to its shareholders in dividends on profits. Francois Eldin, vice-president corporate communications, Air France, Paris</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Inflated hopes No investor likes to miss a turning point. So it was not surprising to see institutions piling in to UK equities yesterday. But it is worth pausing to examine where we are before making too many assumptions about the future. Base rates, after all, are at exactly the same level as at the end of last week. In the meantime, the effective devaluation of sterling, as measured by the Bank of England's trade-weighted index, has been less than 6 per cent. That combination is scarcely enough to produce 0.75 percentage points of extra growth in a full year. The August unemployment figures may now be merely a footnote in history but they were a reminder of quite how bleak the starting point for that boost had become. The 105-point rise in the London market can only be justified on the basis that interest rates will now fall further. Similar assumptions are being factored into gilts, where the short end was up between two and three points yesterday while long-dated paper fell sharply on worries about resurgent inflation. The attraction of further rate cuts is plain. They would pave the way for some badly needed growth. That would make some sense out of the devaluation and take the heat out of the recall of parliament and what promises to be a painful Tory party conference. That the government chose initially only to bring rates back to 10 per cent, however, suggests it may not be in much of a hurry. Perhaps it still hopes forlornly for speedy re-entry to the system. Perhaps it wishes to retain some vestige of anti-inflation credibility. Even outside the system, the UK never managed rates below those of Germany for long. Investors who are betting on a dash for growth could yet be in for a disappointment.</p>

			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Adverts promote fish consumption A Pounds 1m television advertising campaign to promote consumption of fish is being launched this week. The five-week campaign is being run by the Sea Fish Industry Authority, a promotional body funded by levies on fish landings and imports. The authority said the campaign was the first on television since 1988 and aimed to recoup 'two lost years' when it was unable to advertise because of a cut in the levy. Cod, haddock and plaice account for about half of UK fish consumption although 60 varieties of fish and shellfish are available. The authority said, however, that the campaign was not 'geared towards encouraging people to experiment with fish'.</p>

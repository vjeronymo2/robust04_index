			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Taba, 17 Feb (MENA)-- Dr. Nabil Sha'th, head of  the Palestinian delegation to the Taba self-rule negotiations,  stated that the Palestinian and Israeli negotiators have reached  a joint draft agreement on the Palestinian police force.    Speaking to reporters today, Sha'th remarked that certain  points pertaining to the number of this force were not  discussed, but were referred to the Palestinian and Israeli  leadership to adopt a decision on them.    Sha'th described the talks as generally positive, adding  that  considerable progress has been made. We hoped we could reach a  protocol on security issues and another on the transfer of  authority, he said, adding that this will probably be achieved  during the next round of talks next week.    Dr. Sha'th pointed out that the Civilian Affairs Committee  had to conclude its work early today when chief Israeli delegate  Gadi Zohar had to return to Israel, where he has some  engagements. He affirmed, however, that the committee will  finish its work next week.    He added that the Security Committee today discussed  security  arrangements in Gaza and Jericho, as well as on the roads; the  settlements; and the joint patrols within the context of the  Cairo agreement. He hoped all these matters will be settled in  the next round.    Sha'th noted that the subcommittee in charge of the  Palestinian detainees is continuing its work under the  cochairmanship of Muhammad Dahlan and General David Agmon to  draw up a timetable for the release of Palestinians being held  in Israeli jails. [passage omitted]    MENA has learned that the Palestinian and Israeli sides  agreed today to hold the next round of negotiations in Cairo,  contrary to an earlier announcement that the talks would be held  in Taba.</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BUSINESSES SPROUT IN GERMANY  </P> <P> More than 226,000 new private businesses were registered in eastern Germany in  the first 10 months of this year, officials said today.  </P> <P> Klaus Solveen, head of the Economic Ministry's eastern German office in Berlin,  said the creation of new businesses accelerated after East and West Germany  merged their economies on July 1 as a prelude to political union on Oct. 3.  </P> <P> A total of 226,652 businesses were registered by Oct. 31, more than a quarter  of them in the depressed industrial state of Saxony, Solveen told the German  press agency ADN.  </P> <P> About 113,000 of the new businesses were restaurants and retail outlets, while  33,000 were involved in handicrafts and 2,000 were related to tourism.  </P> <P> Revival of small- and medium-sized business in formerly Communist eastern  Germany is viewed as crucial to turning around an economy floundering from mass  shutdowns of state-owned industry.  </P></p>

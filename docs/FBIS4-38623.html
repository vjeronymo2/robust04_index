			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Leonid Kotov] </F>   [Text] New Delhi June 1 TASS -- The Indian armed forces  will receive a large consignment of much needed spare parts for  its military equipment within the next three months, Indian  Minister of State for Defence M. Mallikarjun said here at a  conference of the Indian naval officers.    Supplies will be realized in accordance with contracts  signed  during the visits last month by the Indian military delegation  to Russia and Ukraine. The minister emphasised that shortages  of spare parts creates serious problems in maintaining high  level combat readiness of all kinds of armed forces of India.  They are crucial for the air force, which is equipped with  "MiG-29" fighters, and tank troops, mainly armed with "T-72"  tanks.    At the same time, Mallikarjun recalled that the spare part  problem for the armed forces might be eventually resolved only  by increasing their production in Indian defence enterprises.  The Indian Government has decided to earmark 230 billion rupees  for its requirements this year. A considerable part of this  money will be used to produce military equipment and spare parts  for it at state enterprises of the country.</p>

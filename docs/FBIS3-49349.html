			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 7 Jan -- Sir Leon Brittan, commissioner for  external economic relations and trade policy of the European  Communities, ended his visit to Poland in the 7th of this month.    Brittan was received at dinner by Premier Waldemar Pawlak.  He also held talks with members of the Polish Government,  including Deputy Premier Borowski, Information Minister  Olechowski, and Privatization Minister Kaczmarek. The main  subject of these talks was the future of relations between the  European Union and Poland. The Association Treaty between Poland  and the EC comes into force on 1 February, and Poland will  become a fully fledged partner for the states of the Union.    The commissioner also signed, in the name of the European  Union, a financial memorandum relating to assistance in  implementing a program of promoting and attracting foreign  investment to Poland called INVESTPROM, financed from PHARE  [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] funds at 10  million ecu [European currency units] over three years.    During a press conference at the end of the visit, Brittan  said, among other things, that Poland is continuing a policy of  decisive economic reforms. This has in an unavoidable way  placed great burdens upon society. In addition to granting  advice, the obligation of the Union is to support the process of  reforms both by granting substantive assistance and by  participating in the privatisation of Polish enterprises; also  Polish access to the markets of the Union should be made  possible, although this in significant measure depends upon the  situation in those markets. The Union also expects further  close cooperation with the Polish Government, stressed Brittan.</p>

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Books: A king from the slums - Kevin Henriques on the life of a great clarinettist SWING, SWING, SWING. THE LIFE AND TIMES OF BENNY GOODMAN by Ross Firestone Hodder &amp; Stoughton, Pounds 18.99, 522 pages ROSS Firestone's admirably detailed, adroitly detached and scrupulously fair account of the life of Benny Goodman is far from being the first study of the jazz clarinettist's life but it is likely to be the definitive one. The story of the Jewish boy born in a Chicago slum (along with 11 other Goodmans) who became an internationally known and respected musician, in both the jazz and classical worlds, is the stuff from which Hollywood biopics are made. In fact, one was made. Firestone describes it, accurately, as 'absolutely dreadful,' adding that the storyline was 'patently false.' No similar description can be applied to Firestone's diligent delving into Goodman's life. Admittedly, his childhood is covered rapidly - by page 38, the 16-year-old Benny has his first major engagement (for something like Dollars 100 a week; a fortune for those days) with the band of drummer Ben Pollack in Los Angeles. Thenceforward, Firestone chronicles the almost novel-like career and rags-to-riches life of a complex character whose mercurial behaviour was a constant talking point to his final days. As well as recounting many celebrated incidents with his musicians, almost all of which showed his extreme insensitivity to their feelings - including the famous glare of disapproval on the bandstand known as 'the ray' - Firestone amply covers many other aspects of his character which a novelist would hardly dare to pour into one person. Such curiosities included his enduring search for the perfect reed; his inability to remember the names of his musicians; his offhand treatment of most of the female singers who appeared with his band; the many strains in the relationship with his influential brother-in-law, John Hammond (Goodman married into the Vanderbilt family); and his general remoteness and inability to come to terms with the demands of his fans when he was at the height of his reign as 'king of swing.' Firestone does not attempt to explain Goodman's eccentric, enigmatic behaviour but he does suggest some strong reasons for his quirky character. A demanding human being, Goodman (indisputably a master clarinettist) was intolerant of other people's failings because he was so relentlessly demanding on himself. For him, there was no excuse for anything other than optimum performance. Additionally, he had to live with a recurring back problem which plagued him from the 1940s onwards. Firestone intimates that Goodman was often in pain while performing, another reason for his unpredictable behaviour. Inevitably, the peaks in Goodman's musical career are chronicled faithfully: the success of the big band in the 1930s, followed by the legendary Carnegie Hall concert in 1938; his association with arranger/bandleader Fletcher Henderson, whose writing was a key factor in the Goodman band's success; his study with the British classical clarinettist, Reginald Kell, in the 1950s; and the classic Goodman quartet recordings with vibraphonist Lionel Hampton, pianist Teddy Wilson and drummer Gene Krupa. As far as these are concerned, most readers will be surprised to learn from Firestone that there were personality clashes between the four which added tensions to their later reunions; indeed, these usually were reluctant occasions for all the participants, who had gone on to become major figures in their own domains. The conclusion from this consistently readable biography is that Goodman, like many influential figures in jazz, was a highly complex human being and no outsider, however inquisitive, will ever be able to grasp the core of his many faceted personality. Ross Firestone probably has got as close as anyone ever will.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cajnice, 10 Apr (TANJUG) -- The command of the  Herzegovina Corps today announced that Serb fighters liberated  the villages of Cindici and Zupcici, south of Gorazde, in  yesterday's actions. By liberating these two villages  conditions have been created for units of the Herzegovina Corps  to take control of these important Muslim strongholds in the  area around Uhotic Hill and Bukovo plain, the last remaining  Muslim strongholds on the right bank of the Drina, upstream from  Gorazde.    In order to prevent the withdrawal of members of the 31st  Brigade of the so-called army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, who  suffered a major military defeat in the Cindici area, their  command ordered that the bridge in this village be destroyed.    The command of the Herzegovina Corps claims that Serb army  units engaged in a counteroffensive from the Visegrad direction  are deployed just outside Kopaci, six km downstream from Gorazde.    Serb military sources say that the Muslim army is still  concentrating its forces in the area around Gradina, Volujaca  and Uhotic Hill and that its members -- according to an  imprisoned Muslim soldier -- have been threatened with death if  they lose these strategic points.</p>

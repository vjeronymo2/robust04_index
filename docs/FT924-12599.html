			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / UK Company News: BT begins move into European broadcasting BRITISH Telecommunications has made its first permanent move into the continental European broadcast market through a joint venture with AKK, a German broadcast services company. BT will now be able to compete with Deutsche Telekom for the business of broadcasters wanting satellite links from Germany. As a result of telecommunications deregulation BT has been able to obtain satellite licences in Germany, France and the Netherlands. Mr Steve Maine, BT's director of Visual and Broadcast Services, said the deal was significant 'because it signals the first of a series of initiatives which will see BT expanding its operations throughout the rest of the world. BT has already stationed a fixed satellite aerial at AKK's headquarters in Ludwigshafen. In addition to linking broadcasters in Germany with dedicated satellite capacity on systems such as Intelsat or Eutelsat, BT hopes to apply its expertise in areas of conventional broadcasting. 'Our ultimate goal is to capture some 10 per cent of the German broadcast market,' Mr Maine said. Having started in Germany BT hopes to have a much broader pan-European presence by the end of next year.</p>

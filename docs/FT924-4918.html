			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 30m Birmingham offices plan TARMAC CONSTRUCTION will shortly sign a Pounds 30m design and build contract to develop the former Lewis's department store in Birmingham city centre into an office complex to be known as Temple Court. Overall, the project will cost a total of Pounds 70m. Construction consultants, Wakemans, who are acting as project managers and quantity surveyors for the developers, Richardson Barberry Properties, have confirmed that agreement in principle has been reached with Tarmac. The development is a joint venture between the two Black Country companies, Richardson Developments, of Oldbury, and Barberry House Properties, of Stourbridge. It is intended that work on site will commence before Christmas in order to achieve completion by June 1994. Temple Court will provide 225,000 sq ft of office accommodation above the ground floor, half of which is currently under offer to a leading financial services company. The remainder is to be converted and fitted out with eight county courts, with associated facilities, for purchase by the Lord Chancellor's department. There will be speciality shopping at ground floor with the walk-through Minories being transformed into a spectacular enclosed atrium. Basement car parking will be created for about 200 cars. The design of the scheme is by architects, Peter Hing and Jones, of Birmingham.</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: Akzo bucks trend by maintaining earnings AKZO, the Dutch chemicals group, yesterday posted unchanged profits for the third quarter, bucking the trend of sharply lower earnings which have been reported by many of its European competitors in recent weeks. The company also said it still hoped to post higher full-year net profit before extraordinary items, despite the general economic slowdown and adverse foreign currency movements. Net profit in the third quarter was virtually flat at Fl 162.1m (Dollars 93.7m), compared with Fl 161.5m in the same period of last year. However, net profit for the first nine months rose by 8 per cent to Fl 586.2m. Mr Syb Bergsma, finance director, attributed the company's ability to maintain profits partly to its product mix, which features speciality products not only in the chemicals sector and pharmaceuticals but also in fibres and coatings. Last month, Akzo's Dutch competitor DSM, which is a big producer of base chemicals, reported a decline of more than 50 per cent in third-quarter results. Other factors were greater efficiency following 2,200 job losses since early 1992 and an improved contribution from activities in the US, which accounts for 25 per cent of turnover. Overall, the strength of the guilder against many foreign currencies, particularly the dollar, meant that group turnover fell 3 per cent to Fl 4.0bn, despite a 2 per cent rise in sales volume and a 1 per cent rise in average selling prices. Operating profit showed a small decline to Fl 274m from Fl 279.9m. Coatings, fibres and pharmaceuticals posted slight increases in operating profit but this was not enough to outweigh the fall in chemical products' results to Fl 68m from Fl 91m a year earlier. Akzo's interim dividend was held at Fl 1.50.</p>

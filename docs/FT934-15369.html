			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Aminex in Russian oil venture Aminex, the oil exploration group which is partly owned by Russian shareholders, is in advanced talks on setting up a joint venture in the former Soviet Union with an oil production company. The group, which also announced more than doubled pre-tax losses of IPounds 124,860 (Pounds 119,000), against IPounds 60,415, for the six months to the end of June, said it expected the deal to be completed by the end of the year. Mr Brian Hall, chairman, said Aminex intended to offset any political risk by eventually rebuilding the group's US production. The company sold its operating leases in Texas to help reduce debt and overheads. The disposals were partly behind the decline in gross revenues from Pounds 198,607 to Pounds 84,904 in the first half. The pre-tax losses were exacerbated by the Pounds 73,868 exceptional cost of a failed bid for fellow Irish oil group, Tuskar Resources, earlier this year. Losses per share were steady at 0.01p. The shares closed 1 1/2 p down at 54 1/2 p.</p>

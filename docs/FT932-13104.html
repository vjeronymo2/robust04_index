			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Hold fire on the 1992 claret vintage - Well-made '92s should be good from '96 onwards FOR the second year in succession, the 1992 red Bordeaux was dismissed before the grapes were picked. As Peter Sichel, of Angludet and Palmer, says in his annual vintage and market report: 'It provided the wettest summer for at least 50 years with the fewest hours of sunshine since 1980. But those properties that had sprayed regularly, cut off a large proportion of grapes in July, and selected severely, produced good Merlot and at least healthy if not very ripe Cabernet.' Aided by new concentration techniques, a vintage that would have been declared a disaster 30 years ago will yield a fair proportion of drinkable wines from a record crop of 5.03 million hl. Generally they are superior to the frost-devastated 1991's. The dry white wines, picked before the September rains, are generally excellent when not over-oaked, but the sweet types had little success as the bad weather continued in the autumn. The Union des Grands Crus, which represents 120 classed growths and others with internaitonal market potentialities, has just held a three-day tasting of the new wines. The first-growths are not members or do not show their wines at these tastings, and this applies to several of the leading second-growths. However, I was able to taste all these in their cellars, with the exception of Leoville Las-Cases that had yet to offer them. I have included those sampled in the district lists below. It must be said that many of the wines were difficult to taste, as they had not settled after the assemblage (the blend of each chateau's grape varieties to provide the best balance). Others needed racking (taking the wine off the lees and into fresh barrels), or may have already only just done so. However the union's tastings provided wine writers with a controlled opportunity to compare the wines before the opening prices appear. Thanks to Latour I was able to visit all the first-growths except Ausone and Petrus, which only offers its wines through the associated merchant house of J-P Moueix. The wines of those firsts which also own other chateaux, and which I tasted and picked out, are included in the district lists below. The growths that appealed to me, with my particular preferences, are starred (*). The number tasted in each area are noted. The tastings started with Pomerols and St Emilions, continued with the southern and northern Medocs; then the Graves and finally the Barsacs and Sauternes. In general I found the Merlot-dominated Pomerols and St. Emilions more fruity and better structured than some of the Medocs, especially in the southern communes, and too many were over-oaked to mask their limitations. But variability is the keynote word to describe the 1992 vintage. Pomerol (10) Beauregard*, La Cabanne, La Conseillante, La Croix de Gay, Gazin*, Petit Village*. St Emilion (16) Angelus*, Balestard la Tonnelle, Clos Fourtet, Larcis Ducasse, Larmande*, Pavie, Trolong Mondot*, Villemaurine. Southern Medoc (28). Moulis - Chass-Spleen, Poujeaux. Listrac - Clarke*. Haut-Medoc - Cantemerle*. Margaux - Angludet, Durfort Vivens, Malescot, Pavillon Rouge de Ch Margaux, Rausan-Segla* (I confess to being disappointed with my usually favoured Palmer, but these are early days). Northern Medocs (28) St Julien - Ducru-Beaucaillou*, Gruaud Larose *, Langoa-Barton Leoville Barton*, Pauillac - Grand-Puy-Ducasse, Grand Puy Lacoste*, Lynch-Bages*, Pichon Baron, Pichon Lalande*. St Estephe - Cos Labory, Montrose*, Ormes de Pez. Red Graves (17) Pessac-Leognan - Carbonnieux, Domaine de Chevalier, Haut-Berger, Malartique Lagraviere, La Mission-Haut-Brion, Pape Clement*. White Graves (13) Pessac-Leognan - Carbonnieux*, Domaine de Chevalier*, Larrivet-Haut-Brion*, Malartic Lagraviere, Olivier, Smith-Haut-Lafitte. Portets (2) - Rahoul. Barsac/Sauternes (16). Barsac - Doisy-Vedrines*, Nairac. Sauternes - Lafaurie-Peyrguey - Rieussec. A number of union members did not show their wines, notably Evangile in Pomerol. First growths (6). All save Cheval-Blanc also showed their 1991, and I attach my notes. In the order tasted in their cellars: Mouton-Rothchild  - deep colour, very closed on nose and palate; very hard to taste at present, a bit short ('91 distinguished bouquet, tannic but good balance of fruit). Lafite - deep colour, elegant nose, very closed but not much body evident; light but good style ('91 full colour, elegant, fine nose. Oaky on taste but should develop good balance.) Latour - huge colour, velvety taste and plenty of body, long in the mouth ('91 less body and fruit than '92, fairly oaky, typical Pauillac). Margaux - big colour closed nose, good flavour but hard to taste, somewhat short at present ('91 - fine colour, good aroma, a claret of real class, comparatively long). Haut-Brion excellent colour, closed nose, light on taste, but sweet and surprisingly fruity for the year ('91 - more tannic in '92, more body, should develop well). Cheval Blanc - lovely blackcurrant bouquet, rich flavour, long, typical of this near Pomerol wine, and my favourite, followed by Latour and Haut-Brion. Early indications are that en primeur prices will be well down for the first growths, at the level of the 1987's - once despised, now sought after for current drinking. First-growth collectors apart, there is no good reason for claret amateurs to buy the 1992's before they are in bottle in two years' time. Those made well should make good drinking from 1996 onwards. Available cash will be better spent in acquiring '88's, 89's and 90's, said to lie in considerable quantities in the Medoc, less in the Graves, but not in St Emilion and Pomerol. What Bordeaux needs is a small but fine, highly saleable 1993, but we will have to wait another five or six months to find out if this will turn up.</p>

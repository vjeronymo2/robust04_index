			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Commission views options for US spending cuts As the incoming Republican Congress prepares to debate a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget while simultaneously proposing tax cuts, a bipartisan commission is working on ways to keep the US's long-term federal budget problems under control. The commission, chaired by Democratic Senator Bob Kerrey and retiring Republican Senator John Danforth, will meet tomorrow to discuss options for reducing tax giveaways and cutting spending on programmes such as Social Security and Medicare, which provide pension and healthcare benefits to the elderly. The 32-strong panel will vote next week on a package of cuts to be presented to President Bill Clinton and the new Congress. Documents prepared by the commission's staff show that by phasing in changes to entitlement programmes, it is possible to balance the government's promises with the money available to pay for them, and to bring social security and Medicare back to long-term financial solvency, without either reducing current benefits or raising current taxes. But the staff report also outlines a list of options, many of them politically unpalatable, and warns that without action, entitlement spending and interest on the national debt will eat up all federal revenues by 2012, leaving nothing at all for discretionary spending. The report outlines three sample reform packages, each of which would bring entitlement spending and government revenues into balance by the year 2030. The first staff plan involves no tax increases, but would gradually increase the social security retirement age and the Medicare eligibility age to 70. It would also reduce federal subsidies to Medicare recipients and reduce payments under Medicare to doctors and hospitals. The most sweeping measures, however, would apply a means test to all entitlements, reducing benefits to anyone with an income above Dollars 40,000, (Pounds 24,400) and cut all entitlements except health and retirement programmes by 25 per cent. Further savings would be achieved by revising the consumer price index, which would lower cost of living adjustments to benefits. The second option would make the same adjustment to the CPI, and would also increase Medicare and social security taxes and limit income tax deductions. Instead of raising the retirement age to 70 it would only speed up the already scheduled increase to 67. And instead of means-testing, it would make all entitlement benefits taxable. A third plan blends the two approaches, increasing payroll taxes for Medicare but not for social security while lifting the retirement age to 68. Entitlements other than social security would become taxable, but social security payments to middle- and upper-income families would be reduced. All three plans make it clear how difficult it will be to deal with entitlement spending without touching social security.</p>

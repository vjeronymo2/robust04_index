			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Danish Development Minister Helle Degn has arrived  in our country. She is optimistic about the possibility that  our country might become the beneficiary of significant  financial support.    Danish economic cooperation with our country was  discontinued  after [former Bolivian dictator Luis] Garcia Meza's coup in  1980. The cooperation agreement was not restored for over a  decade. Bolivia may now be a Latin American country chosen to  receive financial support from this Nordic country.    [Begin Degn recording in Danish with superimposed  translation  into Spanish, in progress] ...actually much interest, and eager  to visit the cooperation projects between Denmark and Bolivia.  [end recording]    Asked why the cooperation had been discontinued for such a  long time, the minister explained that Denmark had waited for  democracy to be solidly established in our country.    Bolivia is, however, not the only country hoping for this  financial assistance. [passage indistinct]    With the goal of convincing the Danish Government of our  country's various needs, Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas  will join Minister Degn in traveling to Beni Department and the  plateau region.    [Begin Cardenas recording] In our governmental agenda this  cooperation is required, especially in the fields of  agriculture, craftsmanship, the advancement of women,  educational reform, dairy products -- an area in which they have  already been supporting us in a significant manner -- and other  areas that our country may propose to Denmark.    I have discovered that she has an extremely positive  attitude  toward cooperation with our country. These three days will be  dedicated to talking with her in depth to convince her -- and  convince the Danish people -- of resuming and normalizing their  cooperation with our country.    I hope the rains will allow us to have an uneventful and  successful trip. [end recording]    The Danish minister was optimistic. She also visited  Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar and Economic  Development Minister Fernando Romero.    Danish cooperation will be earmarked in particular for  social  programs. If positive results are achieved, it will involve $20  million.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Laurent Maillard] </F>   [Text] Tehran, Feb 2 (AFP)--Several people were injured and  others arrested in a rare outburst of sectarian violence in  southeast Iran, marring celebrations for the 15th anniversary of  the Islamic republic, newspapers said Wednesday.    The protest on Tuesday came the same day as a gunman fired  shots during a speech by President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani.    And the mainly Shiite Muslim country's economic plight also  cast a shadow over the anniversary when parliament cut the  annual budget.    An angry crowd gathered Tuesday outside the main mosque in  Zahedan, one of the few Iranian cities with a Sunni Muslim  majority, after rumours spread that a Sunni mosque had been  destroyed in Mashhad in northeastern Iran.    "Counter-revolutionary elements joined the crowd and started  throwing stones at the police, breaking shop windows," HAMSHARI  newspaper said.    The interior ministry described the violence as a "counter-  revolutionary plot" and said public buildings, houses and  military vehicles had been attacked.    The security forces arrested demonstrators who wanted to  "sow  disorder and trouble in Zahedan" at the start of the official  ceremonies marking the anniversary of the 1979 revolution which  toppled the shah, the ministry said.    No figure was given for the number of demonstrators  involved.    "Counter-revolutionary elements gathered in Khayyam Avenue  and began ripping down the Iranian flags and smashing the party  lights decorating the street for the anniversary of the  revolution," the ministry said.    The newspaper KEYHAN reported Tuesday that the armed  opposition group the People's Mojahedin [Mojahedin-e Khalq  Organization, MKO] was preparing "terrorist activities" in  Sistan va Baluchestan province, of which Zahedan is the main  town, "with the backing of Saudi Arabia," which sees itself as  the leader of the Sunni branch of Islam.    Also Tuesday, a gunman fired shots as Rafsanjani delivered a  speech at the mausoleum of the republic's founder, Ayatollah  Ruhollah Khomeyni. Police arrested a 26-year-old man who said  he had only wanted to frighten the crowd.    Rafsanjani, standing 50 meters (yards) away and shielded by  an aide, kept his composure and did not interrupt his speech at  the shrine in southern Tehran. "There was nothing to worry  about," he told Tehran Radio later.    The noise panicked some in the crowd of several thousand who  had gathered to celebrate the first of the 10 days which led to  the revolution, known here as "Fajr" (dawn).    After the incident the crowd started shouting "Rafsanjani,  we  support you" and "death to the hypocrites," in reference to the  armed opposition. On the economic front, the Iranian  parliament adopted an austerity budget for 1994-1995, trimming  the government's proposed draft by 12 percent because of low oil  revenues.    Parliament lowered the forecast for overall revenues to 17  billion dollars, down from the government's target of 19.2  billion dollars. The budget was cut by 12 percent, from 45.5  billion dollars to 40 billion dollars.    MPs also chopped 20 percent off the revenue forecast from  oil  exports for the next Iranian year -- running from March 21, 1994  to March 20, 1995 -- from 12.8 billion dollars to 10.15 billion  dollars.    The price of a barrel of crude was estimated at 13 dollars,  while the government had forecast 14.5 dollars.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sevastopol, 8 Jun--The coordinating council of the  Black Sea Fleet officers' meeting assessed the emergence of a  battalion of the National Guard of Ukraine in the city as an act  of moral and psychological pressure against the people of  Sevastopol. As was reported by Yuliya Syrotynska, a staff  member of the public relations center at the Sevastopol  Department of Internal Affairs, the National Guardsmen arrived  in Sevastopol last week to help local militiamen maintain public  order. The joint patrolling of the city streets allows better  coverage of the areas to be patrolled.    In their letter, addressed to the chairman of the local  administration, the leaders of the coordinating council of the  Black Sea Fleet officers' meeting voiced their protest against  the introduction of additional troops at a time when  contradictions between the leadership of Crimea and the  leadership of Ukraine are aggravated.</p>

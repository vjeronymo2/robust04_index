			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE SAY BOY'S HOUSE YIELDED STABBING CLUES  </P> <P> A bloodhound led police to the house of a 14-year-old boy suspected of stabbing  a neighbor to death and, once at the boy's house, investigators found physical  evidence linking him to the crime, officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Westminster Police Officer Robin Kapp declined to elaborate on what evidence  was discovered. However, he said the weapon used to kill Janice L. McLean has  not been recovered.  </P> <P> No motive for the slaying has been established, Kapp said.  </P> <P> McLean, a 42-year-old single mother of two teen-agers, was stabbed in her bed  about 3 a.m. Monday by an assailant who apparently entered her home in the 9100  block of Obsidian Drive by prying open a window. She died during surgery at UCI  Medical Center in Orange.  </P> <P> A neighbor who lives five houses from McLean's said his son was the one  arrested by police. He said he had no explanation for the incident and  expressed hope that his son was innocent.  </P> <P> The Orange County district attorney's office will decide today whether to file  charges against the boy, who is being held at Orange County Juvenile Hall on  suspicion of murder, authorities said. The boy's name was not released because  of his age.  </P> <P> School officials who know the boy said they were shocked by the news. La Quinta  High School Principal Andrew McTaggart said the boy is a freshman at the  school. He said the youth excelled in athletics but struggled academically and  had a problem with attendance.  </P> <P> "He wasn't an angel, but he wasn't a problem student either," McTaggart said.  </P> <P> McLean's 15-year-old-daughter, who was at home at the time of the attack,  attends the same high school, McTaggart said.  </P> <P> He declined to comment further on the either student.  </P> <P> Jim Perry, the boy's basketball coach, said the ninth-grader is "a very gifted  athlete, blessed with a lot of talent." He said the boy plays football as well  as basketball and is well-liked among his teammates and other classmates.  </P> <P> And at 6-foot-3, "we were expecting great things from him," Perry said.  </P> <P> The boy was ineligible to play in a basketball game because of poor grades,  Perry said. McTaggart, however, said the boy's marks were improving.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, McLean's friends, co-workers and relatives were at a loss to  explain her death and how the 14-year-old fit into the picture.  </P> <P> McLean's father, Joe Rasciella, who lives next door to his daughter, said the  family had no contact with the boy other than "waving to him as we drove down  the street."  </P> <P> He said his daughter "had no enemies. None. Everybody loved her."  </P> <P> McLean's colleagues described her as a compassionate friend, a devoted mother  and an exceptionally competent secretary. McLean worked for Justice Sheila  Prell Sonenshine at the Santa Ana offices of the state's 4th District Court of  Appeal.  </P> <P> Harmon Scoville, presiding justice of the 4th District Court of Appeal, said  her colleagues had "nothing but the highest regard for her."  </P> <P> Friends described McLean as a woman of deep but private religious convictions  and a devoted mother. They said she was very proud of her 15-year-old daughter,  one of the youngest members of her high school tennis team, and her 18-year-old  son, an accomplished artist.  </P> <P> Kathleen Hayes, 39, a clerk in the appeals court, said she and McLean worked  together as secretaries in the Westminster branch of the county public  defender's office from 1979 to 1982. For years, the two women have shared  frequent dinners and occasionally attended Bible-study sessions together, she  said.  </P> <P> Hayes said "everyone" liked McLean and felt they could come to her for help  with their personal or professional troubles.  </P> <P> "She was a very loyal friend and she'd do anything to help you," Hayes said.  </P></p>

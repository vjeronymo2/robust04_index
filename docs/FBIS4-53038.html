			<p>BFN     [Text] On 9 May, the Agency of Natural Resources and  Energy [ANRE] under the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry [MITI] disclosed a plan to drastically revise the  current nuclear fuel recycling policy aimed at securing the  nation's own energy resources by increasing production of  plutonium. The government's plan for a second reprocessing  plant to produce plutonimum by reprocessing spent nuclear fuel  will be given another review "in or around 2010 as to whether  the plant is really needed." As for the enriched uranium plant  now under construction in Rokkasho-mura, Aomori Prefecture, ANRE  will freeze its second expansion plan which envisages producing  1,500 tons of enriched uranium per year beginning in 2000.    By revising Japan's longstanding nuclear policy toward  containing production and minimizing the amount of plutonium in  stock, ANRE wants to show people at home and abroad that Japan  will use plutonium only for peaceful purposes.    The ANRE will formally announce the policy revision after  the  Atomic Energy Division of the General Advisory Committee for  Energy, an advisory panel to the MITI minister, makes a  recommendation on the revision in its interim report to be  compiled in June. The government's Atomic Energy Commission  will then incorporate the revision into a new long-term atomic  power program to be worked out this summer.    The ANRE decision on the revision stems from the realization  that, with the world crying for a need to put a stop to nuclear  proliferation as a result of North Korea's suspected nuclear  arms program, it is difficult for Japan to obtain understanding  at home and abroad on its nuclear policy, however hard the  government may insist that it is strictly for peaceful purposes.  Another reason is that the uranium supply is large enough to  last until about 2020 or 2030. The agency has also taken into  consideration the fact that the United States and Europe are  reviewing their own nuclear fuel recycling policies.    However, as Japan is heavily dependent on energy resources  from overseas, its basic nuclear fuel recycling policy will be  maintained from the viewpoint of securing the nation's own  energy resources.    As such, as far as a reprocessing plant for spent nuclear  fuel is concerned, ongoing construction of the first plant (that  can reprocess 800 tons of spent nuclear fuel a year) in  Rukkasho-mura will be completed in 2000. But construction of a  fast breeder reactor for demonstration purpose will be delayed  from the late 1990's to the early 2000's.    The agency wants to dispel apprehensions about nuclear  proliferation by reducing the amount of plutonium in stock. It  will seek to reduce the volume of plutonium by burning it, for  instance, by adopting the plutonium thermal system in the  light-water reactors. It thus wants to set an international  example in making peaceful use of nuclear power.</p>

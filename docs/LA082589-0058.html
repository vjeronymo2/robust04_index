			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SAFETY RULES FOR ROADSIDE AID ASKED  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council has called on auto clubs and other providers of  emergency roadside services to establish new safety procedures to reduce the  risk of attack for motorists waiting for assistance.  </P> <P> The action came in the wake of heavy lobbying by several dozen business women,  civic and community leaders who asked the Automobile Club of Southern  California and other service providers to set up better safety measures.  </P> <P> The women said they were concerned that people had been attacked after their  cars broke down and they were required to wait for help at telephone booths  rather than in their locked cars.  </P> <P> The motion by Council President John Ferraro also asked the city attorney to  draw up an ordinance that would require tow truck operators to enhance their  safety procedures as part of the city two-truck permit system.  </P> <P> Ferraro's spokesman Bill Gilson said the city now lacks the power under state  law to regulate the emergency roadside service providers and therefore the  motion only requests the change.  </P></p>

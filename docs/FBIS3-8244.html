For the first time since NATO was formed in 1949, its Air  Force took part in a combat operation in Europe, outside the  range of the North Atlantic Alliance. Another "first" -- for  the first time since the beginning of the ethnic and religious  conflict in Bosnia, foreign forces interfered in the conflict.  Such were the initial assessments of the political observers  after it was reported that U.S. F-16 aircraft belonging to  NATO's allied Air Force, took off from the base in Aviano and  shot down four "Galeb" aircraft in the Banja Luka region, which  is controlled by the Serbs.    The report marked a new date in the history of the longest  and bloodiest military crisis in Europe since the end of World  War II. Until now, even the famous NATO ultimatum of 9 February  did not cause an escalation, however, the air action of the U.S.  fighters in Bosnia crossed the border at which things become  unpredictable and dangerous.    One was not surprised by the explanation given by NATO  headquarters. The UN Security Council resolution that envisages  a "clear sky" over Bosnia, i.e. a ban on military flights that  have not been authorized by the United Nations Protection Forces  [UNPROFOR], has been violated. The truth is yet to be  established, but a fact is well-known. The three fighting sides  have violated the ban on flights since the day the resolution  was adopted. Periodically one of the sides accuses the others  of utilizing helicopters or combat aircraft. Nevertheless,  NATO's "AWACS" intelligence aircraft have not accused any of the  sides of violating the resolution, nor has UNPROFOR publicly  warned any of the fighting sides.    Without justifying the actions of those who violated the  resolution, and regardless of whether the airplanes were Serbian  or not, it is obvious that NATO's operation comes at a very  inappropriate moment -- precisely when the world public sighed  with relief that the ultimatum did not prompt a bombardment and  even directed the developments toward peace. The air operation  contradicted the conclusion of the "Blue Helmets" commanders,  who said that the cease-fire was generally observed, and the  opinion of the political figures that the Sarajevo model of  peacemaking must gradually be expanded to include all of Bosnia.    The first military intervention of NATO in Europe must evoke  great concern. It demonstrated that contrary to Butrus-Ghali's  assurance, the commanding center of the military operations in  Bosnia is not in the UN glass skyscraper in New York, but in the  Pentagon, and that Washington deliberately seeks an escalation  in the conflict to prompt a new division of Bosnia's territory.  It is not very hard to establish that the attack against the  four airplanes in the Banja Luka sky, which was peaceful since  the beginning of the war, was directly related to the tripartite  talks in Washington on establishing the Croatian-Muslim  federation. The U.S. plan practically eliminates the EC plan on  dividing Bosnia into three parts. On the other hand, it  envisages a much greater territory for the future federation  than the Bosnia Serbs would be willing to concede.    Consequently, NATO's air fist had the important goal of  demonstrating power to force the Serbs to make territorial  concessions under the threat of military intervention. An  unidentified Russian diplomat demanded an explanation from NATO  regarding the air operation and said: "What happened is what we  feared most and warned against frequently."    If one adds to this alarming sensation the intention of  UNPROFOR to allow the "Blue Helmets" who accompany the  humanitarian relief convoys, to open fire in order to clear the  way, even without informing the fighting sides about this, it  becomes clear that Bosnia is heading toward a new military  escalation. They say that this corresponds to the interests of  the Muslims and their protectors, the Americans. This could be  so. However, it does not correspond to the desire of Bosnia's  population for peace and the efforts of the world community to  stop this shameful butchery.</p>

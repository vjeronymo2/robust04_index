			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Piero Visani: "High Quality Options for the </F> Military"]    [Text] Reforming the Armed Forces is one of the top  priorities on the new government's agenda. Indeed, the hatchet  of an absurd, penny-pinching policy has been taken to the  Italian military capability over recent years, reducing defense  spending to little more than 1 percent of gross domestic  product. The result of these unfounded decisions by the last  few governments of the First Republic has been that our country  has found itself without the essential foreign policy support  provided by a military capability when developments on the  international political scene made it crucial to have one. The  situation is compounded by the restrictions imposed on a sector  that has traditionally been at the forefront of technology, the  arms industry -- such tight restrictions that they give grounds  for suspecting lucrative collusion with the competition in the  best "bribe city" style -- and the dominant cultures' continuing  demonization of anything remotely connected with the "military"  sphere.    Now that the new cabinet is giving clear signs that it  intends to assume a much more definite role and acquire a higher  profile at international level, the necessity of imparting new  vigor to the Armed Forces, in other words to the means most  traditionally used to back foreign policy, has become manifest,  and Defense Minister Previti has been more than explicit on the  subject.    The renovation of the Italian military apparatus requires a  rise in quality standards, to be achieved not just by increasing  defense spending but, first and foremost, by deploying this  spending more wisely, so as to create a tool relying more on the  quality of its operational units and the means and equipment at  their disposal than on the quantity of bureaucratic structures  and bodies of greater or lesser utility.    One of the crucial aspects of such decisions in favor of  quality is undoubtedly the growing professionalization of the  Armed Forces in view of the fact that the increasing complexity  of modern warfare means that it cannot be waged by poorly  trained draftees but requires arms professionals capable of  acquitting themselves with the maximum skill in a range of  different operational situations, peacekeeping and  peace-enforcing missions currently being the main ones envisaged.    However, we must define the real nature of military  careerism  with extreme clarity.    To cite the well-known distinction drawn by U.S. sociologist  Charles C. Moskos, when the Armed Forces decide to recruit a  substantial number of volunteers, they must maintain a  fundamentally institutional organizational structure, resisting  the temptation to adopt an occupational structure. The  institutional model responds to a set of values and standards  that transcend individual interests and serve the collective  interest, and it is marked by a high level of idealism. The  occupational model, on the other hand, tends to turn the  military career into a job like any other, lacking ideals and  concerned solely with obtaining pay rises and union guarantees.    Ever since its initial proposals on voluntary recruitment,  the MSI [Italian Social Movement] has been fighting for an Army  made up of professionals motivated by high ideals, and not for a  crowd of odd-jobbers.    Today, National Alliance cannot but confirm this stance,  bearing in mind, however, that, particularly in times of  economic recession, the temptation for many young men to opt for  a military career as a remedy for widespread unemployment may be  very strong.    Nevertheless, the fact that this need exists must not be  seen  as a limiting factor, but rather as a welcome opportunity to  improve relations between youth and the Armed Forces.    In a recent interview granted to the specialized journal,  PANORAMA DIFESA, General Incisa di Camerana, Army chief of  general staff, pointed out that the country's current economic  problems had definitely enhanced voluntary recruitment, but he  also added that a large number of the volunteers seemed to be  driven by high ideals that transcended short-term economic  necessity.    This is the human foundation on which we must aim to build a  new, high quality military capability; a force whose major  concerns are not so much job stability, pay rises, and pension  rights (which must nevertheless not be neglected, provided they  are kept in the right perspective), but rather the ability to do  one's job at all times and in any circumstances, and to do it  according to the ethical principles and values that the military  institution has traditionally made its own.    This will also create the conditions for improving relations  between the governing forces and the officer corps.    The latter, indeed, has for decades had its high ideal  motives unfairly undermined by governments who made no secret of  their basic contempt for anything with "military" associations.    The creation of a new, modern, military capability requires  a  decision to go for quality in this sphere as well.</p>

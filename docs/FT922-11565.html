			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Ghost of Nazism rises to haunt Austrian election: Accusations of pro-Nazi leanings in an ironic reversal of roles WHEN President Kurt Waldheim last summer announced he would not run for a second term, Austrians thought they would be able to escape the shadows of the Nazi past. But the issue, which has dogged Mr Waldheim's six-year term following allegations that he lied about his war record, has come back to haunt the campaign for the presidential election this Sunday. In an ironic role reversal, it was Mr Joerg Haider, the chairman of the right-wing Freedom Party, who accused Mr Robert Jungk, the leftist candidate for the Green Party, of having shown pro-Nazi leanings as a journalist in Switzerland during the Second World War. Mr Jungk, 78, is a Berlin-born Jew who was forced into exile in Switzerland. Mr Haider, his unlikely accuser, was ousted as governor of the state of Carinthia last year after praising the 'orderly employment policy of the Third Reich.' Mr Jungk published his critical reports on Nazi Germany under a pseudonym, and to evade Swiss censorship, he sometimes resorted to the nationalist idioms of the time. It was a reference in 1942 to the Nazi's 'volks-biologically progressive health policies' which stressed the genetic purity of the population in Germany which Mr Haider cited as evidence for Mr Jungk's sympathy for the Hitler regime. Mr Haider has been ordered by a court to retract the accusations, and it is unlikely that the controversy will have any significant impact on the first ballot round on Sunday. Mr Jungk never had a chance of getting more than 5 to 8 per cent of the vote. And Mrs Heide Schmidt, 43, the eloquent candidate of the Freedom Party, has seen her chances of making it into the second round fade in a recent row between Mr Haider, her party leader, and critics from the party's liberal wing to which she is aligned. Mrs Schmidt was forced to downplay her disapproval of nationalist tendencies in the party after Mr Haider threatened to withdraw his support for her. But even a poor showing by Mrs Schmidt is unlikely to dent the future prospects of Mr Haider. His right-wing populist message is dominating the political debate and headlines. Mr Rudolf Streicher, the former minister of transportation and candidate for the Social Democratic Party, and Mr Thomas Klestil, a 60-year old career diplomat who is running for the conservative People's Party, are expected to draw the most votes in the first round of balloting. Mr Streicher, 53, is ahead in the polls, but is unlikely to gain a clear majority. Such an outcome would result in a run-off on May 24, in which Mr Streicher would again be the favourite. A former factory worker who worked his way up the ranks to become chairman of one of Austria's largest companies Amag, before joining the cabinet in 1986, he is one of Austria's most popular politicians. His folksy style and his musical hobby - he is an accomplished conductor - appeal to the electorate which is looking for a surrogate emperor figure to fill the largely ceremonial post of president. Mr Streicher compares his concept of the office to that of a fireman who stays out of day-to-day politics but intervenes when something goes wrong. But Mr Klestil's spirited campaign has enhanced the standing of the People's Party, the Social Democrats' junior partner in the coalition government.</p>

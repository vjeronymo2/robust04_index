			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 14. In &sect;92.211, paragraphs (a)(2) and (f)(3) are revised, and paragraph (a)(3) is added, to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;92.211  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Tenant-based rental assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The participating jurisdiction selects families in accordance with written tenant selection policies and criteria that are consistent with the purposes of providing housing to very low- and low-income families and are reasonably related to preference rules established under section 6(c)(4)(A) of the Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et. seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Selection policies and criteria meet the ``reasonably related'' requirement if at least 70% of the families assisted qualify, or would qualify in the near future without the tenant-based rental assistance, for one of the three Federal preferences under section 6(c)(4)(A) of the Housing Act of 1937. These are families that occupy substandard housing (including families that are homeless or living in a shelter for homeless families); families that are paying more than 50 percent of (gross) family income for rent; or families that are involuntarily displaced. The participating jurisdiction may select low-income families currently residing in units that are designated for rehabilitation or acquisition under the participating jurisdiction's HOME program without requiring that the family meet the written tenant selection policies and criteria. Families so selected may use the tenant-based assistance in the rehabilitated or acquired unit or in other qualified housing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) A participating jurisdiction may require the family to use the tenant-based assistance within the participating jurisdiction's boundaries or may permit the family to use the assistance outside its boundaries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (f) * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The participating jurisdiction's rent standard for a unit size must based on:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Local market conditions; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) May not be less, for each unit size, than 80 percent of the published Section 8 Existing Housing fair market rent (in effect when the payment standard amount is adopted) nor more than the fair market rent or HUD-approved community-wide exception rent (in effect when the participating jurisdiction adopts its rent standard amount). (Community-wide exception rents are maximum gross rents approved by HUD for the Rental Certificate Program under 882.106(a)(3) of this title for a designated municipality, county, or similar locality, which apply to the whole PHA jurisdiction.) A participating jurisdiction may approve on a unit-by-unit basis a subsidy based on a rent standard that exceeds the applicable fair market rent by up to 10 percent for 20 percent of units assisted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 15. In &sect;92.214, paragraph (a)(8) is revised to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;92.214  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Prohibited activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Pay for the acquisition of property owned by the participating jurisdiction, except for property acquired by the participating jurisdiction with HOME funds, or property acquired in anticipation of carrying out a HOME project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 16. In &sect;92.218, paragraphs (a) introductory text and (c) are revised, and a new paragraph (e) is added, to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;92.218  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Amount of matching contribution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Each participating jurisdiction must make contributions to housing that qualifies as affordable housing under the HOME program, throughout a fiscal year. The contributions must total not less than:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c) HOME funds used for administrative and planning costs (pursuant to &sect;92.207), CHDO operating expenses (pursuant to &sect;92.208) and capacity building (pursuant to &sect;92.300(b)) of community housing development organizations are not required to be matched.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (e) Contributions that have been or will be counted towards satisfying a matching requirement of another Federal grant or award may not count toward satisfying the matching contribution requirement for the HOME program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

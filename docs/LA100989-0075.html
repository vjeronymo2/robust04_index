			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDY CITES ENERGY-SAVING APPLIANCES  </P> <P> Consumers can save nearly $150 a year by using the most energy-efficient  appliances sold in the United States, according to an independent nonprofit  energy research group.  </P> <P> "There are many factors that consumers need to look at in purchasing  appliances. Energy is one of them," said Steve Nadel, senior associate at the  American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.  </P> <P> Since "one-third of the electricity produced in the U.S. is consumed in our  homes" the council recommends that consumers pay closer attention to the  EnergyGuide labels affixed to new appliances. The group has published a guide  entitled "The Most Energy-Efficient Appliances."  </P> <P> "If all the households in the U.S. had the most efficient refrigerators  currently available, the electricity savings would eliminate the need for about  10 large power plants," the report said.  </P> <P> "Using appliances and heating and cooling equipment costs an average household  more than $1,000 per year," the report said.  </P> <P> "We estimate that these standards will save consumers at least $28 billion over  the lifetimes of the products sold through the year 2000," the report  concluded.  </P> <P> The council report rates a Frigidaire 18.6-cubic-foot model as the most  efficient in that size category. Based on a national average energy cost of 7.7  cents per kilowatt hour, the booklet estimates the annual cost to run the  Frigidaire at $65, a savings of $47 a year over the average inefficient  refrigerator.  </P> <P> The council rates a White-Westinghouse dishwasher, which costs $38 a year to  operate, and a Gibson front-loading standard-size washing machine costing $23 a  year to run, as the most energy-efficient new models. The consumer buying these  would save $32 and $67, respectively.  </P></p>

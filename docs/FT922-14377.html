			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Voters dentcredibility of Italian coalition THE post-war domination of Italian politics by the Christian Democrats was broken yesterday by a protest vote ushering in a period of uncertainty. Preliminary computer projections indicated the Christian Democrat vote had fallen for the first time in 46 years to below 30 per cent for the first time. The outcome is a fragmentation of support for traditional parties after the country's first post-war election without a powerful communist party in opposition. Whoever controls the new administration will need to implement an austerity programme to combat a public sector deficit close to 11 per cent of GDP, and carry out long-awaited institutional reforms. This was the basis on which the Christian Democrats had fought the campaign with their allies, the Socialists, the Liberals (PLI) and the Social Democrats (PSDI). It looked unlikely last night that this outgoing four-party coalition, which was projected to muster no more than 48 per cent of the vote, would be able to form a government. Quirks in seat distribution could still give the coalition parties a majority in the 630-seat chamber of deputies but, in the 315-seat senate, they were projected to hold 45 per cent of the vote, or 12 seats less than the number required for a majority. This would impede their chances of forming a government. Moreover, such a frag-administration would be thought incapable of tackling a full term involving convergence with Europe as laid out by the Maastricht treaty. 'The coalition fought the campaign saying vote for us or chaos. The voters have preferred chaos,' said Mr Giorgio La Malfa, leader of the small Republican party and one of the beneficiaries of the protest vote. Mr Arnaldo Forlani, the Christian Democrat party secretary, described the result as 'the opening of a new unwritten chapter in a book'. He claimed the electorate had rejected the coalition's election campaign calling for a stable government. He himself indicated he might resign, assuming full responsibility for the party's failure to convince voters. Equally crest-fallen was Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader, who had counted on becoming the next premier in an ongoing four-party coalition. The fragmentation of the vote was underlined by the fact that six parties each won between 5 and 17 per cent of the vote. For the chamber of deputies, the Christian Democrats were being given 29.6 per cent last night, a drop of 5 per cent, while the Socialists appeared to have dropped by more than 1 per cent to 13.3 per cent. The main beneficiary from the protest vote was the populist Lombard League which appeared likely to pick up more than 9 per cent of the vote nationwide.

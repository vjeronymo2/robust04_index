Analysts hold that recent changes  in tax policy will have a great impact on foreign investors and  have expressed their preference for a relatively long  consultation and adaptation period, which they believe is  necessary.    Wu Lianfeng, assistant general manager of the Nanyang  Commercial Bank, noted that China is only now preparing to  reform its taxation system after more than 10 years of  implementing the reform and opening up policy. However, he also  pointed out that the value-added land tax, the consumption tax,  and other laws and ordinances introduced early this year only  provide a framework and that many specific procedures need to be  worked out and improved. He noted that different  interpretations of the new laws and regulations by the central  and local governments have already caused a certain degree of  confusion and disorder in their implementation and have  disrupted investment projects by foreign businessmen.    Chim Pui-chung, a member of Hong Kong's Legislative Council  who represents the banking and finance functional constituency,  also urged China to give consideration to foreign investors'  legitimate interests while continuing to exercise macroeconomic  regulation and control. He warned that as other Asian countries  were making efforts to improve their investment environment to  attract foreign investors, China should follow suit; otherwise  foreign funds could move elsewhere.

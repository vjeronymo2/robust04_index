Defense Minister David Collenette says the  U.S. will be denied permission to conduct tests until MPs hold a  special debate in the issue next week. According to the  minister Washington was informed late last year that the  Liberals wanted to review the testing agreement, but the  Canadian Broadcasting Corporation has learned that plans were  under way for a Cruise missile test next week. Michael  MacCaulif reports:    [MacCaulif] The decision to hold a parliamentary debate on  Cruise missile testing is in a sense a face saving exercise. In  November the new Liberal government told the Americans to begin  their planning for 1994 Cruise missile tests, but in opposition  the Liberals had also said no further tests should take place  until Cruise missile testing was reviewed. So after this  morning's cabinet meeting Defense Minister David Collenette said  the Liberals would be true to their word.    [Begin Collenette recording] We had a discussion this  morning and we hope to have a debate some time next week before  any decision is taken on the, any tests in 1994. [end recording]    [MacCaulif] Even though in November the Liberals had told  the  Americans to begin planning their 1994 tests Collenette insists  they were also told there would have to be a review first.    [Begin Collenette recording] The United States does, did  know  that any future tests would hinge on our government reviewing  it. [end recording]    [MacCaulif] But CBC news has been told in fact that isn't  the  case. Until this week many people even in the Canadian military  were under the impression that this year's tests would go ahead  on schedule and plans were fully under way for the first test to  take place next Tuesday [25 January].</p>

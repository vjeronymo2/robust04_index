			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Businesses expect delay in recovery THE ECONOMIC recovery is likely to be postponed from the second to the third quarter of this year, the Association of British Chambers of Commerce said yesterday. That assessment emerged from the association's latest quarterly survey of business opinion, which reported a decline in confidence compared with the third quarter of last year. It also found a poorer outlook for investment and employment. The survey was based on questions last month to nearly 7,500 manufacturing and service companies. One finding was that unemployment will continue to rise, a factor likely to damp consumer confidence and hold back demand for credit. The association warned that with base rates stuck at 10.5 per cent and a weak pound preventing the government from cutting the cost of borrowing, real interest rates were rising as inflation fell. High real rates 'may act as a depressant to economic performance'. Another factor delaying recovery was uncertainty about the election. Better news for Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, came with signs of a rise in exports. The association warned, however, that a slowdown in big overseas markets such as the US and Germany raised questions about the strength of an export-led upturn. The balance of manufacturers expecting sales to increase over the next year was 38 per cent in the fourth quarter last year, compared with 47 per cent in the third quarter. The balance is calculated by subtracting the percentage of companies thinking sales will decline from the percentage expecting a rise. Similarly, the confidence balance for service companies declined to 38 per cent in the fourth quarter last year from 42 per cent in the previous quarter. Business confidence has, however, climbed significantly from the first half of last year, when the recession was at an early stage. Another brighter sign outlook emerged from the balance of 5 per cent of manufacturers reporting increased orders for exports in the fourth quarter, the first time since early 1990 that manufacturers seeing a rise in export orders outnumbered those seeing a decline. There were 'plenty of grounds for optimism' about a recovery, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, said last night in a speech at Manchester Business School. He said the stability given to sterling by the European exchange rate mechanism should provide a platform for sustained growth in a non-inflationary environment.</p>

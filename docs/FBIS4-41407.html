			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Rybak report: "Some Presidential Edicts Are Crude. </F> Glazyev's Report Under Discussion at the Economic-Mathematical  Studies Center"]    [Text] Yet another discussion of the report "Main  Guidelines of State Economic Policy," which was drawn up by a  group of authors under Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the State  Duma Committee on Economic Policy, was held yesterday at the  Economic-Mathematical Studies Center.    The discussion was attended by scientists from the Russian  Academy of Sciences, State Duma deputies, officials from various  Russian ministries, and also businessmen.    Sergey Glazyev's report was devoted to problems concerning  reform of the Russian economy and also proposals aimed at  improving it. Mr. Glazyev repeated his proposals that the state  fine-tune the "mechanism of market self-organization" by  regulating markets, supporting enterprises engaged in  nonprofitmaking activity, and transferring the management rights  over commercial state institutions to a special State Property  Fund.    The report submitted for discussion also contained proposals  aimed at adjusting the pension system, combating inflation, and  reversing the slump in production by giving greater subsidies to  state-owned enterprises. Speakers from among the report's co-  authors suggested, in particular, that the system of tax  collection be changed so as to collect half of government  revenues by levying charges on the use of natural resources and  environmental taxes.    In a conversation with your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  correspondent, Mr. Glazyev also touched on the president's  recent economic edicts. In his view, these are steps in the  right direction, but some of the edicts are still crude. In his  words, laws to be enacted by the Federal Assembly will "set the  edicts right." In addition, Boris Yeltsin's edicts were largely  based on the 50 bills that were passed to the president by the  State Duma last winter "for consultations," the State Duma  committee chairman said.    Shortly the parliament is scheduled to discuss the first  presidential economic packages, draft federal laws, and  amendments to existing laws. In particular, they will consider  the problems of foreign investment, the customs code, and  foreign economic activity.    State Duma Deputy Irina Khakamada, member of the "12  December" faction, commented on the discussion of the  "guidelines" as follows: "I like in Mr. Glazyev's program the  pension proposal whereby people will be paid state pensions that  will be set in accordance with a subsistence level, and extra  money will be allocated from private pension funds. I cannot  imagine, however, how, given the proposed subsidies, state  enterprises could compete with each other; moreover, where is  the guarantee that another government would be better equipped  to tackle the problems the current one cannot solve?"</p>

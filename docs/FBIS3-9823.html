The fresh round of talks will include the Bosnian Serbs,  whose absence makes the peace "impossible". This round of  diplomatic action, as is announced in Washington, aims not only  to bring the Serbs to the negotiating table, but also to find  something they and the Moslem-Croat Federation could reach an  agreement on.    Two things are crucial to this: First, to reach an agreement  on relations between the Moslem-Croat Federation and the Bosnian  Serb republic, and, secondly, to resolve territorial demarcation  issues between the federation and the Bosnian Serb republic.    Although the Serbs refused to join the Moslem-Croat  Federation, they do not rule out the possibility of establishing  a trilateral union in Bosnia-Herzegovina, a feasible solution,  especially if confederal relations with countries outside  Bosnia-Herzegovina are not insisted upon.    The territorial demarcation issue is the most difficult, but  it could also be solved. The problem had nearly been resolved in  Geneva and Brussels, when the differences have been reduced to  only a few percentages.    Now that the Moslem-Croat Federation package has been tied,  U.S. presidential envoy Charles Redman announces a return to  Geneva, speaking to that effect about the former demarcation  lines. It was, in fact, a deal offering 33.3 per cent of the  territory to the Moslems, 17.5 per cent to the Croats and about  50 per cent to the Serbs. The deal broke down at the last  minute after Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic rejected it  under the pretext of being dissatisfied with the quality of the  territories.    The "Geneva idea" is now back in circulation and, all things  considered, the U.S. and Russian presidential envoys, Charles  Redman and Vitaliy Churkin, will take it as a starting point of  a fresh round of the talks.    In the meantime, talks between Croatia and the republic of  Serb Krajina officials resume, Yugoslav and Croatian bureaus  have opened in Belgrade and Zagreb and a question of "a phased  economic restoration in the entire territory of the former  Yugoslavia" has been raised at a meeting of the working group in  charge of economic issues within the Geneva conference on the  former Yugoslavia.    No matter how utopian any of these issues might sound, a  peace option is mostly being considered and supported. The  major foothold is that the Americans and the Russians are so  deeply involved in Bosnia-Herzegovina that they would not let it  slip away so easily. They would otherwise lose face, which would  be a greater disgrace than the one the European Union had  experienced there.</p>

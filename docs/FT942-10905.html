			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Hawks and Handsaws: For the chop We are on our way out, men. Our Dunkirk looms. Our irrelevance grows more visible day by day. I am amazed at the speed of the distaff revolution: at how quickly the seething mass of womankind has inveigled itself into position for its attack on mankind. First we had millions of years of progressive and sensible evolution, during which we made our dispositions and thrashed out our gender roles. Then we had feminism, which was initially quite cute, smacking, as it did, of fairness and equality. Then - just like that - we were into post-feminism. Do you remember that? It was over in a trice. Now men are facing their final gory hour - the age of machisma. Evidence? There is tons of it. My week started badly with a report, in The Times, by Sally Jones, that well-known snoopy-drawers, on the horrible success of English female sporting teams. 'Why can't our men be more like our women?' was how the termagant Jones kicked-off her report, and on it went from there. Apparently, the English women's rugby team recently won the world championship. Apparently, last summer, the English women's cricket team won the World Cup. Apparently, the English women's football team has reached the quarter-finals of the European championship without losing a game. All of this, of course, in contrast to the various English men's teams, which are not worth a toss. I am too much the gent to describe the crop-haired, jetty-jawed, quaking-thighed, punch-you-in-the-mouth monstrosities that play in women's sports teams, especially England's. But I confess I was driven to tears by the whingeing that the Jones creature insinuated into her report, alongside the triumphalism. Apparently, sponsors are uncommonly hard to find for women's sport. Apparently, it cost each England female rugby player an estimated Pounds 6,000 to take part in the world championship and the internationals that preceded it. Not that this will last. The way things are going, female sports stars will soon be awash in sponsorship money. The day of the first Pounds 1m lipstick endorsement is not far away. Male sports stars, in contrast, will be stripped of their contracts, denuded of their glamour, marginalised and humiliated by the suddenly swelling horde of female sports writers: killers all, I have met quite a few. The second vicious experience of my unpleasant week was to be traumatised by Maureen Freely's exploitative novel, Under the Vulcania, published by Bloomsbury, whose name, as you know, is synonymous with shame. I can hardly bring myself to explain what Vulcania is about; can hardly sit here at the screen, typing these words, without falling into a froth. But I think I have to try, if only to bolster my claim that the age of machisma has entered its dawn-time. Vulcania is a palace of pleasure, set on a sculpted hilltop, attended by women - businesswomen, housewives - in order to recharge their batteries with personal servicing by discreet and well-muscled male undergraduates. I will not describe what goes on in the Rough Trader Saloon, the Hard-On Cafe or the cubicles of the Roman Baths. Suffice it to say that Under the Vulcania is scandalously voyeuristic, with no redeeming social or cultural values. The men are playthings, without dignity or feelings, to be used - and used again - and then cast away. The week's third incident was the falling into my hands of yet another book: Deadlier than the Male: Violence and Aggression in Women, by Alix Kirsta, from HarperCollins. Whereas Vulcania is just pornography, Deadlier than the Male is dynamite. It is a study of female anger, violence, hate and criminality. It is the first book, says the publisher, 'in which a woman dares to challenge the most persistent and cherished images of her own sex. Drawing on recent sensational criminal cases, diverse academic research and extensive personal interviews with violent women, Alix Kirsta probes the blackest recesses of the female psyche. The resulting revelations about women's aggressive instincts (are) chilling and shocking . . . In demonstrating that women have as great a capacity as men for destructiveness, she ensures that our view of women can never be the same again.' It is all quite clear, men. We are heading for the chop. Will we go quietly? I maintain that we should.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Channel Africa Report" program] </F>   [Text] The African National Congress [ANC] has announced  that it will begin a mass action campaign on Friday [25 March]  to demand free political activity in South Africa's  Natal-kwaZulu region. ANC spokesman (Sbhu Ndebele):    [Ndeble] The mass action is intended to mobilize all the  people who want to resolve their issues, political issues, in  Natal through elections. It will mobilize and demonstrate to  the people of Natal (?that) it's only a small minority in Natal  that is against elections, and indeed in the whole country we  have seen that out of the 26 parties that were at the World  Trade Center, only two parties today remain that are opposed to  the election -- namely, the Conservative Party [CP] with its AWB  [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] counterpart, with the CP in  Natal having pulled out of the nonelectioneering CP, and the  IFP. Those are the only two parties that are left today.    What is worrying us about the IFP is that it is doing what  even the Conservative Party is not doing. The Conservative  Party is not going on to hold election venues preventing other  parties, but the IFP has prevented us twice now in Umlazi and  kwaMashu from using stadiums that we were entitled to use. So  it is that development that is actually very, very worrying in  South Africa -- in Natal. Whoever wants peace will have to  support this form of action.    [Correspondent Gary Govindsamy] What if there's resistance  to  the march on Friday?    [Ndebele] Well, there has been resistance to the struggle  led  by the ANC since the 50's. The ANC has got the capacity to  overcome that.    [Govindsamy] Will this be another situation like that in  Bophuthatswana in Ulundi?    [Ndebele] Not exactly. Two situations are not the same.  Bophuthatswana, though it was not recognized by the whole world,  was as a matter of law recognized by the South African  Government and it was recognized in South African law as  independent. That is why we saw extraordinary measures being  taken there. KwaZulu is part of the South African law. It is  not regarded as independent. But on April the 27th the  constitution of 1993 will come into operation at midnight, and  that constitution does not recognize any of the self- governing  states, including kwaZulu or any of the so-called independent  bantustans -- Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, and so forth. So  there's no need for the ANC in Natal to be mobilizing their  energies to go and overthrow the Legislative Assembly of Ulundi  when that assembly won't be there on April 27.</p>

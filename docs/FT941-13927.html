			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Cyclist in the news Lord Justice Scott has been an enthusiastic cyclist for 'between 25 and 30 years', writes Jimmy Burns. He has never had an accident and never been insured. His first bike was second hand. He never chained it up and it was eventually stolen. For the last 20 years he has been on a slightly newer bike. 'I bought it for about for Pounds 80 - it was the cheapest in the shop. This time I invested in a padlock and chain.' Why no insurance for a judge who bicycles to his inquiry every morning? 'I've never really considered it. It is not clear that it is cost effective.'</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: BR's secret pot of gold? Sir, I am afraid that John Welsby, BR chief executive, railways (Letters, September 1), missed one major potential source of revenue for BR - actually enforcing the purchase of tickets by the travelling passengers. As a commuter who travels extensively on the rail network, I have become increasingly concerned and annoyed at just how easy it is to evade paying fares. I recently kept a regular log of when I was asked to produce my ticket. Over a three-month period the average was once every four days; on one occasion it was once in 16 days. It is clear that there has recently been a heavy fall-off in the number of station ticket-collecting staff and of stations at which staff are present, especially early morning and late evening. Penalty fares are no real deterrent at Pounds 10 a time. Are the uncollected revenues a secret pot of gold to encourage privatisation operators to bid for franchises?

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Survey of Scotland (6): Intriguing contradictions - Scotland's position in the EC pecking order AS THE states of the European Community tackle the difficult challenge of widening membership and deepening cooperation, Scotland faces a series of European tests of its own. The country has to secure its position in the pecking order governing the distribution of keenly fought over EC regional funds. It must seek to maximise benefits from the EC's 'single market' formally being put into place next year - a development which could bring particular benefits for Scottish financial services. And Scotland has to make its voice heard in the debate in Brussels and national capitals about 'subsidiarity' - allowing government decision-making to be carried out as close as possible to the people. Scotland's relationship with the EC throws up some intriguing contradictions. On the one hand, there is no argument about whether Scotland gets 'value for money' from the EC. It clearly does. As a region suffering from industrial decline, with a disproportionate share of rural areas requiring special support, Scotland has attracted a large amount of EC funding to help depressed areas. Mr Ian Lang, secretary of state for Scotland, recently pointed out that Scotland had benefited from nearly Pounds 1.5bn in structural fund assistance from Brussels since 1979. 'Denmark, like Scotland a small country at the north of Europe, but without the clout which the UK carries in the Community, has secured just one-sixth of that total,' Mr Lang declared. On the other hand, in the future battle for EC cash and industrial investment, Scotland will face some disadvantages. Mr Grant Baird, the head of Scotland's recently-established representative office in Brussels, Scotland Europa, sums up the position: 'Competition is going to get tougher. The funds will be coming. But any growth will be going to the poorer countries.' The gap in economic output per head between Scotland and the rest of the UK has narrowed in recent years, principally because Scotland has better weathered the downturn. Moreover, as a result of the accession of poorer southern countries during the past decade, Scottish gross domestic product (gdp) per head is about the EC average. Further, the shift in the Community's centre of gravity both eastwards and southwards has sharpened the problem of Scotland's peripheral position. Scotland in the past has relied on the US more than the rest of Europe for inward investment. Now Scottish industry is looking far more actively towards Europe. But corporate and government managers are aware that, when German companies seek a foothold in the EC, Scotland is now well down the priority list for investment. 'Scottish industry has not been very good at attracting EC money,' says Mr Baird, 'often because it doesn't know it is there.' One reason for the establishment of Scotland Europa was to put Scottish enterprises and institutions firmly on the Brussels map, searching for funds in, for example, EC research programmes. Scotland has already qualified for EC grants in the troubled fields of coal-mining, shipbuilding and textiles. Now it will be trawling for assistance from the EC's planned new programme for 'reconversion' of defence and electronics industries hit by the post-cold war downturn in European armaments spending. Another part of Scotland Europa's activities is to point out that, in a range of economic matters, Scotland's interests do not always necessarily coincide with those of the rest of the UK. Putting forward the Scotch whisky industry's point of view on EC alcohol levies, or making known the interests of Scottish power companies on European emission control plans, are two examples of Scotland Europa's work. In another area of special interest, Scotland has put in a bid for at least part of the activities of the European central bank, designed to run Europe's monetary affairs if and when economic and monetary union takes place towards the end of the 1990s. Scotland's bid has not been helped by rival campaigns from London and Manchester. Additionally, the effort has been hard hit by the UK's withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism in September. None the less, Edinburgh will be doing its best to press its candidature during this week's EC summit. The Royal Bank of Scotland is printing a special issue of Europeanised pound notes to coincide with the summit. A few are likely to be handed out as ceremonial gifts to heads of government. Having been part of monetary union with England since 1707, Scots have fewer qualms than people south of the border about giving up sovereignty to an EC central bank. But Scottish analysts also believe that Emu will be impracticable unless accompanied by a political union to provide a framework for intra-Community fiscal transfers necessary to make a single currency work. The debate about Scotland's place in Europe has been greatly affected both by the delays to the Maastricht process and by the setback for the Scottish National Party and the Labour party in April's general election. Up to this spring, many moderate Scots could support the idea of an eventual Scottish parliament dealing directly with a strengthened European executive in Brussels. Now, both notions - Scottish devolution (or full-scale independence), and a move towards a Maastricht-style federation in Europe - appear illusory. Scotland's voice in Europe will be heard firmly from within existing UK institutions; it seems unlikely that it will be very loud. The EC intends to set up a 'Committee of the Regions,' acting as an advisory body to the Commission and Council of Ministers on matters of regional importance. Unlike the position of other countries with a federal structure, Scotland however has no clear-cut right to send elected representatives to the committee. It has been assumed that Scotland would take up four seats out of the UK's allotment of 24 members of the committee, made up of representatives of Scottish local authorities. According to recent indications, however, the Scottish Office appears to believe that representation on the committee is purely a matter for the UK government to decide. This flies in the face of 'subsidiarity' - and could be a point of considerable irritation for the Scots. As Mr Craig Campbell of the Scottish Council Development and Industry puts it in a paper published this week, 'The overwhelming majority of members of the House of Commons supports the UK's active membership of the Community . . . The irony is that at a detailed policy level, the different parts of the UK can have very different interests, and there is not yet any adequate mechanism for expression of those interests.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, May 30 (YONHAP) -- South and North Korean  companies have struck the largest single barter deal ever, under  which the South will supply plastic products in exchange for  Northern mineral water and alcoholic beverages, the president of  the North Korean firm announced here Sunday.    Cha Kyong-chu, president of Korean Saemmul (well water) Co.  of Pyongyang, said his firm has signed a 60-million-U.S.-dollar  (500 million won) agreement with the Korea Plastic Industry  Cooperative (KPIC).    The two sides are seeking approval for the deal from their  respective governments, Cha said in an interview with YONHAP  News Agency.    Under the agreement, the North Korean company will ship some  30 million dollars worth of spring water, mineral water, soju  and beer, all of which carry the "Shindok" brand name, to the  South, Cha said.    The South Korean cooperative will supply plastic sheets used  to build hothouses for agricultural produce, PVC pipes, and  plastic wastebaskets, cups and water containers to the North, he  said.    The North Korean products will be shipped from Nampo port on  the west sea coast to Inchon, Pusan and Mokpo while South Korea  will deliver its goods to Nampo from Inchon and Pusan aboard  ships from a third country, Cha said.    Korean Saemmul Co. is a joint venture between Kenny Plastics  Co. (Hong Kong) Ltd., a subsidiary of Kenny Plastics Corp. of  the United States, and Korean Nungrado Trading Co. of North  Korea.    Cha is an ethnic Korean-American. Korean Saemmul is the only  North Korean company that exports mineral water produced in  Shindok with government approval. Its products are sold in  China and Hong Kong.</p>

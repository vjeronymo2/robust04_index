			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> STATE BUDGET ACCORD REACHED; $800 MILLION IN TAX, FEE HIKES  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian and leaders of the Legislature, capping a record 27-day  impasse, announced today that they have reached agreement on a state budget for  the fiscal year that began July 1.  </P> <P> The budget includes nearly $800 million in tax and fee increases, contains a  variety of cuts and curtails some automatic cost-of-living increases, they  said.  </P> <P> The $50-billion-plus budget includes an automatic "trigger" sought by  Deukmejian -- a mechanism that will automatically limit spending each year if  there is an unexpected decline in revenues.  </P> <P> The state has gone nearly a month into the new fiscal year without a budget,  the longest period in the state's history without a spending plan.  </P> <P> The hangup was caused by lawmakers' inability to agree on how best to cover a  $3.6 billion revenue shortfall.  </P> <P> "Now, we've got this proposal to present to the legislators. Hopefully, they  will pass it as quickly as possible," Deukmejian said. But, he added, "it's  always hard to get a two-thirds vote (in the Legislature)."  </P></p>

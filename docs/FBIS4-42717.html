			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jacques Fleury: "Prime Minister Welcomed Queen </F> of the Netherlands in Normandy Yesterday -- Balladur's  Pro-European Message"]    [Excerpts] Sainte-Mere-Eglise -- On the eve of large-scale  formal commemorations of the Normandy landing, Edouard Balladur  went to Pont-Audemer and Sainte-Mere-Eglise yesterday to  congratulate veterans.    The prime minister took advantage of the visits to remind  his  audience that peace must never be taken for granted and that  only a strong Europe can protect us from new disasters.    "Only with the support of our American allies could West  Europe rebuild itself and live in peace for 50 years," the prime  minister said. "Today, the world has changed. The success of  the West European model, which hinges on freedom, is no longer  being questioned. The Berlin Wall, which divided our continent,  is no more."    "Europe is undergoing change. This has been cause for  rejoicing among us. However, such change entails risks as well.  For the first time since 1945, war has returned to Europe,  spreading devastation in the former Yugoslavia. On this day of  commemoration, we must reaffirm our determination not to let  freedom and the values we all believe in be trampled underfoot."  <H5>  `Key Foundation' </H5>   "We also must do everything we can to ensure that such  situations cannot happen again" the prime minister went on.  "The Pact for Stability in Europe proposed by France could  prevent future crises. The European Union must take charge of  and improve its own defense system, alongside NATO, which will  remain the key foundation of solidarity between nations on both  sides of the ocean. Thus defended, and bolstered by democracy  throughout the continent, the very peace that was restored 50  years ago will thrive on the indestructible ties born, on both  sides of the Atlantic, of the belief that we share the same  values forged in yesterday's ordeals."    Edouard Balladur was accompanied by Foreign Minister Alain  Juppe, Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, and War Veterans  Minister Philippe Mestre. Before he spoke, a few paces from  Sainte-Mere-Eglise's small church, from whose spire Private John  Smith's parachute still hangs by way of a symbol, he welcomed  Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands as well as Netherlands Prime  Minister Lubbers, who had come to attend a commemoration of the  city's liberation by Netherlands troops. [passage omitted]    In Sainte-Mere-Eglise, the prime minister also congratulated  at length the U.S. veterans who had just completed their  parachute jump. Before speaking to the population, he visited  the war museum, reaffirming his conviction that a strong Europe  is peace's best safeguard.</p>

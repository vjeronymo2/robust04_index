			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MINORITIES AND PRIVATIZATION  </P> <P> The column "Privatization Is a Blunt Weapon Against Minorities" by Henry McGee  and Manuel Pastor (Op-Ed Page, Sept. 21) is obvious propaganda for those who  see the government as the be-all and end-all of human existence. They see the  "privatization" of public services as a threat to the ability of minority  groups to hold well-paying jobs.  </P> <P> If we wish to see the most economical and efficient enterprises in this  nation's economy, we must look to the private sector. Virtually any service  currently provided by government agencies can be more efficiently and  economically provided by competition in the free market. By free market I do  not mean the granting of a monopoly franchise to one company, but true  competition among any number of firms.  </P> <P> Why should the government run garbage collection, or fire protection, or waste  water treatment, or any of the dozens of departments they have created to boost  the clout of politicians and bureaucrats? There are plenty of examples in this  country and in others of successful private handling of these functions.  </P> <P> McGee and Pastor appear to argue that the taxpayers should be soaked for any  amount government bureaucrats seek to take from them, just so blacks and  Latinos can have well-paying jobs. Are they implying that no one else will hire  these people? If so, then are they qualified to do the jobs they are doing now?  The authors seem to forget that many of the same jobs would exist with private  companies. If the applicants with experience in public agencies are qualified,  then they will be hired.  </P> <P> Finally, the authors use the unfortunate example of a woman prisoner being  raped by guards from a private extradition service. They obviously trust that  guards employed by the state of California would never think of abusing  prisoners in any way! Come on! Privatization does not mean abuse and  inefficiency. Give us the free market for awhile and just see the change for  the better.  </P> <P> TED BROWN  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

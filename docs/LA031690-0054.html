			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> JAPANESE-DERIVED 'BLIND FURY' A WOULD-BE ACTION COMEDY  </P> <P> "Blind Fury" (citywide) is a numskull, cornball action comedy about an American  soldier in Vietnam who, blinded in battle, is nursed back to health by  villagers and schooled in the art of swordsmanship.  </P> <P> The blind-swordsman gimmick derives from the Japanese "Zatoichi" series, but  Japanese action scenarios have often provided rousing starting points for  Westernized reworkings -- witness "The Seven Samurai." The double whammy, of  course, is that many of the Japanese actioners are, in turn, based on Western  models.  </P> <P> "Blind Fury" (rated R for violence and strong language) should be a lot more  fun than it is; the cultural cross-fertilization ought to result in something  zippier and weirder than this slovenly bash-a-thon, particularly since its star  is the Dutch Rutger Hauer and its director is the Australian Philip Noyce.  </P> <P> The script by the all-too-American Charles Robert Carner doesn't provide the  kind of exalted cartoon situations that might have made all this nonsense  enjoyable -- like, for example the Arnold Schwarzenegger/John Irvin "Raw Deal"  of a few years back. "Blind Fury" is a rehashing of movies you passed on the  first time, like, uh, "Over the Top."  </P> <P> Hauer's Nick Parker, back in America after 20 years in the jungles, looks up  the family of an old war buddy (Terrance O'Quinn) in Miami and becomes  entangled in a gangland drug war. The film's centerpiece is Nick's bus ride  from Miami to Reno with his friend's snot-nosed kid (Brandon Call) in tow.  Naturally, a heavy-duty, pseudo-father-son bond ensues. When the real father  turns up, we're treated to a Chaplinesque fade-out. The Blind Swordsman as  Little Tramp is not exactly a brainstorm.  </P> <P> The cruddiness of "Blind Fury" -- which has been on the shelf for a while -- is  particularly depressing because it represents the sort of project that is being  offered these days to people of real talent. Not just Hauer, who has been  straining to carve out an American career, or Noyce, whose first Hollywood film  this is, but an actor such as O'Quinn, who gave an absolutely smashing, major  performance in "The Stepfather" back when he was billed as Terry O'Quinn. Even  if these people entered into "Blind Fury" willingly, with at least the hope of  scoring a hit and creating some clout, the results must be scary and not a  little dispiriting -- like blindly swinging a sword at a roomful of enemies.  </P> <P> 'BLIND FURY'  </P> <P> A Tri-Star Pictures release. Executive producers Robert Cort and David Madden.  Producer Daniel Grodnik and Tim Matheson. Director Philip Noyce. Screenplay  Charles Robert Carner. Music J. Peter Robinson.

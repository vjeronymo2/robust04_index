			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Beware the election euphoria - Diary of a Private Investor AS A private investor, I am pleased with the result of the UK general election. But the City's immediate euphoria - with the FT-SE 100 leaping 136.2 points on the day after the election - seems a bit too much too soon, bearing in mind the increasing troubles in eastern Europe; stock market, banking and property problems in Japan; and continuing unhappy economic trends in the US, UK and many other countries. I am certainly not rushing to buy shares at present prices. At least the UK election campaign did not last long, and we should have political stability for the next few years, unlike the US where the presidential campaigns drag on into November with neither of the leading candidates having much to recommend him. Perhaps there will be a 'late entrant' to the race who will command more widespread respect and support. On the home front, what will the benefits be now the Conservatives are back? Take inheritance tax, for a start. In the Budget, chancellor Norman Lamont proposed important exemptions from IHT on certain shareholdings. For example, if someone dies owning more than 25 per cent of an unquoted or USM company, no IHT will be due on that holding. If he dies owning a controlling interest in a company quoted on the main market, or a holding of 25 per cent or less in an unquoted or USM company, there also will be a reduction in the IHT bill. Legislation for these proposals was delayed because of the election. Presumably, the government will now seek to enact it as soon as possible. This means there will eventually be a number of elderly, wealthy people reducing their small minority investments in a wide range of companies (or reducing their cash piles) and investing instead in holdings of 25 per cent or more in certain companies in order to reduce their IHT bills. If a private investor can spot the likely targets for such investments and buy shares before those wealthy folk do, then excellent profits could be made. The reason is that the shares would zoom upwards when any such 25 per cent-plus deals were announced. Of course, the shares might then fall back over the years since the wealthy folk could be less inclined to disinvest (even if faced with declining dividends and lacklustre performance) because they wish to cling on to the inheritance tax advantages of their holdings. Takeover activity should continue under a Conservative government and I shall try to discover new takeover targets. A government is only as good as its ministers, though. On that basis, John Major's administration looks highly promising. Michael Heseltine, as the new minister for trade and industry, has long been known for his support of small businesses and his wish to see big changes in parts of Britain's infrastructure. I am delighted with the arrival of Neil Hamilton and the other new faces at the Department of Trade and Industry. Hopefully, they can be persuaded to replace the costly bureaucratic City regulatory bodies with a single, cheaper, genuinely-independent body with teeth; and engineer legislation and tax changes to allow and encourage direct investment in shares by private investors, rather than continuing to favour institutional and 'manager-controlled' investments.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: Baltica claim against ex-parent Baltica Insurance, the Danish insurance company, is claiming up to DKr590m (Dollars 91m) in compensation from its former parent, Baltica Holding, now known as Gefion. Baltica Insurance's claim arises because the former parent company last year sold shares owned by Baltica Insurance in the French insurer, Victoire, for DKr1bn. But the buyer - Victoire's parent, Suez - revealed it had paid DKr1.36bn for the shares. Baltica Insurance wants to know how the difference arose and believes it has a claim against Gefion for at least DKr360m and up to DKr590m, according to Gefion yesterday. Gefion rejects the claim. The dispute is the latest twist in a long saga, which led to the collapse of Baltica Holding last year, when it was rescued by a capital injection from Den Danske Bank, the largest Danish bank. This left Gefion as a minority shareholding in Baltica Insurance. Baltica Holding's troubles were in part caused by a hostile raid by its Danish rival Hafnia in 1991. Hafnia collapsed in 1992 and its insurance business was taken over last year by Codan, the Danish insurance company. Baltica Holding fought off Hafnia by bringing in Suez as a main shareholder. Baltica Holding and Baltica Insurance acquired holdings in the French companies. The French and Danish companies sold their stakes in each other last year. Suez will announce its decision on Victoire, its insurance unit, at its shareholders' meeting on June 15, Mr Gerard Worms, chairman, said yesterday, Reuter adds from Paris.</p>

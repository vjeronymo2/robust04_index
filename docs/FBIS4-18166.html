			<p>CSO       [Editorial report] In a report in the 7 March Stockholm  business weekly VECKANS AFFARER on pages 17 and 18, Ewa Hedlund  looks at with which EU [European Union] countries Sweden will  likely find common cause and how well it will do implementing  the rules of the single market. Sweden will have the most in  common with Germany, Denmark, and Britain. It is expected to  cooperate with Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands on  environmental issues, and with Germany and Denmark on labor  market policy. On social policy, its likely partners will be  Denmark and Belgium. In addition, it is expected to find common  cause with Germany on industrial policy and budgetary matters,  and with Britain on free trade, competition policy, and state  subsidies. It will probably only be able to form alliances with  the southern European countries on single issues: for instance,  with Spain on regional policy and Greece on veterinary matters.  Sweden will be closest to the French position on foreign and  security policy issues. Portugal will be an ally on matters  concerning the influence of smaller countries, as will Belgium.    In an interview with Hedlund, Christer Asp, the deputy  permanent representative in Brussels, promised that Sweden would  be diligent in instituting the rules of the single market. "We  will very much uphold the common rules and laws. The strength  of cooperation is achieved by having set rules." He predicts  that Sweden will soon surpass Britain, currently on top, in the  number of regulations implemented. Asp also notes that Sweden's  foremost aim as a member of the EU will be to defend the  interests of small countries and "not get squeezed between the  large trading countries."</p>

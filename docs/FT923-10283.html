			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: Earnings at Credit Suisse climb CREDIT SUISSE, Switzerland's third largest bank, saw consolidated pre-tax profit, before provisions and write-downs, rise 8.4 per cent to SFr1.44bn (Dollars 1.09bn) in the first half. However, it reported that profits deteriorated in the second quarter and warned that if the economic situation in Switzerland continued to worsen, this year's provisions by the parent company might have to be larger than last year's SFr993m. The bank had previously forecast that provisions would be at about the same level as last year. Consolidated income from interest-related business rose only 3.4 per cent in the first half to SFr1.2bn, reflect ing significantly weaker growth in lendings and provisions taken to cover the risk of borrowers not meeting interest payments. Commission income soared 22.7 per cent to SFr837m, mainly because of better receipts from commercial banking, current account, investment management and securities administration activities. Commissions on stock exchange and new issue business were down slightly. Income from trading in securities, foreign exchange, precious metals and interest rate instruments rose 10.8 per cent to SFr782m. Total consolidated assets reached SFr163.7bn at the end of June, up 5.2 per cent from the end of last year. The parent company's gross profit rose only 5.4 per cent in the first half to SFr1.07m. The bank said that 'the persistently sluggish economy and tight interest rates have exacerbated risks, particularly in Switzerland where small and medium-sized businesses, as well as real estate companies in western Switzerland, are being hit especially hard.'</p>

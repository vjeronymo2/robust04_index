			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Experts from 22 countries of our continent, who are  participating in the meeting called for by the Economic  Commission for Latin America (ECLA) and the United Nations  Environment Program (UNEP), approved in Santiago on 18 November  a recommendation that their governments implement a regional  agreement banning the importation of all types of wastes that  could be dangerous for the region.    They also called on the member parties of the Brasilea  Agreement [not further identified] to totally ban this trade  from industrialized countries to developing nations. ``The  dispatch of waste from First World countries for processing or  recycling has been transformed into a mechanism that in practice  camouflages the uncontrolled and indiscriminate transfer of  dangerous waste,'' the experts stressed.    The participants agreed in indicating that Latin American  and  Caribbean countries do not have the capability to process their  own toxic wastes, thus making it very difficult for them to take  charge of toxic waste from other areas.</p>

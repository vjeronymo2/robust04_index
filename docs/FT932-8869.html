			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / The Week Ahead: Results Due MARKS AND SPENCER, the UK food and clothing retailer, is expected to announce a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 627.2m to between Pounds 710m and Pounds 730m. The average forecast of about Pounds 725m represents an increase of 16 per cent, but last year's figures were reduced by exceptional redundancy costs of almost Pounds 50m. Stripping these out, the profits increase is likely to be between 7 and 8 per cent, reflecting a considerable pick-up in sales in the second half, thanks partly to M &amp; S's 'outstanding value' promotions. Storehouse, which includes the BhS and Mothercare chains, should report pre-tax profits on Thursday of about Pounds 13m to Pounds 15m, after exceptional items. As these are mainly one-off costs relating to disposals aimed at streamlining the business, analysts expect the City to pay more attention to the pre-exceptional figure, forecast at between Pounds 40m and Pounds 45m. That would represent a significant increase on last year's Pounds 15.8m when there were no exceptional items. Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, is expected to report tomorrow pre-tax profits of Pounds 500m for the six months to March 31. This compares with Pounds 488m under the old accounting rules which stripped out extraordinary items. Half year profits have been helped by around Pounds 25m of exceptional profits relating to disposals, the depreciation of sterling against the dollar and a good result from Cavenham Forest Industries in the US. Whitbread, opening another round of brewers' results today, is expected to report pre-tax profits little changed from last year at around Pounds 222m. Volume growth for the group's beer brands is likely to be offset by margin pressures and increased marketing expenditure; but improved first half trading by the retail division has been maintained. Full year results from Allied-Lyons today should show profits up from Pounds 610m to Pounds 618m, at the top end of market forecasts. The group's leading spirits brands have achieved further growth and on the retailing side, Victoria Wine and Dunkin' Donuts have had a good year. Bass, on Wednesday, is expected to report a 5 per cent fall in interim profits to Pounds 245m against a restated Pounds 259m. Brewing profits are likely to show little change and retailing is still suffering from the reduction in pub numbers. Holiday Inn profits will benefit from the upturn in the US, but these gains will be partly offset by poor returns from the European operation. British Airways is expected to report tomorrow lower profits of around Pounds 200m-Pounds 180m for its financial year ending March compared with Pounds 284m the previous year. The airline is also expected to launch a rights issue to raise up to Pounds 400m to strengthen its balance sheet at a time of difficult trading conditions and a series of significant equity investments in other international carriers.</p>

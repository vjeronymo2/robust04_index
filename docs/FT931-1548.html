			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Clyde calls for Pounds 34m as losses hit Pounds 40m CLYDE Petroleum, the UK exploration and production company, yesterday called on shareholders for Pounds 34m and at the same time reported a 1992 after-tax loss of Pounds 39.8m. The loss reflected a change in accounting policy and the subsequent write-off of Pounds 42.3m of costs of unsuccessful exploration. The year earlier net loss was a restated Pounds 1.2m after a Pounds 32.7m write-off. Turnover dropped to Pounds 83.3m (Pounds 87.2m) Mr Colin Phipps, chairman, said the rights issue would give the company a cash cushion following the go-ahead of its development of the Gryphon field in the North Sea later this year. 'This is a major sea-change within Clyde - we're moving to the fast track development of Gryphon,' he said. Originally, Gryphon was due to come on stream in 1996 but Clyde now plans to start production in the final quarter of this year. That would involve investment of Pounds 90m - Clyde has a 35 per cent stake in Gryphon - this year which would push the company's debt to equity ratio to over 100 per cent. Mr Malcolm Gourlay, chief executive, said: 'We're at a peak of our expenditure this year and the rights issue will help keep that under control'. The rights issue, of 79.86m shares on a 1-for-4 basis, will give Clyde the flexibility to continue its exploration programme overseas while it proceeds with UK developments. Cashflow will increase to Pounds 350m next year as the company's production rises to 55,000 barrels a day in the second quarter from a current level of 23,874 b/d. With the strong cashflow, the company plans to pay down its debt quickly and reduce gearing from the 100 per cent level to 60 per cent by 1994 and 15 per cent by the end of 1996. The company is looking at break-even this year with possibly a small profit or loss. For 1994, when it hopes to return to profit, it plans to pay an interim dividend of 0.5p followed by a final of 1p.</p>

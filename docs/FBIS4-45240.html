The teams carried out an operation against the occupants  of the villa, which stands on four donums of land. The teams,  who were armed with automatic firearms, surrounded the villa,  the courtyard of which was sealed off by a high wall and barbed  wire. The teams crawled to the building and established how  many drug traffickers were inside. Then they went in.    Under the command of Ismail Caliskan, director of the  Directorate of Police Narcotics Department, they broke down the  front door and stormed the building. They arrested the drug  traffickers without giving them an opportunity to use their  arms. The production center was on the ground floor. The teams  discovered 60 kg of heroin and morphine base, three handguns,  one of which was automatic, and a large quantity of ammunition  in the attic.</p>

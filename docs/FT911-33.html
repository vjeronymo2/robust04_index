			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Brent Walker shares drop ahead of loss BRENT Walker's shares tumbled yesterday as the heavily borrowed leisure group confirmed that losses last year would lead to a 'major reduction in shareholders' funds'. The company has also delayed announcement of its preliminary results from tomorrow until next Monday. Brent Walker's shares closed 16p lower at 40p. 'Although the group produced profits at the operating level, it sustained a substantial loss for the year after taking into account interest, exceptional items and taxation,' the company said. It made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 82.2m in the year to December 1989. The delay in the 1990 results pushes back publication of the financial restructuring plan Brent Walker is thrashing out with Hill Samuel, the merchant bank acting as its advisers. The steering committee of creditor banks, led by Standard Chartered, has yet to see a Touche Ross report on Brent Walker's assets and liabilities on which the package will be based. The firm was asked last November for the report when the banks agreed a standstill on Pounds 1.4bn of debt. Banks expect a write-down in Brent Walker's asset values of Pounds 1bn to about Pounds 100m net of debt. London Stock Exchange, Page 40</p>

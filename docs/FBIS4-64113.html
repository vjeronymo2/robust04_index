			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [IPRINDA press agency report under rubric "According to </F> Reports From Correspondents and Information Agencies":  "Statement by the Political Council"]    [Text] On 17 May, the Georgian Social-Democratic Party  (GSDP) Political Council disseminated an appeal to the  republic's population in which an analysis is given of the  complex sociopolitical situation. Proceeding from this, the  GSDP Political Council believes: The head of the Georgian state  should resign and, at the same time, a national salvation  committee that will be able to implement laws should be formed.  Otherwise, considers the Political Council, it will be  impossible to speak about the territorial integrity of Georgia,  its independence, and the physical salvation of the Georgian  nation.</p>

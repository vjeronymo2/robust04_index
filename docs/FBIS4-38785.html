			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and Mikhail </F> Melnik]    [Text] Kiev June 1 TASS -- "The wrong regional policy of  the former Soviet Union and the uncertainty of the fate of the  Black Sea Fleet are the top two objective causes of the Crimean  problem," Ukrainian parliament chairman Oleksandr Moroz said.    Speaking at a session of the parliament on Wednesday, Moroz  said that among the subjective causes are "intolerance in  solving ethnic problems and the clash of several nationalist  tendencies."    "It is necessary now to neutralise these factors as soon as  possible by restoring economic ties and providing conditions for  normal rest and recreation in the Crimea," Moroz said.    He stressed that Ukraine must use all possible diplomatic  channels to ease tension and put the problem within the  constitutional framework, without using force.</p>

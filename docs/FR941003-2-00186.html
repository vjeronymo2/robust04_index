			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Section 22(f) was designed to bar only those restrictions on transferability or negotiability not disclosed to the holder of the subject security or expressly prohibited by Commission rule or regulations, neither of which circumstances would apply to the restriction of transferability of a director's benefits under the Plan. Such restriction is clearly set forth in the Plan, is included primarily to benefit the participating director, and does not adversely affect the interests of the directors or of a shareholder of any Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. With respect to section 22(g), the legislative history of the Act suggests that Congress was concerned with the dilutive effect on the equity and voting power of common stock of, or units of beneficial interest in, an open-end company if the company's securities were issued for consideration not readily valued. Applicants assert that the Plan would not have this effect. Also, a director's right to receive payments under the Plan are not granted in return for services or property other than cash already owed to the director. Although any director's fees that may be payable to a director would clearly be for services rendered, a Fund's obligation to pay such fees would exist whether or not the Plan was in effect. The Plan would merely provide for deferral of the payment of such fees and thus any rights under the Plan should be viewed as being ``issued'' not for services but for the Fund's not being required to pay such fees on a current basis. Thus, the requested exemption of the proposed deferred fee arrangement and future transactions effected pursuant to such arrangement from section 22(g) of the Act would not be inconsistent with the protection of investors and the purposes of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Section 17(a)(1) of the Act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such person, from selling any security to such registered investment company. The section was designed to prevent sponsors of investment companies from using investment company assets as capital for enterprises with which they are associated or to acquire controlling interest in such enterprises. Applicants believe that the sale of securities issued by the various series of the Funds pursuant to the Plan does not implicate Congress concerns in enacting this section, but merely facilities the matching of the liabilities for Deferred Fees with Designated Shares, the value of which determines the amount of such liabilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Rule 2a&hyph;7 provides that the current price per share of any ``money market fund'' may be computed by use of the amortized cost method or the penny-rounding method, provided that the money market funds meets certain conditions. These conditions include, among others, (a) that the money market fund limit its investments to securities that have a remaining maturity of 397 days or less and that meet certain quality standards and (b) that the money market fund will not maintain a dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity that exceeds 90 days. Applicants believe that an exemption from rule 2a&hyph;7 for each money market fund to the limited extent required to permit them to invest in Designated Shares (and to exclude Designated Shares from the calculation of such series' dollar-weighted average maturities) is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Such an exemption would permit the series in question to achieve an exact matching of Designated Shares with the deemed investments of the Deferred Fee Accounts, thereby ensuring that the deferred fee arrangements will not affect net asset value. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d&hyph;1 thereunder are designed to limit or prevent a registered investment company's joint or joint and several participation with an affiliated person in a transaction in connection with any joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan on a basis different or less advantageous than that of the affiliated person. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Under the Plan, each Fund will have discretion to set aside cash to fund the general obligations accruing thereunder, and each Fund may invest cash in those shares of one or more series of Funds representing Designated Shares. Adjustments are to be made to the Deferred Fee Accounts to reflect the income, gain or loss with respect to the Designated Shares. The changes in value would be identical to the changes in share value experienced by any shareholder of the same series during the same period, but whose shares were not held in a Deferred Fee Account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As an affiliated person, the participating director would neither directly nor indirectly receive a benefit that would otherwise inure to the Funds or any of their shareholders and thus the Plan would not constitute a joint or joint and several participation by any Fund with an affiliated person on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of the affiliated person. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants agree that the order of the Commission granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. With respect to the requested relief from rule 2a&hyph;7, any money market series of the Funds that values its assets by the amortized cost method will buy and hold Designated Shares that determine the performance of Deferred Fee Accounts to achieve an exact match between such series' liability to pay deferred fees and the assets that offset that liability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. If a Fund purchases Designated Shares issued by an affiliated Fund, the Fund will vote such shares in proportion to the votes of all other holders of shares of such affiliated Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

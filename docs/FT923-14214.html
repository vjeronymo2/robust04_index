			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: BR sale to stress quality of service TRANSPORT ministers will next week try to present the privatisation of British Rail as an opportunity to improve service quality before the next general election, Ralph Atkins writes. The long-awaited white paper on BR's privatisation will stress the possible benefits in terms of increased flexibility in rail services, improved customer service and lower fares. The department regards the sell-off as unique in that there will be less emphasis on the amount it will raise for the Treasury. Legislation for the sale allowing private-sector companies to bid to run services is expected to be brought before parliament after the summer recess, with the first franchises in 1994. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, is expected to argue that the continuing high level of public subsidy for the railways continuing means the government will continue to have a say over the level of services. No rush for franchises is expected. His department has been talking with private-sector companies, particularly those already involved in transport, about possible deals and about the transfer of more freight on to rail. BR's freight division will be sold outright.</p>

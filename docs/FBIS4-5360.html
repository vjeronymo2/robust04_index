			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "And Now Even the Withdrawal of U.S. Forces From </F> the ROK Is Raised"]    [Text] The U.S. Congress released a report stating that  the United States may consider withdrawing U.S. Forces stationed  in the ROK under the condition that North Korea completely give  up nuclear development. The report is based on an analysis of  choices of military measures in case North Korea does not give  up nuclear development to the last.    U.S. Congressional reports do not necessarily reflect a U.S.  Administration's policies. And there has been no sign that the  U.S. Administration is considering such a scenario. However,  the United States is a country moved by public opinion. U.S.  Congressional reports are reference materials for U.S.  lawmakers' parliamentary activities. In this regard, the report  is noteworthy. It comes as a shock that this U.S. Congressional  report has turned to the negotiation strategy of trading the  withdrawal of U.S. Forces from the ROK for North Korea's nuclear  development.    The withdrawal of U.S. Forces from the ROK is the last  choice  of negotiation strategies. It is natural to doubt if it would  be actually realized. It is notable that the withdrawal of U.S.  Forces from the ROK was raised after the snag of the U.S. plan  to deploy Patriot missiles on its own expenses with an aim to  reinforce the U.S. Forces in the ROK in preparation for a  possible contingency. It has been learned that our government's  odd action of making a military defensive weapon as a diplomatic  weapon put the U.S. Forces in the ROK in an awkward situation.    Another noteworthy fact is the U.S. military authorities'  information analysis that North Korea already has one or two  nuclear bombs. Quoting the analysis, the U.S. Congressional  report believes that North Korea possesses one or two primitive  nuclear bombs and is able to transport them by truck. This is  different from our government's opinion which denies the  possibility on every occasion. It is puzzling on what basis the  government has come to this assertion and to what extent should  we believe it.    Let us calmly reanalyze North Korea's intention to develop  nuclear weapons. There could be many different opinions but it  is safe to take the worst possible situation. That is North  Korea's long-desired political goal of the withdrawal of U.S.  Forces from the ROK is achieved. As long as North Korea  believes the nuclear threat could effectively block the  involvement of the U.S. Forces in the ROK in the contingency, it  will never be satisfied with any carrot other than a condition  that could achieve the goal. In this regard, the U.S.  Congressional report makes us uncomfortable.    Shall we refute that this creates a crisis on the Korean  peninsula? Shall we repeat the optimistic observation that  North Korea does not possess nuclear weapons? The government  should first of all do its best in clearing up distrust and  suspicion that the government is doing nothing.</p>

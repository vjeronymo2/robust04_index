			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Consortium buys German news agency VWD-Vereinigte Wirtschafts-dienste, a leading German financial news agency, has been bought by a consortium of German and US publishers. The buyers are Dow Jones, the US information group which owns the Wall Street Journal, and the two German companies which publish the Handelsblatt, a daily business newspaper, and the Frankfurter Allgemeiner, Germany's most influential daily newspaper. The buyers are taking a third each of the company which last year generated revenues of DM40.8m (Dollars 23.3m), 70 per cent of which came from electronically distributed services. The shares were previously owned by the Deutsche Presse-Agentur, another news agency, and two other companies. The new shareholders said they would strengthen and develop VWD's position as Germany's leading news agency for finance and business. As part of the transaction VWD has signed an agreement with Dow Jones covering the supply and exchange of financial news. This would secure VWD's sourcing of news over the long term, the agency said. No details of the price were given but the issued share capital is to be increased.</p>

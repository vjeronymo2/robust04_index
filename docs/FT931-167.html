			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Observer: GM's insider Morgan Grenfell chairman John Craven has survived as a member of Deutsche Bank's board of managing directors since 1990 and Deutsche's Ellen Schneider-Lenne has been on the board of ICI since 1991. Even so, a few eyebrows may be raised at the sight of Louis Hughes, General Motors' big wheel in Europe, going on Deutsche Bank's supervisory board. Not only is he probably the first US business executive to be welcomed on to the supervisory board of a German blue chip, but he is joining the board of a company holding a big stake in one of his rivals, Daimler-Benz. But Hughes, a German speaker who used to run GM's Opel operation, is more attuned to German customs than most North Americans. So he probably won't have much difficulty fitting in with the strange customs of Germany's corporate establishment. Indeed, the real surprise about the appointment is how Hughes can find the time to do it, given that his own responsibilities now stretch well beyond Europe.</p>

			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / French foreign minister warns against protectionist responses to problems of recession and rising unemployment France must avoid protectionist responses to the problems of recession and rising unemployment, Mr Alain Juppe, foreign minister, warned at the weekend, John Ridding reports from Paris. Speaking at a conference of parliamentarians from the RPR party, the dominant partner of the ruling centre-right coalition government, Mr Juppe described protectionism as one of the main threats to jobs in France. Unemployment, currently at 11.7 per cent of the workforce, is expected to exceed 12 per cent by the end of the year. The French government has been accused of a protectionist stance by international trading partners as result of its position on agricultural trade. In particular, France is demanding changes to an EC-US agricultural deal which is crucial to completing an agreement on the Uruguay Round of international trade negotiations. At their weekend meeting at the western port of La Rochelle, RPR lawmakers voted unanimously in support of a motion calling on the government to veto any agricultural agreement which damaged French interests.</p>

			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNITED EUROPE: WHAT, WHO, WHEN;  </P> <P> EUROPOWER; THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO EUROPE'S ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION IN 1992 BY  NICHOLAS COLCHESTER AND DAVID BUCHAN (TIMES BOOKS/RANDOM HOUSE: $22.50; 256  PP., ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> During the early 1980s, France, Germany, England and the other nine members of  the European Community -- what Americans often call the Common Market --  finally negotiated common noise levels for lawn mowers. The idea was that  manufacturers in one country should be able to sell their wares throughout the  region without hassle. It took six years of bureaucratic wrangling to reach  agreement.  </P> <P> Since 1987, these same countries have committed by 1992 to harmonize their  respective laws on trade, travel, transport, construction services, government  purchasing and banking. They have set their near-term sites on substituting a  single European currency for francs, lire, pounds and marks -- and on creating  a European Central Bank to manage the whole show. They have even scheduled a  summit for this December to discuss political union.  </P> <P> Are we seeing a basic transformation of the Old World into a United States of  Europe, a new fountain of political ideas and industrial energy, and a powerful  rival to the United States and Japan? Or is this the same old Common Market,  just combining a temporary burst of vitality with some clever public relations,  more flash than substance?  </P> <P> In "Europower," two of Europe's most influential journalists -- Nicholas  Colchester, deputy editor of the Economist, and David Buchan, Brussels  correspondent of the Financial Times -- have concluded that something truly  historic is taking place across the Atlantic. Call it a triumph of cooperation  over centuries of animosities; call it a kind of supranationalism that  eventually will become necessary for more countries in the global economy; call  it what you like -- real change is occurring, they say, and the continent will  never be the same again.  </P> <P> "Europower" masterfully illustrates the practical obstacles that must be  overcome before the European Community can realize its aspirations. For  example, the authors describe the progress that has been made in lowering  customs barriers, but they also point out that even if commerce cannot be  stopped at the borders, other obstacles can be just as frustrating, such as  different systems in each country for taxing or different standards for health  and safety.  </P> <P> They show that even though the Common Market can decree that European banks are  free to set up shop throughout the continent and conduct all the business they  would at home, at the same time local customs and ordinances still can clip the  wings of foreign financial institutions. They demonstrate how the ideal of free  travel within the Common Market leads to problems in apprehending drug dealers,  terrorists and money launderers. They illustrate the far-reaching nature of  what has become European law, but admit how difficult it often is to enforce.  </P> <P> A second theme of "Europower" is the debate over "deepening" the community  versus "widening" it. There are those who want to confine the evolution of the  Common Market to its current 12 members -- at least for the next several years  -- and to concentrate on deepening integration among the existing core group.  To proponents of this approach, the overwhelming priority is to complete the  process of integration to remove all existing barriers to trade, to create a  single currency and a single central bank, and to build a system for common  political management.  </P> <P> But not everyone agrees. Others want to broaden the community to include new  members like Norway, Sweden, Poland and Hungary. They understand that bringing  in nations with such diverse traditions and needs would slow the pace of  integration, but it's a price they are willing to pay (or, if they are  skeptical of too much integration, it's a price they are happy to pay).  </P> <P> Colchester and Buchan also highlight the arguments taking place over the  political accountability which big, supranational European institutions -- such  as a new European Central Bank -- would have to national parliaments. This is  perhaps the single biggest philosophical issue facing West European leaders.  Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, for one, is appalled by the notion that  interest rates and taxes in Birmingham or Brighton could be decided in Brussels  or Frankfurt without the advice and consent of locally elected British  officials who are responsible to grass-roots constituencies.  </P> <P> Finally, the authors explain the details of the entire program called "Europe  of 1992." They provide an easily understood road map of the Community's  political and economic institutions and how they work. And they manage to cover  every important area of policy endeavor, including money, trade, immigration,  anti-trust, law and defense industries.  </P> <P> "Europower" seems to have been written primarily for a European audience,  mainly to explain what's going on. Americans could use this information, too.  But aside from digesting the facts, how should we feel about a United Europe of  one sort or another?  </P> <P> Certainly we are all for measures that give our friends and allies a better  life, and we should be happy about economic and social links that make an  intra-European war ever more remote. In addition, an American might well admire  Europe for the remarkable momentum it has generated, starting from a stagnant  position in the mid-1980s. We might be a bit envious about the political  exhilaration and unbridled optimism across the Atlantic, at a time when we are  mired in debts, deficits, banking scandals, soaring crime and deteriorating  schools.  </P> <P> Beyond all this, however, additional concerns might be warranted. A united  Europe may be a big market for IBM, General Motors and AT&amp;T, but it is sure  to make European firms more competitive in everything from aerospace to  insurance. We might be happy that Europe is strong enough to look after itself,  but as a new, powerful political entity the Community is sure to be more  independent of Washington, whether the issue is currency alignment or support  in the Middle East. A unified Europe will be a house for a reunified Germany,  much to the relief of those with even passing knowledge of the past 100 years.  But how long will it be before Berlin controls the keys?  </P> <P> Colchester and Buchan do not directly examine these issues. Between the lines,  however, it is not hard for an American reader to find them.  </P> <P> BOOKMARK: For an excerpt from "Europower: The Essential Guide to Europe's  Economic Transformation in 1992," see the Opinion section, Page 2.  </P></p>

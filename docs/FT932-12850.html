			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Shuttle launched years late THE US space shuttle Columbia went into orbit yesterday with seven astronauts on a science mission chartered by Germany and years overdue, AP reports from Cape Canaveral. It was Nasa's third attempt to launch Columbia on the laboratory research mission. The first, a month ago, ended abruptly with an engine shutdown. Eighty-eight Spacelab experiments are planned involving about 200 scientists from around the world, including a slew of medical tests. All science will be managed from the control centre in Germany, with Nasa's Johnson Space Centre in Houston overseeing everything else on the nine-day flight. The only other time a US space mission has been controlled from outside the US was during Germany's first Spacelab flight, aboard shuttle Challenger in 1985. This mission was targeted for 1988 but put on hold along with everything else after Challenger exploded in 1986.</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / People: Cox quits Stock Exchange Lynton Jones, the new chief executive of OM London, part of the Swedish futures and options exchange group, has persuaded an old friend from stock exchange days, Peter Cox (right), to join him as director of business development. Cox, 45, has been at the London Stock Exchange for a total of 16 years, and is best known as the founder of SEAQ International and, more recently, for masterminding the introduction of on-line trade confirmation service SEQUAL. He had been head of business development for the past year, a post he says will not be directly filled, but he is unwilling to discuss his reasons for leaving. The Exchange adds that it expects to make an announcement in the next fortnight concerning the reorganisation of the market development area. 'While there had been a natural break after the SEQUAL project, we tried very hard to make sure there was a role for him elsewhere in the exchange' a spokeswoman said, who acknowledged his departure was a big loss. Jones, who was at the London Stock Exchange himself between 1983-1987, and who has been brought in to extend the range of products and exchange linkages at OM London, says he worked alongside Cox on the strategic plan for Big Bang. Later, when Jones was running the London outpost of Nasdaq, the two were again in frequent contact. 'Peter is an ideal choice; the only thing he doesn't have is direct experience of derivatives' says Jones, who adds he is also looking for a marketing director 'who will not come from the Stock Exchange'. ***** Sir Christopher Benson yesterday announced plans to step down from the chairmanship of MEPC, the UK's second largest property company, in July 1993 after nearly 20 years on its board. The new chairman will be Lord Blakenham, who is also chairman of Pearson, the media and industrial group which owns the Financial Times. He has been on the board since 1990, and his will be a non-executive position, in contrast with Sir Christopher, who describes his role as having been a 'part-time executive' one. Sir Christopher said he was leaving the company when he reached the age of 60, which is MEPC's retirement age. He is also chairman of Boots, the retailer and a director of Sun Alliance, the insurance group. His departure from MEPC, like his arrival, coincides with a severe downturn in the property market. 'Much has happened since I joined the board in January 1974 and the company has successfully ridden out three major economic hurricanes,' he said. Ian Irvine, deputy chairman of Reed International and chairman of Capital Radio and Jonathan Taylor, chief executive of Booker, have also joined the MEPC board. Sir Christopher is a chartered surveyor who began his career in the navy before moving into the property industry in the late 1950s. He became managing director in 1976 and became chairman in 1988. He was chairman of the London Docklands Development Corporation, the body charged with regenerating London docklands, from 1984-1988. ***** John Macomber, 64, a former chairman of the US Eximbank and ex-McKinsey management consultant, has rejoined the board of Pilkington, the world's largest glass manufacturer. He served as a non-executive director between February 1988 and July 1989 when President Bush gave him the job of running Eximbank. Macomber, who was chief executive of Celanese Corporation, until it was acquired by Hoechst in 1987, is one of two new faces on the Pilkington board. The other, George Simpson, 50, is deputy chief executive of British Aerospace and chairman of Rover. They are replacing Lord Croham, a former head of the home civil service who has been on the board since 1978, and Sir Peter Thompson, president of NFC, who has been on the board since 1985. Pilkington has been hard hit by the recession and is often touted as a takeover target. But the recruitment of the two new non-executives to a boardroom which includes Deustche Bank chief Hilmar Kopper, shows that the firm has little difficulty recruiting talented independent directors. George Simpson is credited with helping to revamp the fortunes of Rover and is now a rising star in the British Aerospace boardroom, while Macomber played a leading part in building up the European practice of McKinsey &amp; Co. ***** Donald McFarlane, chairman of Senior Engineering Group and of James Dickie, is appointed a non-executive director at GENERAL CONSOLIDATED INVESTMENT TRUST. ***** Harold Cottam, chairman of Haden MacLellan and recently retired UK managing partner of Ernst &amp; Young, becomes a non-executive director at ALLIED COLLOIDS; William Wilkinson becomes deputy chairman.</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Russian bank files for ADR issue AvtoVAZbank, a regional Russian bank owned by AvtoVAZ, the country's biggest motor company, has filed an application to issue American depositary receipts. The company is the first from Russia to make such an application, although two bigger companies - Lukoil, the oil company, and United Energy Systems of Russia, an electric power company - are expected to follow suit in the next few months. Other Russian companies, including Gazprom, the big gas company, are also planning issues. AvtoVAZbank is filing to issue so-called 'level one' depositary receipts, which means it has to meet less stringent disclosure standards than those typically associated with formal US stock listings. In addition, it need not file accounts according to standard US principles. The paper does not allow it to raise new capital in the US but the ADRs, backed by existing shares, can be traded there. New capital could be raised either through a full listing of shares or through a private placement of ADRs under the Securities and Exchange Commission's rule 144a. 'This is very much a first step,' says Mr Christopher Kearns of the Bank of New York, which will issue the ADRs and hold the Russian stock in its name. He expects both Lukoil and UES to have ADRs in place in the first quarter of 1995. 'Many companies have ambitious long-term goals. Many have large capital needs which they see will only be satisfied outside of Russia,' he added.</p>

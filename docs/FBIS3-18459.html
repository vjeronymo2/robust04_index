"We sincerely believe  that Turkey will help us," Andonov said.    Veysel Atasoy, energy and natural resources minister, said  before meeting with Andonov that Turkey was one of the first  countries to recognize Macedonia's [The Former Yugoslav Republic  of Macedonia--FYROM] independence.    Andonov said Macedonia's northern borders and its southern  Greek border have been besieged and the north-south route was  the only way for the procurement of raw materials and for  exportation. Turkey earlier said the Balkan republic could use  Turkish ports to circumvent a trade blockade imposed by Greece.  [passage omitted]</p>

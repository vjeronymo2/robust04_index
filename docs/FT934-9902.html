			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Poland makes policy pledge to IMF POLAND is set on maintaining good relations with the International Monetary Fund with a view to achieving further reductions in its Dollars 47.2bn foreign debt, Mr Waldemar Pawlak, head of the new centre-left government, said yesterday, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. His statement to parliament commits the government to following stringent monetary policies acceptable to the IMF, which is unlikely to agree to any big increase in next year's budget deficit over this year's target of 5 per cent of GDP. Mr Pawlak said policies would aim 'at reducing inflation'. The government elected on September 19, and formed out of the post-communist Left Democratic Alliance and Mr Pawlak's Polish Peasant party, needs IMF approval for a 20 per cent cut in the Dollars 30.6bn debt owed to the Paris Club. This was promised as part of a 50 per cent debt reduction package agreed on condition that Poland remained in favour with the IMF.</p>

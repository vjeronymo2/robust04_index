			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM;  </P> <P> HIGHER PARK COSTS?  </P> <P> One of the big problems is making sure that all kids will be on the same track  (schedule). There's very little guarantee along that line.  </P> <P> It's supposed to be based on zip codes, so if the whole family is in one  zip-code area, all the kids would be on that same track. There are several  different tracks that would be going at the same time. Some kids would be off  three weeks in February, some would be off three weeks in March, etc.  </P> <P> Something else that parents had talked about was community support. Right now,  most of the community activities are set up so that they work during the  12-week summer break. And they wanted community support before they went into  this year-round schooling. If you were two working parents, you couldn't be  taking off to watch your kids for three weeks. And they wanted to make sure  that the Parks and Recreation Department would offer classes year-round. So  it's probably going to increase the need for employment in the department.  </P></p>

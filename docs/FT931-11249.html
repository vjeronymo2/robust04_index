			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Chemical Waste tumbles to Dollars 8.7m CHEMICAL Waste Manage-ment, a partially-owned subsidiary of Chicago-based Waste Management, said fourth-quarter earnings fell to Dollars 8.7m, or 4 cents a share, from Dollars 12.2m, or 6 cents, in the 1991 quarter. The 28 per cent earnings tumble reflects a Dollars 15m, or 7 cents-a-share, after-tax charge associated with the formation of Rust International, a new global environmental services company. Rust will be majority-owned by Chemical Waste Mangement. Chemical Waste's fourth-quarter results were further weakened by a 5 cent-per-share charge linked to its majority-owned subsidiary, The Brand Companies. The Brand Companies, which will become part of Rust International, took a charge on a write-down of its asbestos abatement business. Revenues were also down for the quarter, at Dollars 354m, compared with Dollars 370m in the fourth quarter of 1991. Chemical Waste said the sales declines were the result of a fall-off in special projects. For the year, Chemical Waste reported earnings of Dollars 126m, or 63 cents a share, before accounting changes, up from Dollars 100m, or 49 cents, in 1991. Full-year sales were Dollars 1.5bn, up from Dollars 1.3bn in 1991.</p>

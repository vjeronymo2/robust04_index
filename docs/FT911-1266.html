			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Businessmen report revival of confidence in economy and prospects BRITISH businessmen are more optimistic about future economic trends, according to two surveys. A poll of 300 members published today by the Institute of Directors points to a sharp rise in confidence about the economy and their own companies' prospects over the past two months. A survey of clients by 3i, the investment capital group, found a marked reduction in pessimism about the general business climate since January, with 56 per cent of those polled believing the recession will be over within six months. Both surveys have to carry statistical 'health warnings', however. The latest IoD survey is not strictly comparable with the previous poll of directors in February because of changes in the size and method of sampling. The IoD said the changes in attitude disclosed were sufficiently large to indicate 'a substantial shift in optimism.' The 3i survey was based on 392 replies to questionnaires sent to a random sample of 1,000 of the company's clients last month. The group says they tend to be more profitable, more likely to be exporters and growing faster than the average UK company. The IoD survey, carried out in the first two weeks of April, found that 53 per cent of the 300 directors polled were more optimistic about the UK economy than six months ago, and only 20 per cent were less optimistic. In February, at the time of the institute's last poll, only 8 per cent of directors expressed more hope about the economy, while 72 per were less optimistic than six months before. A similar recovery in confidence was found at company level, especially in the Midlands and the south. Last month 56 per cent of directors were more optimistic about their company's outlook than six months before, against only 18 per cent in February. Those saying they were less optimistic fell to 19 per cent from 54 per cent in February. Nevertheless, those improvements in sentiment have yet to be reflected in company performance. The IoD survey found a fairly even split between the 40 per cent of directors reporting a drop in business volume over the previous six months and 37 per cent reporting an improvement. No less than 49 per cent of the sample said profits were down in the six months compared with the same period a year before. The picture for investment and employment was also mixed. While 62 per cent of directors expected unchanged employment levels, a strong minority of larger companies planned job cuts.</p>

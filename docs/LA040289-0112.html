			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> 5 COMPETE FOR VACANT INGLEWOOD COUNCIL SEAT  </P> <P> The allure of a vacant seat has drawn five candidates into the race to replace  the late Ann Wilk on the Inglewood City Council.  </P> <P> Wilk, a former school board member, died of a heart attack last December, 1 1/2  years after she surprised two-term incumbent Bruce Smith by beating him in a  close runoff election in 1987.  </P> <P> The winner of Tuesday's election will fill the remaining two years of Wilk's  term representing the 3rd District, which encompasses Inglewood's downtown and  west side. The candidates are:  </P> <P> * Smith, a 69-year-old businessman.  </P> <P> * Jose Fernandez, 29, an aide to state Sen. Cecil N. Green (D-Norwalk).  </P> <P> * Claude Lataillade, 37, a TRW engineer who ran unsuccessfully for the seat in  1987.  </P> <P> * Muhammad Nassardeen, 36, the former security director at Centinela Hospital  Medical Center and owner of a consulting firm that works to strengthen  black-owned businesses.  </P> <P> * Robert Sturms, an 18-year-old student at Inglewood High School.  </P> <P> As several candidates have pointed out, the 3rd District is perhaps the most  diverse of the city's four council districts. It has a large though largely  politically dormant Latino population, a concentration of longtime white  residents and a substantial black population.  </P> <P> That diversity is one of the reasons the race appears close. A June runoff  among the top two finishers will be required if no candidate gets more than 50%  of the vote.  </P> <P> Although campaign disclosure records show Smith with a fund-raising lead,  Lataillade, Nassardeen and Fernandez are all potentially strong candidates.  Nassardeen and Lataillade are black, Fernandez is Latino and Smith is white,  but the candidates are seeking support across the ethnic spectrum.  </P> <P> Smith is styling himself a near-incumbent, arguing that his experience makes  him the strongest candidate.  </P> <P> Fernandez, on the other hand, has been endorsed by the family and several close  friends of Wilk, who capitalized on dissatisfaction with Smith to earn her  underdog victory in 1987. And Nassardeen and Lataillade are assiduously  pursuing that perceived anti-Smith vote.  </P> <P> Many district voters are senior citizens, either homeowners or residents of  several housing complexes for seniors, and candidates are courting them:  </P> <P> Lataillade's campaign literature features him shaking hands with supporter Amal  Alexander, president of the Senior Citizens Association of the Inglewood  Meadows housing complex near downtown.  </P> <P> Fernandez's literature includes a handwritten letter from his grandmother  urging votes for her grandson.  </P> <P> Nassardeen proposes programs in which Inglewood youth would assist seniors and  seniors would work as teachers aides.  </P> <P> Smith emphasizes his longtime involvement in organizations such as the  Centinela Valley YMCA and the Centinela Historical Society.  </P> <P> As of last week's campaign spending disclosure deadline, Smith had raised  $13,116; Lataillade, $8,255; Nassardeen, $6,850, and Fernandez, $3,360. Sturms  filed a short form indicating he intended to raise less than $1,000.  </P> <P> Smith has not proposed many specific initiatives, focusing instead on his two  council terms and the need to put a qualified representative in place quickly  to work on issues such as crime and improving the city's image.  </P> <P> "We need experience and stability on that council," Smith said. "This is a  wonderful town and it's going to stay that way. This is the city of tomorrow.  We have to collectively get together and change the image."  </P> <P> Smith called for rejuvenating the district's block clubs and involving young  residents by establishing sports leagues among the clubs as an alternative to  gangs. In addition, Smith said his opponents are looking to launch their  political careers and said he has no such ambitions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Not a Politician'  </P> <P> "I see myself as an elected official, not a politician," he said.  </P> <P> While Smith plays up his experience, the other candidates say he was voted out  because he was an unresponsive councilman. They say he lacks their vision for  the future.  </P> <P> Lataillade, who backed Smith in 1987 after failing to make the runoff, said he  will be more sensitive than Smith to the district's diverse population and  dealing with constituents' requests for help.  </P> <P> Lataillade is active in area Republican politics and has worked for several  years organizing science fairs in the Inglewood schools.  </P> <P> Lataillade said he supports increased anti-gang and anti-drug programs and  cites his volunteer youth counseling and his co-founding of a drug  rehabilitation center, Living Miracle Ranch. At the same time, Lataillade  favors prosecution of parents who profit from their children's gang activity  and mandatory sentencing for gang-related crimes.  </P> <P> To rejuvenate downtown Inglewood, Lataillade said he wants to stop the  proliferation of swap meets and discount stores.  </P> <P> "We have to attract the kind of businesses that can make Inglewood a major  cultural center," said Lataillade, who cited his management experience at TRW.  "I have the skills necessary to work with the kind of retail problems that  exist."  </P> <P> Nassardeen also has an economic agenda. He wants to attract a Nordstrom  department store to downtown Inglewood as part of an aggressive effort to  revamp the city's economy and its image.  </P> <P> Although Inglewood has lost several department stores over the last few years,  Nassardeen said it is possible to lure the upscale retailer. "It's not a pipe  dream," he said. "I don't think we have to accept a substandard Inglewood.  Inglewood needs an attitude adjustment."  </P> <P> Nassardeen left his post as director of security at Centinela Hospital Medical  Center last year to establish his own consulting business, Recycling Black  Dollars. The firm works to strengthen black businesses by bringing them  together, creating support networks and rotating capital within the black  business community.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Jobs for Young People  </P> <P> Along with black economic self-reliance, Nassardeen emphasized his experience  in anti-crime and disaster-preparedness efforts.  </P> <P> But he has also made a point of reaching out to longtime residents of his  district. For example, he said his proposal to hire Inglewood youth to assist  seniors would aid the elderly and create jobs for young people.  </P> <P> "This is a very diverse community," he said. "We need to come together."  </P> <P> Fernandez, meanwhile, speaks of his desire to make Inglewood "a model  multi-ethnic community."  </P> <P> If elected, Fernandez would be the first Latino councilman in a city with a 30%  Latino population. The district has not had high Latino voter turnout, but  Fernandez's supporters, many of whom worked closely with Wilk, say he is  striving to find and attract registered Latino voters.  </P> <P> Fernandez emphasizes his government experience with state Sen. Green, and the  fact that he is a homeowner and self-employed businessman at age 29. He  proposes police foot patrols downtown and allocating city revenue from the  county transportation tax to expand the "I-Line Shuttle," a downtown shuttle  used by seniors.  </P> <P> Fernandez styles himself a good-government candidate, alluding to past council  controversies, including a refuse contract awarded to Western Waste Industries  without competitive bidding.  </P> <P> "I want the City Council to conduct the public's business in an open, honest,  ethical manner," he said. "Public contracts should be awarded by public bidding  . . . citizens should be treated courteously. . . . Unfortunately, the  publicity created by some infractions of these principles has created an  unfavorable reputation for Inglewood."  </P> <P> As for Sturms, his youth and lack of funds and political experience make him a  decided long shot. But the Inglewood High School senior and Red Cross volunteer  appeared at a candidates forum last month and gamely sought support, saying "I  am young. I am in touch with that youth section of the district."  </P></p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Observer: Governing party One of the first tasks for whichever party wins the election will be to replace the Governor of the Bank of England, whose term runs out at the end of June 1993. The ideas a continuing Conservative government would have on suitable pedigrees have been reasonably well aired, with Sir David Scholey, Warburg's man on the Court for the past decade, an obvious contender. But what happens if Labour wins? In that case, the dossier of qualified candidates with apt backgrounds is somewhat thin. There are some Labour peers who have worked in the City, such as the Lords Williams and Donoughue. But their credibility has not been enhanced by their recent career moves. Another possibility is Lord Peston, a Labour academic, but he is said not to be interested and, even if he were, his appointment would be controversial - at least among economists. History suggests that Labour prime ministers tend to play much more safely than their Tory counterparts when it comes to picking governors. On nationalising the Bank in 1946, Labour might have given the place a thorough shake-up. In the event, it passed up the opportunity by asking Lord Catto, a former Morgan Grenfell partner, to stay on as governor. Since then, Labour governments have had only a couple of chances to choose a new governor, and both times it promoted from within. Admittedly, in 1949 Stafford Cripps wanted to give the job to John Hanbury-Williams, a well respected chairman of Courtaulds. But when he turned it down, the post was offerred to Cameron Cobbold, the deputy governor. Similarly, Harold Wilson also settled on the deputy, then Leslie O'Brien, to take over from Lord Cromer in 1966. On this basis, the two obvious front-runners are the current deputy governor, 53-year-old Eddie George, and Sir David Walker, who has worked in the Treasury as well as the Bank and steps down as chairman of the Securities and Investments Board at the end of May.</p>

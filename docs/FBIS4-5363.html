			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 11 (YONHAP) -- The ruling Democratic  Liberal Party (DLP) repeatedly urged the government Monday to  re-examine its policy on the North Korean nuclear dispute,  criticized recently for inconsistency.    In a general policy-makers' meeting, the DLP's current  affairs analysis committee pointed out that the party and  government should heed recent U.S. press reports and study  measures to cope with developments in the nuclear matter.    The party and government should note a report by the  newsweekly TIME, which said North Korea already possesses one or  two nuclear weapons, and a U.S. congressional report predicting  a possible withdrawal of American forces from South Korea in  return for North Korea abandoning its nuclear ambitions, the  committee said.</p>

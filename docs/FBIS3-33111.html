			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Samuel Prieto and Francisco Rubio from San </F> Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas State]    [Text] Finally, the long-awaited announcement was made.  The peace talks in Chiapas State will begin Monday at 1100.  The place is still unknown, obviously for security reasons.    Smiling and in good spirits, Manuel Camacho Solis,  commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas and San  Cristobal Bishop Samuel Ruiz said that we are quickly advancing  toward peace. Camacho Solis said that during the peace talks in  Chiapas the proposals presented by the EZLN [Zapatist National  Liberation Army] and the Indian groups will be honored because  the dialogue has political foundations. [sentence as heard]    [Begin Camacho Solis recording] We have agreed on the date  for the peace talks. Next Sunday, the movement of delegates  will begin. Bishop Samuel Ruiz and I will be traveling Sunday  morning to the various areas where there is an EZLN presence,  and will be accompanying the delegates to the city in Chiapas  State where talks for peace and reconciliation will begin the  following day at 1100.    We all want to begin real negotiations. The peace talks can  be one of two things: one, simply an opportunity to report  problems or present political programs; the other, an  opportunity to express views regarding the situation in Chiapas  and the country, and also to advance in negotiations that could  eventually lead to the end of hostilities, and hence to peace  and reconciliation. We must all choose between those two  options: Do we want this simply to be a forum to report  problems, or do we want to make this an opportunity to build  peace and reconciliation in Chiapas and in the country. I am  totally committed to the second option.    I have come here and will go to the forum to listen and to  learn. We have all learned a lot. We will also go to the talks  with the clear purpose of facilitating the end of hostilities.  In other words, the issue here is that we could not attain  peace if someone tried to force the EZLN into accepting a  solution that is not dignified. That is not the way to build  peace. The only possibility is respecting the proposals, listen  to them, discuss them, propose other things. The position I  will present will be the one I perceive as best for the  interests of the Mexican State, not of part of the  administration. It must reflect the various interests and  opinions, as well as the concerns, reports, and proposals that  the EZLN will present toward a possible political agreement that  can be built as time permits.    There are two options: either we simply meet to mention our  problems, or we meet to sign a peace agreement. I have  perceived that the EZLN, which at the beginning was probably not  ready for a change under the political conditions that prevailed  after 10 January, today has shown us through decisions like the  ones it adopted yesterday that it is interested in coming to the  negotiating table not only to present its political positions,  but also to open the possibility of a real dialogue that can  lead to dignified peace.

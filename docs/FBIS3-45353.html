The Director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office, Lu Ping, was quoted yesterday as saying Beijing  had already responded to the British side's recent concern over  financial arrangements for the new airport.    After meeting Mr. Lu in Beijing, the spokesman for the  Junior  Chamber of Commerce, Ng Man-kun, quoted the official as saying  China had yet to receive feedback on its reply to the Government.    But he said Mr. Lu "did not go into detail about what their  response was".    A Government spokesman said last night: "We have not seen  Mr. Lu's precise remarks and as both the Governor and the  Financial Secretary said last week, the right place to discuss  these issues is within the Airport Committee.    "We have been pressing the Chinese side for a meeting but  have had no response. We have also called for expert talks on  land matters and again we have had no response."    Financing of the new airport has been deadlocked since  August's Airport Committee meeting. It is understood the  Government has held a number of informal discussions with the  Chinese side.    Legislator Samuel Wong Ping-wai, who convenes the  Legislative  Council Airport Committee, urged both sides to release more  information about the financial arrangements. "The fund is the  money of Hong Kong people," he said.    According to Mr. Ng, Mr. Lu had again accused the Government  of mixing politics with business by refusing to send officials  to Beijing to explain the Airport Corporation Bill to the  Preliminary Working Committee (PWC).    "Mr. Lu said he had read the contents of the bill several  times but there were many things he could not understand and  things that were unclear," he said.    "Therefore, he hoped the PWC, being the main adviser to the  future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), could be  more familiar with it."    The Government is to decide tomorrow on which funding  proposal will be submitted to the Legislative Council.    The funding proposals -- either a $377 million suggestion to  retain the operations of the Provisional Airport Authority (PAA)  or a $1.6 billion proposal to keep the PAA and urgent airport  projects going -- will be tabled during the Finance Committee  meeting on Friday.    Meanwhile, the controversial partial political reform bill  passed the Legislative Council bills committee yesterday and is  now headed for final approval.</p>

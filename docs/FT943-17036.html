			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Fresh job blow at Du Pont hits 720 Du Pont, the world's largest nylon maker, yesterday announced it was cutting more than 700 jobs at its British operations. Most of the job losses will be from former Imperial Chemical Industries facilities which Du Pont acquired last year, Paul Abrahams writes. The UK bore the brunt of a previous round of cuts by Du Pont in September last year when 860 lost their posts and a plant in Pontypool, south Wales, was closed. Most of the latest job losses will be at Wilton, Teesside, where 520 posts will disappear. An additional 200 jobs will go at Gloucester and Doncaster. Du Pont's announcement drew sharp reactions from unions. Mr Fred Higgs, national secretary of the TGWU general union, which represents most of the workers due to lose their jobs, said the Teesside closure was 'a cynical betrayal of more than 500 loyal workers who were promised by Du Pont, only a year ago, that their jobs were secure'. Du Pont intends to close a plant at Wilton which manufactures adipic acid, a raw material for nylon, by early 1997. The company is setting up a joint venture with Rhone-Poulenc of France to expand an adipic acid facility at Chalampe, Alsace. The group also plans to close the Wilton plant manufacturing hexamethylenediamine, the other main raw material for nylon. The chemical will be supplied from other Du Pont facilities, primarily in Texas and Canada. About 160 Du Pont employees will be left at Wilton.</p>

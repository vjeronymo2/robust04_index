Despite this, Demirel remarked, there are incidents in  Yugoslavia and the Caucasus. Extreme nationalism, racism,  sectarianism, and xenophobia lie at the base of this problem,  the president explained.    Pointing out that there are 3,000 different languages and  179  countries in the world today, Demirel continued:    [Begin Demirel recording] If every different ethnic group  and sect claims a different flag and demands independence, then  3,000 states must be established. Geography is also not  conducive to this. People live intermingled with one another.  People are happy when they live without making an issue of  their origins and their beliefs, and when they show tolerance  for each other and accept one another. [end recording]    Demirel recounted that the Soviet Union, which covered 22  million square km, collapsed, but Russia today includes 70  percent of this territory and its population. Noting that the  Red Army is still standing and that there are close to 20,000  nuclear warheads in Russia, Demirel said intensive diplomatic  contacts are under way throughout the whole world in order to  prevent the reemergence of a military threat and a return to the  old days.    Demirel concluded by saying Turkey has an important place,  name, and stature in international relations as a result of its  60 million population and its sensitive geographical location.

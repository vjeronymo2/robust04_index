			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Insolvency move not ruled out The government made clear last night that it had not ruled out the possibility of retrospective legislation to safeguard the position of insolvency practitioners appointed as administrators and receivers to companies in trouble. At the same time it successfully called on the House of Lords to follow the example of the Commons by rejecting amendments seeking to make the Insolvency (No 2) bill effective from December 30 1986. Peers rushed the bill through and it should receive royal assent today or tomorrow. The bill provides protection from Tuesday of last week for administrators and receivers from the consequences of a Court of Appeal ruling on Paramount Airways which, in effect, made them responsible for the contractual employment obligations of a company after 14 days. Lord Strathclyde, chief government spokesman on the bill, gave an assurance to peers who warned that insolvency practitioners could face claims of up to Pounds 1bn - possibly involving the bankruptcy of some small- and medium-sized accountancy firms. He said ministers would closely watch how the situation developed. He refused to be drawn on whether the government was likely to introduce further emergency legislation. Lord Donaldson of Lymington, a former Master of the Rolls, criticised the hasty manner in which parliament had been asked to approve the bill, but insisted that it would be wrong to provide blanket retrospection. He suggested that it would have been more satisfactory if it had been delayed for a week to enable the main 1986 Insolvency Act to be amended. Lord Donaldson suggested that a provision should be introduced requiring insolvency practitioners to inform each employee of the company concerned whether they were adopting or disclaiming employees' contracts. He had not introduced such a provision 'because I am not certain of my ability to amend the bill on the hoof'.</p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Travel: Happy holidays in the Pigsty - The eclectic properties on offer through the Landmark Trust 'The Pineapple is an elaborate summerhouse of two storeys built in 1761 for the 29-year-old Earl of Dunmore (later Governor of New York and of Virginia). Though classical and orthodox at ground level, it grows slowly into something entirely vegetable; conventional architraves put out shoots and end up as prickly leaves of stone. It is an eccentric work, but of undoubted genius . . . every leaf is drained to prevent damage by frost.' FOR SUCH an exotically quirky description to belong to a Scottish holiday home (four beds and around Pounds 400 per week, depending on the season), the Pineapple has to be out of the Landmark Trust handbook. Sandwiched between The Pigsty ('an exercise in primitive, almost barbaric classicism'), which is a twin-bedroomed Doric pigsty overlooking Robin Hood's Bay, and Plas Uchaf, Clwyd (the 15th century ancestral home of the Hughes of Gwerclas, descendants of Iorwerth, third son of Owain Brogyntyn), the entry is typically, and lyrically, irresistible. The Landmark Trust, brainchild of Sir John Smith, was founded to rescue interesting but dilapidated buildings and let them for holidays. Some are cottages and houses, some are castles and forts and some, like the Sandringham Water Supply Tower (which sleeps four), are more functional. All are unusual, carefully furnished and well equipped with information on local history and geography. Sometimes far flung, the properties always have a link, physical or literary, with Britain. The trust has the lease on the third floor of Piazza di Spagna in Rome, for example: 'These are not the rooms in which Keats died on February 23 1821 - those are on the floor below and they are more in a condition he would recognise.' To run Lundy Island, which lies 12 miles off the North Devon coast and is owned by the National Trust, the Landmark purchased a 300-ton supply ship, MS Oldenburg ('carries 267 passengers in comfortable well appointed salons . . . '). I stayed with family and friends for a week in Clonque, a granite fort built in the 1840s on a clump of rocks 300 yards off the uninhabited south-west tip of the Channel island of Alderney. Originally designed to keep the French out of the Channel islands, Fort Clonque was refortified by the Nazis in 1940 and after years of neglect fell into the hands of the Landmark Trust in 1966. Its accommodation, fit for a party of 12 and described as the officers' quarters, the soldiers' quarters, upper magazine and German bunker, is more luxuriously furnished than those originally billeted there would have enjoyed: it even has a piano. But flickering gaslights, an open fire and heavy seas surging across the causeway combine to give a romanticised idea of what it must have been like to man the four batteries. And being cut off from Alderney by the tide twice a day gives plenty of time for reflection. It is the sort of setting for contemplation that the dedicated Landmark 'camper' relishes - and usually records at length in the log provided in each of the properties. These campers tend to be fiercely dedicated to the original aims of the trust as laid out by Sir John and can be prolific in committing their thoughts to the log. It will be interesting to read their reactions to the trust's plans for the future. Twenty-five years and 200 revived historic buildings since its formation, the trust now has to come to terms with its own landmark: the retirement of Sir John Smith and the withdrawal of its principal benefactor, the Manifold Trust, a grant-making charity created by him. If the Landmark is to continue its good work it will have to look for new sources of funding which, according to the trust's Rebecca Morgan, could mean opportunities for company sponsorship. There are a lot of good reasons for a company to sponsor the Landmark Trust, she says - not least, to help 'fight the forces of destruction and make the conservation of historic buildings a matter of public concern.' Commercial sponsorship could seem like a sell-out to hard-core campers, but the trust has an exacting, expensive rescue schedule ahead of it which includes Naulakha, Rudyard Kipling's chalet home in the US ski resort of Vermont.

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Waste Management Solid first quarter figures today from Waste Management may stop the rot in its share price this year, but the shares peaked against the US market in 1990. That suggests a creeping disillusionment. Recession is partly to blame by reducing the volume of waste - especially high-margin industrial waste - churned out by the US economy. But more efficient companies will produce less rubbish and effluent even when the economy turns. Over-capacity in areas such as incineration may thus persist beyond recession. Tougher environmental standards are also steering waste management companies towards unknown areas such as recycling. Recession aside, the outlook in Europe should be brighter. Legislation in most European countries is some way behind the US. Profitable landfill should have years of good growth before regulations become too onerous. Quality landfill sites and incinerators are also in short supply, so prices might hold up better through the downturn. Yet shares in Waste Management International, which operates in Europe and Asia, are well below the price at which 20 per cent of the equity was offered last year. The US flavour of the share register may be to blame. A stronger dollar cuts the value of European earnings to US investors. The shares of UK companies which paid full prices for a position in waste - notably Severn Trent and Wessex Water - may escape unscathed. But weak prices and the proposed UK government levy on landfill dumping are uncomfortable echoes of the US.</p>

			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / EC struggles to keep Maastricht train on rails: The actions of Britain have pointed up an uncomfortable truth about the pact CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl will want some straight answers when he meets Mr John Major, UK prime minister, at Ditchley Park in Oxfordshire today. Mindful of the need to avoid reopening wounds in Anglo-German relations, Mr Kohl will seek to establish when exactly the British government intends to ratify the Maastricht treaty on European political and economic union. So far, British pronouncements have been Delphic. Having promised to push the Maastricht bill through the House of Commons by the end of the year or early in January, Mr Major last week bowed to pressure from Tory Euro-sceptics and agreed to postpone ratification until after a second Danish referendum, probably next May. President Francois Mitterrand's outburst on French television on Monday night against British shilly-shallying merely echoed what many senior officials in Brussels and other capitals are saying privately. However irritated Mr Major will be at Mr Mitterrand's remarks, he will attach far higher priority to the views of Mr Kohl. For whatever the Chancellor's domestic difficulties, he is best placed to give a lead to the Community which recently has been lurching from crisis to crisis, in the view of a senior EC official. By restoring a link between parliamentary approval of Maastricht to a resolution of Danish demands for exemptions from the treaty, Mr Major upset plenty of allies. These include officials in Bonn who are still feeling sore after the furore over whether the Bundesbank forced sterling out of the exchange rate mechanism. Yet, in ordering a delay as the price of winning over Tory Euro-sceptics, Mr Major has highlighted a truth which many EC partners have been prone to forget: without a resolution of Danish demands for 'legally binding' exemptions from Maastricht, there can be no second Danish referendum, and therefore no treaty (since it requires ratification by all 12 EC members to come into force). The huffing and puffing which greeted Denmark's rejection of the treaty last June obscured this truth. Member states agreed first in Oslo and later in New York to early Maastricht ratification by all members, with the mutineers from Denmark coming on board last. The new British delay changes this logic. What ought to have been a balance of 11 states against one on Maastricht ratification has changed into a 'race to be last'. Hence, the new alliance of convenience between the UK and Denmark which emerged on Monday at the meeting of EC foreign ministers in Brussels. The aim is two-fold: the avoidance of a messy divorce between the EC and the Danes, and the early settlement of the Danish question by the Edinburgh summit next month so as to proceed with other EC business, notably enlargement negotiations with Finland, Sweden and Austria. Both British and Danish officials argue that the price of a Danish divorce would be the end of Maastricht - and a new treaty. Mr Major is likely to point out politely to Mr Kohl that such a new treaty may well fall short of the scope of Maastricht, particularly its provisions for political and monetary union. As one UK official mused this week: it is far from clear whether Mr Kohl could secure Bundestag approval for a treaty which provided for the irrevocable linking of exchange rates on the lines of Maastricht. Similarly, Mr Major will seek to appeal to the chancellor's interest in enlarging the Community, to pull in richer members such as Austria which will help redress the EC's tilt to the south and push it more to the east. At the moment, enlargement negotiations are tied to a resolution of the Delors II budget package and ratification of Maastricht by all member states. But the delay in ratification has created uncertainty about the entire enlargement timetable - and the planned review of Maastricht in 1996. Already Belgium, which inherits the rotating EC presidency in July 1993, has voiced complaints that there are two main priorities - enlargement talks and implementation of the provisions of Maastricht - which appear jeopardised by Denmark's and Britain's delays. 'Enlargement is going to be the next big row,' says one EC official. Faced with the unpleasant fact of a dual Anglo-Danish problem, several EC leaders are tempted to throw up their hands. Already there is mischievous talk in Brussels about scrapping Maastricht and trying to negotiate a new deal among 10 states committed to some kind of European union. So far, it is low-level talk; the intention remains to try to settle differences at Edinburgh on December 11-12. But that summit agenda is already looking very crowded. In the next five weeks, the crucial bargains must be struck if the future of Maastricht is to be settled. The question for Mr Kohl is whether he chooses to take a confrontational line like Mr Mitterrand on Monday night, or whether he plumps, in the words of one UK official, for 'intelligent flexibility'. No one can yet be sure which way he will jump.</p>

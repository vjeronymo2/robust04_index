			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Letter: CBI industrial surveys tell the story as it is, with no gloss Sir, Having begun his campaign against business surveys with the accusation in June that the CBI was 'stretching the truth, or probably downright lying', Mr Roger Lyons, general secretary of MSF, now appears to have moderated his language but still seems to be intent on misrepresenting the facts. In his letter (July 8), he asserts that the CBI's March Industrial Trends Survey 'declared on the eve of the general election that recovery was round the corner'. It did no such thing. The survey, based on replies from 1,439 companies in 50 different industries together responsible for roughly half of UK manufacturing employment and exports, reported a slight improvement in home and export orders, a further run-down in stocks and that firms expected output to flatten out over the next four months. The FT report on the survey was headed 'CBI reports 'patchy' rise in demand' (March 28). In June, Mr Lyons was quoted in The Guardian as saying the CBI had been 'talking up the state of the economy, particularly before the election' and alleging there had been 'election trickery at work'. I suspect Mr Lyons' memory is as muddled as his accusation. It was the CBI's April survey, published 19 days after polling day, that reported the biggest increase in business optimism since July 1988 and said that manufacturing output was expected to increase over the next four months as demand improved. The FT report on that survey was headed 'CBI reports rising prospects' (April 29). Mr Lyons really must not allow his dissatisfaction with the election result to distort his judgment. The CBI surveys depend solely on what industrialists themselves say about the trend in orders, output, stocks and prices. In publishing these surveys, the CBI never attempts to put a particular gloss on them. We always tell the story as it really is. Mr Lyons might do much for his own credibility if he followed the same practice.

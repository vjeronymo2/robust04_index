			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Insolvency Service fees and funding under review THE GOVERNMENT is undertaking a detailed review of the way in which the official Insolvency Service is funded after strong criticism of the existing system. Among the issues under discussion is the reform of the insolvency services account, which funds the service from the proceeds of assets realised from insolvent companies and individuals. The Insolvency Service deals with corporate and individual financial failure and tackles wrongdoing within insolvencies. It is an executive agency of the Department of Trade and Industry under the government's Next Steps initiative. Whitehall officials have confirmed that a review is under way. It will cover some of the most important aspects of how the service is funded and the structure of its fees. Under the present timetable, ministers will have a report by early December. Private insolvency practitioners have long complained that the insolvency services account - which is administered by officials - is inefficient and penalises creditors. The existing system of finance means that the creditors of insolvent companies and individuals are the ones who are paying for the service. The proceeds of any asset sales from compulsory liquidations and bankruptcies must be placed in the account, as well as those from other liquidation procedures under certain conditions. The account offers a low, fixed rate of interest which is taxed before any proceeds can be removed. Some portion of the money can be placed into the insolvency service investment account, which allows proceeds to be invested in gilts and Treasury bills. The Insolvency Service is at present running at a substantial surplus, generating income from fees and the insolvency services account of Pounds 62m in the last financial year, against costs of Pounds 57m. The extra was paid to the DTI. The review is unlikely to propose any options that reduce the chance of the service to be self-funding. But it will consider whether it is possible to retain income generated rather than remitting it to the Treasury each year. Among alternative proposals for raising money being considered is an additional charge that would be paid by all limited liability companies as part of their annual registration fee, or a fixed-rate fee levied on the proceeds of asset realisations. Historically, one of the reasons for the insolvency services account was to prevent unscrupulous practitioners misappropriating funds left in their own hands. The 1986 insolvency act introduced a licensing system in which practitioners are also required to put up a bond that could be cashed if there was any suspicion of creditors' money being used improperly.</p>

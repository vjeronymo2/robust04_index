			<p>BFN     [Text] The war veterans of the Korean People's Army [KPA]  unit to which Comrade Kim Che-yon belongs visited the soldier  builders of the KPA unit to which Comrade Choe Chong-un belongs  who are mobilized for the Pyongyang-Hyangsan Expressway  construction.    The war veterans who have already visited the soldier  builders several times are vigorously encouraging the soldiers  so that they may be brought up strong to become true  revolutionary fighters who live and struggle for the party, the  leader, the country, and the people.    The war veterans respectfully wrote a letter of loyalty to  the respected and beloved comrade supreme commander, and are  invariably following the road of loyalty to help the KPA  soldiers spiritually and with labor until the completion of the  Pyongyang-Hyangsan expressway.</p>

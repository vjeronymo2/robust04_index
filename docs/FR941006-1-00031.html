			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (10) Section 344.3(c)_In this section, the Bureau of the Public Debt is substituted for the Federal Reserve Banks to reflect the consolidation of program administration in Parkersburg, WV. The current rule requires that a final subscription must be submitted on or before the issue date. As proposed, this section would add a 3 p.m., Eastern time, submission deadline. In addition, this proposed section is updated to reflect sending of a final subscription by facsimile equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (11) Section 344.3(c)(1)_A typographical error in the current regulation is corrected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (12) Section 344.4_The current section is divided into two parts, (a) and (b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (13) Section 344.4(a)_This section would require that the issue date selected by the subscriber must be a business day and would allow for the sending of initial subscriptions by facsimile or other carrier. In this section, the Bureau of the Public Debt is substituted for the Federal Reserve Banks. The current rule requires investors to make payment by having their financial institution deposit funds in a reserve account for debit by a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch on or before the date of issue. Under the proposed section, full payment for each subscription must be submitted utilizing the Fedwire funds transfer system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (14) Section 344.4(b)_The current regulation provides that any subscriber which fails to make settlement on a subscription once submitted is ineligible thereafter to subscribe for securities under this offering for a period of six months. Under the current regulation, the Commissioner of the Public Debt may determine, given the circumstances of the case, that the six month penalty need not apply. As proposed, the Division of Special Investments may determine to waive the six month penalty, pursuant to the provisions governing waiver of regulations set forth under 31 CFR 306.126. Where settlement occurs after the proposed issue date and the Division of Special Investments determines, pursuant to 31 CFR 306.126, that settlement is acceptable on an exception basis, the six month penalty will be waived, and the subscriber shall be subject to a late payment assessment. The assessment will include payment of an amount equal to the amount of interest that would have accrued on the securities from the proposed issue date to the date of settlement, as well as an administrative fee of $100 per subscription. Assessments under this subsection are due on demand. Failure to pay an assessment shall render the subscriber ineligible thereafter to subscribe for securities under this offering until the assessment is paid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (15) Section 344.5(b)(2)_This section would add a reference to a designated Treasury form and delete a reference to wire as an authorized means of submitting notice for redemption prior to maturity. The agency's Parkersburg, WV, address is substituted for its former Washington, DC, address. This proposed section would allow the notice of redemption to be sent by facsimile or by other carriers. The current regulation provides that notice of redemption must be received no less than 15 calendar days before the requested redemption date. However, owners are encouraged to provide as much notice of redemption as possible to assure that payment can be timely made. As proposed, this section would provide that notice be submitted no less than 15 calendar days and no more than 60 calendar days before the requested redemption date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (16) Section 344.5(b)(3)(ii)_The current regulation states that the applicable rate table for determining the ``current borrowing rate'' is the one in effect on the day the request for early redemption is received or, where mailed, the postmark date. This section would clarify that the applicable rate table is the one in effect on the day the request for early redemption is telecopied, postmarked, or where delivered by other carrier, date-stamped.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

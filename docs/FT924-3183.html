			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: High stakes down under Few doubt the wisdom of British Airways' expansion strategy, but some shareholders may be feeling a touch nervous at the financial implications of its aggression. As if TAT, Dan-Air and the mooted Dollars 750m (Pounds 490m) stake in USAir were not enough, British Airways is also bidding to take a 25 per cent stake in Qantas, the Australian national carrier which is being privatised next year. The deal is far from done and BA will face strong competition from Singapore Airlines and Air New Zealand. In order to secure the stake, BA may have to put Pounds 250m-Pounds 300m on the table - although how quickly it would have to pay it out is unclear. Any such outlay would take gearing close to 70 per cent, which surely begins to test the limits of financial tolerance. BA would doubtless argue that opportunities to secure a foothold in the lucrative Asia-Pacific market seldom arise. And the stock market's apparent equanimity suggests shareholders may be ready to accept the argument. Whether they would be willing to back it eventually with cash is an altogether different matter. BA may be inclined to tough it out on the basis that there is only likely to be one more poor quarter to come and that any gearing up should only heighten its rebound. Alternatively, some form of capital markets issue may provide a neat way of sidestepping the issue. Yet perhaps BA would be privately relieved if one of its deals fell through. Being the world's favourite airline can create its own dilemmas.</p>

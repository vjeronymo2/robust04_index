			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Ex-mayor admits rigging vote in Dresden MR Wolfgang Berghofer, former mayor of Dresden, admitted in court yesterday that he had falsified the results of the city's elections in May 1989 but claimed he had been acting on direct orders from his superiors, one of whom was to become the last communist prime minister of East Germany. Mr Berghofer accused Mr Hans Modrow, the then Communist party leader of Dresden district, of responsibility for the vote rigging, along with Mr Werner Moke, the first secretary of the party in Dresden who is also on trial. Mr Modrow, who later became the last Communist premier of East Germany, is now a member of parliament in Bonn for the Democratic Socialist Party (PDS) and is to be called as a witness. The Dresden public prosecutor has launched a separate investigation into allegations of election rigging by Mr Modrow. The trial is seen by justice officials as a test case in assigning responsibility for the widespread manipulation of results in East Germany's local elections on May 7 1989. The Communists officially reported that only 2.5 per cent of ballots cast were against the party instead of an actual 12 per cent, while 98 per cent of eligible voters were said to have voted instead of 90 per cent. Mr Otto Schily, defending Mr Berghofer, argued in court that since East German elections were by their very nature undemocratic, his client could not be accused of 'falsifying what was false'. Previous trials of officials accused of altering returns in other elections have ended in light sentences.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Chin Chang-uk on interview with Kim Sam-hun, ROK </F> nuclear ambassador, by Washington-based ROK correspondents in  Washington D.C. on 3 June]    [Text] Kim Sam-hun, ROK nuclear ambassador, said on 3 June  that UN Security Council sanctions against North Korea are aimed  at resolving the North Korean nuclear problem and if North Korea  ensures nuclear transparency in the future, sanctions can be  removed.    In an interview with Washington-based ROK correspondents  held  in Washington, Ambassador Kim pointed out that adoption of a  resolution on sanctions against North Korea by the UN Security  Council is the most important issue at present. He stressed,  however, that if North Korea allows a special inspection of two  undeclared nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA], it would be a breakthrough in the North Korean  nuclear problem, although the issue on fuel rods in the Yongbyon  reactor has not been resolved satisfactorily.    The interview follows:    [Question] What is the purpose of your visit to Washington?    [Kim Sam-hun] My purpose is to discuss the positions on the  North Korean nuclear issue by the ROK and the United States in  the UN Security Council, as well as that between the ROK, the  United States, and Japan; and to discuss sanctions against North  Korea by the UN Security Council with its Standing Committee  member states.    I had consultations on measures of the ROK and the United  States with Robert Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of state  and coordinator of the North Korean nuclear issue, on the  morning of 3 June. On 4 June, I will have working-level  consultations with the United States and Japan.    [Question] What was the content of discussion with Assistant  Secretary Gallucci?    [Kim Sam-hun] We discussed various steps and a broad range  of issues regarding sanctions by the UN Security Council against  North Korea. There was no difference in views between the ROK  and the United States during the discussion.    [Question] What is the purpose of sanctions against North  Korea?    [Kim Sam-hun] The sanctions are aimed at removing nuclear  suspicion of North Korea and ensuring nuclear transparency. The  purpose is to ultimately resolve the North Korean nuclear  problem.    The ROK Government made efforts to resolve the problem  through dialogue to the end. However, the IAEA decided that its  future measurement of used nuclear fuel rods in the Yongbyon  reactor is now impossible. As a result, the basis for dialogue  has collapsed and sanctions have become inevitable.    Even if sanctions are imposed, we will not renounce dialogue  with North Korea if nuclear suspicion is removed and nuclear  transparency is ensured.    [Question] Is there any other way to examine North Korea's  diversion of nuclear material, other than by the fuel rods in  the five-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon?    [Kim Sam-hun] Even without the fuel rods in the Yongbyon  reactor, there is room for examining the history of North Korean  nuclear development provided that an inspection is allowed of  the two undeclared nuclear facilities that North Korea omitted  from the list when it reported its 16 nuclear facilities to the  IAEA. Therefore, the inspection of two undeclared facilities,  which are known to store nuclear waste after reprocessing, will  become an important issue in the future.    Since the accuracy of measurement of used fuel rods from the  reactor is higher than any other method, the IAEA demanded this  measurement from North Korea.    North Korea has persistently refused the IAEA's special  inspection of its two undeclared facilities since March 1993.  Because of this, the North Korean nuclear issue has reached the  sanctions stage.    [Question] What is the extent of the U.S. and ROK attitude  regarding sanctions against North Korea?    [Kim Sam-hun] IAEA Secretary-General Hans Blix's report to  the UN Security Council is an important momentum for sanctions  against North Korea. We must not lose this momentum. It is not  desirable to miss the opportunity by wasting time. The issue of  sanctions is still in the discussion stage. However, if  sanctions against North Korea are approved by the UN Security  Council, they should contain practical consequences. The  sanctions this time should not merely be a statement-like  warning, as the recent presidential statement of UN Security  Council.    [Question] Is there any change in China's attitude, which is  a Standing Committee member state of the Security Council?    [Kim Sam-hun] I cannot say at this moment that there is a  change. I may point out, however, that the ROK and the United  States has made all possible efforts to include China in the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, and has tried to  create conditions for China to do so.    [Question] What if North Korea declares its withdrawal from  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] before the UN Security  Council puts sanctions to a vote, and what would be your  reaction if North Korea declares that it possesses nuclear  armament?    [Kim Sam-hun] The North Korean nuclear problem began in  1992, and has been a full-scale international issue since March  1993. The international community will never tolerate North  Korea's declaring its withdrawal from the NPT or that it is a  nuclear-state. As the North Korean nuclear problem has been  discussed by the UN Security Council on many occasions, there  will be no problem in imposing sanctions even if North Korea  carries out such an act.</p>

The riot took place in Penitenciaria de Occidente, located  in  Santa Ana, 68 km west of San Salvador. The commotion among the  inmates broke out Wednesday night with two dead initially. The  situation was aggravated yesterday morning when the resident  inmates rejected the presence of others who had been transferred  from Gotera Prison in the east, where they had participated in a  massacre last November.    It was reported that the Occidente inmates demanded the  retransfer of the rioters, who caused the deaths of two of their  group on Wednesday night. After the riot ended last night with  the mediation of the UN Observer Mission in El Salvador, Onusal,  prison system director Rodolfo Garay Pineda reported nine dead,  six of whom had been beheaded by the old Santa Ana inmates.    The riot concluded after negotiations were held to  retransfer  the dangerous inmates and after inmate committees cooperated by  agreeing to surrender the knives and ice picks used in the riot.</p>

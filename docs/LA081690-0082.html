			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> SCHOOL DISTRICT TO RAISE LUNCH PRICES  </P> <P> The price of school lunches will increase 25% in the Ocean View Elementary  School District this fall because the schools are receiving less surplus food  from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, board members said.  </P> <P> The Board of Education of the four-school Oxnard district voted Tuesday to  raise the price from $1 to $1.25.  </P> <P> June Tanaka, a past president of the Laguna Vista Elementary School Parent  Teachers Club and a cashier in a school cafeteria, said 85% of the students at  the school are military dependents whose parents work at the Point Hueneme  naval base.  </P> <P> "Many of those children receive free lunches or buy reduced lunches for 40  cents, a price mandated by the state," she said. "It's unfortunate, but the  children who can afford lunches will pay the increase." GERRY BRAILO SPENCER  </P></p>

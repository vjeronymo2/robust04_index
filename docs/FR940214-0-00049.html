			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> H. Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) requires that applicants disclose identities of interest that will exist in the development of the proposed housing. Forms FmHA 1944&hyph;30, ``Identity of Interest (IOI) Disclosure Certificate,'' and 1944&hyph;31, ``Identity of Interest (IOI) Qualification Form,'' (available in any FmHA office) will be completed and submitted as part of the preapplication package.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> II. *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A. Economic justification and project size should be based on the housing need and demand from eligible prospective tenants or members who are permanent residents of the community and its surrounding trade area. Since the intent of the program is to provide adequate housing for the eligible permanent residents of the community, temporary residents of a community (such as college students in a college town, military personnel stationed at a military installation within the trade area, or others not claiming their current residence as their legal domicile) should be discounted in determining need and project size. The market study will reflect the types and sizes of units which are needed in the market area. For example, if the full market analysis shows a need for one-bedroom, two-bedroom, three-bedroom, and four-bedroom units, the preapplication must contain a percentage of three- and four-bedroom units to correspond to the need expressed by the market study in order to accommodate the larger families. The need will not be based on persons who own their own homes but will be derived from:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Persons migrating into the area;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Persons dwelling in family units who desire to move into their own units (elderly persons living with family members will only be considered if evidence of their interest in moving into the project is furnished with the market study);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Conservative estimate (not to exceed 20 percent) of households living in substandard rental housing (lacking complete plumbing facilities or 1.01 or more persons per room). (A higher percentage will be allowed only if it can be clearly documented by signed survey sheets, developed expressly for this purpose, that occupants of more than 20 percent of the occupied substandard rental units are willing and able to move into the proposed project.);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Demolition of rental stock;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Allowance for a 5 percent vacancy rate in the growth of households since the last census; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Conservative estimate (not to exceed 20 percent) of households experiencing rent overburden provided the analyst has made a determination there are sufficient households in the market area to occupy any rental units vacated by those lower income persons who choose to move into the proposed project from the existing units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. A detailed study based upon data obtained from census reports, State or county data centers, individual employers, industrial directories, or chambers of commerce is required. FmHA personnel will utilize the market study checklist found at Exhibit A&hyph;12 of this subpart (available in any FmHA office) as a means for measuring market study credibility. The study will include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> C. Exhibit A&hyph;8 of this subpart outlines the information which professional rental market studies will be required to follow. The qualifications of the person preparing the market study should include some housing or demographic experience. The market study will be used by FmHA in evaluating market feasibility but will not be the sole factor in such a determination. The data and information provided in the market study will be used to supplement FmHA's knowledge of the market area and to facilitate rational judgment concerning the need for new rental units. Other considerations will be FmHA's experience with the housing market in the State and local area and U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD's) analysis of market feasibility for the proposed units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> F. The analyst must affirm that he/she actually made an on-site visit to the market area and that failure to do so may result in denial of further participation in the section 515 program by the analyst.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

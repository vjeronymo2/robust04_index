			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. RULING ON SCHOLARSHIPS  </P> <P> William Raspberry raises many points in his commentary "A Suspicious Bolt From  the Blue," (Commentary, Dec. 18) most of which are fallacious and typify the  racist attitudes of the minority.  </P> <P> To insinuate that the recent, now improperly amended, ruling regarding  prohibitions against racially based scholarships came "out of the blue" is  ludicrous.  </P> <P> It was merely the consistent and proper application of federal law regarding  the impropriety of programs that discriminate on the basis of race.  </P> <P> Further, to intimate that no one had been asking why such scholarships have  been allowed to date is equally fallacious. Most thinking people, including  blacks, have complained about and demanded an end of discrimination under the  misnomer of "affirmative action" for many years.  </P> <P> To label Michael L. Williams' interpretation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as  "novel" is the epitome of buffoonery. His interpretation was exactly correct,  proper and in compliance with the law. Moreover, had the tables been turned,  the minority would have demanded that Williams' interpretation be adopted  posthaste.  </P> <P> A fatal defect in Raspberry's logic is that the government is somehow  responsible for equality of outcome. Nothing could be more preposterous. The  government's responsibility is properly limited to ensuring equality of  opportunity with the outcome allowed to be what ever it turns out to be.  </P> <P> J.

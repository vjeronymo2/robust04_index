			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (25): More, but still not enough - Foreign Investment MR K. K. Modi, the chairman of Godfrey Philips, a leading cigarette manufacturer, is a busy man right now. Last week he spent many hours with the top brass of Stephanel. This British company is seriously considering both marketing its range of women's wear and sourcing some of its production in India. Next week, Mr Modi will be closeted with Disney executives, looking at the prospect of dubbing the latter's vast repertoire of children's movies into various Indian languages. 'Since the liberalisation programme started, the number of inquiries from foreign companies has been phenomenal,' says Mr Modi.  'It is a far cry from the time we wore out shoe leather trying to attract companies to come to India.' The recent international interest in India is certainly not superficial. Very soon, Indians could be crunching bowls of Kellogg's Cornflakes, washed down by cans of Coke. These global brands are just two of the 950 foreign collaborations approved by the Indian Government in the past 12 months. In contrast, there were just 666 approvals in 1990. According to the Indian Investment Centre, 289 projects involving foreign equity worth Rs5.34bn were approved in 1991. Figures from the Department of Industrial Development suggest that 78 per cent of this amount was approved between August and December 1991, or shortly after the first budget of the present government. In January 1992, foreign collaborations involving Rs1.76bn were approved - which is more than the whole of 1990, when there were just 194 projects involved a mere Rs1.28bn worth of foreign equity. February 1992 was even more remarkable. In just that one month, the figure shot up to Rs14.91bn. Foreign investment seems to be finally coming to India in a big way. Currently, General Electric of the US is possibly the largest foreign investor. It has tied up with half a dozen Indian companies for products as diverse as refrigerators and washing machines (with Godrej), thermoplastics (with Indian Petrochemical Corporation), and industrial lighting (with Wipro). It has also evinced keen interest in India's ambitious energy programme and is likely to set up a electric power station once the government has finalised its power policy. Du Pont also has major investment plans. These include a Dollars 100m venture to manufacture polyester base film for photographic, X-ray and graphic arts applications, to be located at Kurkumbh, near Pune in Maharashtra. Meanwhile, there is a whole host of smaller projects involving high-profile multinationals such as Shell in petrochemicals, IBM in computers, and Alcatel in telecommunications. But just how much of this fresh investment is due to the welcome mat spread out by Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, and the much-touted 'new economic policy' announced on July 24 last year? Reading between the lines, the answer is: not very much. Companies like GE, Du Pont and Coca-Cola, which head the list of major investors, have long been interested in India. Most of their recently announced projects have been in the pipeline for the past two to four years. Even more significantly, almost all were tailor-made to suit India's five-year plans. The Du Pont polyester base film project is a classic example. 'The Indian government was clear that foreign investment had to be high-tech, world-class and export-oriented. We centred our project around those objectives,' says Mr Bob Wray, business director of Du Pont electronics. 'Liberalisation only speeded up decisions.' Even more significantly, despite the obvious and dramatic percentage increase in foreign investment, the actual total remains piffling in international terms. The question is: why has India failed to attract more? India's multi-layered bureaucracy is frequently cited as a key factor. Aware of international frustration, one of the first acts of the Narasimha Rao administration was to appoint a high-powered four-member foreign investment board headed by Mr A. N. Verma, a senior civil servant, to slice away at red tape. But it was unable to achieve much. Right through a sweltering Indian summer, Shell's managing director, for example, cooled his heels in a Delhi hotel, waiting for final clearances for a Rs30bn naphtha cracker which Shell wants to set up with the Mafatlal Group outside Bombay. He waited in vain. Swapping such horror stories is almost a favourite pastime for foreign businessmen dealing with India. In trying to understand the logic for these delays, what most India watchers forget, or neglect to take into account, is the strong nexus between business and politics in India. If a new venture encroaches on an existing concern, its management will anxiously look for ways to protect its turf. Often politicians and bureaucrats are all too ready to help out by stalling a rival's project. It took Pepsi-Cola over three years to set up a food processing and soft drink plant outside Delhi. The undertaking almost became unviable in the process. Though its profit-and-loss account is nothing to write home about, the Pepsi venture at least managed to get going despite the multi-pronged and unabashed blitz unleashed by Parle, a local soft drinks manufacturer. A Du Pont-Thapar Group nylon 66 project in Goa has not been as fortunate. The polyester cartel succeeded in delaying the Rs1.96bn enterprise to the point where cost escalations rendered it financially unviable. Another source of misgiving among potential foreign investors is India's draconian labour laws. It is almost impossible to fire workers or close down loss-making units. These are not the only trouble spots. According to Mr Alan Furness, British Deputy High Commissioner in Bombay, 'there is a degree of scepticism about how far government policies have really changed and what this means in practice. There are also fears about power allocations and whether other infrastructural needs will be fully met.' Nonetheless, despite warped labour policies, a stubborn bureaucracy and roadblocks all along the way, India holds several advantages over neighbouring countries for foreign investors. Du Pont, for example, preferred to locate its polyester base film plant in India rather than China, Japan or the Pacific Rim countries. According to Mr Wray, 'we want to globalise but there is too much competition in Japan and markets such as Korea, Taiwan and Singapore are too small. India offered more incentives than China. The clinching factor was the presence of a major local consumer for our product.' So India could be one way to beat the global recession; company results for 1991-1992 have been largely ebullient. Inflation and the prospect of a poor monsoon may cut into next year's profits but with a 150m-strong middle class, India's consumer boom, which started in the late 1980s, may only marginally decelerate. In this panorama, do the pluses outweigh the minuses in the minds of foreign investors? Recent figures certainly suggest that they do. But will India seize its rare opportunity or let it slip away?</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Proposed Changes to DRG Classifications and Relative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Weights  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the prospective payment system, we pay for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inpatient hospital services on the basis of a rate per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharge that varies by the DRG to which a beneficiary's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stay is assigned. The formula used to calculate payment for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a specific case takes an individual hospital's payment rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per case and multiplies it by the weight of the DRG to which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the case is assigned. Each DRG weight represents the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average resources required to care for cases in that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular DRG relative to the average resources used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treat cases in other DRGs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress recognized that it would be necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recalculate the DRG relative weights periodically to account  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for changes in resource consumption. Accordingly, section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1886(d)(4)(C) of the Act requires that the Secretary adjust  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the DRG classifications and relative weights annually.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These adjustments are made to reflect changes in treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patterns, technology, and any other factors that may change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the relative use of hospital resources. The proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes to the DRG classification system and the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recalibration of the DRG weights for discharges occurring on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or after October 1, 1994 are discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. DRG Reclassification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Cases are classified into DRGs for payment under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective payment system based on the principal diagnosis,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> up to eight additional diagnoses, and up to six procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed during the stay, as well as age, sex, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharge status of the patient. The diagnosis and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure information is reported by the hospital using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> codes from the International Classification of Diseases,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification (ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare fiscal intermediary enters the information into its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claims system and subjects it to a series of automated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> screens called the Medicare Code Editor (MCE). These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> screens are designed to identify cases that require further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review before classification into a DRG can be accomplished.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After screening through the MCE and any further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of the claims, cases are classified by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GROUPER software program into the appropriate DRG. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GROUPER program was developed as a means of classifying each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case into a DRG on the basis of the diagnosis and procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> codes and demographic information (that is, sex, age, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharge status). It is used both to classify past cases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in order to measure relative hospital resource consumption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to establish the DRG weights and to classify current cases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for purposes of determining payment. The records for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare hospital inpatient discharges are maintained in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (MedPAR) file. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data in this file are used to evaluate possible DRG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classification changes and to recalibrate the DRG weights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, cases are assigned to one of 491 DRGs in 25  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> major diagnostic categories (MDCs). Most MDCs are based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a particular organ system of the body (for example, MDC 6,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Diseases and Disorders of the Digestive System); however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some MDCs are not constructed on this basis since they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involve multiple organ systems (for example, MDC 22, Burns).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, principal diagnosis determines MDC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assignment. However, there are four DRGs to which cases are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assigned on the basis of procedure codes rather than first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assigning them to an MDC based on the principal diagnosis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These are the DRGs for liver and bone marrow transplant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (DRGs 480 and 481, respectively) and the two DRGs for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tracheostomies (DRGs 482 and 483). Cases are assigned to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these DRGs before classification to an MDC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Within most MDCs, cases are then divided into surgical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DRGs (based on a surgical hierarchy that orders individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures or groups of procedures by resource intensity)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and medical DRGs. Medical DRGs generally are differentiated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the basis of diagnosis and age. Some surgical and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical DRGs are further differentiated based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presence or absence of complications or comorbidities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (hereafter CC).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Generally, GROUPER does not consider other procedures;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is, nonsurgical procedures or minor surgical procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally not performed in an operating room are not listed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as operating room (OR) procedures in the GROUPER decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tables. However, there are a few non-OR procedures that do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affect DRG assignment for certain principal diagnoses, such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for patients with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principal diagnosis of urinary stones.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The changes we are proposing to make to the DRG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classification system for FY 1995 are set forth below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. MDC 2 (Diseases and Disorders of the Eye)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When a case is coded with a principal diagnosis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subcorneal pustular dermatosis (diagnosis code 694.1), it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classified to MDC 2 (Diseases and Disorders of the Eye),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where it is assigned to DRGs 46, 47, and 48 (Other Disorders  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Eye). <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  We recently received a suggestion from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public that we should review the DRG classification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subcorneal pustular dermatosis because it is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dermatological condition and is not a disease or disorder of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the eye.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A single title combined with two DRG numbers is used to signify pairs. Generally, the first DRG is for cases with CC and the second is for cases without CC. If a third number is included, it represents cases of patients who are age 0&hyph;17. Occasionally, a pair of DRGs is split on age >17 and age 0&hyph;17. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (17): Parasites on the piste  -International sponsorship / So-called 'ambush marketing' is the biggest concern in the International Olympic Committee's commercial sector. It is not a game but a deadly serious business It is commonplace, whenever sport is discussed, to lament its increasing 'commercialisation'. Everyone likes to hark back to some imagined golden age before sponsorships, advertising deals and player salaries featuring six zeros. Such debates are almost as much fun as watching the sport. Although the TOPIII sponsorship programme will raise the extraordinary sum of about Dollars 800m for the Olympics in the quadrennium containing the Lillehammer and Atlanta events, few people realise that Olympic sponsorship is not new. Even in the ancient Games, athletes received the backing of wealthy patrons. When the modern Games were revived in Athens in 1896, the organising committee faced financial hurdles and sold advertising in a souvenir programme to help meet the bills. Among the companies taking space was Kodak, still a leading Olympic sponsor through its participation in the TOPIII programme. When the Games visited Stockholm in 1912, rights were granted to several Swedish companies to take exclusive photographs and sell memorabilia from the Games. At Paris in 1924, advertising was sold within the main stadium. This policy has since been reversed and the Olympics are now the only major international sporting event with no signage at the actual venues. Although the costs of becoming a TOPIII sponsor are such that only the biggest multinational companies can take advantage of the global product exclusivity on offer, the worries of the Olympic movement are now directed as much to protecting existing partners as to seeking new ones. 'Ambush marketing' is the biggest concern in the International Olympic Committee's commercial sector. 'It is not a game but a deadly serious business. One that has the potential to destroy sponsorship,' says Michael Payne, the IOC's marketing director. 'If ambush marketing is left unchecked then the fundamental revenue basis of sport will be undermined.' Unlike official sponsors, who pay significant amounts to help support the Olympic Games, ambush marketeers pay nothing. In the words of Dick Pound, unofficial commercial leader among the IOC vice-presidents: 'they try to get a free ride, which is neither fair, ethical, nor right.' The phenomenon is becoming known as 'parasitic marketing'. The distinction is to try to correct the image of gung-ho Robin Hoods taking from the wicked, wealthy corporate giants. In fact, the ambush tactics are often adopted by companies bigger than the actual sponsors themselves. Some of the most common ploys include creating signage or branding within sight or broadcast of Olympic venues. Airships are a much-tried tactic. In Barcelona, both Reebok and Fuji had blimps stationed to fly over the city but these were grounded by IOC legal action. For a decade, American Express has waged a guerrilla war to combat Visa's status as an official Olympic sponsor. During 1988, Amex used photos of the main Olympic stadium in Seoul for a general advertising campaign. Pictures from the Asian games were retouched to make them look like the Olympics. During the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville, Amex launched an entire print advertising campaign in France based around the Games. The IOC successfully sued the company. 'When a company chooses not to be involved with an event and then tries to borrow or steal the imagery associated with that event, it steals from the event and the institutions behind it,' says John Bennett of Visa International. So far in Lillehammer, most of the problems have been nipped in the bud before lawyers become involved. However, Lillehammer Olympic Organising Committee officials are watchful. Ethics are so highly developed in Norway that any 'ambush' trouble is most likely to come from companies outside the country. 'Very few Norwegian companies infringe on the rights of sponsors,' said Asmund Berge of the organising committee. 'However, there have been some examples of top international firms who have engaged in such activities. We have had discussions with them and, so far, have been able to sort out the matter.' Dick Pound thoroughly disagrees with any advertising managers or marketing managers who see ambush tactics as imaginative short-cuts for companies short of resources. 'Cute? Street smart? You must be kidding,' says Pound. 'This is uncreative, unethical and unprofessional.'</p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Jacques Vert plunges into the red - Finance director on 'paid leave' as dividend is halved to 2p JACQUES VERT, the womenswear group, is replacing its finance director after falling sales and rising costs plunged the company into loss for the six months to October 26 1991. The interim dividend is halved to 2p; the joint chairmen are waiving their dividend entitlement in respect of their 57.9 per cent stake in the company. The level of payment at the year-end will be 'considered in the light of circumstances pertaining at the time of the preliminary announcement in July 1992', the company said. The group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 125,000, compared with a profit of Pounds 1.23m last time. The shares fell from 193p to 116p. The company blamed 'extremely tough' trading conditions for a fall in sales and a sharp rise in air freight charges following the Gulf war for the higher costs. Sales at its 22 UK shops dropped by 6.5 per cent. The result was a fall in gross margin from 43.4 per cent to 39.5 per cent. 'We have now introduced an early warning system for margin control,' said Mr David Tiedeman, managing director, yesterday. He said that the previous system for monitoring the margins 'had failed'. The company said yesterday that 'after three years with the group, latterly as finance director, Sashi Mylvaganam is no longer carrying out his executive duties.' Mr Tiedeman said Mr Mylvaganam was on paid leave and that a temporary replacement had been seconded from the company's auditors. The board is undertaking a strategic review of the group's operations with particular emphasis on manufacturing, overheads and brand development. Turnover for the six months slipped from Pounds 20.2m to Pounds 19.7m, and the company registered losses per share of 0.8p (earnings 8.1p). With the tightening of cash management, gearing fell to 51 per cent (65 per cent). Directors said that while there were 'few signs of abatement in the recession', the second half of the year was traditionally stronger. The company has nevertheless shelved plans to increase the number of shops beyond the current 25.</p>

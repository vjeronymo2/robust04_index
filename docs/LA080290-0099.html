			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'PALLADIUM': DIAL 'S' FOR A WINNING SWINDLE AT COURT THEATRE  </P> <P> Lenore Carlson was on the money when she subtitled her play, "Palladium Is  Moving," "A Nasty, Vicious Comedy." But surely her tongue was in her cheek as  she scrawled those words. Half the fun of this "Palladium" at the Court Theatre  in Hollywood is watching a sleazy bunch of telemarketers get theirs.  </P> <P> The other half is watching them get each other on the way to getting theirs.  </P> <P> The idea isn't entirely new to the stage. David Mamet came up with something  like it in "Glen Garry Glenn Ross" and so did Keith Reddin -- at least as the  jumping-off point for his "Life During Wartime" which closed Sunday at the La  Jolla Playhouse. Carlson's intent is a touch less serious than Mamet's or  Reddin's (she does call it a comedy), but it's a fiercely funny epitaph to the  gods of swindle, written in hot ink and stemming (according to the author's  program note) from some real-life encounters with the breed.  </P> <P> Her setting is simple: a "phone room" operation, somewhere in the vast open  spaces of Greater Los Angeles. Four telemarketing cowboys are riding herd on  their preys, reaching out and touching their someones, bilking them out of  hundreds of thousands of dollars with a mere turn of the dial. Make that  thousands of dollars. This is not a high-class operation.  </P> <P> It's Nick's operation (Carmen Argenziano), a peripatetic leader of the pack who  is not happy unless everyone is busy. His "team" includes a fast-talking sleaze  named Freddie (Gregg Henry) who is into this to support a coke habit; a prickly  character named Brad (Glenn Plummer) for whom the telephone squeeze is just one  of several enterprises, and a rookie named Malcolm (Anthony Starke).  </P> <P> Malcolm is at once the most and least interesting -- least to the audience,  most to the boiler room veterans who can't quite believe how wet this kid is  behind the ears. Ostensibly, he is an unemployed actor trying to make ends meet  between jobs. But is he cut out for the roughness of this trade?  </P> <P> Carlson's play has a straightforward spine that eventually pivots on the  suspense of pondering that last question. For a long time, plot is not the  issue. Interaction is. She has a talent for muscular, salty language that would  make Mamet proud. And she fills in the blanks of each character she paints not  quite by the numbers.  </P> <P> There are fewer surprises in who these people are than in how vividly this  hand-picked cast brings them to life. Argenziano's Nick is a typically driven,  coiled, unfocused, sometimes hysterical boss, who is not happy if he isn't  having a knockdown-drag-out with someone. Henry's unkempt Freddie is vulgarity  incarnate -- a loud, oily, scared, mean man whose blow-by-blow description of  how he likes to live is hilarious and repulsive.  </P> <P> So far so good. Most of the first half is designed to humorously establish the  noxious environment of the room. The real suspense walks in with Plummer's Brad  -- a bristling sliver of a guy, watchful as a cat and lethal as a stiletto. You  don't mess with him, although Nick tries to and, to a lesser degree, so does  Malcolm -- the famous Malcolm, the fish in the wrong pond about to be devoured  by these sharks. Starke brings a tremulous innocence and vulnerability to the  role that eventually explode in ways one only partially anticipates.  </P> <P> It's a raw, precipitous tumble to the play's conclusion over hairpin turns.  </P> <P> James Carhart has supplied a neutral office interior, brightly lit by Brian  Gale. Lisa James' vigorous staging meets this material head on. It's direct and  punchy, though one might wish for a quicker start out of the gate. That  problem, however, is as much the writer's as the director's. Carlson's play,  like a roller coaster, is slow to build in its pull to the top of the curve,  but swift enough once it's unleashed on the downslope.  </P> <P> Carlson diligently keeps the nasty and vicious going to the end, but to her  credit, the comedy, which has a surprisingly moral outcome, never sinks into  self-righteousness. If you're looking for new insights on the subject of sleaze  or greed, however, you won't find them here. "Palladium" is to be taken at face  value. It may not be searing satire, but it is clever, gutsy entertainment  whose well-observed spoofing makes mincemeat of some of today's  all-too-recognizable realities.  </P></p>

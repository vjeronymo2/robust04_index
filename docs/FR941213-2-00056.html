Course description. The course provides the student with an overview of various types of common machinery and related safety standards. The course provides guidance in recognizing hazards such as those created by points of operation, ingoing nip points, rotating parts, and flying chips or sparks, and provides some options to achieve abatement. A field trip is provided to enhance students' knowledge of machine guarding standards. The OSHA Training Institute awards 2.5 CEU's for this course. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Course objectives. Students completing this course should be able to: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Identify various machines and their functions; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Identify common machinery hazards; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Recommend selected abatement methods; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Select the appropriate OSHA standard that applies to a hazard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Course topics: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Introduction, pretest and pretest review, posttest and posttest review_2 hours. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Hazards and standards workshop and review_2 hours. In this workshop, written hazard conditions are researched, and standards are reviewed and referenced. Oral review also incorporates policy relating to specific conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Inspection field trip to machine shop operations and inspection writeup_6 hours. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The class is taken to facilities with extensive and varied metalworking and woodworking operations following the discussions of machinery, terminology, and 29 CFR 1910.211&hyph;1910.219. It exposes the students to operations including lathes, mills, boring machines, screw machines, woodworking machines, mechanical power presses, and power transmission apparatus. Students are given an opportunity to apply hazard recognition concepts on a site inspection at an operating facility with a variety of machine operations. They evaluate and document any machinery and machine guarding hazards, then return to the classroom to research the standards for citation references. They present an oral report on their findings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Review of 29 CFR part 1910, subpart O, machinery and machine guarding concepts_1 hour. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e.

Course description. The course is designed for students in the private sector who are interested in teaching the 10- and 30-hour construction safety and health outreach program to their employees and other interested groups. Special emphasis is placed upon those topics that are required in the 10- and 30-hour programs as well as on those that are the most hazardous, using OSHA standards as a guide. Course participants are briefed on effective instructional approaches and the effective use of visual aids and handouts. This course allows the student to conduct both a 10-hour and a 30-hour construction safety and health course and to issue OSHA cards to participants certifying course completion. The OSHA Training Institute awards 2.5 CEU's for this course. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Course objectives. Students completing this course should be able to: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Define construction terms found in OSHA standards; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Present effective safety and health training programs in accordance with OSHA construction standards, regulations, and guidelines; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c. Identify hazards and determine appropriate standards; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Prepare reports citing the conditions found; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. Identify methods to abate hazards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Course topics: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Introduction, pretest and pretest review, overview of the OSH Act and OSHA, introduction to OSHA standards, posttest and posttest review_4 hours. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.

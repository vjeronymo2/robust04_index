			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Pressure cooking With margins the envy of food retailers worldwide, it is perhaps not surprising that investors fret about the prospect of a UK food fight breaking out. Hence the sharp drop in food retailing share prices which greeted J Sainsbury's announcement of its January price promotion. Given the billions being poured into new stores, any protracted battle would indeed be serious. Yet despite the suitably robust replies from Sainsbury's principal competitors, Safeway and Tesco, the overwhelming impression is of Sainsbury tightening its grip on the market. Indeed, one of the most interesting parts of Sainsbury's statement was that it had beaten its own demanding sales budgets in the run up to Christmas. The increased profits thus generated provide ammunition for the company to cut prices selectively and expand its market share. It may even be politically desirable for Sainsbury to plough back profits into sales growth rather than see its margins rise even further. Not that margins are being cast to one side. The campaign has been cleverly hyped to extract the maximum publicity and increase in volumes from carefully chosen price concessions, and suppliers will bear some of the price cuts in the hope of higher sales. Tesco confronts Sainsbury most directly, yet its slower growth record limits its room for response. The valuation gap which has opened up between the two this year is unlikely to narrow. And Tesco's recent foray into France may even hint that the company is finding the domestic kitchen a little warm.</p>

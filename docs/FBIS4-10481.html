			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Socialist Party [PS] is aware that it is  currently the leader in the Coalition of Parties for Democracy,  which is a role played by the Christian Democratic Party [PDC]  at the political and congressional level in the past.    This comment was made on 23 March by Socialist Youth  President Mauricio Bugueno, who said his party has shown that it  is capable of politically leading the coalition and that it has  been able to face the situation better than other parties,  including the PDC.    Asked if he believes the PDC has lost the political  leadership of the coalition, Bugueno said the PDC is in a  situation of "perplexity and confusion" and that this is proven  in some way by the comments made by PDC President Gutemberg  Martinez, who said the Socialist Party's current strategy is to  become a political choice.    Bugueno said that such a statement is absurd.    Despite the comments by PDC Senators Andres Saldivar and  Juan  Hamilton denying the PS' leadership of the coalition, PDC  leaders at the national, provincial, and municipal level and the  militants see with concern that their party is not creating  political events or leading the coalition; on the contrary, the  party is involved in infighting for leadership that is  unnecessarily wearing down the party. [passage omitted]    The PS' talks with the RN [National Renewal] on political  reforms have been interpreted as a good political strategy. This  led the PDC to talk with the Independent Democratic Union (UDI)  on corruption and administrative integrity, which is an issue  also being discussed by the PS with the RN. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Arts: The Road to Oxiana 'Out of the trees to the south rose a tall fluted dome, moon-lit blue against the deep-toned verdure and the slaty frown of a storm on the Hindu Kush.' That, of course, is Robert Byron describing Balkh (pictured above) in The Road to Oxiana, an account of his winter journey through Iran and Afghanistan in in 1933-34. Rereading it after 20 years I cannot think that anyone has ever surpassed Byron at evoking monuments in their landscape setting. But Byron was also a photographer of talent: this weekend is the last chance to see some 80 fascinating photographs in Along the Golden Road to Samarkand: Photographs of Monuments in the Middle East by A. W. Lawrence, T. E. Lawrence and Robert Byron, at the Courtauld Institute (071-873-2526). Of this trio, Byron's photographs alone have real distinction. TE Lawrence was a keen photographer, but his shots of Azraq in Jordan - his base in November 1917 for operations against the Damascus to Baisan railway - and the streets of Jidda, are pretty unremarkable. However, Lawrence fanatics may like to know that this set of photographs are the best examples that can be seen. They are printed from the original glass negatives given by AW Lawrence (younger brother, fellow-spy, and archaeologist) to the Conway Library at the Courtauld Institute. The Byron photographs, however, are sensational, all the towers and mausolea and mosques he describes in his travel journal - and more. Some few of these places may look better than when Byron saw them, thanks to restorers. But many look infinitely worse, thanks to untalented restoration and, in Afghanistan, to Russian carpet-bombing. What has become of the remaining minarets of Herat? Byron's thousand or so photographs, which include Russian architecture in the 1930s, is nothing less than a publisher's goldmine, with or without the homosexual erotica which has apparently disappeared - into Professor Anthony Blunt's private collection.</p>

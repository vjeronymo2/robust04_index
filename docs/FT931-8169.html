			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Letter: VAT on food a banana skin that government must avoid Sir, Michael MacKenzie of the Food and Drink Federation (Letters, February 10) has rightly described the proposed imposition of VAT on food as a tax on the poor. We also think that there are other points to be made against the proposal. VAT will cause further inflationary pressure on food costs for an industry already suffering the effects of the devaluation of the pound. It would also be a tax on farmers at a time when bankruptcies are commonplace. And it would be ironic if the government extended VAT, with accompanying bureaucracy, in the same month as it has launched a campaign to reduce the burden of regulation on the food industry. As proponents of public health, we are in favour of sensible and flexible regulation, but the imposition of VAT on food would be neither. The government should reconsider. The FT has consistently covered the international row on the banana trade. We are sure that your readers will join us in judging the idea of VAT on food as a banana skin the government and the food industry would do well to avoid.

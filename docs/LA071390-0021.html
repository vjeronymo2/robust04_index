			<p><P> July 13, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS;  </P> <P> $500,000 CROP OF MARIJUANA SEIZED  </P> <P> Narcotics detectives from the Ventura County Sheriff's Department seized  $500,000 worth of marijuana plants and arrested the alleged grower during a  drug bust Wednesday evening in the Santa Monica Mountains, authorities said.  </P> <P> Walter Rheo Vaughn, 48, was arrested on suspicion of cultivating marijuana and  released on his own recognizance, a Ventura County Jail spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> "He was very, very disappointed," Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Arnie Aviles  said. "He had a very big cash crop."  </P> <P> The carefully tended crop of more than 200 plants would have been ready for  harvest in three months, Aviles said.  </P> <P> The Sheriff's Department received a tip last week that marijuana was being  grown on the property in the 9900 block of Cotharin Road in an unincorporated  area of the county southwest of Thousand Oaks, Aviles said.  </P> <P> Detectives obtained a search warrant and investigated the property Tuesday,  Aviles said. He said the detectives photographed the 1,500-square-foot plot  before pulling out all the plants. Some of the plants will be analyzed at a  lab, and the rest will be destroyed, he said.

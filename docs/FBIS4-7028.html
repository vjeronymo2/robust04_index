			<p>BFN     [Text] According to Seoul's Christian Broadcasting System  reports, on 25 April the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique launched the  provocative Hwarang war exercise in Inchon and the areas of  Kyonggi Province adjacent to the military demarcation line.    The exercise in which some 1.3 million puppet military  personnel, police officers, and reservists are taking part will  be conducted for five days under the pretext of defending the  homeland and facilities against someone's infiltration.    The war exercise commotion perpetrated by the puppet clique  is all the more adventurous since it is staged right after  warmonger U.S. Defense Secretary Perry left Seoul after hatching  a war plot and, in particular, is timed to coincide with the  deployment of the latest-type Patriot missiles.    The prevailing situation once again exposes the fact that  the  Kim Yong-sam regime has completely thrown away its civilian  mask, has clearly revealed its color as a warmonger, and is  kicking up its preparations for a northward invasion.</p>

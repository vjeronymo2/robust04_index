			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: SARDUCCI'S GOOD FOR OPENERS  </P> <P> Sarducci's Cafe and Grill is best known for its Italian dishes and seafood, and  features what the restaurant touts as "South Orange County's Most Incredible  Desserts." But what many don't realize is how good the breakfasts are.  </P> <P> In keeping with the nature of San Juan Capistrano, Sarducci's offers a very  relaxed environment and good, friendly service. The place is adorned with  ceiling fans and white patio furniture and provides a choice of seating indoors  or out. If you choose to sit out on the lower patio, you can watch the morning  trains come in. The best news is that it's one of those rare places where you  can get quality food and generous portions at a very reasonable price.  </P> <P> Definitely worth trying are the Eggs Alaska (poached egg on an English muffin  with tomatoes, crab and Hollandaise sauce), and the Seafood Omelette, with  crab, shrimp and Hollandaise. The Italian Sausage Omelette is topped with tangy  marinara sauce and comes, as all omelets here do, with potatoes and mini-carrot  muffins or toast.  </P> <P> The Cajun breakfast, with spicy smoked ham, sausage, chicken and scrambled  eggs, pleases the more adventurous palate. Other good possibilities include  chicken and mushroom crepes with sherried cream sauce, seafood crepes with  crab, shrimp and Hollandaise sauce, and a familiar favorite: eggs Benedict.  </P> <P> In addition to their good coffee, Sarducci's offers espresso or cappuccino, and  a choice of fresh juices.  </P> <P> Sunday brunches, accompanied by champagne, fruit juice or mimosa, are $7.95.  The regular breakfasts are moderately priced, at around $10 to $12 for two  people.  </P> <P> </P> <P>  Sarducci's, 31751 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Open daily, 8 a.m.  to 10 p.m., Friday and Saturday till 11 p.m. (714) 493-9593. AMY McCURDY  </P></p>

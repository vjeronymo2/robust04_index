			<p>BFN     [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- According to the Defense Ministry,  the Federal Government has in no case become liable to recourse  by discontinuing deliveries to private arms dealers following  reunification. A spokesman for the ministry thereby reacted to  a BILD AM SONNTAG report, according to which foreign and German  firms demand payments from the government totaling 440 million  German marks, because the Defense Ministry failed to carry out  arms deliveries from National People's Army stocks that it had  promised during the time of the GDR.    The deliveries were agreed upon with the GDR government  under  former Disarmament and Defense Minister Rainer Eppelmann. The  Defense Ministry spokesman said that with Germany's unification  in 1990, all contracts with private arms dealers were canceled.  Only contracts that did not violate the War Weapons Control  Law were accepted. Following that delivery halt, the ministry  had in fact been sued repeatedly for noncompliance with its  contractual obligations, but it had not lost a single case. He  added that one lawsuit was still pending, but here, too, the  prospects of success were good.</p>

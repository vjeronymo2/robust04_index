			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Neither the quality proposal by LOL nor the somatic cell  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal by NCI, in which each handler would be allowed to submit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an individual quality or somatic cell payment plan to the market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrator, is included in this decision. Although the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act in 7 U.S.C. 608c(5) does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow for adjustments to minimum pay prices on the basis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality, such adjustments should be at a uniform rate for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> producers in the market. Allowing each handler to have its own  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment schedule would defeat the concept of uniform pricing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> producers, eliminate the purpose of allowing quality adjustments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the order, and lead to disorderly marketing. Producers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with identical milk shipping to different handlers within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same market could, and probably would, have different minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order pay prices if each handler had its own quality or somatic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cell payment plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of witnesses testified that the profusion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment plans currently in effect in the market today are causing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disorderly marketing, and that one of the benefits of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporating multiple component pricing with a somatic cell  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment in the five orders would be to reduce or at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standardize the vast array of producer payment plans currently in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect in the region. In view of such testimony, adoption of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LOL or NCI quality adjustment proposals would serve no purpose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Conforming Changes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To accommodate multiple component pricing a number of changes need to be made in the current order provisions of the five orders in this decision. To compute a handler's obligation and the producer price differential, several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prices need to be defined. The Class I differential price should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be defined as the difference between the current month's Class I  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price and the current month's Class III price. The Class II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differential price should be defined as the difference between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the current month's Class II price and the current month's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Class III price. These differential prices should not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confused with the fixed value that is added to the Minnesota-Wisconsin price for the second preceding month to arrive at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Class I price for the current month, or the computed value that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is used in the computation of the Class II price. It should also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be pointed out that these differential prices may be negative,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which currently happens when the Minnesota-Wisconsin price is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater than the Class I or Class II price. The skim milk price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be calculated by subtracting from the Class III price the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value determined by multiplying the butterfat differential by 35.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The skim milk price will be expressed on a per hundredweight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis with four places to the right of the decimal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since producer location adjustments are not changed in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision, the application of such adjustments to the producer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price differential remains unchanged. In some of the orders the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uniform price is ``snubbed'' at the Class III price when producer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> location adjustments are applied. In these orders, the producer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price differential will be adjusted for location until the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> producer price differential is zero if the producer price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differential at the zero zone is zero or greater. However, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the producer price differential is negative, no minus producer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> location adjustment will be applied. Plus adjustments to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative producer price differential would be made. In those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> orders in which the uniform price is not ``snubbed'' to the Class  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III price, producer location adjustments will be applied as they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are currently.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the Market Administrator to compute the producer price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differential handlers will need to supply additional information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on their monthly reports of receipts and utilization. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition to the product pounds and butterfat currently reported,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handlers will be required to report pounds of protein and pounds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of other solids. This information will be required from each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handler for all producer receipts, including milk diverted by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handler, receipts from cooperatives as 9(c) handlers, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receipts of bulk milk received by transfer or diversion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the Upper Midwest Order only, the due date for handlers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to submit reports of receipts and utilization should be changed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the 10th of the month to the 8th of the month. Currently,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Upper Midwest Order requires handlers to submit reports by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 10th of the month, and the Uniform Price to be announced by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 11th of the month, allowing only one day for the pooling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process. The other four orders involved in this decision allow a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longer period of time for the processing of data and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> announcement of the Uniform Price. In the Chicago Regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Order, handler reports are due on the 10th, and the Uniform Price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is announced on the 14th, a period of 4 days. In the Iowa Order,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handler reports are due on the 8th, and the Uniform Price is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> announced on the 12th, a period of 4 days. In the Nebraska-Western Iowa Order, handler reports are due on the 7th, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Uniform Price is announced on the 12th, a period of 5 days. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Eastern South Dakota Order, handler reports are due on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8th, and the Uniform Price is announced on the 12th, a period of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

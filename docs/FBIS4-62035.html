			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Eduard Popov] </F>   [Text] Vladivostok May 12 TASS -- Confrontation between the  Vladivostok border guard service and representatives from the  international Greenpeace organisation, who arrived in the  maritime territory to drum up support for the protection of the  Ussuri taiga from massive log felling and industrial pollution,  is turning into a scandal.    A Greenpeace ship cannot leave the Vladivostok port for the  Svetlaya Bay for the fourth day to inspect activities of the  Russian-South Korean log felling enterprise.    Operating in compliance with Russian legislation, border  guards approved the call only for the ship's crew members.    However, the bulk of the delegation consists of ecologists,  researchers and journalists who are, in actual fact, passengers  and, according to Russian laws, have no right to cross Russian  territorial waters.    Commenting on the situation, head of the Vladivostok port  check point Oleg Sukhanov claimed that the Greenpeace  deliberately earns scandalous popularity on the conflict with  authorities.    The ship with crew members may go to the bay without any  problems. The rest of the delegation may go to the bay (some  500 kilometers from Vladivostok) by other types of  transportation, for instance, by air.    "Despite my great respect for the international `Greens'  movement, we cannot permit a violation of Russian legislation on  the protection of the state border," the border guard stressed.</p>

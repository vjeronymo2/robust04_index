			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Arts: A demonic 'Don' Since the bicentenary year the most exciting performances of Mozart's operas in London have not been in an opera-house. This irony is thanks to John Eliot Gardiner, whose enormously successful series of the major operas is presumably nearing completion. Like so many important musical projects, Gardiner's Mozart operas have been undertaken with an eye on recordings. The live performances which have been scheduled alongside have toured Europe, sometimes in fully-staged productions, but in London only as semi-staged concert performances at the Queen Elizabeth Hall. That was, at least, until this week's Don Giovanni, when the stage action grew to engulf the entire hall. Of the three Mozart/Da Ponte comedies, Don Giovanni is surely the one most suited to Gardiner's gifts. There is nothing warm or relaxed about his Mozart, nothing soft-centred. His intellectual background comes across as rigorous clarity of thought in performance, driven along by the energy that has taken him to the top of his profession. Nobody in the English Baroque Soloists or Monteverdi Choir is slack with Gardiner as conductor. From the opening chords of the Overture their playing made the spine tingle. The drama was brutally intense, the comedy hard-driven, as though the music was constantly poised on a knife edge between violence and laughter. Rodney Gilfry's Don Giovanni personified this dual character, always larking about, a young man who had gone off the rails and was now wholly irresponsible, ruining lives half for fun, half for sadistic delight. He had plenty of charisma. For Cos fan tutte, his previous opera in the series, Gardiner chose young singers who could be moulded in his image, more notable for their blend as an ensemble than any individuality. This time he went to the opposite extreme and we had a diverse international cast with as many styles and personalities as there were singers. It is always a bonus to have an Italian as Leporello and Ildebrando D'Arcangelo was one of the best; young, humorous, every word clear. The words came and went in Luba Orgonasova's self-consciously artful singing as Donna Anna, but she rose to the classical poise of her second-act aria. It might have been better if she had exchanged roles with Charlotte Margiono's outgoing Donna Elvira. Eirian James sang with warm beauty of tone as Zerlina, but her Masetto, Julian Clarkson, was a bit of a character. Christoph Pregardien made a forthright Don Ottavio, denied his second aria. As ever challenging accepted ideas, Gardiner performed the later, Vienna version of the opera - an interesting change to the usual, but not an improvement. In the final scene Andrea Silvestrelli's Commendatore, as huge of voice as he is of person, descended menacingly from the back of the hall, while Gilfry's insolent Giovanni strutted back and forth in impatience. As the demons surrounded the audience, Gardiner unleashed the music as if all hell had been let loose. It is a long time since London saw a Don Giovanni to touch this. Sponsored by British Telecom. Further performance today and then in Ludwigsburg</p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / The changing fax of life: An industry's strategic shift It is already late in the evening and you have only just finished putting together the action plan for tomorrow's annual meeting. Branch managers scattered throughout the country are waiting anxiously for their copies to be faxed to them. No need to panic. Just call up the national branch map on your computer screen and press the auto-dialling button. Within minutes your managers will have easy-to-read plain paper copies of the crucial document on their desks, complete with colour graphs. Such technology is one example of a new wave of fax products aimed at integrating the machine into office and home electronics. For the fax industry, the success of the new generation is a matter of survival. Like other areas of electronics the fax is suffering from stagnant growth. The US and Japanese markets peaked in 1990, and the UK also faces saturation. All British companies with more than 1,000 employees and 70 per cent of those with fewer than 100 had faxes by 1990, according to market research company BIS Strategic Decisions. Saturation of markets has combined with intense competition and recession to prompt a price war. A basic fax machine which cost businesses Pounds 4,000 in 1986 can now be bought for about Pounds 400, says Mr Tomio Komine, general manager of the fax marketing department at Canon in the UK. 'Prices have been dropping like crazy,' says Mr Jeffrey Goldberg, industry analyst at Dataquest, the market research company. 'Nobody's making money from fax machines as far as I can tell.' Not surprisingly, there have been casualties. In Europe, Alcatel, the leading French telecommunications group, recently announced that it would stop making fax machines at its own factories because of the fall in prices and margins. Alcatel's withdrawal leaves the industry even more concentrated in Japanese hands. The largest manufacturers of fax machines are all Japanese, with Canon, Matsushita, Sharp and Ricoh achieving the largest international sales. Even Xerox, the US company which brought the world the first commercial fax machine, manufactures its faxes almost entirely through Fuji Xerox, its Japanese subsidiary. But the Japanese, too, are now suffering. Their response has been to invest heavily to develop products with sufficient advantages over older models to spark demand and justify premium prices. The greatest hope over the next few years lies in plain paper faxes, which use ink jet sprays or laser-printed normal paper rather than the shiny, flimsy thermal paper which is universally disliked. BIS expects annual sales of plain paper faxes in the US to grow from Dollars 28bn in 1990 to Dollars 93bn this year. However, prices of plain paper machines are expected to fall sharply by the end of this year as more vendors introduce competing models. The price of a top-of-the-range machine, for example, is forecast to drop from about Dollars 2,500 to Dollars 2,000, according to BIS. Multi-functional fax machines - integrated with printers, scanners and photocopiers - also hold out the hope of better profits. The growing trend to integrate the fax with the PC, however, could represent a threat to all stand-alone faxes and their manufacturers. The fall in prices of PC modems, which enable PC users to send faxes straight off their computer screens, has accelerated the development of such rival systems. 'As more and more people become computer literate, they will want to avoid the inconvenience of having to stand up from their terminal,' says Jennie Lewis, senior analyst at BIS. If the shift to integration takes off, the fax industry could be looking increasingly at the non-business user for growth. The combined fax and answering machine is likely to be the main spur to home demand. Manufacturers looking further into the future also talk of integrating a fax capability in mobile phones. In Japan, where machines small enough to fit under the telephone are becoming popular, it is fashionable to have a fax machine at home. Japanese schoolchildren are already sending homework to each other via the fax. The popularity among younger consumers could spread if Swatch, the Swiss group that makes 'disposable' watches, comes out with a fax machine, as promised. There are already signs that prices of household fax machines are falling even before the residential market has fully developed. If, as expected, such price cuts materialise, the fax-cum-answering machine could rival the videophone as the next yuppie gadget.</p>

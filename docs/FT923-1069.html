			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Jamaica aims to boost alumina output by 50% IN SPITE of the weak state of the aluminium market, bauxite refiners in Jamaica are expanding their refining capacity to lift the island's alumina output by about 50 per cent by 1997. The industry is using all its current installed refining capacity of 3m tonnes a year, and according to Mr Carlton Davis, executive chairman of the Jamaica Bauxite Institute, growth will be constrained until the plants are expanded. Alumina Partners of Jamaica, the island's largest refiner, will lift capacity from the current 1.2m tonnes a year to 1.5m tonnes by the middle of next year. Mr Davis said a second phase of expansion will see an increase to 2m tonnes a year. The company, owned by Kaiser Aluminum of the United States and Hydro Aluminum of Norway, is spending Dollars 180m on the first phase of the program. Jamalco, a refinery jointly owned by the Jamaican government and the Aluminum Company of America, is boosting capacity from 800,000 tonnes a year to 1m tonnes at a cost of Dollars 60m, Mr Davis said. The plant's rated capacity will later be increased to 1.5m tonnes a year. Two refineries owned by Alcan of Canada are also being upgraded to lift total alumina output by 200,000 tonnes a year to 1.2m tonnes. Industry sources say the companies are not deterred by the weak state of the aluminium market. 'This is a market which has always been cyclic and will rebound,' said an industry spokesman. 'The hope is that the added capacity will be in place when there is an increase in demand.' The state of the market, however, is depressing the earnings from the industry for Jamaica, the world's third largest producer of bauxite ore after Australia and New Guinea. Mr Davis says the island's earnings from the industry this year will be about Dollars 625m. Earnings have declined steadily from Dollars 700m in 1991 and Dollars 725 in 1992 as aluminium prices have fallen. The Bauxite Institute is projecting Jamaica's mine and refinery output for this year at the same levels as 1991 - 11.5m tonnes of bauxite and 3m tonnes of alumina.</p>

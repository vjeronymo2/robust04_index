The United States has been sending about $7 million a year in  covert aid to a guerrilla coalition headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk. Robert  Kimmitt, undersecretary of state for political affairs, told the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee that the increased aid would strengthen Sihanouk's position  in negotiations next month on a Vietnamese withdrawal from Cambodia as well as  deter attacks by the Khmer Rouge on his forces.  </P></p>

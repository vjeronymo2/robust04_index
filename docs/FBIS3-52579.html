			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, Jan 5 (INA) -- An Iraqi political analyst  predicted peaceful trends in the Arab region during the current  year resulting from feelings of fatigue caused by international  conflicts that had engulfed the region over the past years.    The analyst, Mr. Barzan al-Tikriti said in an article  published by AL-JUMHURIYAH newspaper today that such kind of  peace could be achieved if bravery was available with those  decision-making people to wrap up chapter of the past and start  a new chapter through serious and realistic debate of affairs  and realities despite their bitterness to reach a new and sound  frame that clarifies the nature of relationship and obligations.    The Iraqi analyst warned against the probabilities in case  of  non-availability of good intentions and the bravery for  realizing a settlement of leading to dangerous developments that  cause blood and destruction.    Mr. al-Tikriti believes that inter-actions of 1994 will be  governed by the quality of the relationship between two courses.  First of them is the feeling of fatigue from the conflict and  the second is an increased move toward regionalism especially in  the Arab region as a result to previous events and mainly to the  events in the Arab Peninsula and Gulf.    The Iraqi analyst justified the Zionist-Palestinian  self-rule  agreement to the feeling of fatigue of the conflict parties and  said that that feeling could be the reason behind the  probability of achieving peace in Ireland and other hot-beds in  the world.    Mr. al-Tikriti further predicted an end to other conflicts  in  other parts of the word like Afghanistan. Former Yugoslavia,  Somalia, Yemen in addition to the conclusion of peace agreements  by concerned Arab countries with Israel.    The analyst was of the view that all those issues would be  liable for settlement because of the weight of pressure of  fatigue from conflict unless a decisive factor could be  introduced in those conflicts and differences and namely the  motive of regionalism.    Mr. al-Takriti ruled out the possibility that the Arab  homeland could witness a real attempt for unification neither in  general nor on the level of regional entities and that there are  increased fears over the possibility of maintaining Iraq as  integral entity.    The analyst replied on such fears by saying that Iraq would  remain unified for reasons including that what could be applied  on Iraq is applied on countries of the region unless those  countries would accept what the others decide for them or were  not knowing what is going around them or within their borders.    The Iraqi analyst further predicted an escalation to the  extreme fundamentalist trend in the Arab region in the manner  that threatens of changes in the Arab Peninsula and the Gulf  states, Egypt and other Arab countries.</p>

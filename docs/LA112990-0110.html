			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY WINS SETTLEMENT OVER FORCED CESAREAN  </P> <P> The parents of a cancer patient who died shortly after being forced to undergo  a Cesarean section have ended their three-year battle, winning an unprecedented  settlement that the ACLU called "an important victory for women's rights."  </P> <P> "All through her short life, Angie wanted to help other people," Nettie Stoner  said of her daughter, Angela Carder. "Through her last tragedy, little did she  know that even though she would not be here, she would continue to help  people."  </P> <P> The settlement Monday between George Washington University Hospital and  Carder's family includes a monetary award and an agreement by the hospital to  establish policies protecting pregnant women's rights to determine their  medical treatment. Both parties agreed not to disclose the size of the award.  </P> <P> "We did not want the dollar amount to overshadow what we think is the more  significant outcome of the case, which is the policy perspective," said Terry  Thorton, an attorney working with the ACLU who represented the family.  </P> <P> Carder, 27, a terminal cancer patient at the hospital, died in 1987, two days  after doctors performed a Cesarean section, ordered by a lower court, in an  attempt to save the life of her 26-week-old fetus. The baby died less than  three hours after the operation, which was listed as a contributing factor in  Carder's death.  </P> <P> Carder's parents, who live in Clarksville, Md., appealed the order, saying that  their daughter, who was conscious and coherent at the time of the operation,  did not give informed consent. Further, the family charged that the surgery  violated Carder's right to bodily integrity.  </P> <P> The District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled in the family's favor, saying:  "A fetus cannot have rights . . . superior to those of a person who has already  been born."  </P> <P> On behalf of the Stoners, the ACLU brought a civil suit and a medical  malpractice case against the hospital, charging that it had not taken  sufficient measures to determine Carder's wishes and did not consult the family  before requesting the court order.  </P> <P> The hospital has agreed to establish policies aimed at precluding court  intervention in such cases.  </P></p>

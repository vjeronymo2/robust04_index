			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Brussels tightens aid curbs THE European Commission yesterday reinforced its increasingly tough line on state aid in Italy when it attached strict conditions, applicable to all Italian state holdings, to its authorisation of payments to creditors of Efim, the liquidated state industrial holding. Yesterday's decision follows a preliminary deal reached in July between Mr Karel Van Miert, EC commissioner for competition, and Mr Beniamino Andreatta, Italian foreign minister, which allowed for repayment of half the bank loans. Efim was put into liquidation in July 1992 with debts of nearly L18,000bn (Pounds 7.49bn). Financial institutions were owed L9.3bn of this, including more than L3,500bn to foreign banks. The loans were guaranteed by the state under Italian law, and Rome argued it was obliged to honour what amounted to sovereign debt. The Commission accepted this argument, but in effect held up the deal as part of a wider effort to bring Italian state aid under control. At the time of the July understanding between Brussels and Rome, the Italian government withdrew its plan to write off debts worth Ecu4bn (Pounds 3.08bn) run up by Ilva, the steel group. The two sides are still negotiating the size of the write-off against Commission demands for steel capacity cuts. As part of the agreement on Efim, to be monitored by the Commission, Rome will have to: Impose a freeze on debt at state-owned companies by the end of 1993; Reduce debt to levels in equivalent private sector companies by the end of 1996; Revoke the government's loan guarantee arrangements to state-owned companies immediately afterwards. Agree to the Commission's joint monitoring of the process.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Researchers develop artificial eye AN ARTIFICIAL eye capable of recognising shapes and patterns in a way which mimics human sight has been developed by researchers in Dublin. Teams from Hitachi of Japan and Trinity College, Dublin, have combined two of the most advanced information processing technologies - optical computing and neural networking - to create an optical device which can 'learn' to recognise objects in a fashion far in advance of the comparatively crude robot vision systems available today. The Dublin eye can, for example, recognise and distinguish between two patterns irrespective of their position or movement. Applications for the new technology could include automated assembly systems in factories, robots able to tackle a wide range of services and self-steering vehicles. Among the work being carried out at Hitachi is the interpretation of human facial expressions, which could have important consequences for human-machine interaction. Current automatic vision systems use television cameras to scan an image or an object, the shape of which is analysed by special software. While impressive results have been obtained with such systems they are at best an approximation to true machine vision. The Dublin researchers realised that computers using light beams instead of electrons would have the necessary speed to analyse more complex shapes or objects in motion. The Dublin eye is one of the first devices which combine light based computing with a neural network, an attempt to create a brain-like system using microprocessor chips. It is the second breakthrough this year for Hitachi's European laboratories. In February, the Cambridge laboratory developed the prototype of a powerful computer memory. Hitachi has been collaborating with Trinity College for five years and the arrangement has led to establishment of the Hitachi Dublin Laboratory in 1989.</p>

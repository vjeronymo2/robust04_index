			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by N.N. Ugarova, Moscow State University; UDC </F> 577.158.54:579.8.04]    [Abstract] The unique properties of firefly luciferase--an  enzyme which catalyzes luciferin's organic substrate oxidation  by atmospheric oxygen in the presence of  adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATF) and magnesium ions--which is  almost absolutely specific to both luciferin and ATP prompted an  examination of the underlying principles of bioluminescent  microanalysis using firefly luciferase. Numerous published data  and the outcome of the author's own lab research into the use of  luciferase in microbiology, clinical biochemistry, and proximate  analysis of the materials' antibiotic sensitivity and resistance  to biologically-induced corrosion are outlined. The principal  characteristics of two ATP-reagents (microlum and immolum), the  measurement ranges of enzyme and metabolite trace amounts using  firefly luciferase, the ATP, PNM, and gemine content in various  biological materials, and the microflora sensitivity to the  effect of antibiotics are summarized. The light signal at  various ATP concentrations for the immolum agent, calibration  curves for detecting the ADP nucleotide, calibration curves for  detecting biomass in various cultures, ATP concentration curves  in measurements of the microflora sensitivity to antibiotics,  and the calibration curve for detecting the _b_-galactosidade  by  the bioluminescent method are plotted. New approaches to using  luciferase for detecting marker enzymes in enzymatic immunoassay  analysis and nonradioactive detection of DNA samples are  considered. Basic research and the development of enzyme  stabilization and immobilization methods as well as the  development of analytical procedures of luciferase applications  open up new opportunities for bioluminescent methods in  analytical and clinical biochemistry labs and in environmental  and microbiological monitoring.

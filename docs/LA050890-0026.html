			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN '83 BURBANK SLAYING  </P> <P> One of two people arrested in recent weeks in connection with a 1983  drug-related slaying in Burbank pleaded not guilty to murder Monday at an  arraignment in Burbank Municipal Court, authorities said.  </P> <P> Norman R. Nixon, 50, of San Jose was arrested Saturday at his home on a warrant  charging him with the Sept. 27, 1983, killing of 29-year-old Humberto Varela,  who was found shot to death in his home in the 1100 block of North Frederic  Street.  </P> <P> Clifford Green, 41, of Spokane, Wash., was arrested April 27 and has been  charged with murder, Burbank police said. Green is fighting extradition from  Washington to Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Authorities said Varela's slaying remained an unsolved mystery until earlier  this year, when an unidentified witness offered information.  </P> <P> "A witness came forward and made life a lot easier for us," said Los Angeles  County Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Cohen. "It was a witness who knew information  about the slaying."  </P> <P> Though authorities said they have enough evidence to charge the suspects, the  exact details of what led to Varela's death are not known.  </P> <P> "We know there were drugs involved, but we are not sure what happened," Cohen  said. "The investigation is continuing."  </P> <P> Sgt. Don Goldberg, a spokesman for the Police Department, declined to comment  on the motive for the slaying.  </P> <P> It was not known if Nixon and Green were residents of Burbank at the time of  the killing, Goldberg said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES CAMPAIGN '89  </P> <P> MAYORAL RACE  </P> <P> Councilman Nate Holden in a press release issued Monday said that he fully  supports the Los Angeles Police Department's efforts to combat gang violence  and drugs and blames Mayor Tom Bradley for not giving the department "more  support and protection."  </P> <P> Bradley has opened his Watts district campaign office at 11323 S. Central Ave.  </P> <P> CITY COUNCIL RACES  </P> <P> Councilwoman Joy Picus has received some powerful endorsements. Democratic  Reps. Henry Waxman and Howard Berman of Los Angeles, who head the influential  Berman-Waxman Democratic political organization, backed her. So did council  colleagues Richard Alatorre, Ernani Bernardi, Joan Milke Flores, Gloria Molina,  Joel Wachs, Michael Woo and Zev Yaroslavsky. Finally, she was endorsed by two  important city employee unions, Los Angeles Police Protective League and the  United Paramedics of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Jeanne Nemo, who is a candidate against Picus, hopes to get some needed  campaign financing help from a $75-per-person fund-raiser at a supporter's home  tonight. County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who is supporting Nemo, will  attend.  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky, running for another term in the 5th District, has been endorsed by  colleague Marvin Braude and conservation groups, including the Sierra Club, the  Coalition for Clean Air, Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and the American  Oceans Campaign. His political allies in the group that has fought Pacific  Palisades oil drilling, No Oil Inc., also endorsed him, as did gay and lesbian  community leaders, including the Municipal Elections Committee of Los Angeles  and the San Fernando Valley Democratic Party.  </P> <P> Woo, councilman in the 13th District, has the backing of the Sierra Club and  the Los Angeles League of Conservation Voters.  </P> <P> CITY CONTROLLER  </P> <P> Candidate Ray Bishop has offered to conduct an independent audit of the Los  Angeles Housing Authority at his own expense.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> David Bierk's new paintings, collectively titled "In the Absence of Paradise,"  are medleys of copies from famous artists of the past. The styles are  reproduced with superficial accuracy, but each work is either much larger or  much smaller than the original.  </P> <P> Bierk is big on Fantin La Tour's flowers, Gauguin's Polynesian scenes and  Vermeer's unforgettable women. There is something unpleasantly manipulative  about this work, with its couplings of brand name artists and popular images,  its fake sentimentality and its stentorian appeal to the viewer to recognize  the underlying meanings of art.  </P> <P> Bierk combines Vermeer's woman with a pearl earring, a painted sunset sky and  landscape photographs into a fiction he calls "Home/Wife to Vermeer." He  juxtaposes a Bwami mask with a portrait of Freud and a Degas painting of a  father and daughter as if to say, "See, this is really deep, stuff on many  cultural levels." And he ostentatiously genuflects before the cold perfection  of Robert Mapplethorpe's photographs and tragically brief life with the painted  image of a curly haired Greek god in "In Remembrance of Icarus, to Robert  Mapplethorpe, Manet, Claude Lorrain and the Planet Earth."  </P> <P> The artist pursues a somewhat more grounded, less hype-conscious theme in  another group of works in which rather crude paintings of landscape amplify on  photographs of quintessentially "artistic" natural views: a pond at twilight, a  summer storm. Scenes like these, typically chosen for bravura painterly  effects, now seem more persuasive as captured by the mechanical eye of the  camera -- which suggests that painting no longer has the vision or the  vocabulary to summon up the old magic. (Jan Turner Gallery, 8000 Melrose Ave.,  to Feb. 3.) CATHY CURTIS  </P></p>

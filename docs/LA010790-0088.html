			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> EL CAMINO SHOCKED BY MT. SAC, 60-58  </P> <P> In a game that matched the defending South Coast Conference champions, El  Camino College, against a team that hadn't won a conference game in two  seasons, visiting Mt. San Antonio College shocked the Warriors, 60-58, Saturday  night.  </P> <P> John Moses hit the game-winning shot for Mt. SAC with 10 seconds left in the  game. The Warriors were not able to get a shot off before the horn sounded.  </P> <P> "We just could not hit our shots when we really needed to in the second half,"  El Camino Coach Ron McClurkin said.  </P> <P> El Camino (15-5, 0-1) never really got its offense on track. But despite cold  shooting, the Warriors were able to lead by 10 points at halftime, 32-22,  because of a tough defense.  </P> <P> The Warriors finished the night shooting a dismal 34% from the field.  "Basically, our defense kept us in the game," McClurkin said.  </P> <P> Trailing by 13 points in the opening moments of the second half, Mt. SAC got  its own defense to stiffen. "We decided to play a lot more man-to-man in the  second half," Coach Ralph Osterkamp said. "That allowed us to get back into the  game."  </P> <P> The Mountaineers (5-14, 1-0) tied the game when Moses scored with 6:15  remaining and took the lead on a Ny Bradford lay-in with 5:13 left.  </P> <P> El Camino next plays at Pasadena Community College on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.  </P></p>

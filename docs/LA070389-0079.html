			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: IRVINE;  </P> <P> FAULTY METER TRIGGERS RELEASE OF AMMONIA  </P> <P> A faulty meter triggered a small leak of moderately toxic ammonia Sunday at  Diceon Electronics Inc., but Orange County fire officials reported no  evacuations or injuries.  </P> <P> Diceon, a major manufacturer of computer circuit boards, was cited June 26 by  the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to report the nature and amount  of its toxic emissions -- requirements of federal law.  </P> <P> Joe McHugh, a director of the Irvine-based firm, said a meter that monitors  part of a chemical waste system malfunctioned sometime after 2 a.m., when the  last of the plant's 92 employees left.  </P> <P> When the meter detects certain changes in the composition of the chemicals, it  triggers the discharge of anhydrous ammonia to restore the system's balance,  McHugh said.  </P> <P> County fire officials said the broken meter was connected to a 500-gallon  anhydrous ammonia tank, but they could not say how much of the gaseous chemical  had leaked.  </P> <P> McHugh estimated that "something less than half our tank" was discharged.  </P> <P> A plant official noticed the odor of ammonia about 6 a.m. and notified the  County Fire Department, which dispatched a hazardous materials team to the  site.  </P> <P> Twelve firefighters, one engine and one fire truck also were sent to Diceon's  plant in the 16800 block of Hale Avenue -- an industrial park near Barranca  Parkway and Jamboree Road.  </P></p>

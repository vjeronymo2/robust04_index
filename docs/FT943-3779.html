			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Light cast on secrets of EU ministers A shaft of light fell across the secretive deliberations of the European Council yesterday with the release in London of partial details on more than 200 single market decisions taken in the five years to last December. The records, which the EU has refused to publish, show that 91 of 233 single market decisions taken in secret by ministers were forced through against the wishes of one or more member states under the qualified majority voting system. The council - the most powerful EU institution, made up of EU heads of government - legislates in secret, and has resisted attempts to force disclosure of its deliberations under the union's open government rules. Its reticence is being challenged in the European Court in an action backed by the European parliament following the formal rejection of attempts by newspapers to obtain voting records. However, Mr Harry Barnes, a British Labour MP, has obtained details of single market decisions from January 1993 through a parliamentary question tabled in the British House of Commons. Mr Richard Needham, UK trade minister, reveals in a letter to Mr Barnes that 142 single market provisions over the five-year period were adopted unanimously. Mr Needham does not give details of the alliances between member states in the 91 cases in which a vote was required. Nor does he say whether any proposals were withdrawn without being put to a vote. However, he discloses that the UK was on the winning side in 66 of the contested votes, abstained 17 times, and was outvoted eight times. The key British defeats were on regulations abolishing controls on passenger baggage on flights and sea crossings, on food quality control, and on transport issues such as the length of articulated lorries. Other member states failed to get their way on a range of more important issues, including directives on company law, public procurement, television broadcasting, life assurance services, partnership law and telecommunications. The council appears determined to prevent further breaches of its secrecy by arguing before the European Court that decision making could be paralysed by a public right to know details of the negotiating stances of member states. In a submission to the court, the council has urged the judges to ignore declarations at EU summits in favour of greater transparency, arguing that such statements had no binding effect.</p>

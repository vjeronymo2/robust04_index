			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Labour renews tax assault The government was yesterday under increasing pressure to answer another sensitive parliamentary question from Labour on the impact of the tax increases announced in the last Budget. Mrs Margaret Beckett, Labour deputy leader, yesterday raised the issue of the written question in the Commons, demanding that ministers 'come clean' and reveal how much tax a typical family will pay in the financial year 1995-96. The question was tabled three weeks ago by Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. Labour says the government is unwilling to drop a political bombshell by answering the question. Mrs Beckett told MPs that Mr Major's list of issues covered by the Back to Basics campaign 'did not include the standard of telling the truth about tax'. She said: 'We know the government has the figures and the people of Britain will have to pay that extra tax.' Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons who was deputising while Mr Major is in Moscow, said that he and the prime minister would emphasise 'the contribution which our tax policies are making to the economic strength and improved standards of living of this country'. Last month a question tabled by Ms Harman on the effect of the 1994-95 tax increases on a typical family caused a storm of protest in both parliament and the press. The government revealed that a typical family would pay Pounds 12.50 a week more in both direct and indirect taxation in 1994-95 as a result of the Budget. It was also revealed that the typical family would pay 35 per cent of gross income in taxation that year. Labour believes that the 1995-96 figures will show a further increase in payments of a typical family on those for the next financial year.</p>

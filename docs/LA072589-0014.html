			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEL BLANC  </P> <P> It is ironic that the great talents of Mel Blanc and Sir Laurence Olivier have  been lost to us in a period of less than 24 hours.  </P> <P> Both, in their own right, were masters of what they did. Mel was a man of  dignity and possessor of a talent that gave us thousands of hours of pleasure  for 50 years, and should long ago have been recognized by the Academy of Motion  Picture Arts and Sciences for giving so much for so long to so many.  </P> <P> Sir Laurence was unquestionably one of the greatest actors of our time, and  will be missed. Fortunately we have Olivier films and Mel Blanc cartoons . . .  from one spectrum to another . . . to keep us laughing and dazzled by their  great individual talents.  </P> <P> JERRY PERCHESKY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

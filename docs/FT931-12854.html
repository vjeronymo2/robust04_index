			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Foreign Affairs: Same deal as before - The Danes did not win new concessions on Maastricht Denmark has a new government. The foreign minister has pledged himself to secure a Yes to Maastricht in the second Danish referendum on the subject, to be held probably 'before June'. All's right with the world. Some moaning Euro-minnies are still muttering about the dangerous precedent set by Denmark's special 'opt-outs', negotiated at last month's Edinburgh summit. Won't Conservative backbenchers try to obtain the same deal for Britain, as the price of ratification? Won't candidates for EC membership, with three of whom formal negotiations are to start on Monday, demand that the same exemptions apply to them? Isn't this the beginning of the a la carte union so dreaded by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission? Much louder is the chorus of self-congratulation. Danish ministers have waxed eloquent about their success in wringing recognition of their country's special preoccupations from their European colleagues. The one thing everyone seems to agree on is that Denmark did obtain significant concessions, and that to squeeze these through without amending the treaty required ingenious legal draftsmanship. The truth is slightly different. The reason the treaty does not need amending is that it has not been changed. The deal being offered to the Danish people in 1993 is the same one they rejected in 1992. In popular journalistic shorthand, Denmark has been exempted from: European citizenship, economic and monetary union (Emu), joint defence and some aspects of co-operation on justice and home affairs. But to see what has actually happened, one has to read the official conclusions of the Edinburgh summit, in conjunction with the text of the Maastricht treaty. On citizenship, the 'decision' of the heads of state and government in Edinburgh says nothing about exemption, nor about Denmark. It simply says that European citizenship does not replace national citizenship, and the latter remains a matter of national law. In the annexed unilateral declaration, Denmark itself explicitly undertakes fully to 'respect all specific rights expressly provided for in the treaty and applying to nationals of the member states'. It turns out that nationals of other member states already have the right to vote in Danish municipal elections, and the declaration actually warns that Denmark 'has no intention of accepting' that the Maastricht arrangements on this point 'could lead to rules detracting from the rights already given in Denmark'. I suppose it is conceivable that some Danish voters rejected Maastricht last June out of fear that the existing right of foreigners to vote in their local elections might be curtailed. If so, they have been fully reassured. On Emu, Denmark does indeed have an opt-out from phase three (the single currency), as does Britain. But this opt-out was already contained in a protocol attached to the treaty as originally negotiated. All that happened in Edinburgh was that Denmark served notice in advance of its intention to exercise the right accorded to it by that protocol. That notice is, of course, not irrevocable. In fact, the Edinburgh decision says quite explicitly that Denmark may 'at any time . . . in accordance with its constitutional requirements, inform other member states that it no longer wishes to avail itself of all or part of this decision'. Moreover, the duration of the decision is governed by articles Q and N(2) of Maastricht. While article Q says the treaty is of unlimited duration, article N(2) promises a revision conference in 1996. There is thus a clear implication that Denmark's opt-out will be on the agenda of that conference. Denmark did not need to be exempted from joint defence, since Maastricht only refers to this as a future possibility. The treaty does foresee 'the definition, in time, of a common defence policy', but leaves defence as such to the Western European Union, of which Denmark has chosen to become an observer rather than a member. The Edinburgh decision notes this, and draws the conclusion that 'accordingly, Denmark does not participate in the elaboration and implementation of decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications'. The heads of state and government also noted Denmark's intention not to exercise the presidency of the Union when matters with defence implications were discussed, and stated that in such cases 'the normal rules for replacing the president, in the case of the president being indisposed, shall apply'. On justice and home affairs, the decision says explicitly that Denmark will participate fully. A separate declaration points out that, although under article K9 of the Maastricht treaty some aspects of these affairs can be transferred from an intergovernmental procedure to an EC one, involving qualified majority voting, a unanimous decision is required before any transfer can be made. And it notes that in Denmark such a decision will require a five-sixths parliamentary majority or a referendum. But nothing in the original treaty could have obliged Denmark to adopt any such decision without going through that procedure. The essence of unanimity is that no state can be obliged to implement something it has not agreed to. In short, all that happened in Edinburgh was that Denmark's rights under the treaty were spelt out. One may reasonably hope that the misconceptions of some Danish voters were thereby removed, and that this will encourage them to change their vote. But any claim by Denmark's leaders to be offering a new and better deal this year than last is, not to put too fine a point on it, boloney.</p>

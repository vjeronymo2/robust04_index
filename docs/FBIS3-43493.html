He was reacting in an  interview to pressure by foreign aid donors on the Zambian  government to stamp out corruption and drug trafficking in the  Cabinet.    Mushota said diplomats had international guidelines within  which to operate "which some have chosen to ignore with impunity  in Zambia". He said no official complaints had been lodged by  the Zambian government with the governments of the diplomats in  question, but added: "The Zambian government will expel foreign  diplomats who continue to question the governance of the country  by the State."    German ambassador Peter Schmidt said yesterday the  resignation of Foreign Minister Vernon Mwaaanga on Tuesday was  not enough to appease the donors. He called for other ministers  to resign and for more serious government efforts to stamp out  corruption.    Zambian newspapers yesterday carried reports alleging that  several Cabinet Ministers had misappropriated and shared out  between them a R[Rand]142 million Japanese grant intended for  small-scale business development. Political analysts expect  more Cabinet resignations as the corruption scandal continues to  rock the government of President Frederick Chiluba. While he  has not been linked to corruption, Chiluba is being accused of  weakness or incompetence in failing to stamp it out.    The Anti-Corruption Commission, set up by the government,  says it has begun investigating allegations by Mwaanga that some  of his former Cabinet colleagues had long been engaged in  corruption.</p>

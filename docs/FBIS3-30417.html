			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yavuz Kocak from Zagreb] </F>   [Excerpts] The prime ministers of Turkey and Pakistan held  a joint news conference in Zagreb where they stopped over after  their humanitarian visit to Sarajevo. Turkish Prime Minister  Tansu Ciller delivered the opening speech at the news conference  where the foreign ministers of the respective countries also  participated.    Ciller stated that they encountered a war for freedom during  their visit, which was undertaken for humanitarian purposes.  Ciller said: What the world should do is put  Bosnia-Herzegovina back on the world map. We share the  principles of the international community. Human rights is the  most important value. Preventing terrorism and oppression is  among the values we share. We should defend these values when  and where the need arises. Calling for a tolerant approach to  the religious and cultural unity of certain communities, Ciller  called for the perpetuation of the values so that another Berlin  Wall will not happen.    Indicating that peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina should be the  joint goal of the whole world, Ciller appealed to international  public opinion. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, a historical document -- termed the Sarajevo  Communique -- concerning the joint Ciller-Bhutto visit to  Bosnia-Herzegovina was issued. Noting that the visit was for  humanitarian purposes, the communique says that rarely in the  annals of human history has a nation been subjected to such a  massacre while the whole world is watching.    The Sarajevo Communique further states: It is terrifying  that  such a terrible human tragedy is being played out in the heart  of a continent that prides itself on its commitment to human  rights. It is unacceptable that in this era, where the  principles of the United Nations are universally recognized, a  sovereign and independent state is being violently wiped out and  its people -- peace-loving and enlightened -- massacred.    We are respectfully saluting the heroism shown by the people  of Bosnia. We are supporting them in their just struggle toward  the continuation of their national existence. We are supporting  them all the way in their determination to defend their  territorial integrity, the sovereignty of their motherland, and  their political independence.    The international disrespect shown in reaction to this  aggression is horrifying. We appeal to the world community to  halt the destruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The UN Security  Council should make sure that all its resolutions are properly  implemented. The embargo imposed on Bosnia-Herzegovina should  be lifted. The embargo violates their most important  international right -- the right to self-defense.    Bosnia should not be coerced into [word indistinct]  negotiations. We will stand against any initiative that supports  aggression. Ethnic cleansing cannot be considered the basis for  the emergence of a country. The conscientious efforts of the  United Nations and other humanitarian organizations should not  be belittled. We are appealing for an immediate lifting of all  obstacles standing in the way of humanitarian aid for  Bosnia-Herzegovina. For this reason, Tuzla Airport should be  reopened. The blockade on Sarajevo and the region declared the  security region should be lifted and the bombing of the civilian  population should be stopped immediately. Apart from this, an  all-out cease fire should be imposed and negotiations renewed.    Ciller and Bhutto made a courtesy call on Croatian President  Franjo Tudjman. The Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic and  other officials saw Ciller off in Zagreb. It is expected that  Ciller will arrive in Turkey at midnight.</p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Cost cuts and sterling devaluation help ICI SIR DENYS Henderson, chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, yesterday warned that his company's improved performance in the first quarter had been the result of cost-cutting and the devaluation of sterling rather than an improvement in the economic environment. 'While there are signs of economic recovery in some markets, including the UK, the underlying business trends in Continental western Europe remain poor. It is really too early to express definitive views regarding trading prospects,' he warned. Pre-tax profits increased in the first quarter by 10 per cent. Sir Denys warned that in trading terms, 1992 was a very difficult year during which the world economic scene deteriorated. 'This has been a desperately bad recession, deeper and wider than anything we have seen since the 1930s,' said Sir Denys. 'But although ICI's performance has suffered in consequence, it compares reasonably well with that of our international competitors in the chemical industry and many other large multinationals,' he maintained. Sir Denys defended the decision to maintain the dividend on the basis of the actions taken over the last three years to strengthen the company, and given the view that the industry was very close to the bottom of the chemical cycle. ICI closed its last plant manufacturing the ozone-depleting gases CFC 11 and CFC 12 in April. The last factory making halon, another ozone-damaging gas, would close during the autumn. The shares closed down 4p at 695p yesterday.</p>

			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> BARRY'S PLIGHT INSPIRES PLAY  </P> <P> It's not clear yet if Washington Mayor Marion Barry does or does not have a  book or movie contract, but novelist Ishmael Reed seems to be the first one out  with a satirical play based on the mayor's arrest and trial.  </P> <P> Reed, acclaimed author, poet, critic and essayist who calls his writing style  "neo-hoodooism," has titled his play of Barry's arrest "Savage Wilds, Part II."  </P> <P> It is to be performed at the BMT theater in Emeryville, Calif., next month.  Reed, who has taught for a number of years at UC Berkeley, will read from his  play at the Smithsonian on Aug. 21.  </P> <P> Author of such novels as "Yellow Back Radio Broke-Down" and "Mumbo Jumbo," Reed  said that "using fiction, I'm able to raise questions about the Barry case."  "Savage Wilds" is a broadly drawn assault on the prosecution of Barry, which  Reed believes is a "case of a black man being scapegoated. I think when people  have the sense to settle down and look back at this, the government will look  worse."  </P></p>

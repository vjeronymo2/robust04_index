			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Bonn rejects doubts cast on economic prospects for east THE German government yesterday rejected claims that it would be 20 years before living standards in the former East Germany matched those in the west. Mr Dieter Vogel, the government spokesman in Bonn, stuck firmly to the official line that the process would take only five years at most. He was responding to a charge from Mr Wolfgang Scheremet, a labour market expert at the respected DIW economic institute in Berlin, that the 'desolate' condition of the eastern economy had been widely under-estimated. Mr Scheremet said unemployment in the east would reach 1.5m in August, and claimed there would still be 1m people without work at the end of the decade. Unemployment in the east jumped to 1.34m, or 16.5 per cent, last month. Forecasts that economic growth of between 7 per cent and 12 per cent a year would lead to equal living standards in three to five years were illusory, he added. High pay awards in east and west were damaging competitiveness in the new federal states. Westerners would have to realise that unification had a very high price, and easterners would have to learn patience. Official estimates of 10 per cent growth this year are based mainly on the construction boom and developing service industries. According to the latest report from the Berliner Bank, oil refining, printing and food manufacture are also making better-than-average progress. Output from manufacturing industry, meanwhile, is still around 70 per cent of pre-unification levels. Figures published yesterday showed production in November last year was 1.5 per cent higher than in October, and 28 per cent lower than in November 1990. Engineering output was 38 per cent lower than a year earlier and only half the pre-unification level.</p>

			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Housing starts in US show decline A RUN OF encouraging US economic news was broken yesterday by reports of an unexpected decline in housing starts in October and a sharp rise in weekly claims for unemployment insurance early this month, writes Michael Prowse from Washington. The Commerce Department said housing starts fell 1.1 per cent between September and October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.23m units. The decline was broadly based with fewer starts in all regions except the Midwest. The figures, however, tend to be volatile on a monthly basis. The number of people making new claims for state unemployment insurance rose 31,000 to 386,000 in the week ending November 7, the largest increase in three months. The jump came as a surprise after weeks of steady declines.</p>

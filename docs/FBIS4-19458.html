			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Anneli Sundberg: "The Duel for Power"] </F>   [Text] It was the summer of 1990, and the Center Party of  Finnish politics was radiant with vitality and glamour. Paavo  Vayrynen, the battling party chairman, had laid down his arms  for the time being and had voluntarily relinquished control. His  stunned enemies and critics almost respected him. Esko Aho, the  new party chairman, held his victory jubilation under control.  The vanquished, Eeva Kuuskoski, Seppo Kaariainen, and Olli Rehn,  held their disappointment under control, but, then, they had  been able to participate in showing how broad and strong the  party leadership was.    A resounding electoral victory awaited just a few months  down  the road. Being in the party was pure bliss.    Less than four years later all has vanished: the glamour,  the  radiance, the vitality, the will to win.    The stars have dimmed, the faces have grown haggard, the  citizens are enraged, and the party leaders, both old and new,  are at each other's throats.    After the defeat in the presidential elections, the mud at  the bottom bubbled to the surface; laboriously covered up  conflicts, feelings of personal grudges, dislikes, and  disappointment began to surge out with irresistible force. In  the final analysis, the changing of the guard in the Center  Party during the sunny summer of 1990 did not, after all, occur  completely, smoothly, and nicely. The changing is only now  taking place, and it is happening tortuously and slowly. Two  lions cannot indefinitely be kept in the same doghouse.    Inch by inch Esko Aho, the prime minister and party  chairman,  is pushing Paavo Vayrynen aside, out of the party nucleus, which  has grown too small for these former friends and allies.    The battle has been waged in secret for a long time already,  in fact from the very moment that the Center Party gained its  great parliamentary election victory and thereby laid the  cornerstone of Paavo Vayrynen's long enduring dream: a  nonsocialist cabinet. Vayrynen realized very quickly that Aho  intended to play first fiddle at every possible occassion.    Aho was entranced by his role as prime minister.    When Finland's economy collapsed, the prime minister was  snatched away by the whirlwinds of crises, and Vayrynen was  deprived of the support he had expected for his great plans. He  had left the party in good hands that were to bear him all the  way to the presidential manor; but then what happened?    Oh, Vayrynen was allowed into the nonsocialist cabinet, as a  foreign minister. He had wanted to be the minister of the  treasury.    Aho took care of the country's economy and especially took  care of his own public image. Vayrynen also expressed his own  views on economic policy, but met with disapproval. Even those  who actually agreed with him disapproved of his rocking the boat.  <H5>  Relations Become Icy </H5>   Relations between Aho and Vayrynen iced over completely one  year ago, during the winter that Vayrynen tried to topple the  now hated nonsocialist cabinet and to engage the Social  Democrats into joining the government and sharing  responsibility. At that time Vayrynen was helped by Seppo  Kaariainen, the chairman of the party's parliamentary group,  current minister of commerce and industry, whose tolerant  broad-mindedness, as befits a Savo man, made contact with all  groupings possible.    But nothing worked.    Aho was supported by the president and survived. The cabinet  withstood the crisis, and Vayrynen, who had hoped to become  prime minister, departed. He was able to take no one with him,  even though word had spread as far and wide as Sodankyla that  Martti Pura, the minister of agriculture, would stomp off and  follow his lord and master out the cabinet door.    The entire operation proved to be harmful to Vayrynen.    He was permitted to conduct his presidential campaign as he  saw fit. Aho did not appear to much care how the Center Party  candidate fared. He stubbornly remained in the background. His  support could, at best, be described as formal.    Vayrynen's hopes were crushed already in the first round of  the presidential elections. Even during the very last meters  before election day he had tried to be convincing about his  Finnish wisdom, sense of humor, and relaxedness. The expensive  television advertisements proved to be wasted investments, as  Vayrynen, after the election, spewed accusations in all  directions. The "criminal" media and the chilly attitude of the  party leadership both received their share.  <H5>  A Plan Emerges </H5>   Once he had recovered, Vayrynen, in his purposeful way,  began  to arrange new positions for himself.    He desired a politically significant duty for the remainder  of the tenure of the current Eduskunta. He believed that he and  his support base could be of use in parrying off the defeat  threatening his party in the next election.    Vayrynen had no desire whatsoever for comforting words and  head-stroking. He was offered a cabinet post. That wasn't good  enough. He was offered the politically insignificant deputy  chairmanship of the parliamentary group. That wasn't good enough.    What Vayrynen wanted was the chairmanship of the  parliamentary group, a position with influence.    Unfortunately the position was already filled, so, to  realize  his wishes, Vayrynen had to do some arranging and planning. The  plan actually emerged quite easily and was easy to implement.    Kalevi Mattila, the parliamentary group chairman, would just  move over to the deputy chairmanship, and, bingo -- the way  would be open for Vayrynen to the chairmanship. He would  certainly be the unanimous choice, for who could doubt  Vayrynen's credentials?    This construction began to shake badly when one of the  available cabinet posts went to the "wrong" person. Anneli  Jaatteenmaki of Lapua took the position that the Vayrynen camp's  scheme had designated for Seppo Pelttari, a sheriff from Lapland.    With a fury arising from desperation the Vayrynen camp  attempted to hold on to their plan, but, surprisingly, Vayrynen  and his supporters found that the very tokens of their little  game had risen up against them.    Mattila decided that he wanted to remain as parliamentary  group chairman after all. There was to be no further discussion  on the theme that he, supposedly, had for a long time already,  actually wanted to be deputy chairman. That could now be the  post for Pelttari and Lapland, as some sort of compensation for  the cabinet post that he had lost in the selection process.    Prime Minister Esko Aho had realized what Vayrynen was up  to.  <H5>  Little Game Turns Into Nightmare </H5>   A trivial-seeming token game gained unprecedented  dimensions.  The question was no longer: Who is the chairman of the  parliamentary group? The question now was: Who is really in  charge of the party, the present chairman or the former one or  both?    The men drifted into a battle of wills in which apparently  neither wants to give up.    Prime Minister Aho has staked all of his authority into this  game. At this point Vayrynen has little beyond his steel-hard  will to place in the game. In earlier political arm-wrestling  matches, Vayrynen has been able to take advantage of his party  chairmanship, and up until the very last few weeks, he was  protected by his presidential candidacy. As an ordinary,  rank-and-file member of parliament he hardly holds any trump  cards. As such he cannot even threaten to resign.    This elimination game has now been played in public for  about  a week, and no manner of conciliation seems to be arising  between the men. In public Aho tries to present an image of a  party leader who is against no one, but for each and every one.  Nevertheless, Vayrynen's back is against the wall, even though  that wall is padded.    People have become accustomed to regard Vayrynen as a man  who  never gives up. He will strike back if someone hits him. During  the dramatic twists of the parliamentary chairman struggle,  Vayrynen's supporters warned that Vayrynen on the loose is one  dangerous man. Nevertheless, Aho appeared to be prepared to take  that risk, even though the party can ill afford to become  embroiled in a divisive power struggle.    Vayrynen now needs to reassess how he can use his own  prestige and support, and to what ends these will suffice. It  appears that Aho has gained the upper hand.    Vayrynen has expressed in every possible way that, at age  47,  he does not in any way at all want to become a political  old-timer, whose ramblings others can scarcely bear to listen  to. Unless the knot snarling relations between Aho and Vayrynen  is opened, Vayrynen needs to seek a new impetus for his  political future from the parliamentary elections. The prospects  are not rosy.    It appears that the Center Party is headed for disaster in  the coming parliamentary elections regardless of whether Aho and  Vayrynen are feuding or at peace. They stand to easily lose more  than 10 seats in the Eduskunta, unless the Social Democratic  express train to victory somehow derails.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Apr 30, BNS -- It is absolutely possible  that Estonia would buy anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons from  Russia, the commander in chief of the Estonian defense forces  said.    Maj. Gen. Aleksander Einseln in remarks to reporters about  his last week's visit to Moscow and talks with Russian army  leadership said that Estonia wants to buy high-quality weapons  at a low price. "If it is possible for us to get them from  Russia, we'll buy weapons from there," he said.    Einseln quoted the chief of Russia's General Staff, Col.  Gen.  Mikhail Kolesnikov as reconfirming that Russia will pull its  troops from Estonia. "But we didn't talks about dates at the  meeting," he said.    The Estonian commander in chief, who visited Moscow on Apr.  20- 22, also proposed to the Russian Defense Ministry to set up  a joint work group that would be able to quickly resolve all  problems that may emerge in connection with the withdrawal from  Estonia. Kolesnikov had said the proposal would be taken for  consideration.    Also discussed at the meetings were prospects for military  cooperation between Estonia and Russia after the Russian troops  will have left Estonia.    "We don't think that our contacts with the Russian military  will end after the troop withdrawal. We must also look into the  future and make clear the possible directions of working  closely," Einseln said.    The Estonian commander in chief has earlier said that the  country could start sending its cadets to be trained for  officers at Russian military colleges.</p>

We concur, and this has been done.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> OTHER COMMENTS:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While appendix C has been changed to reflect the requirement to have insurance coverage, the amounts are not included in appendix C. The amount of insurance coverage is not an item that is directly related to the size and weight of LCV's.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> NEW MEXICO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> LENGTH OF THE CARGO-CARRYING UNITS:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The cargo-carrying length restriction does not apply to two trailing unit combinations. The length of each trailing unit is limited to 28.5 feet. This describes a two trailing unit vehicle whose operation is guaranteed by the STAA regardless of inter-unit spacing. As long as each trailing unit is 28.5 feet long or less, cargo-carrying length is not restricted. This combination is listed as an LCV because it can exceed the 80,000-pound threshold established in the congressional definition. New Mexico has a grandfathered gross weight limit of 86,400 pounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> NEW YORK  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> COMBINATION:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State submitted an additional vehicle for inclusion in appendix C. It is an STAA Double (twin 28.5-foot units) hauling up to 100,000 pounds under a State DOT permit. As this combination may operate on NN highways in New York, appendix C has been amended to account for its operation. This combination was inadvertently omitted by the State DOT in its previous LCV submissions and docket comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> VEHICLE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CRASH commented that several items were omitted from the ``VEHICLE'' discussion in the SNPRM, including the need to carry emergency equipment, mud flaps, safety chains, and a tractor certification identification number. All of these items are now included in appendix C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The discussion under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DRIVER, VEHICLE,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> PERMIT <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  has been revised to note the fact that the New York State Thruway Authority, in addition to its responsibility for the tolled sections of Interstate routes 87, 87/287, 90, 95, and 190 (the original Thruway mainline between New York City and Pennsylvania along with the Berkshire, New England, and Niagara sections), now also has jurisdiction over the full length of I&hyph;84, and that portion of I&hyph;287 between Thruway exit 8 and I&hyph;95. These latter two sections remain toll-free, and the operating rules that apply are the same as those in effect on all other highways in the State that are under the jurisdiction of the New York State DOT.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> OTHER COMMENTS:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CRASH also sought to include the insurance requirements and the amounts. While appendix C has been changed to reflect the requirement to have insurance coverage, the amounts are not included in appendix C. The amount of insurance coverage is not an item that is directly related to the size and weight of LCV's.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the added combination discussed earlier, the State submitted a second vehicle for inclusion in appendix C. It is a combination which uses twin 28.5-foot units to carry nondivisible loads. This vehicle has not been included as nondivisible loads moving under permit are not subject to the freeze.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> OKLAHOMA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> LENGTH OF THE CARGO-CARRYING UNITS:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The cargo-carrying unit length for the two trailing unit combination has been listed in this final rule at 110 feet. This length was determined after further review of docket comments submitted by the CRASH, actual operation documentation submitted by various carriers, and the appropriate State statutes and regulations. The composite of the information available leads the FHWA to conclude that on or before June 1, 1991, the longest legally allowed multi-unit combination vehicle in regular or periodic use in the State consisted of a truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer, wherein each of the trailing units was 53 feet long. Combining twin 53-foot units with a 4-foot drawbar results in the 110-foot cargo-carrying length. In the NPRM the cargo-carrying length listed for both the ``Rocky Mountain'' and ``Turnpike'' Doubles was 123 feet. In the SNPRM, 123 feet was again listed for the ``Turnpike'' Double. The 123-foot distance was the result of combining a 4-foot drawbar with twin 59-foot 6-inch units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of establishing a cargo-carrying length subject to the freeze provisions of the ISTEA, the State incorrectly interpreted relevant provisions of the STAA of 1982. It appears the State reasoned that since the STAA required (1) that all States allow truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer ``Doubles'' combinations, and (2) that Oklahoma must allow a 59-foot 6-inch semitrailer to meet the grandfather provisions of the STAA (53 FR 2599, Jan. 29, 1988), it follows that Oklahoma must therefore allow twin 59-foot 6-inch units to operate as part of a multi-unit combination vehicle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the STAA does require all States to allow ``Doubles,'' the only applicable length requirement is that each State must allow at least 28.5-foot trailing units. The allowance of any longer unit is at a State's discretion within the parameters established by this final rule. The grandfathered semitrailer length applies only for truck tractor-semitrailer combinations. The STAA requires that each State continue to allow trailers or semitrailers of such dimensions as those that were in actual and lawful use in the State on December 1, 1982. The January 1988 rulemaking referred to earlier established that length as 59 feet 6 inches for Oklahoma.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

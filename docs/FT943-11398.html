			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Rising expectations 'In July the sun is hot. Is it shining? No it's not.' Flanders and Swann's old advice for those planning their holidays in Britain is an equally good guide for those fretting about the pace of the country's economic recovery. True, the horizon remains unusually cloudless for an upturn which is two years old. But the test of whether the government will allow it to overheat lies ahead. While the economy's worrier-in-chief, the Bank of England, was celebrating its 300th birthday, others in the City this week did some worrying of their own. This led to a significant fall in the price of UK government bonds. The yield on a 10-year gilt-edged security had risen to over 8.6 per cent by the end of the week, while Friday's money markets brimmed with expectations of interest rate rises to come. Is this midsummer madness, or something a bit more fundamental? Wednesday's silly rumours, whether substantiated or not, that a Conservative MEP had called for a hike in interest rates, would probably have received less attention in cooler months. UK bonds were also partly suffering a knock-on reaction from fears of inflation in the US. But the Confederation of British Industry's Industrial Trends Survey for July, published on Wednesday, helped fuel more home-grown fears that interest rates would need to rise soon. Receiving most of the attention were the survey's findings on manufacturing capacity. The number of companies reporting that they were operating below full capacity fell to 54 per cent, compared to 59 per cent four months ago. The latter happens to be the long-term average rate. Slightly more firms also fear that capacity will restrain their output in the coming months: another warning. Market speculation Although there are some causes for concern, little in the survey points to an imminent take-off in prices, as the authors themselves point out. Similarly, the Treasury's monthly monetary report - released as the governor of the Bank of England had his monthly meeting with the chancellor of exchequer - provided the participants with few reasons for confirming the financial markets' speculations. The narrow measure of money growth, though still growing faster than its monitoring range, slowed slightly in June, to 6.8 per cent, while output price inflation, as reported earlier in the month, remains at its lowest level since 1967. Monetary authorities with less profligate histories might get away with leaving things as they are. But British financial markets currently need rather more persuading that Mr Clarke will hold fast to his medium-term inflation targets. The gap between conventional and index-linked government bonds, a rough guide to inflation expectations, indicates that the market expects inflation to average over 4.6 per cent during the next five years, considerably more than the government has promised. Attaining greater long-term credibility will take more than the publication of the two gentlemen's monthly conversations. It will mean showing a willingness to act to slow price pressures, even when they remain beneath the surface. The significant growth in commodity prices, as many have remarked, is a potential source of such pressures. But these play a much smaller role in determining production costs than pay. Average earnings At present, growth in average earnings remains moderate, at a yearly rate of 3 3/4 per cent, having been broadly flat over the past few months. This should not breed complacency, however. For one things, average earnings are not a complete measure of labour costs, since they exclude the cost of many cash and non-cash benefits. As the pay research body, Industrial Relations Services, points out in its latest monthly bulletin, several of these excluded costs have been rising in recent months. While overall employment growth has been slow to appear in this recovery, the CBI's finding that a growing number of firms is experiencing skilled labour shortages is also worth worrying about, even if the proportion of affected firms remains below 10 per cent. Unskilled male unemployment at the beginning of the 1990s was some five and a half times the figure for skilled workers, compared to a ratio of three a decade earlier. Wage developments in the months and years ahead will be the central test of whether the UK economy is able to deliver a higher level of employment, while keeping prices stable. But average earnings figures tend to lag behind developments elsewhere. Mr Clarke does not have the luxury of waiting for the figures to look significantly more alarming. If he is serious about inflation, Conservative MPs hoping to escape the year without an interest rate rise are likely to be disappointed. They may not even reach their party conference unscathed. Sterling futures are discounting a significant rise in base rates by the autumn. 'Bleak September, mist and mud, is enough to chill the blood.'</p>

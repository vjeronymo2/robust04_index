			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW YORK;  </P> <P> YOUNG HELD TO FARE WELL AFTER ABORTION  </P> <P> Black urban teen-agers who have abortions fare better economically and are more  apt to stay in school than peers who become young mothers, a new study reports.  The study, published by the nonprofit Alan Guttmacher Institute in Manhattan,  researched 334 unmarried black teens aged 17 or younger from similar economic  backgrounds who visited two Baltimore health clinics for pregnancy tests in  1985 and 1986. Researchers found that 82% of the women who had abortions  graduated from high school or remained in school two years after the procedure  without having fallen behind, while only 63% of the women who gave birth  completed high school or were still in school two years later.  </P></p>

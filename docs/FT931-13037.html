			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / D-Mark rallies as Clinton plan to cut deficit hits dollar THE D-MARK rallied strongly against the dollar yesterday on speculation that the Bundesbank might not cut short-term interest rates as quickly as financial markets had expected. The weakness in the dollar was also the product of a growing belief that the US Federal Reserve might not raise short-term interest rates now that the Clinton administration has signalled a tough line on tackling the budget deficit. The D-Mark gained nearly 2 pfennigs against the dollar as dealers responded to reports that public sector wage talks between the German government and trade unions were deadlocked. A successful resolution of the talks had been seen by the Bundesbank as a necessary precursor to any decision to cut short-term German interest rates. The dollar fell in European trading to a low of DM1.569, before closing 1.75 pfennigs down on the day at DM1.5725. That is more than 7 pfennigs lower than its level three weeks ago. In New York the dollar closed at DM1.577, and in early trading in Tokyo it was at DM1.5767. The D-Mark was also underpinned by news that German inflation and money supply, both central to the Bundesbank's interest rate policy, were still not under control. The M3 measure of monetary growth expanded at an annual rate of 8.8 per cent during December, compared with the central bank's target maximum of 5.5 per cent. Meanwhile, the annual rate of inflation in North Rhine Westphalia, Germany's most heavily industrialised and most populous state, rose a full percentage point last month to 4.2 per cent - more than double the Bundesbank's ideal level. The revised expectations over German monetary policy helped to push French money market rates higher, as dealers feared that interest rate cuts in Europe might be delayed. Three-month French francs also firmed sharply to 12 1/4 per cent from about 11 3/4 per cent last Friday. The Bank of France has kept short-term money market rates high as part of its strategy of defending the franc in the European exchange rate mechanism. Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany warned yesterday that the EC would not allow currency speculators to wreck the ERM. The growth in German M3, a measure which includes cash, short-term deposits and fixed-term savings accounts, marked a further fall from October's peak of 10.3 per cent when figures were distorted by the previous month's interventions during the European exchange rate crisis. The Bundesbank pointed out that in absolute terms the German money stock had grown by DM142bn between the end of 1991 and the final quarter of 1992 - at double the rate recorded in the previous year. The RWI institute in Essen, meanwhile, forecast that industry would start to recover later this year, thanks to exports. Solidarity talks, Page 2 US Treasuries rise, Page 25 Currencies, Page 27</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Angolan peace talks in Lusaka are still  suspended, and the National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] delegation is in Huambo for consultations, but we  are seeing signs of optimism in Luanda. Aldomiro da Conceicao,  the Angolan presidency spokesman, admitted that the negotiations  may be over by 15 June. De Conceicao spoke to Valter Medeiros  on the telephone and also admitted that the peace agreement may  be signed by the Angolan prime minister and the UNITA leader:    [Begin recording] [De Conceicao] As far as know, the talks  are suspended because the UNITA delegation has not yet arrived  in Lusaka. However, we are still optimistic, hoping that all  will be resolved as soon as possible.    [Medeiros] Does that mean by the middle of June?    [De Conceicao] It is possible. As far as we are concerned,  the sooner the better.    [Medeiros] Will the agreement be signed in New York?    [De Conceicao] No, there is no set place, as far as I am  aware.    [Medeiros] Will the peace document be signed by Prime  Minister Marcolino Moco and Dr. Savimbi?    [De Conceicao] Not even that has been defined yet.    [Medeiros] But is there not a possibility it may be so?    [De Conceicao] There are several possibilities, including  this one. [end recording]    Peace in Angola may be a reality by the middle of June.</p>

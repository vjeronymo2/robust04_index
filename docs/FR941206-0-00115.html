			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to Section 623 of Communications Act, 47 U.S.C. 543, the Commission adopted a comprehensive framework governing the rates for BSTs and CPSTs. Under this framework, once initial rates are set pursuant either to the benchmark or cost-of-service approaches set forth in the rules, rates are governed by a price cap designed to assure that rates for regulated cable services remain reasonable. Under the cap, operators may adjust rates annually for inflation as measured by the gross national product price index (``GNP&hyph;PI'') and for certain categories of external costs. 47 CFR 76.922(b),(c),(d). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission's price cap rules were amended in March, 1994 to specify a ``going forward'' mechanism under which capped rates are adjusted for changes in the number of channels offered on BSTs and CPSTs. Fourth Report and Order 59 FR 17943, 17955&hyph;17956 (April 15, 1994). Under these provisions, operators first remove all external costs from the tier charge and then adjust the residual component of the tier charge by a specified per channel adjustment amount when the total number of regulated channels changes. The methodology for adjusting capped rates when channels are added or deleted from a regulated tier is set forth in detail in &sect;76.922(e) of the Commission's rules and in FCC Form 1210. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The March, 1994 rule amendments also permitted operators to include a mark-up of 7.5% on new programming expense related to programming added on or after May 15, 1994. Form 1210 allows the 7.5% mark-up on all programming cost increases occurring after March 31, 1994, no matter when the channel was first offered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parties filing petitions for reconsideration and many commenters filing in response to the Fifth Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ask the Commission to revise the existing going forward rules substantially. Many criticize the existing per channel adjustment on the grounds that it fails to provide sufficient incentives to add channels. Some cable operators, programmers, and networks state that the percentage-based approach to the programming mark-up results in disincentives for operators to add low or no-cost services to BSTs and CPSTs (noting that 7.5% of zero is zero). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most of the alternatives on going forward issues proposed by the industry involve a flat per channel charge. Two Commenters submitted economic studies to support a flat per channel adjustment of at least 25 to 30 cents. Some propose a flat-fee mark-up subject to an annual cap. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted, the Commission previously adopted a machanism by which cable operators may adjust rates when adding channels to BSTs and CPSTs. The Commission is supplementing its existing going forward rules by creating an alternative channel adjustment methodology. Cable operators adding channels to CPSTs under the new, supplemental rules may receive (1) a flat per channel mark-up, subject to a cap through December 31, 1997, and (2) recovery of programming costs, subject to a cap through December 31, 1996, and pursuant to the Commission's existing rules on permitted programming costs through December 31, 1997, modified to remove the 7.5% mark-up. In so doing, the Commission seeks to permit operators to provide new services on CPSTs, while assuring that rates for CPSTs are not unreasonable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operators may adjust rates for CPSTs pursuant to the new going forward rules beginning January 1, 1995, the effective date of the new rules, for channel changes, if any, made to these tiers on or after May 15, 1994, the effective date of the existing going forward rules. Operators adding channels to CPSTs on and after May 15, 1994, may use either the new rules or the existing rules for adjusting rates. Thus, the permitted charge for a CPST will consist of two elements. The first element is the permitted rate for channels offered on CPSTs on May 14, 1994, determined under current rules. The second element is the permitted rates for channels added to, or dropped from, CPSTs on or after May 15, 1994, determined under the new rules, or, if the operator so elects with respect to channel additions, the current rules as modified to remove the 7.5% mark-up on increases in programming costs under certain circumstances described below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operators must elect to apply either the new rules or the current rules the first time they adjust rates after December 31, 1994, to reflect a channel addition to a CPST that occurred on or after May 15, 1994, and must use the elected methodology for all rate adjustments through December 31, 1997. The Commission is allowing operators to choose to continue using the current rules because the current rules provide greater channel addition incentives than the new rules in certain limited circumstances and some operators may have relied on the current rules in deciding to add channels. While the Commission is requiring that operators use either the existing or the new going forward rules consistently for channel additions to CPSTs after December 31, 1994, an operator that chooses to use the new rules after that date may, but is not required to, adjust rates to reflect the new rules for channel additions made between May 15, 1994 and December 31, 1994. Rates for the BST will continue to be governed exclusively by the current rules, except that where a system offered only one tier on May 14, 1994, the cable operator will be allowed to use the revised rules for channel additions to the BST, as if the tier was a CPST. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

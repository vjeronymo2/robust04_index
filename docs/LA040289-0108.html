			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FARCICAL FOLLIES  </P> <P> With the world reeling from sociological disorder, San Diego's smiling  monsignor, Brent Eagen, takes time to play indulgent papa to a naughty  sportsman's farcical fleshly follies ("Going to Bat for Garvey," March 15).  What a marvelous example for us all!  </P> <P> Mr. Garvey indicates he is still planning a political career, and it seems the  right reverend monsignor might be asked not only to be on the stage by the  rostrum when the Garv makes his pitch to the voters, but also to lend a  paternal hand in obtaining the wanted annulment. Isn't it real nice to know  someone who has pull with Leo Maher's chancery so that the monsignor's Mission  parish can be the venue for wedding number two? Isn't it ennobling to see this  "aw shucks" attitude toward these tawdry shenanigans?  </P> <P> And the church wonders why the hemorrhaging of its members continues.  </P> <P> HARRY A. WADE  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

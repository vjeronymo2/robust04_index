			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with former Prime Minister General Michel 'Awn by </F> Shukri Nasrallah in Paris; date not given]    [Excerpts] [Nasrallah] Are you still opposed to the  pope's visit to Lebanon?    ['Awn] I have not said that I am against the visit. I just  expressed some political reservations about the visit because I  consider Lebanon to be an occupied territory. Therefore, the  sight of the pope shaking hands with the current regime's  officials would greatly shock the Lebanese at the national  level. [passage omitted]    [Nasrallah] What is your political peace plan for Lebanon?    ['Awn] My plan is well known. There should first be a  dialogue between me and those who are against me. I was the one  who started the march. I refuse to have my country marginalized  in the peace negotiations. Lebanon should be present as a major  party at the negotiating table. There should be tripartite  negotiations attended by Syria, Lebanon, and Israel.    I am willing to sign an agreement with any Lebanese Muslim  to  work together for the freedom and salvation of Lebanon. I am  confident that I can bring the Christians to the dialogue table,  and also the Muslims. I believe that I truly represent the  Muslims just as I truly and freely represent the Christians.    That is my offer. I hope that nobody would claim to  represent the Christians and Muslims more than I do. I have not  rejected anyone. All I call for is equal rights for all the  Lebanese in a dear, free, and independent Lebanon.    [Nasrallah] Tell us about the agreement reached between you  and the government under which you signed a document indicating  that you would not indulge in political acitivity in France.    ['Awn] Let whoever holds such a document produce it.    [Nasrallah] The government says that it has something to  that effect.    ['Awn] I have nothing at all to do with the Lebanese  Government. I neither negotiated with the Lebanese Government  nor promised it anything directly, indirectly, or through  mediators. I rejected that government and still do. So how  could I negotiate with a government I do not recognize?    I had been kidnapped. I was a hostage inside the French  Embassy. Even if their claim that I did sign something were  true, it would be invalid under the law because I was not  completely free to accept or sign anything. The situation is  now as follows: I do nothing that contravenes French law,  because I am a guest in France. I will do anything permissible  under French law, regardless of whether or not I signed anything  to the contrary.    [Nasrallah] I have heard you talk about funds seized by the  Lebanese Government. What are these funds?    ['Awn] There are funds in my name that did not come from the  government or from donations. These were funds in the bank  under my name and the names of my wife and daughters. The  government froze these funds unfairly.    Furthermore, I was an army commander. I served Lebanon for  35 years. The government has ignored my material rights  arbitrarily through a law that violated all laws.    Also, do not forget that I was prime minister and I have  material rights and am entitled to compensation as army  commander, and am also entitled to aides and a monthly salary  and compensations. The government has rejected all that.  [passage omitted]    [Nasrallah] Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri says that nobody  has claimed Gen. 'Awn's rights from him and that if that  happened he would look into it.    ['Awn] At any rate, my problem is not with them. I have not  recognized them and I still do not recognize them. Even if they  put me in the dock on any particular charge, I would not defend  myself before them. [passage omitted]    [Nasrallah] Permit me to go to the heart of the matter. You  tend to accuse Syria of everything. Is that right?    ['Awn] Let me be frank. Am I an enemy of the Syrian regime?  Have I betrayed it to Israel? Have I plotted against it? Have  I taken political regional or international stands against its  position or in a way detrimental to it? I only defended  Lebanon. I never opposed special relations between Syria and  Lebanon. I have said and I continue to say that I extend my  hand to the sincere hands in Syria so that we can be two  fraternal countries in the full sense of the word, with each one  free, independent, and its own master.

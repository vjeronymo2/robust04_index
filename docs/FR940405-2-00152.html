The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. DGOC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal will amend Section 1001 (Exercise Procedures) of DGOC's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Procedures <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to change the time by which a participant must tender to DGOC's clearing bank an option exercise notice. The cutoff time will be changed from 5:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. or such earlier time as may be announced by the Public Securities Association as the recommended closing time for trading in the government securities markets on the business day the participant wishes to exercise an option contract. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal also will amend DGOC's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Procedures <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 1002 (Assignment of Exercise Notices) which describes the manner in which exercise notices are assigned to participants. Currently when less than all exercisable options in a class of options ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , all puts and calls covering the same issue of Treasury Securities) are exercised, exercise notices are assigned randomly to participants that maintain short positions in that class of options. Under the proposal, exercise notices will be assigned to each participant maintaining a short position in the same class of options on a pro rata basis. The pro rata allocation will be determined by a formula whereby the total number of exercise notices received for a class of options will be multiplied by the ratio of the number of exercisable options in that class subject to exercise that a participant maintains to all exercisable options in the class. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

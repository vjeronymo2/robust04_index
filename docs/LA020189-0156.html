			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> STANFORD RECRUITS NO. 1 WHITFIELD  </P> <P> Stanford University has scored a recruiting coup by receiving a verbal  commitment from the nation's highest-rated high school offensive lineman,  according to reports published today.  </P> <P> Bob Whitfield, a 6-foot, 7-inch, 275-pound tackle from Banning High School in  Wilmington, notified Stanford of his decision on Tuesday, the San Francisco  Chronicle and San Francisco Examiner reported.  </P> <P> Stanford spokesman Bob Vazquez said today he could not comment on the reports  until national letter-of-intent day next Wednesday.  </P> <P> But Allen Wallace of SuperPrep magazine in Orange County, which rated Whitfield  No. 1 among offensive linemen, called it "the recruiting coup of the country."  </P> <P> "For Stanford to turn the corner, they had to get a player like this," Wallace  said.  </P> <P> The Cardinal finished 3-6-2 last season.  </P> <P> Whitfield reportedly chose Stanford over Michigan, Notre Dame, Alabama, Georgia  and Miami (Fla.) and was influenced strongly by the school's Jan. 3 hiring of  Dennis Green as head coach to replace Jack Elway.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Council on Belize [Consejo Nacional de  Belize], CNB, was formally constituted yesterday after President  Ramiro de Leon Carpio signed a decree creating this consultative  and advisory organization under the Foreign Ministry.    Foreign Minister Maritza Ruiz de Vielman will chair the CNB,  and its members are: Fernando Andrade Diaz-Duran, Roberto  Bermejo Gonzalez, Eduardo Castillo Carriola, Edwin Fernando  Guzman Ovalle, Alberto Herrarte Gonzalez, Roberto Herrera  Ibarguen, Carlos Larios Ochaita, Jorge Lujan Munoz, Oscar  Clemente Marroquin Godoy, Gabriel Orellana Rojas, Jorge Skinner  Klee, and Francisco Villaran Kramer. These 12 individuals will  be sworn in shortly.    The CNB was created by government Decree 259-94 that asserts  that the territorial difference with Belize and the search for a  solution that conforms to the Constitution's precepts is a  matter of national interest. The purpose is to modernize and  reorganize the CNB as a study, planning, consultative, and  advisory office of the Foreign Ministry for everything related  to the territorial disagreement with Belize.    According to the decree, the CNB will be authorized to  appoint permanent or temporary commissions or sub-commissions as  well as take the necessary measures to regulate their work. The  decree will take effect when it is published in the official  daily.</p>

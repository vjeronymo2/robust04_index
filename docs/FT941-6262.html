			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Nokia returns to profit as telecoms division surges Nokia, the Finnish tele-communications group, yesterday reported a surge back to profit as high growth in its mobile and fixed telephone divisions produced a pre-tax profit in 1993 of FM1.15bn (Dollars 209m), compared with a FM158m loss in 1992. It is increasing its dividend to FM2.80 a share from FM2. However, the group, the world's second largest supplier of mobile telephone terminals after Motorola of the US, announced it was withdrawing from manufacturing picture tubes in a bid to stem losses in its troubled consumer electronics business. It included a charge below the line of FM1.9bn mostly to cover the costs of the move, leaving a net loss of FM1.15bn, compared with a net loss of FM723m in 1992. Mr Jorma Ollila, chief executive, said consumer electronics losses, at FM747m in 1993, required 'very forceful actions'. Efforts to find a partner or buyer for the picture tube making had so far failed. The decision to shut down will mainly effect Nokia's Esslingen plant in Germany on which it spent FM200m last year in a modernisation drive. Nokia said it would continue to make televisions as these were important in developing interactive communications and multimedia products. But it would buy in picture tubes from outside suppliers. The problems in consumer electronics contrasted with Nokia's fast growth in telecommunications. Overall group sales were FM23.7bn, compared with FM18.12bn, while research and development costs rose to FM1.47bn from FM1.13bn. Operating profits jumped to FM1.46bn from FM288m. The vast majority of Nokia's activities are outside Finland and it said it was applying for a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, the first Finnish company to do so. Sales in the mobile telephone division surged by 73 per cent to FM6.3bn from FM3.6bn. Nokia said sales of digital cellular telephones took off in 1993 and were expected to continue to grow rapidly, but it said demand for the older technology analog systems remained strong. Operating profits for mobile telephones more than doubled to FM950m from FM437m. Sales in the fixed telecommunications division grew by 43 per cent to FM4.6bn from FM3.2bn, while operating profit more than doubled to FM983m from FM427m. The cables and machinery division reported slower sales growth, pushing up to FM4.9bn from FM4.6bn, but operating profits here again more than doubled to FM261m from FM114m. Nokia said it was confident it could sustain the rapid rate of sales growth for mobile telephony in 1994 as it exploited growing markets, especially in Germany, the US and Japan. Mr Ollila said this, combined with an improved performance in the slimmed-down consumer electronics division, provided a favourable outlook for 1994.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 23 May (EFE) -- The holding of a  runoff election in the Dominican Republic is possible if the  opposition Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) demands it,  Manuel Garcia Lizardo, president of the Central Electoral Board  (JCE), said today. Nevertheless, the official explained that  this proposal has not been presented to the JCE.    Last night, President Joaquin Balaguer's primary opposition  in the elections, PRD presidential candidate Jose Francisco Pena  Gomez, highlighted the need for "a runoff election" as the "most  honorable solution" to the Dominican Republic political crisis.  According to Pena Gomez, "in all of the world's democratic  nations, when the results of a general election are uncertain, a  runoff election is held."    Garcia Lizado, meanwhile, rejected a PRD request to match  the  electoral list with the list of voters delivered to each voting  table. Faced with the JCE president's refusal, PRD  representative Leonor Sanchez Baret responded that her party  would not participate in the revision of 9,528 vote tally sheets  if the JCE does not first verify the voters lists.    The PRD demanded the JCE revise the tally sheets and compare  the electoral tables' voters lists with the tribunal's list of  voters, given the alleged manipulation or "displacement"  [dislocamiento] of names and identification card numbers in  favor of Balaguer's ruling party, the Social Christian Reformist  Party.    In addition, Pena Gomez made accusations of discrepancies  between the data issued by the JCE in its bulletins and the  information contained on the computer disks given to the parties.    The PRD has been making accusations of fraud ever since the  16 May elections, claiming the "displacement" of voters lists,  from which allegedly more than 200,000 PRD supporters and their  allies of the so called "Santo Domingo Agreement" were excluded.    On Thursday, the JCE stopped the election vote count given  the PRD and the international observers' demands and pressures.    To conclude the vote count, 2.23 percent of the 9,528  electoral tables distributed in Dominican territory still have  to be counted. The JCE will also have to review more than 100  "challenged" and annulled votes before issuing the final results  of the general elections.</p>

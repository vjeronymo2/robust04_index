Accordingly, all safety glazing materials shall be legibly and permanently marked in letters and numerals, at least 0.070 inch (l.78mm) in height, with the words ``American National Standard'' or the characters AS, and, adjacent to those characters, the numeral that identifies the type of construction of the glazing materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sekurit's noncompliant glazings were mounted in front doors of buses manufactured by Karl K&auml;ssbohrer GmbH, a customer of Sekurit, and exported to the USA. These door glazings were erroneously marked AS3, instead of AS2. This type of glazing has a regular light transmittance over 70 percent, so that its identification as an AS3 item was irrelevant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total number (worldwide) of vehicles equipped with mismarked glazings was 6000. The percentage of vehicles in North America, i.e., where mismarking by USA standards is relevant, was 2.33 percent. That figure is based on 140 vehicles with a total of 280 mismarked glazings (140 left and 140 right side).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On March 2, 1992, Sekurit was notified by their customer, K&auml;ssbohrer, that the mismarking had been noticed by a Department of Transportation inspector in New Jersey at a vehicle approval registration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The mismarked glazing is a 17.O mm nominal thickness, class 1, multiple glazed unit consisting of one sheet of ``AS2'', M&hyph;320'' clear tempered float safety glass and one sheet of ``AS2, M&hyph;24100'' green tinted tempered float safety glass with an AirGap of 6.0&hyph;12.0 mm, SEKURIT SAINT-GOBAIN, ``DOT&hyph;27, AS3, M&hyph;4412.'' According to the petitioner, this glazing can be used anywhere in a motor vehicle except the windshield.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sekurit supported its petition for inconsequential noncompliance by stating that the item in question should be marked_and has been so since March 1993_AS2 and not AS3, as it complies with requirements of Test 1, ``Light Stability,'' and Test 2, ``Luminous Transmittance'' of ANS Z26.1&hyph;1983, as it shows values of light transmission over 70 percent. Double glazings of class 1 complying with these requirements may be mounted anywhere in a vehicle except windshields. Sekurit further stated that by mismarking AS2 glazings as AS3 they prejudiced the use of the mismarked glazings by indicating a restriction in permitted locations that was irrelevant. The DOT&hyph;27 M4412 complies in all ways except the mark ``AS3,'' with safety requirements requisite at locations such as front door windows of buses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several measures have been taken by Sekurit to remedy the error of mismarked glazings: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Applied for revision of ETL Report  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> 495331 of December 11, 1989 to have the correct test reference and marking included. Revised May 12, 1993;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ETL was asked as an official laboratory to perform another series of tests on samples of a recent production campaign, in order to check the continuous conformity of the product to AS2 requirements.

However, there are considerations that go beyond compliance with performance requirements. NHTSA recalls Docket IP80&hyph;3 in which Volkswagen omitted to mark certain windshields with the required AS1 designation. Two comments were received, both from States, who commented that the lack of marking would result in rejection under their inspection systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA observed that rejection puts the owner the burden of contacting Volkswagen, or of replacing the windshield before the State would again inspect the vehicle and authorize its continued operation on the roads. NHTSA found that ``[t]he noncompliance has a direct impact upon the vehicle safety inspection process, diverting public resources with no corresponding safety benefit.'' Accordingly, it denied the petition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although Sekurit's is a case of mismarked side windows rather than an unmarked windshield, the considerations are similar. Here, the noncompliance was discovered by a State inspector, so that the impact upon the inspection process is actual rather than theoretical. NHTSA consulted &Kuml;assbohrer of North America and found that it was willing to provide each of the bus owners with the noncompliant glazing with a letter noting the mismarking and averring as to its compliance otherwise with Standard No. 205. The letter, dated April 21, 1994, advises the recipient to keep it in the bus ``in case a DOT inspector notices the incorrect mark.'' This letter should minimize the effect of the noncompliance upon the State inspection process, and affords a basis upon which NHTSA may grant the petition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A further concern of NHTSA was whether, at the time of replacement, AS3 glazing might be installed instead of AS2. This possibility appears unlikely because local glass shops do not cut multiple glazed units of this type and only factory-made AS2 windows are used to fill replacement orders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons stated above, it is hereby found that the petitioner has met its burden of persuasion that the noncompliance herein described is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety, and its petition is granted.

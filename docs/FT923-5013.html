			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Cut power bill 'nuclear levy', regulator urges: Nuclear Electric attacks untimely interference PROFESSOR Stephen Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, yesterday added his voice to calls for a reduction in the 11 per cent 'nuclear levy' on electricity bills, provoking a clash with Nuclear Electric, the state-owned generator. He proposed a 'faster and more certain reduction' of the nuclear levy, imposed after privatisation of non-nuclear generators in 1990 to subsidise the higher costs of nuclear electricity. Prof Littlechild, director general of electricity supply, was addressing the Energy Intensive Users Group; one of the groups representing large electricity consumers which have repeatedly warned that the competitiveness of UK industry may be harmed unless prices are lowered. The call came only a day after PowerGen, the privatised generator, said it had been discussing a reduction in the levy with large energy users and the Department of Trade and Industry for several months. Rival generator National Power said yesterday it also supported this strategy. The DTI said Prof Littlechild was free to express his views, but reiterated that in discussions with large users on electricity prices it had made clear there could be 'no question of public subsidies'. Mr Robert Hawley, Nuclear Electric's chief executive, wrote to Prof Littlechild on Tuesday but failed to dissuade him from publishing his proposals. In a strongly worded protest, Mr Hawley called the move 'unjustifiable and untimely interference'. Prof Littlechild proposed changing regulations to allow the rate of the levy to be fixed in advance, enabling customers to plan more effectively. At present it is revised yearly on the basis of projected electricity demand to ensure it raises a set amount. He also suggested that the rate should steadily decrease, to give Nuclear Electric a 'sharper incentive to improve efficiency'. 'In a fully competitive market, customers would not have to pay the higher costs of nuclear electricity,' Prof Littlechild said. 'A reduction in the levy would, therefore, be a most practical and defensible way of responding to concerns from larger users.' Mr Hawley said the proposal was unacceptable as it did not recognise that any levy shortfall would have to be made up out of public expenditure. He added that Nuclear Electric had a sharp incentive to cut costs by its public commitment to making an operating profit before the levy by 1995. He called Prof Littlechild's statement on competition and the costs of nuclear electricity 'fanciful'. Mr Andrew Bainbridge, director of the Major Energy Users Council, said he would prefer any cut in electricity prices to be aimed specifically at industry. 'Although we sympathise with anyone who is trying to make ends meet in a recession, we do feel the large user needs special treatment at a time when industry is sinking fast,' he said.

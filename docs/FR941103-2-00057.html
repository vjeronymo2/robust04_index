			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c. Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By its own terms the 1983 Agreement between Reclamation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Western does not apply to State and private projects or developments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that the agreement reveals the parties' intent to use full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depletion levels in setting rates under the terms of the Agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Western disagrees that the intent of the 1983 Agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was for Western to use ``full'' (or ultimate) depletion levels in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> setting rates. Rather, a provision of the agreement that addresses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depletions only requires that water depletion schedules used for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> power repayment studies ``. . . be consistent with construction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedules for participating projects.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Western agrees that provisions of the 1983 Agreement between Western  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Reclamation did not explicitly address State and private projects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or developments. In defining a ``reasonable expectation standard,''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 1983 Agreement establishes necessary steps by Reclamation to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate the potential for construction of future Federal participating projects before the costs of these projects would be included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the ratesetting years. This reasonable expectation standard has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been applied to the future development of all water development  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects for ratesetting purposes by Western in setting the lowest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible rates consistent with sound business principles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, Western has included total depletions forecasted by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Upper Basin States for the use of Colorado River water for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projects, with deferral of less-certain water developments (depletions) beyond the ratesetting period in the proposed rate. Future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate adjustments will allow for movement of depletions into the rate-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> setting years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> d. Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Western arbitrarily suppressed depletions from 2010 through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2090 only justified by the fact that such a method of suppression  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (capping) was utilized in the 1990 study and did so without adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consultation with Reclamation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The decision by Western to defer uncertain depletions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beyond the ratesetting period is not arbitrary. In the 1990 rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process, Western gave considerable attention to the reasonableness of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the then-proposed depletion deferral and to the associated rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect when applied. Further, Western has given renewed and height-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ened attention to the treatment of depletions in the proposed rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through preparation of numerous issue papers, informal discussions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with both customer and water user representatives, and in Western's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> April 1994 rate brochure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Figure 1, on page 12&hyph;5 of the rate brochure, shows that Western  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presently assumes full development (full depletions) of all Upper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Basin water projects by FY 2090.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Projects with uncertain schedules have been placed in the PRS so that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they do not impact the rate at this time, in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Western's practice to set the lowest possible rate consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sound business principles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Western also disagrees with the claim that inadequate consultation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occurred with Reclamation in the past on this deferral treatment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reclamation, along with other interested parties, has either participated in or has attended many of the public forums scheduled in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of all Integrated Projects rate proposals. In these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public forums, Western has detailed the components of the rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment, including the treatment of depletions. Reclamation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interested parties have been and will continue to be afforded ample  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice and opportunity to comment on future rate proposals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e. Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Five comments said: DOE RA 6120.2 seems to require the use of operation studies based on historical streamflows including hydrologic data current to within 5 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Western believes that it is in compliance with DOE RA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6120.2. This requirement is valid for most projects. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceptions, as discussed in DOE RA 6120.2, Section 10.e.(4), are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided for those projects which are anticipated to have extensive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water development in the future. CRSP operation studies are based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> historic streamflows, which are then reduced by projected water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depletions supplied by the Upper Basin States and modified by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reclamation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> f. Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Western suggests that its departure from the 1990 depletion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedule represents better data than utilized by Reclamation in its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> energy and capacity studies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Both Reclamation and UCRC staff have told Western infor-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mally that the depletion schedule used in this process is a more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accurate reflection of the current situation than the earlier ``Energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Capacity Studies'' which was available when the ratesetting PRS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was prepared.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> g. Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 1990 cap at 2010 resulted in an approximate 11-percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction of Basin States' depletions and an artificially low power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate. The proposed super-imposition of a 1990 mentality beginning in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2010 to a substantially revised 1992 unofficial depletion schedule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results in excess of 20-percent reduction of depletions and does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> even fully recognize the future depletions of projects currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under construction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Western agrees that the deferral of some estimated deple-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tion effects until 2060 suggests a significant (20-percent) reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the 1992 depletion schedule contained in the CRSM demand data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Western believes there should be greater certainty of development  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding this 20-percent prior to including the associated reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in hydrogeneration in the PRS in a way that affects the firm power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates. Also, Western agrees that its deferral postpones future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depletions of projects currently under construction, based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principles of the 1983 agreement. Again, because the timing of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of the associated consumptive use is uncertain, Western  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chooses to not include future depletions within the ratesetting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years. As more current information is supplied by the UCRC to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reclamation, Western will apply the ``reasonable expectation'' standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to these updated depletions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> h. Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Western did not use the depletion schedule dated July 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which was received in draft form in April 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

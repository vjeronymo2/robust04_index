			<p>BFN     [Text] House of Representatives Speaker Brother Shaykh  'Abdallah al-Ahmar has reiterated that the approach the  political leadership, the government, and the legislative  council in the Republic of Yemen adopt to settle the current  crisis is that of the Yemeni people. This approach is embodied  in the fact that Yemeni unity is the fate and lot of the people,  and that this unity should not be harmed and is not subject to  bargaining. He said the state welcomes and does not reject  dialogue with any party, if this dialogue deals with Yemeni  unity, the establishment of this unity, and with legitimacy,  democracy, and political pluralism. Those who reject this are  infidels.    This came at a news conference by the brother House of  Representatives speaker today and attended by local, Arab, and  foreign correspondents in Sanaa.    House of Representatives Speaker brother Shaykh 'Abdallah  Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar emphasized that the Armed Forces, the forces  of unity and legitimacy are confronting the forces of apostasy  and secession, and that the Yemeni people from all walks of life  support their Armed Forces. He explained that the forces of  apostasy and secession have imposed war on our people, something  our people do not want. He said the secessionists cannot have  some of their illusions realized because Yemeni unity is a fact,  the fruit of the struggle of the Yemeni people, their response  to the Yemeni revolution's objectives, and the nucleus of  comprehensive Arab unity.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Pacific Rim scores five new highs as Nikkei declines WEAK industrial production figures discouraged investors, and share prices lost ground on profit-taking by financial institutions and index-linked selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average receded 73.30 to 20,953.30, its first decline in seven trading days. It saw a day's low of 20,837.48 in the early afternoon, and a high of 20,968.00 just before the close. Volume eased from 377m shares to 367m. Declines led rises by 575 to 422, with 176 issues unchanged, and the Topix index of all first section stocks shed 3.68 to 1,689.41. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 0.17 up at 1,294.92. Tuesday's industrial production data showed a fall of 0.3 per cent in July from the previous month, down for a record 22nd time in succession. Rumours that the Bank of Japan was unlikely to cut the official discount rate also dampened sentiment. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, yesterday laid out steps to deregulate Japanese industries, but investors do not expect the measures to have an immediate impact; they were also disappointed by the lack of concrete measures to boost the economy. Financial institutions placed sell orders around the 21,000 level. However, traders said foreign investors remained active buyers and that index-linked buying by investment trusts was also supporting share prices. Interest rate-sensitive banks were lower on profit-taking, Sumitomo Bank losing Y20 at Y2,450. Telecommunications-related stocks were among the gainers. Oki Electric moved ahead Y13 to Y569 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone advanced Y10,000 to Y970,000. Mr Hosokawa's list of measures included assistance to home buyers, encouraging purchases of housing shares. Shokusan Jutaku Sogo rose Y12 to Y725 and Misawa Homes gained Y20 at Y1,390. In Osaka, the OSE average eased 1.39 to 22,880.08 in volume of 50.2m shares. Machineries and textiles were lower but regional banks and housing-related issues firmed. Roundup FIVE equity markets in the region set new closing highs. MANILA hit a new peak following a jump in Philippine Long Distance Telephone (PLDT) on Wall Street. It rose Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 46 1/4 there, followed by a 70 pesos gain to 1,270 at home, inspiring the composite index to close 46.41, or 2.6 per cent, higher at 1,827.20. Volume soared to 12.47bn shares from 1.81bn because of a special block sale of Unioil Exploration. Turnover more than doubled, from 380.4m to 789.6m pesos. AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index set a new high, 14.9 ahead at 1,977.1, on a takeover bid and good results. Turnover more than doubled, from ADollars 268.6m to ADollars 642.2m. Gas producer Sagasco rose 21 cents, or 6 per cent, to ADollars 3.55 on the Boral takeover bid. Santos, which owns 20 per cent of Sagasco, added 12 cents at ADollars 4.07 and Boral moved forward 11 cents to ADollars 3.56. KUALA LUMPUR peaked again, the composite index rising 12.55 to 821.04 on strong institutional buying of blue chips. The market heavyweights, Telekom Malaysia, Tanjong, Genting and Tenaga Nasional, firmed between 20 and 50 cents each. Promet again led activity, with 81.7m shares traded, accounting for 15 per cent of the day's total volume. Rerated on its move into the oil and gas sector, Promet closed 28 cents up at MDollars 2.17 after touching a high of MDollars 2.34. SINGAPORE inched to a new closing high of 2,012.78, up 4.12, on selective buying. Brokers said activity was focused more on second-liners and Malaysian shares traded on the OTC. JAKARTA peaked again and, while Astra International stayed under pressure, the shares were unchanged at Rp17,000 as the JKSE index rose 5.52 to 422.83. SEOUL rose late in the day on unconfirmed rumours that the South Korean government would announce market-boosting measures, including an easing of the 10 per cent limit on foreign share ownership. The composite index rose 9.98 to 674.86. After hours, the government announced a tax-cutting budget for 1994. BANGKOK saw action in banks and property as the SET index advanced 15.73, or 1.6 per cent, to 978.91 in heavy turnover of Bt9.98bn. Bangkok Bank rose Bt4 to Bt133 on foreign domestic buying and was the most active stock, followed by Bangkok Land, Bt6 stronger at Bt109. HONG KONG's Hang Seng index fell 7.54 to 7,542.19 after some weakness in the banking sector, where HSBC lost 50 cents to HKDollars 83.50 after interim results late on Tuesday. In SHANGHAI, the Standard Chartered Securities B Share index rose 2.73, or 4.7 per cent, to 61.43, up 9.5 per cent in four straight gains, while Shenzhen B was down 0.38 at 61.15.</p>

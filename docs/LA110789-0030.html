			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFECTIVE MEDICAL DEVICES TARGETED;  </P> <P> HEALTH: EARLY DETECTION OF LIFE-THREATENING HAZARDS IN CRIB MONITORS AND OTHER  HARDWARE MAY BE FAILING. CONGRESS IS EXPLORING THE PROBLEM.  </P> <P> The attorney for a Texas couple who blame their son's crib death on a defective  respiratory monitor told a House subcommittee on Monday that the monitor's  manufacturer failed to inform federal authorities about at least 50 such  deaths.  </P> <P> The infant deaths were cited at a subcommittee hearing as evidence of the  failure of the Food and Drug Administration's "early warning" system to detect  potentially life-threatening problems with medical devices.  </P> <P> Manufacturers are required to inform the FDA when medical devices may have  contributed to a death or a serious injury or when a malfunction could prove  hazardous. But the company that manufactured the monitor in the Texas couple's  case initially notified the FDA of only one of 76 death and injury cases in its  files, said Cage Wavell, who represents Michael and Cory Davis, a Corpus  Christi couple.  </P> <P> "We were never told there could be any problems with the monitor," said Michael  Davis, 22, who testified in hushed tones about the March 17, 1987, death of his  infant son. "The only thing we were told was that we couldn't take our son home  without the monitor."  </P> <P> The monitor is used for infants susceptible to apnea, a sudden cessation of  breathing. Davis said that it failed to sound an alarm when his son, whose  lungs were not fully developed because he was born prematurely, stopped  breathing.  </P> <P> The inspector general's office of the Department of Health and Human Services  is conducting a criminal investigation of the company -- Aequitron -- to  determine whether it withheld required reports from the FDA.  </P> <P> Davis and his wife, Cory, provided the emotional focus of a packed hearing  before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and the  environment. They were preceded by Charles Bowsher, the comptroller general of  the General Accounting Office, who discussed two GAO reports that were highly  critical of the FDA's oversight of medical devices, ranging from thermometers  to kidney dialysis machines.  </P> <P> "It's very clear here," Bowsher said, "that . . . there's very little testing  going on, and when there are problems, they're not reported."  </P> <P> The GAO's analysis of 1,635 medical device recalls between 1983 and 1988  determined that manufacturers had filed required reports of deaths, injuries or  hazardous malfunctions in only 22% of the cases.  </P> <P> Bowsher said the GAO found that 33% of the medical device manufacturers said  they were unaware of the reporting requirement. Manufacturers maintain that the  reporting regulations are ambiguous and subject to differing interpretations by  even well-meaning companies.  </P> <P> Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), subcommittee chairman, used the Davises'  description of their experience with Aequitron to illustrate what he and other  critics maintain are the dramatic shortcomings of current regulation of the  fast-growing $14-billion industry.  </P> <P> Representatives of the FDA, Aequitron and the Health Industry Manufacturers  Assn. rebutted the GAO findings and witnesses' testimony as misleading or  inaccurate.  </P> <P> FDA spokeswoman Susan Cruzan said the agency encourages the medical device  industry to initiate recalls when problems are detected and, "when the agency  has information, it takes appropriate action promptly and aggressively."  </P> <P> She said that the FDA understood that Aequitron had investigated each death  associated with its monitors. In addition, she said the agency has begun its  own inquiry to determine whether "the company's conclusions were valid and to  ascertain whether some of the nonreported deaths should have been reported  under the law."  </P> <P> In general, she advised: "Parents should be aware that no apnea monitor is  foolproof."  </P> <P> A spokesman for Aequitron, the largest maker of infant monitors, said the  company had reported all required deaths or injuries to the FDA. The Plymouth,  Minn., firm was aware of 115 deaths of infants for whom the monitor had been  prescribed, including 24 in which the alarm allegedly failed, Chris Malacek  said. The company reported eight cases to the FDA, he said.  </P> <P> "Over the course of eight years about 150,000 infants have been monitored,"  Malacek said. During "all those monitoring cycles, it's never been established  that a defect or a malfunction in one of the monitors caused the death of a  patient."  </P> <P> Aequitron voluntarily recalled 5,000 of its Model 9200 monitors in June of 1987  after it determined that an alarm failed to sound at certain voltages. Malacek  said the device used on the Davises' son, a Model 8200, was subsequently tested  by Aequitron and "found to be fully functional."  </P> <P> The GAO found that 94% of new products that have come on the market in the past  13 years were not required to undergo rigorous tests to prove their safety and  effectiveness because of a widely used loophole in a 1976 law. The law stated  that manufacturers could avoid the testing process by declaring that the new  product was "substantially equivalent" to devices already available. Aequitron  has used this exemption for its infant monitors.  </P></p>

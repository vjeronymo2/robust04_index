			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia -- A result of the foreign debt agreement,  debt conversion will again be replaced by direct investments in  the country, which were suspended in 1987. This mechanism  allows foreign banks to immediately receive real cruzeiros to  invest in Brazil, instead of having to wait to receive payment  in foreign currency. The Central Bank believes that the country  will immediately obtain $210 million for the capitalization of  financial institutions or holdings, whether or not these  institutions have foreign capital.    According to the provision promulgated yesterday by the  Central Bank, creditors who in 1998 lent fresh money to Brazil  have two options: exchange the money which has not been used,  and is still deposited at the Central Bank, for new certificates  for the rescheduled debt; or invest in the capitalization of  companies in the country. The Central bank provision demands,  however, that these creditors have a balance in the PFA  (Parallel Financing Accord) [Acordo Paralelo de Financimaneto],  which was one of the four types of fresh money used in 1987.</p>

This withdrawal is a result of a comprehensive review of the use of the local anchorages in Boston Harbor, recent rules issued, written opinions received, and oral comments expressed at a public meeting held on December 15, 1993. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rulemaking is withdrawn on March 24, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> LCDR E.O.

The original goals of the proposed rule were: (1) To assure maximum availability of the limited deepwater anchorage area within Boston Harbor for use by deepdraft vessels; (2) to enhance safety and to reduce environmental risks associated with the carriage and transfer of oil products aboard the ships and barges that anchor in Boston Harbor. Several developments since the publication of the proposed rule have occurred which make it unnecessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Recent dredging in the Weymouth Fore River has alleviated some of the congestion at the President Roads Anchorage. The barges which have filled Anchorage No. 1 for the dredging portion of Boston's Third Harbor Tunnel construction, will be out of Anchorage No. 1 by the summer of 1994 and will free up space for other barge traffic currently utilizing the President Roads Anchorage. In addition, the Army Corps of Engineers plans to expand the President Roads Anchorage which will provide greater access for vessels. The Coast Guard, Army Corps of Engineers, Boston Pilots, Massport, and local shipping agents and companies, held a meeting on December 15, 1993. They agreed that better communication between entities using the President Roads Anchorage should solve any potential overcrowding problem at the anchorage. The Boston Pilots Association has agreed to act as an information clearinghouse for users of the President Roads Anchorage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recent regulations mandated by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) have forced operators to improve response capabilities and minimize the impact of oil spills. Vessel response plan (58 FR 7376), lightering (58 FR 48434), and on-board equipment requirements (58 FR 67996) have been published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  since the publication of this proposed rule. They have helped to reduce environmental risks associated with the carriage and transfer of oil products aboard the ships and barges that anchor in Boston Harbor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the main premise for anchorage regulations is that navigation safety is improved and commerce is facilitated. Excluding barges from this anchorage has the potential to restrict commerce (i.e., the tug and tow industry). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nine written comments were received by this office. Six of the nine comments strongly opposed the proposed rule due to their view that it unduly restricted barges from anchoring in the President Roads Anchorage. Two comments received requested the Coast Guard become the clearinghouse for information on anchorage activities. One comment received requested the Coast Guard provide language in the rule to allow for lightering/bunkering operations in Board Sound due to the overcrowding at the President Roads Anchorage. Two comments received requested increased regulation of watchstanding standards aboard vessels at anchorage. Other comments received requested minor clarification of the rule, but were not substantive in nature. All verbal comments expressed at the meeting held on December 15, 1993, reflect the text of this notice and the desire to withdraw the proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Captain of the Port carefully considered all written and verbal comments and concluded that safety concerns expressed in the notice of proposed rulemaking had been adequately addressed by the present and future operating conditions at the President Roads Anchorage and other Boston Harbor anchorages. In addition, the information clearinghouse sponsored by the Boston Pilots should minimize any overcrowding at the President Roads Anchorage. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons stated above, the notice of proposed rulemaking, CGD1&hyph;90&hyph;202, is withdrawn. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: March 7, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> G.W.

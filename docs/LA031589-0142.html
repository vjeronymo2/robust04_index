			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SWITZER TO WHEEL INTO HIS OFFICE  </P> <P> Oklahoma coach Barry Switzer was released from the hospital today and has  ordered a wheelchair with leg extenders to make getting around easier while he  recuperates from knee injuries. Switzer reinjured his left knee and hurt his  right knee in a skiing accident in Colorado last week. He had surgery on his  right knee Saturday. His secretary, Kay Haslam, said the coach told her he  would be at the office later in the day because he had a lot of work to do.  </P> <P> Kathy Switzer, the coach's daughter, said her skis became tangled with his as  the two got off a ski lift at Beaver Creek. "I kind of knocked him over," she  said. "He fell backward and his knees went forward." Spring practice begins in  a month and Switzer will direct the players from a golf cart.  </P></p>

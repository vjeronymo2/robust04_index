			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Stripped down and on the recovery road - Paul Cheeseright on the progress at Leyland Daf Vans since its MBO last year Leyland Daf Vans, which went into receivership a year ago and is now the largest UK-owned automotive manufacturer, will shortly announce 1993 profits which will reflect both the recovery in its corporate fortunes and a limited revival of the panel van market. The company, operating from its plant at Washwood Heath, Birmingham, has been profitable since the first day of the Pounds 40m management buy-out from the receivers in April 1993. Sales in the eight months since then have been about Pounds 80m. The turnover target for 1994 is Pounds 150m. 'We have achieved all of the commitments we gave to the institutions,' said Mr Allan Amey, chief executive. The main equity investor in the company is 3i, the venture capital group. Financing came from the Royal Bank of Scotland and United Dominions Trust. Last March, when the company was in receivership following the failure of Daf, its Dutch parent, its market share of the UK panel van market slipped to 6 per cent. Once production had resumed and the new company had sorted out its dealership arrangements, market share started to rise, averaging 13.3 per cent a month for April to December 1993. Last December Leyland Daf's market share was 19 per cent and the company calculates it is now running at about 16 per cent. Mr Amey said that last August the total size of its market was 5 per cent smaller than a year before, but since then it had been between 10 and 15 per cent larger. In the second half of 1993 smaller businesses and smaller local authorities, which had been delaying purchase decisions, came back into the market. Fleet purchases remained steady. 'I'm not saying the market is buoyant but we can see more activity in the last four months,' said Mr Amey. Yet, he added, and this is characteristic of the motor sector, 'margins have been very, very tight, because to a large degree we've been suffering from what's going on in Europe.' That is, declining markets are encouraging competitors like Mercedes Benz and Volkswagen to push into the UK market. However, this has not stopped expansion at Leyland Daf, which has just announced plans to raise production from 200 to 250 vans a week and to take on 50 people. During the receivership, the workforce fell by 800 to about 1,000. Rather, the response to the margins pressure has been, as elsewhere in the sector, to bear down on the cost base. 'The break-even point is at least 30 per cent lower than it was in the old organisation,' Mr Amey calculated. The new company has stripped away overheads associated with its old parent, consolidated all its activities at Washwood Heath and introduced zero-based budgeting. Although the new company's re-established position in the panel van market has defied the fears expressed at the time of the buy-out that the company would be too small to survive, there are problems it is being forced to deal with. First, its press shop, one of the largest in Europe, which contributes 12 per cent of total turnover and half of whose activities are supplying outside customers like Land Rover and Leyland Trucks, is only working at 60 per cent of capacity. It needs more customers. Second, the future of the company depends on the development of the 200 and 400 series of vans, its staple output. Some Pounds 8m of a Pounds 30m development plan has already been committed. Meanwhile, Leyland Daf is seeking to consolidate its market position by offering customer-specified variants of its basic models. Third, Mr Amey noted that the company must strengthen its relations with its key component suppliers. It is trying to halve the number of suppliers with whom it must deal to about 200. Leyland Daf needs the expertise of its systems suppliers in the development of new models, but it is not large enough to coerce co-operation. It will have to forge partnerships rather than force them as has happened in parts of the car industry. Finally, Leyland Daf needs to strengthen a dealer network which was thrown into confusion by the receivership and which in any case tends to handle the vans as one of a number of franchises. Leyland Daf wants the dealers both to sell the vans and market the company.</p>

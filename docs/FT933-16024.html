			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Japanese warrants A flurry of equity warrant bonds from Japanese companies this week will doubtless stir nostalgia among investment bankers. The real wonder, though, is that this particular item of late 1980s excess has not caused more of a hangover in the capital markets. Around Dollars 75bn of warrant and convertible bonds issued by Japanese companies in 1988-89 fall due for redemption this year. Since most of the warrants and conversion rights will expire worthless, cash to repay bondholders will have to be found elsewhere. Yet so far the task of refinancing has caused barely a ripple. Whether the rest of the year will be as smooth remains an open question. The ability of Japanese companies to repay bonds out of cash flow - by running down stocks going into recession, for example - must be limited. All the more so if they anticipate a recovery in their home market. The brunt of the burden may fall on the capital markets. But international fund managers happy to buy equity-linked paper when the Japanese stock market was in a trough - as they did in the early months of this year - may be less enthusiastic now share prices have rallied. The companies can always issue straight bonds or borrow from banks instead, but only at the cost of higher interest payments. Many are already struggling to make a decent return on marginal investments funded with what must have looked like virtually free equity. The real cost of the equity warrant binge will be seen, not in the Eurobond market, but in the results of the companies themselves.</p>

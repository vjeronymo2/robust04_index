			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ertugrul Kurkcu: "Peace: A Rational End to the </F> Southeast Conflict"]    [Text] The Ciller government has launched an austerity  program which is basically aimed at closing an immense public  deficit of $7 billion. Leaving aside the question of the  consistency of the austerity measures themselves, the unfeasible  and ambitious privatization plans, the lack of determination and  discipline in levying additional taxes on prosperous social  groups, not to mention a prospective deterioration in the  already disturbed social balances once the program itself is  fully implemented, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's set of economic  and financial measures, as a matter of fact, misses its basic  goal; namely, overcoming the public deficit.    A public deficit by definition basically arises from the  state's unproductive expenditures as every high school graduate  could simply guess.    Yet, even after having introduced a new set of austerity  measures, the government has obviously left the major source of  public expenditures--state expenses on security and defense  which approximately comprise one-third of the budget--intact.  Ciller, however, still calls on the nation to swallow this  "bitter pill," or she warns, the nation's fate will be at stake.  If the nation is really to swallow this "bitter pill," if the  government has really to close down or sell out State Economic  Enterprises, and lay off thousands of public employees on the  pretext that they are "economically unproductive," then why does  the government let the most unproductive allotment in the budget  grow in inverse proportions?    Who has decided that the nation through the state should  invest in guns but not in butter? And in economic and social  terms how feasible or profitable is it to invest in guns or, in  other terms, in war?    According to Ciller and her closet aides, Turkey in the last  decade has spent TL 800 trillion in order to support security  operations in the Southeast. She moreover plans to spend a  further TL 400 billion in the next 16 months.    Yet during the decade old conflict in the Southeast, the  "enemy," the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party) forces, have grown  from 250 in 1984 to 20,000 in 1994.    Except for the security mechanism, which has swollen to huge  dimensions, the state has been deprived of all its public  functions in the state of emergency region. Meanwhile  clandestine, fundamentalist organizations such as Hezbollah have  been allowed to speak through secular mechanisms.    Local people have fallen victim to frequent instances of  torture and mistreatment.    The economy, in turn, has come to a halt, the free  circulation of goods, money and people between the country's  West and the Southeast provinces has almost stopped. The  countryside has been devastated, forests set on fire,  agricultural areas destroyed and livestock and farming nearly  abandoned.    People from the countryside have had to group themselves in  and around the region's bigger cities or immigrated to Western  cities such as Mersin, Adana, Istanbul, and Ankara, turning  these metropolitan centers into ungovernable, big villages. And  the immense human sacrifice included at least 10,000 people,  more than 2,000 of whom were civilians, and resulted in growing  ethnic and religious tension among the citizens of various  origins both in the region and in the West. The overall result:  A decade's balance sheet, after enormous spending on war and in  spite of all material and human sacrifice, has now produced a  country which is failing when judged by two major international  criteria. It has an incredibly bad human rights record and an  ever falling economic credibility.    After having given her one year to pursue the so-called  path to a "military solution" to the Kurdish question, the  Western allies now question some of Ciller's policies. Bonn  suspends military aid at least temporarily; Washington hedges  about additional economic aid to Turkey; and the British  Parliament hosts a major PKK official in order to hear his  version of the Kurdish problem. Just at that fatal point "the  enemy," the rebel PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, offers Turkey  another chance for a lasting peace, one year after the abortive  call for a cease-fire in March 1993.    "Just recognize our Kurdish identity and render  constitutional guarantees to our claims for self-government. We  are ready to concede any solution within Turkey's present  boundaries," Ocalan says. "No territorial claims, no  separatism."    Yet, it seems that the government and the Army are  determined  to pursue their path to "military solutions," with the naive  belief that the PKK is already isolated from the "people" and  will inevitably yield to the immense military pressure already  in progress.    The outcome of the ongoing military crackdown on the PKK  forces, which extends from the east bank of the Euphrates to  deep in northern Iraq, and which, the military claims, will  continue until the PKK is "finally eradicated" from the region,  will eventually show the Turkish public if the "military  solution" to the Kurdish question is, or was, any solution at  all.    Turkey's citizens of both Kurdish and Turkish origins have  already paid an immense price both in material and human terms  for the war or to repeat the chief of staff's terminology for  the "low intensity warfare" in the Southeast. Now at the height  of the flagrant clashes in northern Iraq, it is high time to  develop concrete and conceivable plans for peace.    There is no reason to believe that Kurds would submit their  "national identity" as a result of military force, the appeal to  which has cost the citizen of this country a whole decade,  thousands of lives and billions of dollars.    The reverse contains more truth; the unreasonable appeal to  force by successive Turkish governments has awakened the Kurds  to their "national identity" on such a scale that even the  present moderate overtones displayed by the PKK might be viewed  as rather "fainthearted" by thousands of Kurdish victims of the  conflict. No one should fool himself or herself into thinking  that Ocalan's latest offer for peace results from an  organizational and political weaknesses or from a deteriorating  position in the region.    On the contrary, there is every proof that Ocalan's  influence  in his own organization is at its peak and the PKK's influence  among Kurds in other parts of the region--in Syria, Iran, Iraq  and Armenia--is on the increase.    Yet, Ocalan seeks peace just when he has reached maximum  control over his sphere of influence, for he seems to be a wise  enough leader to understand that he is historically incapable of  inflicting a final defeat on the Turkish Army; yet he is equally  confident that his forces cannot be finally defeated by the  Turkish Army. Thus, arises an offer for peace, before a  decade's military stalemate makes the country a huge junkyard  and a massive cemetery, a country in which he believes Kurds are  fated to live together with Turks.    Now, after having spoiled the nation's fortunes and  resources  for decades on guns in order to deny the identities of its  Kurdish brethren, Turkey has to decide. Is not peace more  profitable than the war? Is not investing on production more  feasible that spending on the military? Is not recognizing  Kurds as constituents of a democratic Turkey more progressive  and more humane that recognizing them as our "enemies?"</p>

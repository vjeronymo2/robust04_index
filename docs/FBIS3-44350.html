The repairing, which took less than four months, was  undertaken by the Henan branch of the China International Water  and Electric Corporation (CWE) with a loan of 2.13 million U.S.  dollars provided by the Japanese Government for the restoration.    A grand ceremony for recommissioning of the power stations  was held here this afternoon.    Expressing his thanks at the ceremony for the help extended  by China and Japan, Nepali Congress Supremo Ganesh Man Singh  [spelling of name, title as received] said that "it's really  unbelievable that the project should be finished in such a short  period with excellent quality."    Water Resources State Minister Laxman Prasad Ghimire said  that "the success of the restoration is mainly due to good  management by CWE and the Japanese side."    The Kulekhani Hydropower Project was forced to close down  after the penstock pipe of the no. 1 station and water supply  equipments of no. 2 station were damaged by heavy floods caused  by incessant monsoon rains in July this year.    The Kulekhani project's two stations provide 100 megawatts  of  the country's total annual capacity of power supply of 280  megawatts. So its recommissioning would help reduce the  load-shedding practised in Kathmandu Valley.</p>

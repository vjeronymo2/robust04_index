Gulan: "Sell Your Land To Pay the Taxes"] </F>   [Excerpts] By the Serbian Government's Decree on Taxation  of Property, Agriculture, Forestry, and Independent Businesses,  the farmers across the entire country, and there are more than 2  million of them, who are the only ones to produce anything in  these times, have again been brought to a hopeless situation.  Taxes have been levied on them that they cannot pay. Not to  mention how they are going to carry out the spring sowing of  about 2.5 million hectares when the state has not ensured a  single liter of oil. At these times, the most difficult  situation is with households consisting of old people who  possess land, but earn no income from it.    The following example shows best what troubles farmers are  experiencing when, instead on investing money into sowing and  new production, they have to fill the state coffers. Last year,  a farmer with about eight acres (five hectares) of land got  three tons of wheat or two tons of sunflower seed per acre,  which is considered to be good for a dry year. Income from four  acres of wheat, when one deducts the costs of seed and  harvesting, totalled 500 German marks [DM]. The income earned  from sunflowers, when the costs of seed and harvesting are  deducted, was charged in kind, more than 600 liters of edible  oil. Some of that edible oil was immediately exchanged for oil,  and DM200 were immediately given for wheat seed. Added to this  are the cost of wheat harvest (DM80 to DM100 per acre), plowing  DM100, cultivation DM10 to DM15 per acre.... Along with all  this, the household must pay the utilities charges, not to speak  of what happens if a machine breaks down, or a pig-pen needs  repair, Dragisa Maric, a farmer from Kac told BORBA. [passage  omitted]    About 2 billion new dinars are needed for spring sowing this  year. For the first time in half a century, primary issue  cannot be used, and banks say that they have no money for loans.  Moreover, the state, which is asking farmers to give money, has  not made it possible for them to buy diesel fuel (not a single  liter has been allocated for agriculture for several months),  and the question is whether artificial fertilizers are going to  be ensured and how is it going to be done (750,000 tons are  needed by the middle of the year). Therefore, the state is  addressing farmers again and asking for money from them.</p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: New issues The government's decision to sell its remaining stakes in the two English power generators dominated the new issue market this week. Developments have also been announced at a couple of placings: Games Workshop, a hobby games manufacturing concern, and Filtronic, a telecommunication components supplier. Ashbourne Holdings, a nursing homes business, said it would be getting a quote and allocations were announced for the ED&amp;F Man offer (see page 8, main paper.) The government is aiming to use the Pounds 4bn sale of its remaining 40 per cent stakes in National Power and PowerGen next February to widen share ownership further. Private investors will be offered two-fifths of the available shares at discount prices and the proportion will rise if demand requires it. To qualify for the discounts investors must apply through the 'share shops' of banks, building societies, stockbrokers and other financial intermediaries, rather than through forms in newspaper advertisements. The government expects to begin marketing the sale in January which will be the first opportunity for people to register. Payments will be in three instalments, each in a different tax year. The prices will be determined following bids from institutional investors in two separate, open-priced international tenders. The international offer will include a retail tender to enable individuals to bid for shares in either or both companies on similar terms to institutions. Small investors in the UK will be able to buy only a package of shares in both companies, with a pre-determined ratio, possibly three National Power to two PowerGen. Discounts to the public will be reflected in a lower first instalment. Existing shareholders will need to register with share shops to be eligible for incentives and preferences in allocation over other applicants. Shares in Games Workshop have been priced at 115p, which will give the games' manufacturer a market capitalisation of Pounds 36m. Around Pounds 12m is being raised through the float, which is being undertaken through a placing sponsored by Samuel Montagu. Filtronic, which supplies micro-components to the mobile telecommunications industry, is also coming to the market via a Pounds 25m placing. The prospectus is due to be issued on October 18, with dealing commencing around a week later. Ashbourne Holdings, one of Britain's largest nursing home businesses, has announced plans for a stock market flotation valuing the company at up to Pounds 90m.</p>

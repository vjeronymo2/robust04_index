			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Business and the Law: Pan Am seeks to recover money from India - Legal briefs Pan American World Airways, in the process of Chapter 11 liquidation in the US, has launched an action against the Indian government to recover Dollars 3.7m for creditors. The money was frozen in an Indian branch of Citibank after the airline carried an Indian passenger out of the country who owed millions in back taxes. According to the American National Law Journal, the Indian government blocked the money after Pan Am flew Dr Jayanti Dharma Teja to New York in 1977. Dr Teja owed Pounds 4.5m in taxes and was prohibited from leaving India. Pan Am accepts that the Indian government warned it that Dr Teja was grounded, but says it was given insufficient information to trace him. He was seen off at the airport by Indian officials, including the son of the then prime minister, and had all the necessary documentation. The action is the culmination of more than 10 years of efforts by the US administration and the airline to get the money released.</p>

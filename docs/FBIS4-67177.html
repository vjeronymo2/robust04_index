			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Angel Paez, from the "Investigative Unit"] </F>   [Text] A report issued by the Interior Ministry General  Intelligence Directorate (Digimin) last February states that the  arrest and imprisonment of Demetrio Limonier Chavez Penaherrera,  aka "Vaticano" has not curtailed drug trafficking activities.    The document states that the creation of new drug stocking  and dispatch centers, and the transference of drug "firms" to  new areas is due to the repressive action of the security forces.    The report states that Colombian Waldo Simeon Vargas Arias,  aka "El Ministro," and the Cachique Rivera brothers from Huanuco  have occupied the void left by "Vaticano" by increasing their  operations.    "Vaticano's" organizations have not been totally dismantled  because they are now controlled by his brother Elias Chavez  Penaherrera, aka "Cristo."    The Digimin report states: "Even though `Vaticano' was  sentenced to life imprisonment, trafficking increased in Peru  demonstrating that the organizations and `firms' involved in  this illegal activity can modify their procedures and change  their areas of action to avoid being detected." The report was  distributed to the Armed Forces Joint Command, the National  Intelligence Service, the Navy, Army, and Air Force Intelligence  Directorates, and other agencies.    The main areas to where the traffickers have moved to avoid  enforcement actions and to resume their businesses are the  Tambopata Basin in Madre de Dios, on the border with Brazil, and  in the northeastern jungle, specifically in Loreto and Ucayali.    According to the Digimin document, the "firms" that are  massively installed in Tambopata Basin use Cusco peasants "to  transport coca from the Amparaes and Lares valleys (Calca  Province), Huaros (Quispicanchis Provinces), and Quillabamba (La  Convencion Province), on a `small scale' basis, by land (road  and rail) to Juliaca (Puno)."    The same "firms" which have turned Boca Manu into one of its  operations center also collect coca from the higher zones of  Puno. These leaves "are allegedly processed in maceration pits  in riverside areas in these provinces and in inaccessible zones  of Juliaca, where basic and washed coca paste as well as cocaine  hydrochloride are allegedly being manufactured. This drug is  then transported by land and sold for consumption in Cusco,  Arequipa, Moquegua, Tacna, Ica, and Lima as well as in Argentina  and Chile."    The presence of trafficking gangs in the Tambopata Basin,  Loreto, and other places that will be mentioned later is due to  the combined action of the Army, National Police, and the DEA in  Upper Huallaga.    Experts warned that the implementation of antinarcotics  policies based on repression would scatter the "firms" but not  destroy them.    Interior Ministry analysts also acknowledge this, admitting  that the mafias in Madre de Dios mostly come from the Upper  Huallaga and Ucayali, especially from Aguaytia and particularly  from Tambopata River Basin "given its geographical location and  scarce" police and military "control."    The same point of view is expressed in the conclusions of  the  document which states: "The pressure exerted by the forces of  order has caused trafficking activity to (...) move further  away."    Madre de Dios is now "the main stocking center of basic and  washed coca paste produced in northeastern Peru, as are Cusco  and Puno, from where it is then transported abroad (to Brazil  and Colombia)."    The "firms" have also moved to the Maranon River Basin from  the Upper Mayo Valley in San Martin Department, from where they  send drugs to Chiclayo, Trujillo, Piura, and Tumbes through  Chiclayo, Olmos, Jaen, Bagua, Rioja, and Moyobamba.    The report states that "coca paste production was observed  to  have increased gradually there as well as greater stocking in  Nueva Cajamarca (Rioja and Moyobamba). This increase is  reflected both in the domestic market (small scale trade) and  abroad (transported to Ecuador)."    The trade, transportation, and manufacturing of drugs has  increased in these areas, particularly in Celendin, Cajamarca,  and Luya, Amazon Department, "where Colombian and other foreign  small planes are observed in the airport of Luya which is  allegedly the export shipment center."    The organization left by "Vaticano," which is now controlled  by his brother Elias Chavez Penaherrera, aka "Cristo," is  allegedly protected by the Shining Path in the Huallaga River  Basin.    The document adds that the "firms" have increased their  operational levels in Ucayali, especially in Ayatala and Padre  Abad Provinces and in the towns of Tamaya and Pachitea where  basic and washed coca paste are manufactured to then transfer it  to Pichis Palcazu from where it allegedly is transported to  Brazil.    Recent antinarcotic operations in Pichis Palcazu forced the  "firms" out toward Zona Balta, Puerto Esperanza, and San  Bernardo, in Puros Province, Ucayali.    Just two weeks ago, LA REPUBLICA published a report on  activities in the Pichis Palcazu valley. We discovered that the  area had been turned into a new operations center by traffickers  who previously operated in Upper Huallaga.    Regarding the Apurimac-Ene Basin, the document says: "Coca  producing peasants in the Ene and Perene River valleys, in  Satipo Province, Junin, and Pichis Palcazu-Oxampampa Province,  in Pasco; as well as peasants from the Apurimac River valleys in  Huanta and La Mar Provinces, Ayacucho, and Conception Province,  in Cusco, have increased their plantations. In these zones  traffickers have involved coca producers in their illegal trade.  Peasants now build maceration pits near rivers and are  manufacturing basic and washed coca paste."    The drug that is produced here, with that sent from  Huallaga,  is traded in Palmapampa in the Apurimac valley. This is the  "main collection center. From here drugs for domestic  consumption are distributed by land to the capital and other  important cities (Huancayo, Pisco, Ica, Arequipa, Cusco) and  shipped toward the Colombian and Brazilian borders by air."    Clandestine strips for shipping drugs have been fully  identified in Luisiana, Palmapampa, Palestina, Puerto Mayo,  Valle Esmeralda, and Iscozazin.    Digimin analysts said there are Army and Air Force bases  near  the clandestine strips of Luisiana and Palmapampa but the other  strips are not controlled at all.    Trafficking activities have increased in the so-called  central axis--comprising roads leading to Lima and the main  coastal, central, and southern cities--particularly in Ica.    One of the projections being handled by Digimin is that  "trafficking organizations will try to counter their recent  setbacks by creating new centers of collection and shipping,  thus spreading the police coverage and reducing their  efficiency."    Another option being analyzed by experts is that  "trafficking  organizations, due to the quality of the coca in Huallaga, will  continue to evade police controls by transporting the drug by  land or by river to areas outside the control of the forces of  order and close to airstrips that have been abandoned or are not  controlled. Here the drug can be manufactured and shipped  abroad."    The document does not specify the amount of drugs  transported  by the "firms," the number of drug flights, or the number of  military or police personnel who cooperate with traffickers.    The report says, however, that interdiction has increased  sharply. During February the police seized 186 kg of cocaine,  3,713 kg of washed coca paste, and 8 kg of cocaine and arrested  245 individuals in 119 operations, most of them in the Maranon  basin.    The antinarcotic forces are now seeking to capture and  disable the organizations headed by Waldo Vargas Arias and the  Cachique Rivera brothers.    "(Vaticano's) capture has left a gap which his main  competitors, `El Ministro' and the Cachique Rivera brothers, are  seeking to exploit," the report states.    Both "firms" work for the powerful Cali cartel, which is  responsible for 80 percent of the drugs entering the United  States.    The police have hit the Cachique Rivera group the hardest:  Five houses in Lima were raided, four laboratories were  destroyed, and 15 accomplices were arrested. Just one month ago  Antinarcotics Directorate officials captured Margarita Cachique  Rivera--the "firm's" contact with foreign buyers in Lima and who  guaranteed the supply of precursors to elaboration centers in  the jungle.    "El Ministro" once again escaped from a combined police,  Army, and DEA operation in Lagunas, Loreto Department, during  March: He has an airstrip in the area.</p>

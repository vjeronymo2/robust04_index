			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Samir Knayaz: "450 Private Companies Left </F> Dangling"]    [Text] To gain access to new lines of credit for financing  imports, companies must show they are financially sound...    This is one of the most important conditions contained in  the  10 import-financing measures that went into effect upon the  dissolution of the Ad Hoc Committee. But it turns out that at  least 450 private enterprises, despite the fact they are  investing in so-called priority sectors or import substitution,  will not be able to benefit from these finance modalities. As  things stand now, they find themselves seriously indebted due to  foreign exchange losses occasioned by the devaluation of the  dinar.    Exchange losses result from fluctuations in the value of the  national currency against hard currencies. In the case of  Algeria, the problem for private enterprises first arose in  1991, when the government of Mr. Mouloud Hamrouche devalued the  dinar, and no concrete solution has yet been found. The results  have been catastrophic for private-sector enterprises, since  they have been obliged to pay back three, four, even five times  the amount of loans extended to them. The situation has been  such that a number of companies filed bankruptcy. Public-sector  enterprises, though hit equally hard by the problem, were given  more support.    Several tens of billions of dinars were injected into them  to  make up for their losses, while nothing was done to cushion the  shock for those in the private sector.    This dichotomy--which national authorities deny but that is  nonetheless a reality--has aroused the wrath of private  investors.    With the installation of Mr. Ghozali as head of government  to  replace Mr. Hamrouche, private entrepreneurs began to hope for a  final resolution of the question. Mr. Ghozali had promised to  deal with the issue by instituting the famous tripartite  commission (government-National Union of Algerian  Workers-employers). But things dragged on, and the problem was  left hanging.    Mr. Belaid Abdesselam, Ghozali's successor, made a similar  promise on 6 February 1993 in a meeting with employer  representatives.    But while exchange losses of statal enterprises were  completely resorbed as part of public-sector financial reform,  the estimated 3 billion dinars in losses sustained by the  private enterprises was ignored. In late 1993 another head of  government, Mr. Redha Malek, proposed a "solution" that in fact  would have served only to aggravate matters and bury private  enterprises deeper in debt: a rescheduling of debt service over  a 7-year period with interest set at 11.5 percent.    This solution was never implemented, though, since the  companies concerned rejected it. So four governments have come  and gone while the exchange rate problem remains. Why? The CAP  [Algerian Employers Confederation] monitoring committee, which  was instituted recently to find a solution to the problem and  met yesterday at the Hotel Aurassi, says quite simply: "There is  a calculated campaign to destroy the private manufacturing  sector. It would take only a single decision to save it, as was  the case with our Tunisian and Moroccan neighbors, but it seems  no one wants to do so. Paralyzing the private sector means  paralyzing the country's progress toward economic opening,  something that some decisionmakers do not want." The committee,  which represents about 450 enterprises employing 20,000-25,000  workers, is calling once again on authorities to come up with a  formula that would permit all economic operators to integrate  exchange risk into their production and investment decisions.    In that context, the committee is asking for an  unconditional  payoff of the exchange losses, with the resulting obligations to  be rescheduled through primary banks at concessional interest  rates.    Will their appeal will heard this time? Will the issue at  last be resolved? At this point, it is up to the government of  Mr. Sifi to answer such questions, for the future of several  hundred enterprises and several thousand employees is at stake.  Another issue up for decision is whether to end once and for all  the public-private-sector dichotomy that has become an integral  part of our economic system.</p>

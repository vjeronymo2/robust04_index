			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Heads roll in Paris over help for Habash THE president of the French Red Cross and three top government officials resigned senior positions yesterday after the admission of radical Palestinian leader George Habash to a Paris hospital for treatment for a stroke, Reuter reports. Mr Habash, whose Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine pioneered aircraft hijacking, was flown to Paris by the Red Cross. Ms Georgina Dufoix, the Red Cross president, offered her resignation as adviser to President Francois Mitterrand, who accepted it. It was not clear whether she would continue to head the Red Cross. Mr Roland Dumas, foreign minister, demanded and obtained the resignations of his director of cabinet, Mr Bernard Kessedjian, and his secretary-general, Mr Francois Scheer. The office of Prime Minister Edith Cresson said the director of cabinet at the Interior Ministry, Mr Christian Vigouroux, had also offered his resignation. Mr Habash's admission to France from Tunisia on Wednesday provoked angry condemnation from Israel and French opposition leaders. Israel's foreign minister, Mr David Levy, called it a 'slap in the face' for his country. 'It does France no honour.' Mr Francois Leotard, a senior figure in France's centre-right opposition, said: 'This is one of the world's leading terrorists. . . . I want to know how this happened.' Earlier, Mr Mitterrand had said Mr Habash's stay should be 'extremely brief', and that a French judge investigating terrorism related to the Middle East would have access to any information he needed. Mr Scheer and Mr Kessedjian were the two top civil servants in the Foreign Ministry. The former, responsible for administration, has had wide experience in Middle Eastern affairs. He recently negotiated a long-standing financial dispute between France and Iran. Mr Kessedjian, the ministry's top political officer, was chief adviser to Mr Dumas on all aspects of foreign policy.</p>

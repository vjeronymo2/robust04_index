			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Expanded Frost jumps to Pounds 5.75m FROST GROUP, the independent petrol retailer that floated free of the Norfolk House receivership in 1991, yesterday reported a 78 per cent increase in earnings per share after a year in which it dramatically increased the number of new sites. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 5.75m on sales up 50 per cent at Pounds 124m. Reported earnings per share before the February 1993 scrip issue rose from 13.4p to 23.8p. The group added 57 new sites during the year, bringing the total to 143. Mr James Frost, chairman, said low gearing would allow the group to continue to make acquisitions. '1994 should either bring more sites at reasonable prices or a recovery in margins as new sites become more mature, or both,' he said. He warned, however, that recession was not yet over and that margins would remain under pressure. He anticipated that the forecourt shop would in future replace the 'familiar corner shop'. The group would therefore place more emphasis on its shop facilities. The final dividend is 2.2p, making a total of 4.03p after adjusting for the scrip, compared with 0.667p for the two months of the previous year that the group was quoted. After the scrip, earnings rose from 4.4p to 7.9p.</p>

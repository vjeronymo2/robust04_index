			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Car sales freedom recommended: Monopolies report may result in cheaper cars by extending choice for dealers CARS could be made cheaper in the UK by giving dealers more freedom to choose which makes of car to sell and how to sell them, according to a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report to be published today. But the long-awaited, 1,000-page report is likely to disappoint consumer groups in giving only partial support to their persistent claims that car prices overall in the UK are excessively high compared with the main EC markets. While accepting that private motorists are confused by UK pricing structures, the report concludes that neither manufacturers nor their distributors are guilty of price fixing or systematic profiteering. It also concludes that the existing system of selling cars through exclusively franchised dealers does not necessarily work to consumers' disadvantage. It was to investigate these twin issues that the MMC report was first commissioned two years ago. It is understood largely to accept the arguments of the industry that the franchised dealer system, with its dedicated service and repair facilities and other after-sales support, is a beneficial way of dealing with complex products with major safety implications. In this respect the report is likely to be regarded as a partial 'whitewash' by consumer groups critical of the retail motor trade's performance. The report concentrates on freeing up areas of competition within the industry's existing structure. If adopted they should help substantially to increase marketplace competition. The five key recommendations are understood to be: Removal of restrictions on dealers advertising outside their manufacturer-designated sales territories; Ending of manufacturer-imposed restrictions on the number of outlets selling their models that any one retailing group may own. Ford, the UK market leader, limits it to eight, for example. The issue is important because some manufacturers have become concerned at the bargaining power which can be exerted by the large public groups which are increasingly involving themselves in the motor trade; An end to manufacturer restrictions on dealer groups owning rival franchises within their designated sales territories, although the MMC does not go so far as to say that multi-franchising should be allowed on a single site; An end to restrictions on dealers setting up parts sales or fast-fit operations within the franchised territories; The forced removal of unit sales ceilings that some manufacturers impose on individual dealers. The industry's initial reactions to the report appeared to be that, while it had not been given a wholly clean bill of health, the MMC's decision not to recommend abolition of exclusive franchises or other fundamental changes had exonerated the industry from the worst charges made against it. While the detailed conclusions on price levels will not be known until later today, they are expected to show a varied picture, in which private motorists fare relatively badly compared with the fleet and other business purchasers who account for more than half of the total UK new car sales.

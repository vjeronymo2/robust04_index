			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC gives comfort to traditional banana suppliers - Caribbean reactions to a decision to keep the fruit out of the Gatt negotiations TRADITIONAL suppliers of bananas to the European Community, who fear a loss of the trade when the single European market is created in eight months, were comforted by last week's European Commission decision against the inclusion of the fruit in the Gatt negotiations. The commission's proposal to apply quotas to banana imports from other sources, mainly the Latin American countries, rather than imposing tariffs on these imports, is regarded by the traditional suppliers in the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of countries as necessary for the survival of their industries on which many small economies are dependent. But the commission's position has apparently driven home to ACP producers, which have higher production costs, the message that ultimate survival on the European market means that they will have to increase productivity and efficiency, and that it is not the wisest of courses to continue depending heavily on bananas as a source of foreign earnings. 'We are pleased that they have decided not to use tariffication in dealing with this very important matter,' said Mr Marshall Hall, chairman of Jamaica's Banana Export Company. 'Tariffication would have exposed us to the wealth of the multinational fruit companies, which can afford to lose some money over several months in order to gain a market advantage.' The ACP producers, who supply one fifth of the bananas consumed in the EC, had been worried by the proposals made in the text of the current Gatt negotiations that current trading conditions for current export volumes be maintained for all sources until 1999. Anything above this would be subject to tariffication, with tariffs being reduced progressively by an average of 36 per cent between 1993 and 1999. Against this proposal, the EC had to set its own undertaking to the ACP states that they would not be placed 'in a less favourable situation than in the past or at present'. The commission, in arriving at a compromise, proposed quotas on fruit from non-ACP sources. The quota can move upwards depending on the growth of consumption in the EC, reducing prices to consumers. But no figures have been set. All this depends on the granting of a waiver by Gatt. Opposition is expected from the Latin American producers and the US multinationals that operate in those countries, and who, for a long time, have been casting envious glances at the European market. Regardless of the outcome of impending negotiations, Dame Eugenia Charles, prime minister of Dominica (one of the Windward Islands) whose economy is 60 per cent dependent on banana exports, has drawn some clear conclusions. Caribbean bananas cost about 30 per cent more to produce than Latin American fruit. There would be one clear and easy winner in open competition. 'We now have to ensure that we improve the quality of our bananas and that we increase the level of productivity by raising yield per acre so the farmer gets more,' she said. 'We also have to ensure that diversification takes place because we must never again rely entirely on bananas. The commission's decision gives us some time and some breathing space for us to put the rest of our house in order. But it is not going to be easy.' Latin American producers are hardly likely to be happy at the latest developments. The Union of Banana Exporting Countries (UPEB), which is made up of eight Latin American producers, has been seeking unrestricted EC access for their cheaper fruit. A recent letter sent by UPEB members (Colombia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Dominican Republic and Panama) to Mr Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission, questioned the need for continued protection for ACP fruit. The Latin producers told Mr Delors that it was unacceptable and unusual to exclude bananas and other tropical agricultural products from the globalisation of markets being considered by the Gatt. UPEB said continuing restrictions would halt the growth in the Latin countries' banana exports to the EC. ACP producers have launched a diplomatic offensive in Washington to counter opposition from the US fruit industry to the EC position. Caribbean officials, producers and traders say they expect a 'sympathetic' hearing, while there is some optimism that the derogation under the Gatt will be granted  - if the US does not ask too high a price of the EC in return. 'The question for the ACP producers now concerns the manner of the administration of the quotas,' said Mr Hall. 'How will the quotas allow for growth? For how long will they be in place? The next step is for ACP producers to prepare their quota suggestions. I expect the European Commission to receive a deluge of quota proposals.'</p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Fashion: It's Paris chic to wear your seams inside out this season - Alice Rawsthorn is excited by a young designer who hangs out in a derelict hospital ONE OF the chicest places to shop in Paris is the disused radiology department of Hopital Ephemere, a derelict hospital on the edge of Montmartre cemetery and now an artists' squat under threat of closure from the French authorities. Here Xuly-Bet designs and sells his clothes. Xuly-Bet, 30, is one of the recyclage designers now making waves on the Paris fashion scene. These designers, led by Martin Margiela, the young Belgian, use recycled fabrics and cheap materials to make avant garde clothes, often with unfinished edges and seams on the outside rather than the inside, that are popular with the young Paris fashion crowd. Xuly-Bet is typical of the recycleurs. He was born in Mali but studied architecture in Paris and switched to fashion four years ago. His clothes are made of tights and underwear fabrics. He makes them himself on an old Singer sewing machine and sells them at weekends when he opens the radiology department as a shop. Things might have been different a few years ago when a talented young designer could have expected to be courted by everyone from LVMH, the French luxury goods groups, to GFT, the Italian textile giant. But that was back in the 1980s when the fashion market was buoyant and designers were feted as superstars. All that has changed. Now today's designers are struggling to find new directions in the moribund market of the 1990s. The fashion market expanded in the 1980s, when the middle-aged customers of the establishment designers had more to spend. These designers also gained a fertile market in Japan, thanks to the appetite of the nouveau riche for western luxuries. The dominant stylistic theme for the established fashion houses was reinterpreting traditional designs, as Karl Lagerfeld did at Chanel with his 1980s versions of Coco Chanel's 1920s suits. This fused perfectly with the post-modernist ideas then influential in art and architecture and satisfied the Japanese craving for western 'authenticity'. At the same time the designers gained a new, young market as the progeny of the pre-Pill baby boom moved into their 20s. These young consumers had been influenced by the 'glam' image of rock groups such as Roxy Music that dominated pop culture during their adolescence. 'Glam' was a rebellion against the scruffy hippy styles of the early 1970s. It fostered a generation of young consumers who wanted to dress smartly and a cadre of young, innovative designers emerged - Jean-Paul Gaultier in Paris and Dolce &amp; Gabanna in Milan - to service them. But those days are over. Recession has struck and designers are in the doldrums. Some companies have collapsed. The rest have been left to struggle. Recession is not the only issue. The designers must also grapple with changes in their market, for fashion has fallen victim to demographics. There are fewer 20-year-olds around because of the falling birth rate. The recession has left them with less money and the shift in pop culture to the 'rave' cult - a backlash against 1980s materialism that has heralded a return to the casual dress styles of the early 1970s - means they are less inclined to spend it on expensive clothes. Even the older customers have changed. The Gulf war, environmental crises and the chaos in eastern Europe have fostered a new sensibility. As this month's US Vogue magazine concedes: 'In these politically correct times, Dollars 10,000 seems a ludicrous price to pay' for a suit. The designers have found it difficult to adapt. For the past few seasons the fashion collections have had the feel of designers plumbing new depths of sensationalism in an attempt to disguise the emptiness of their ideas and to attract the paparazzi. The assortment of super-models, pensioners and drag queens that totter along the catwalks are all part of the spectacle. Karl Lagerfeld is still a superb stylist - refining the hippy de luxe look into sellable suits for Chanel and Chloe. But he seems to take a perverse delight in exposing his own role as a publicist for the global luxury goods groups. A big bottle of Chanel No5 towered over the last Chanel show. Lagerfeld was later asked by French television whether he saw himself as a designer or a stylist - a question which might have reduced his peers to tears. Lagerfield just laughed. Christian Lacroix, unlike Lagerfeld, is still idealistic enough to believe that fashion can move forward from the disposable materialism of the 1980s, by using traditional aesthetics and craftsmanship to create beautiful, enduring clothes. The same theme is apparent in the cottage couture of Koji Tatsuno and Romeo Gigli, both of whom produce limited editions of hand-made pieces alongside their main collections. Tatsuno's exquisite silk jackets and Gigli's embroidered velvets cost thousands of pounds, but last for years. Lacroix, Tatsuno and Gigli are trying to redefine the de luxe look that was so lucrative for designers in the 1980s into something better suited to their 'politically correct' consumers in the 1990s. The recycleurs, who dominate what remains of the young market, favour the direct approach of rebelling against 1980s excess. It remains to be seen whether Martin Margiela and the other recycleurs will be more than a transient phenomenon. Recyclage is riddled with contradictions. Everything about Margiela's clothes, from the seams on the outside to his blank white labels, is a statement against materialism. But his labels are as coveted among the Paris avant garde as are Chanel's trademark Cs by the nouveau riche. His clothes are expensive, Pounds 350 for a jacket or Pounds 500 for a coat, and they sell in the same shops - Jones in London, Charivari in New York - as those of the established designers he is rebelling against. The biggest threat to the recycleurs is the fashion establishment. The luxury goods groups that gobbled up the established fashion houses in the 1980s have raised the financial stakes in the industry, as Jean Colonna, another recycleur, discovered when his business went bust this spring. It will be much more difficult for Margiela to achieve the same status in the 1990s as Gaultier in the 1980s - or even for Xuly-Bet to check out of Hopital Ephemere.</p>

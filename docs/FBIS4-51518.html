			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Finance Hirohisa Fujii by </F> unidentified NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN correspondent; place and date  not given; from the "Interview With Hata Cabinet Members in  Charge of Economic Matters" series; second of two interviews  comprising first part of series; "Improvements Being Made in  Substantiating the Consumption Tax"]    [Text] [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the  current economic situation?    [Fujii] We are in a very delicate stage. Economic  indicators in some areas are good; in other areas, they are not  so good. We need to make the economy grow for we are at an  important stage.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] It is said that deliberations on the  fiscal 1994 budget will be delayed.    [Fujii] It should not have a negative impact on people's  everyday life. I will ask the Diet to start budget  deliberations as soon as possible. I know we have a system  which is supplementary to a tentative budget. However, it is  too early for us to talk about it now.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The minority ruling government needs  the cooperation of both the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and  the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to achieve tax  reform.    [Fujii] A considerable number of people are beginning to  understand that we have no choice but to reduce the income tax  and substantiate the consumption tax in order to prepare for an  aging society. We are beginning to share common views with the  SDPJ. We have no choice but to seek the understanding of the  people and the parties.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you no think that a compromise,  such as changing the consumption tax to welfare tax, is needed  for the coalition to achieve the other parties' understanding?    [Fujii] Many people protested against an earmarked tax  [mokuteki zei] when the consumption tax was introduced. Many  are still against it. We may use the revenue from this tax  mainly for welfare services, but I do not know about an  earmarked tax.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you not think administrative  reform is needed to increase taxes?    [Fujii] We have been seriously trying to achieve  administrative reform. The ruling parties are still meeting on  it. I hope they will come up with concrete ideas and not  abstract plans.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How about foreign exchange markets?    [Fujii] The fundamental of foreign exchange is to reflect  the fundamentals [as published]. This was confirmed at a  meeting of the finance ministers and central bank presidents  from the group of seven (G-7) industrial nations.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Is the appreciation of the yen  natural because the trade surplus is a fundamental?    [Fujii] I do not think so. The trade surplus is merely one  item. I am sure the interest rate level, economic trends, and  unemployment rates are also fundamentals.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How are you going to tackle the  Japan-U.S. framework talks?    [Fujii] It is important for us to get the economic recovery  back on track by promoting the current economic management plans  in order to settle the issue. It is also important for  international society to seek economic harmony. We have been  trying to ease regulations regarding insurance and financial  services. In addition, we also need to ease other regulations  as well to act in harmony with international society.</p>

			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTERIORS: HOW TO CLEAR SPACE IN CROWDED GARAGE;  </P> <P> SPACE USE: CABINETS, SHELVES, HOOKS NEEDED TO PROVIDE THE MAXIMUM CAPACITY,  KEEP OBJECTS AS CLEAN AS POSSIBLE.  </P> <P> If you're eyeing your garage to use for storage and/or work space, there are  several ways to find the space you need within your available space.  </P> <P> Before you start installing shelves, cabinets and work tables, make a list of  exactly what you'll be storing. Bear in mind as you make the list that the  garage was never meant to house unused furniture and personal belongings that  won't hold up under the elements.  </P> <P> Some things are correctly stored in the garage (such as gardening equipment,  hardware, tools, paint, and some sports equipment), but other things should  never be put in the garage at all. Even in the cleanest garage, dirt, dust,  dampness, bugs and rodents can be prevalent.  </P> <P> If you are already storing things such as clothes, books, papers, and unused  furniture in the garage and you want extra space to store even more things, you  should first go through what you already have stored in the garage. Chances are  that a good portion of it will be ruined, and you'll have to throw much of it  away (particularly if the items have been in the garage for some time). You may  decide too, that much of what is stored in the garage is no longer used or  needed, and can therefore be given away.  </P> <P> If you are committed to storing personal things in the garage, pack everything  in clean boxes and label the boxes on all sides. If you must keep papers in the  garage, they are best stored either in Transfile boxes (available at office  supply stores) or in a sturdy filing cabinet (you can probably pick up a  second-hand cabinet for this).  </P> <P> You'll want to store everything off the floor on shelves or in cabinets.  Inexpensive metal shelving is available at building supply and variety stores.  These shelves can be assembled and placed along the walls of the garage for  instant organized storage space.  </P> <P> When you shop for the metal shelves, also look for some strong hooks that can  be attached to the wall or ceiling beams of the garage. These can be used to  hang anything that has a loop or open space that could conceivably be draped  over a hook.  </P> <P> For example, you can hang your lawn furniture, some long garden tools, large  extension cords and garden hose on these hooks. You can even hang your bicycle  on hooks (available at bicycle shops).  </P> <P> To establish an immediate work area, a trip to a discount office furniture  store can net you a very sturdy 4- to 6-foot table for less than $50. These  tables provide work space for gardening, hobby or fix-it projects, and can be  collapsed to store flat or to be moved as needed.  </P> <P> Tools and supplies can be stored in an old dresser or cabinet, or from a  Pegboard and hook system attached to the wall over the table. The Pegboard and  hooks can be purchased at hardware or building supply stores.  </P> <P> Another way to store tools is to buy tool organizers made by Rubbermaid. These  tool organizers snap onto a tool center Wall Strip (also made by Rubbermaid) or  can be mounted on Pegboard with adapters or brackets, or directly onto a wall  with screws.  </P> <P> These tool organizers include a screwdriver rack, wrench rack, hooks that can  hold a variety of tools and accessories, parts bins for nails, nuts, bolts and  small parts, clip hooks that hold notes or instructions, and a tool rack  designed to hold wrenches, putty knives, pencils, punches, shears, pliers and  other small tools.  </P> <P> Rubbermaid also makes recycling containers for used automotive batteries, as  well as heavy-duty weather resistant storage containers with lids that fit  tightly to keep moisture out. These containers come in 3-, 10-, 14- and  18-gallon sizes and can hold everything from small tools to larger tools such  as a skill saw or a piece of bulky gardening equipment.  </P> <P> For a sleek, clean look, you may want to have closed cabinetry installed in  your garage. These modular cabinets come in a range of colors, styles and  materials, and usually feature interior shelves that are adjustable, some  drawer space and a countertop that provides work space with an area above it  for a Pegboard and hook system for tools.  </P> <P> While these cabinets help keep things cleaner because they are behind closed  doors, you'll need to take the door clearance factor into consideration before  you have them installed. Make sure that even with your car in the garage, you  will have enough room to open the cabinet doors so that you access to the  contents without moving the car.  </P> <P> Firms specializing in closet systems often also install these garage cabinet  systems to maximize the organization and storage capacity in the garage.  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND FIRMS THAT INSTALL GARAGE SYSTEMS  </P> <P> Some firms in the Southland that install garage systems:  </P> <P> The Closet Store (213) 837-0417  </P> <P> California Closet Co.

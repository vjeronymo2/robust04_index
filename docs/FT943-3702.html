			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Labour conference set for row over Irish unity Labour is heading for a row at its annual conference this month over the future of its 13-year-old commitment to campaign for Irish unity by consent. The row threatens the future of Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Northern Ireland secretary, whose attachment to Irish nationalism is regarded as out of date by party leaders. The unity-by-consent policy - adopted in 1981 after a split over the Troops Out movement - has been under severe strain since the IRA announced an open-ended ceasefire last month. Mr Tony Blair, the party leader, believes that Labour's commitment to persuade Ulster unionists to agree to a united Ireland is outdated and could damage the prospects for a permanent peace. Mr Blair is believed to favour a move towards neutrality, which would allow Labour to support Northern Ireland's right to remain in the UK for as long as a majority of the population wished to. However, Labour's conference agenda contains only hardline nationalist resolutions, most of which reject any solution which would not guarantee a united Ireland. Such a resolution would be embarrassing to Mr Blair, who is said to be determined to remove control of Irish policy from the party's nationalist wing. As a result, the leadership is likely to back one of several less nationalist proposals being circulated by more moderate party pressure groups, which could be tabled as emergency resolutions in Blackpool. One potential compromise has been put forward by Independent Labour Publications, a pressure group, which calls for a full policy review by the ruling national executive committee. The resolution calls on the NEC to report to the 1995 conference, giving Mr Blair room to manoeuvre in response to developments in the UK-Irish peace process. A growing number of Labour MPs believe that Mr Mc-Namara could not credibly present a more neutral policy because of his longstanding commitment to Irish unity. Mr McNamara is also deeply unpopular with unionist MPs who were angered by proposals for joint UK-Irish sovereignty over Northern Ireland put forward by his office last year. Mr Blair has recently sought closer relations with the Ulster Unionist party, and has had some success in persuading it that Labour intends to modernise its Irish policy. Mr McNamara has had little to say about the ceasefire, and there have been repeated rumours in Labour circles that he has been told to refrain from commenting by the leadership. Tribune, the leftwing weekly, reported in its latest issue that Mr McNamara was barred from giving an interview to the BBC by Labour party headquarters. Mr Blair would have little difficulty in removing Mr McNamara from the shadow cabinet because he is a co-opted member rather than an elected one. However, no changes are likely until after the annual shadow cabinet elections in November.</p>

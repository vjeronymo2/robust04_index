			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Tie Rack increases fivefold to Pounds 5.1m TIE RACK, the retailer whose neckwear designs range from discreet paisley patterns to Mickey Mouse, recorded a fivefold increase in profits in the financial year to January 31. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 5.1m, up from Pounds 1m in the previous year when there was an exceptional charge of Pounds 504,000, and the group doubled its dividend to 1p. Earnings per share rose from 1.99p to 6.1p. The record results marked Tie Rack's recovery from its dark days in 1989 and 1990 when some commentators predicted it would share the fate of many 'niche retailers' who failed as the 1980s consumer boom fizzled out. Tie Rack had come to the stock market in 1987 at a price of 145p. The shares hit a low of 15p in November 1990, and closed yesterday at 126p, up 10p. Mr Roy Bishko, chairman, said the group had learnt from mistakes, such as the uncontrolled expansion into the US, and predicted a year of 'solid progress'. Mr Nigel McGinley, chief executive, said 'it's a marathon, not a sprint'. He said the profit rise reflected tighter cost control, a rise in sales volumes, and closing unprofitable shops and opening new ones. Group sales rose 23 per cent to Pounds 67m, and operating profits by 155 per cent to Pounds 4.5m. Mr Bishko said the group's policy was to run shops itself, rather than to franchise them, except in particular circumstances. Less than 20 per cent of the 272 shops are now franchised compared with more than 50 per cent three years ago. UK profits were Pounds 4.2m, up 46.4 per cent, and continental Europe and the Irish Republic made Pounds 1.5m, up 43.3 per cent. Losses in the US fell from Pounds 856,000 to Pounds 53,000, after the restructuring provided for the 1991-92 accounts, although losses in Canada rose from Pounds 1,000 to Pounds 84,000. Australian profits rose from Pounds 88,000 to Pounds 396,000. Associated profits from the joint venture in France, were up from Pounds 316,000 to Pounds 333,000 in spite of a weakening of the French economy. Net cash of Pounds 7.4m at the year-end led to interest receivable of Pounds 292,000, a swing from interest payable of Pounds 539,000. Mr McGinley said that capital expenditure this financial year would double to Pounds 3m.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] An Arab youth was shot and killed during a riot in  Nabulus at noon following a demonstration demanding the release  of all Palestinian prisoners. Our correspondent Moti Amir  reports that there were similar demonstrations in other towns in  the territories, and in Gaza and Jericho in the autonomy.    In Gaza, thousands today attended the funeral of Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement] activist Nasir Faluha, who was  murdered yesterday. The Palestinian police safeguarded the  funeral procession. During the funeral ceremony there were  calls to kill Faluha's murderer. Our correspondent Nisim Qeynan  notes that the Palestinian police detained a suspect,  'Abd-al-Salam 'Alwan, a brother of a collaborator murdered  several months ago by Hamas' 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam military arm.</p>

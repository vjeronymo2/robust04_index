			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Tietmeyer scorns UK recipe for 'recovery' European governments should not try to buy their way out of recession with interest rate reductions and devaluations, the Bundesbank president warned yesterday. Increased internal competitiveness was the surest way to establish a stable community economy, Mr Hans Tietmeyer told bankers in Bonn last night. 'Sanctioning cost increases with subsequent devaluations has regularly been shown to be an unsuitable recipe,' he said. Such policies - as applied in Britain and often cited in the Anglo-Saxon press as 'successful' - were hardly models for other countries. In the first place it had to be remembered that the UK's economic recovery was already under way before Britain suspended its membership of the European monetary system, he added. 'It should also be noted that any competitive advantage gained from devaluation is lost when all countries use this method.' Companies could enjoy cost advantages only as long as wages were kept under control and domestic inflation was not driven upwards by the higher import prices resulting from devaluation, he warned. Rejecting charges from German industry that the Bundesbank's strict monetary policies had damaged competitiveness by effectively revaluing the D-Mark, Mr Tietmeyer refused flatly to contemplate any devaluation strategy at the Bundesbank. He blamed companies' pay and government's fiscal policies for driving up domestic prices and costs, and in the process unbalancing the Bundesbank's monetary policy and contributing to the nominal revaluation of the D-Mark. In an apparent attempt to dampen speculation that German interest rates were due for another cut to promote economic growth, Mr Tietmeyer warned against 'false expectations' and said the bank had to be increasingly cautious when considering further reductions. Policy would continue to be guided primarily by monetary developments. 'This does not mean that interest rate levels and the D-Mark's external value play no role at all. . . . but they are without doubt only of secondary importance to money supply,' he said. Repeating his recent calls for monetary discipline in individual member states, Mr Tietmeyer said public discussions on when a return to narrow bands within the European exchange rate mechanism might be possible were far from helpful. It was more important to concentrate on economic convergence and restoring the EMS's lost credibility.</p>

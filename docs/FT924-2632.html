			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Concern over Lonrho share deal SHARES in Lonrho, the international trading group, yesterday fell 4p to 75p as investors indicated they would not be taking up shares in its rights issue because of uncertainty surrounding the deal with the German financier Mr Dieter Bock. Shareholders also voiced concern about the group's rise in net debt to Pounds 947m and the fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 205m to Pounds 79m, for the year ended September 30. Two of Lonrho's institutional shareholders said financial information given to Mr Bock should be made available to all shareholders. Morgan Grenfell, which is advising Mr Bock, sought and obtained 'pieces of information' from Lonrho which are not in the public domain. This was to enable Mr Bock to make a decision about whether to invest in Lonrho. Mr Bock made it clear that he was then given a choice 'to take or leave' half of the 15 per cent stake owned by Mr Tiny Rowland, Lonrho's chief executive, at 115p each - compared with 85p a share in the rights issue. Mr Bock said he thought he bought Mr Rowland's shares 'at a resonable price'. However, one of Lonrho's institutional shareholders said: 'We would like to know what information was given to Mr Bock for him to decide that 115p a share is a reasonable price to pay'. Mr Bock is to underwrite half the 200m shares in the 3-for-10 rights issue at 85p a share, take up the rights of Mr Rowland and buy his existing shares. Mr Bock will end up with a maximum 19 per cent stake in Lonrho if no shareholders take up the rights issue. This will rise to 25 per cent when he buys the other half of Mr Rowland's 15 per cent stake in three year's time. Meanwhile, Gencor, South Africa's second-biggest mining house, yesterday said it was still interested in buying Lonrho's Western Platinum mine in spite of the international trading group's deal with Mr Bock. Although Gencor and Lonrho had been in merger talks, Mr Brian Gilbertson, Gencor's chairman, said he did not believe a takeover of Lonrho was the 'natural route' for Gencor.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Extreme Fervor for Reinvasion" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 28 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  comments on the growing danger of Japanese militarism.    The news analyst says:    The Japanese reactionaries dispatch more and more soldiers  of  the "Self-Defence Forces" [SDF] overseas for military exercises.  They unhesitatingly utter such words as denying the criminal  nature of the past war of aggression and inciting militarism.  They undisguisedly work to fascistize the domestic system and  legitimate overseas military action.    Through the enactment of an "emergency law" and revision of  the "law on the SDF" they try to legitimate the overseas  dispatch and military action of the "SDF" and mobilize the  manpower and material resources of Japan lock, stock and barrel  for military reinvasion.    Facts show the Japanese militarists, taking advantage of the  failure of the policy of strength of superpowers, are going to  revive the old empire and repeat the history of aggression.    The reinvasion fervour of the revived militarist ghosts has  reached the extremity.    The Japanese reactionaries' talk about "threat" and "crisis  in security" is an excuse for justifying their militarist acts  for aggression. Under this pretext, they are inciting the  consciousness of crisis and war at home and building public  opinion to malrevise the "peaceful Constitution" and the "law on  the SDF" and enact a wartime law.    The danger of revived militarism of Japan today is  incomparably greater than it was.    Their acts for military reinvasion, however, lead to the  same  doom of Japanese imperialism that ran riot in aggression on Asia  in the past.    They must learn a lesson from the past defeat and act with  discretion.</p>

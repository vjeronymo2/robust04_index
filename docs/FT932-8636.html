			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / IG Metall head in row over purchase of shares MR Franz Steinkuhler, the most prominent and powerful trade union leader in Germany, yesterday admitted spending almost DM1m (Pounds 400,000) in a speculative purchase of shares in a Daimler-Benz holding company. At the same time he rejected accusations that, as a member of the Daimler supervisory board, he was guilty of insider trading. Mr Steinkuhler heads IG Metall, the giant engineering workers' union, which is currently involved in controversial strike action in eastern Germany to gain rapid wage equalisation with the west. He is said to be determined not to resign. A union official admitted, however, that 'some people will be astonished' at the revelations. 'There will always be social envy,' he said. Mr Steinkuhler denied that he had any prior knowledge of a move to dissolve the holding company, Mercedes Holding, which left him with a windfall profit of DM64,000 on the shares he had bought. He summoned an extraordinary press conference at his union headquarters in Frankfurt yesterday to counter the charge of insider trading, and quoted Mr Edzard Reuter, the chief executive of Daimler, in his defence. 'I cannot prove what I did not know at the time,' Mr Steinkuhler said. Insider dealing is not legally barred in Germany, although bankers and company officials are bound by a 'gentlemen's agreement' not to use inside information. The government has promised to introduce legislation to control the practice next year. Mr Steinkuhler said he bought the shares with cash he had available to pay a future income tax demand, for some DM976,000, shortly before they rose almost 20 per cent in value. Union officials admitted yesterday that Stern, the weekly news magazine, appeared to have precise and accurate details of share transactions carried out for Mr Steinkuhler by BfG bank. They confirmed that the union leader, always known for his smart dressing and good lifestyle, had an annual salary of 'more than DM200,000'. According to a report in this week's issue of Stern, Mr Steinkuhler bought 2,100 MAH shares between March 18 and April 1 this year, for almost DM1m. Half the total was bought on April 1, the very day he was attending a supervisory board meeting of Daimler-Benz. MAH was a special holding company established in 1975 to prevent the Shah of Iran from acquiring a big stake in Daimler, Germany's largest company. Its sole function is to hold a 25.23 per cent stake in Daimler. Steel agreement near, Page 2 Editorial Comment, Page 17</p>

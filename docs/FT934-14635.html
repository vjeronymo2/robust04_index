			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: HTR Japanese offer oversubscribed THE FIRST investment trust launch by Henderson Touche Remnant, the recently merged fund management group, has proved a success with the Pounds 100m offer for subscription of HTR Japanese Smaller Companies Trust being oversubscribed. The amount raised, viewed in the light of the recent Pounds 60m flotation of Fleming's Chinese trust and the Pounds 67m raised by Schroder's emerging markets unit trust, indicates the healthy state of the collective funds sector. Henderson raised Pounds 75m via a placing for its trust with the Pounds 25m coming from an offer for subscription. Dealings in the shares will start on October 22.</p>

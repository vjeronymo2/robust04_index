Political and Economic  Instability in Russia Complicates Cooperation With the West"]    [Text] From the purely formal point of view, relations  between the long-standing opponents in the "cold" war in Europe  -- the Soviet (now Russian) army and NATO -- have changed  substantially. Merely a few years ago, in 1989, the two gigantic  groupings were confronting each other, ready to fight. In spite  of all talk about "new" thinking, both sides continued to build  up their military might, while the disturbances in the GDR,  which preceded the fall of the Berlin wall, could, it seemed,  have put both sides on the verge of a large war, just like  during the earlier Berlin crises of 1949 and 1961.    Now the new Russia and NATO are "partners," almost allies,  "for peace." Reciprocal official and working visits by military  delegations have become so common that they do not arouse great  interest. This week, for instance, German Army General von  Ondarza, commander of NATO Allied Armed Forces in the Central  European War Theater, arrived in Moscow. The visit, however, is  of a fairly nostalgic character: this war theater as such does  not exist any longer; von Ondarza is resigning while the  prospects for the future of the hitherto most powerful NATO  forces in Central Europe are quite dire -- the enemy is gone,  apparently for a long time, if not forever. At present the  remnants of the combat effective units of the Russian troop  grouping are being pulled out of Germany and all that will  remain by spring will be the 6th Berlin Brigade, designed  exclusively for military ceremonies, and some rear and special  services. By August the withdrawal of the Russian troops will  be completed.    Both NATO and the Russian Defense Ministry are now looking  for a new raison d'etre for their coexistence on the same  continent. General Kolesnikov, chief of the Russian General  Staff, told General von Ondarza that "we are now studying with  great interest the Partnership for Peace program: it contains  some sound ideas." The text of an agreement on a program of  cooperation between NATO and the Russian Federation Defense  Ministry has been prepared and in fact is ready for signing.  Russia is interested in closer interaction with NATO in the  area of planning, organizing, preparing, and conducting  peacekeeping operations and above all, in according the  peacekeeping battalions -- the 27th Motorized Rifle Division in  the Dniester Region, a battalion in South Ossetia, and the 201st  Motorized Rifle Division in Tajikistan -- a more "reliable"  international legal status (as UN or CSCE forces). NATO member  states, however, concerned by the results of the 12 December  elections and the danger of the "revival of Russian  imperialism," do not intend to oblige Russia on this issue.    Generally, any practical moves toward implementing the  Partnership for Peace program are unlikely any time soon.  Primarily for economic reasons. True, joint command and staff  exercises by the U.S. 3d Infantry Division and the Russian 27th  "peacekeeping" Motorized Rifle Division of the Volga Military  District have been planned for 1994 but the Russian Defense  Ministry has no funds to conduct real joint maneuvers with NATO  forces. The ministry has no funds even for official visits,  although it has been flooded with invitations literally from all  NATO countries. In the near future however economic problems  will apparently not be the main ones.    The ministry is agitated by serious rumors about an early  and  inevitable drastic reorganization (resubordination of the  General Staff directly to the president, and so forth) of the  military department patterned after the reorganization of the  Security Ministry last December. It seems that the Yeltsin  administration is considering the third variant of the edict on  reorganizing the Russian Federation Defense Ministry. In any  event, the idea of "Partnership" today does not seem to be very  topical.</p>

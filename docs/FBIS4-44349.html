			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Mark Atkinson, PRESS ASSOCIATION economics correspondent] </F>   [Text] The Treasury today upgraded its forecast for  economic growth in 1994 to 2.75 percent from the Budget  prediction last November of 2.5 percent. And, in what amounts  to a golden scenario for the Government, it said prices would  rise more slowly than at first thought.    The more optimistic outlook for growth is coupled with a big  downward revision to the expected level of underlying inflation  -- the Government's preferred measure which excludes mortgage  interest payments.    According to Treasury calculations, it is set to average 2.5  percent in the last three months of 1994 against 3.25 percent  previously forecast -- well within the Government's 1 percent to  4 percent target range.    The combination of higher growth and lower than anticipated  inflation has allowed the Treasury to reduce the amount of money  it expects to borrow to plug the gap between its spending and  income.    The Public Sector Borrowing Requirement [PSBR] in the  financial year 1994-95 is now put at 36 billion pounds sterling  -- 2 billion less than predicted last November.    The improved performance of the economy is expected to  continue next year when growth is again forecast to be 2.75  percent.    However, the Treasury warned that inflation may be pushed up  temporarily to 2.75 percent by the end of 1995 as the amount of  slack in the economy is taken up.    The PSBR is expected to fall to 28 billion pounds sterling  in  1995-96 -- 2 billion lower than previously forecast.    Mr Clarke said the figures showed that the Government's  monetary, fiscal and supply side measures were having their  effect, "placing this country in an excellent situation with the  chance, if we are prepared to take it, of having good recovery  with low inflation, falling unemployment and rising prosperity  for several years ahead."    He said the forecast was "prudent and sensible," adding:  "This is not a government that is encouraging its forecasters to  go wild with over optimism."    Addressing a news conference at the Treasury, Mr Clarke  issued a series of health warnings about the figures contained  in the Government's first summer economic forecast.    He said: "The figures in the forecast are objective, the  best  we can produce and show a combination of very favourable  circumstances at the moment. But I don't believe we should look  at them as if every figure is bound to be accurate and a spot  forecast of where we will be in 12 months time," he said. "They  are a guide to policy but I have no intention of being dominated  by them," the Chancellor added. Mr Clarke stressed that there  was "quite a margin of error in forecasting of this kind." But  he said the figures in the forecast were "good news" for the  British economy. "We have quite the best combination of  circumstances pointing to sustainable growth and low inflation  that I can remember for a very long time."    Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown told PA [PRESS ASSOCIATION]  News: ``The Chancellor is being complacent about the short-term  because millions of people have seen their living standards fall  and complacent about the long-term because he has done nothing  to address the fundamental problems of the economy.    ``Growth will not reach even 3 percent before 1996, if the  Chancellor is to be believed. The prospects for long-term and  high sustainable growth needed for rises in the standard of  living are simply not there.''    It appeared that Mr Clarke was heading for a fight with Bank  of England Governor Eddie George over the direction of the  economy. "It is clear that the Governor of the Bank of England  now believes that interest rates and therefore mortgages are  going to have to rise. For that to happen so early in the  recovery is not good news for the long-term prospects of the  economy." Mr Brown claimed that the Government had little room  for manoeuvre by bringing in tax cuts as a sweetener before the  next election.    He added: "There is nothing that this Chancellor can do on  taxes that is going to impress the electorate. He can't undo  the damage done by what he himself has had to admit is the  equivalent, with all the tax rises he was sought, of a 7 percent  rise in income tax."</p>

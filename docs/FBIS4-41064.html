			<p>BFN     [Text] If the term of the powers of deputies to the Federal  Assembly and the president are extended for two more years, the  period of stability in Russia could continue for another three  years. This is what Federation Council Speaker Vladimir  Shumeyko thinks. In his words, Boris Yeltsin does not object to  this step and also thinks it necessary to extend the period of  stable work.    But we remind you that in an interview to Radio Ekho Moskvy,  Boris Yeltsin's press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov said that  Vladimir Shumeyko's initiative had only been heard of in the  apparatus of the head of state today from a dispatch received  there.    Today the initiative of the Speaker of the Federation  Council  was also supported by State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin. In his  opinion the idea could be implemented on three conditions,  namely: If elements of stabilization emerge in the country in  the next few months; if the country's legislative network is  formed in the right way; and finally, if both the chambers of  the Federal Assembly prove their competence.    However, major factions of the State Duma were extremely  skeptical regarding the initiative of the chairman of the upper  chamber on extending the powers. Our correspondent reports on  this:    [Correspondent Ivan Tresilov] Although the factions and  groups have not worked out united positions, individual  representatives among them have already expressed their opinion  on this.    Aleksandr Savtsov, of Russia's Choice, expressed himself  more  accurately: I see nothing here but an attempt to buy deputies.    Communist Viktor Zorkin called the proposals unethical and  Yabloko member Viktor Sheynis called the move amoral.    Boris Fedorov, leader of the 12 December Union, also called  for holding elections at the normal time.    Only leader of the Liberal Democrats [LDPR] Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy immediately entered the fray and started vigorous  bargaining. In his words, the LDPR will support the extension  of powers if a new government is formed on the basis of his  party.    Ivan Tresilov, Ekho Moskvy, State Duma.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Welt-Nachrichtendienst" report: "Bundeswehr to Bosnia: </F> Schaeuble Contradicts Kohl"]    [Excerpt] Bonn -- Differences over the participation of  Bundeswehr soldiers in missions in the former Yugoslavia seem to  have appeared between Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl, of the  Christian Democratic Union [CDU], and Wolfgang Schaeuble,  chairman of the CSU/Christian Social Union [CSU] Bundestag Group.    Kohl stated yesterday that he was taking an "extremely  skeptical" position on this issue. Memories of World War II are  particularly vivid in that part of Europe, which is why we "will  have to discuss the question of help quietly." The chancellor  spoke in favor of humanitarian and technical support for the  reconstruction of Bosnia.    Schaeuble, however, did not expressly rule out the  involvement of German soldiers: "Basically one must say that  Germany must make its contribution -- including in the military  sphere -- to peace in the former Yugoslavia. Should peace be  concluded, then the participation of German soldiers should not  be ruled out on principle to secure and consolidate peace --  under one condition: All parties involved must agree to it."    Government Spokesman Vogel said in this connection that he  saw fundamentally "no differences" between the two leading CDU  officials on the issue of international Bundeswehr missions.  Both were basically in favor of such Bundeswehr missions, he  said, without making any specific mention of Yugoslavia.  [passage omitted]</p>

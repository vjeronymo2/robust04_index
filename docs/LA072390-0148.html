			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PADRES' RIDDOCH IS COOL DESPITE COLD START;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: SAN DIEGO'S NEW MANAGER HAS SEEN MANY ASPECTS OF THE GAME, AND HE'S  NOT GOING TO LET A FEW LOSSES RUIN HIS JOB.  </P> <P> Sitting in the middle of the restaurant Friday afternoon, having lunch hours  before his team would lose yet another game, Greg Riddoch's eyes were  transfixed.  </P> <P> Across the room was an aquarium containing live lobsters, and Riddoch kept  looking at it until the parallel finally hit him.  </P> <P> "You know, he said, "that's kind of like me. There's a lobster sitting in cool  water, just relaxing and letting the water go through its gills.  </P> <P> "Then, all of a sudden, someone snatches it and throws it in a pot of scalding  water.  </P> <P> "It deadens your senses right away."  </P> <P> Somehow, in the midst of all of this, Gregory Lee Riddoch still is able to  laugh. Well, outwardly, at least. His insides are bubbling to a point at which  he already has lost five pounds, and he has been on the job only since July 11.  Welcome to the Padre manager's chair, where your dream, too, can turn into a  living hell.  </P> <P> The Padres have won just one game since Riddoch was promoted as manager, losing  games in ways that have even Little League kids wincing. It has gotten so bad  that instead of Riddoch consoling players, they're consoling him.  </P> <P> "I feel so bad for Greg," Padre pitcher Bruce Hurst said. "No one deserves  this. We're just playing awful, and it's not his fault at all."  </P> <P> Said first baseman Jack Clark: "It takes a lot of guts for him to take this  over. I think he's doing a super job. He's pushing the right buttons, but we're  the ones letting him down."  </P> <P> This, more than anything, reveals the respect and intimacy Riddoch has with his  players. The players are well aware Riddoch was hired as a manager only through  the end of the season and that managers with a .090 winning percentage don't  tend to stick around for long. But please, they say, give the man a chance.  </P> <P> "I really believe we have the right man for the job," right fielder Tony Gwynn  said. "It's so tough for him to right the ship when it's sinking, but I really  believe if anyone can, it's Greg. I know he's not going to give up, he'll fight  to the end."  </P> <P> You would think that a man who has just 10 weeks left to prove to his owners  that he's right for the job would be panicking. He should be acting as if he's  waiting a last-minute stay-of-execution call from the governor, but instead,  it's as if he's waiting for the President to call and chit-chat. He's been  calm, almost serene, during this rash of defeats.  </P> <P> You want him to criticize one of his players, ripping him to shreds in the  fashion that would give Dick Williams goose bumps. Uh-uh.  </P> <P> "You're not going to ever hear me criticize one of my players through the  paper," Riddoch said, "Never. That's not my style. When something needs to be  said, it'll be done between me and the player, and that's it."  </P> <P> Riddoch made it clear that if the players wanted to continue to make stupid  mistakes on the field, go ahead, but they'll have to keep opening their wallets  every time, too. He installed a Kangaroo Court, complete with three judges,  with all fines going to the San Diego Children's' Hospital.  </P> <P> He has had separate meetings with Clark and Gwynn, trying to repress the  clubhouse feuds and cliques. He also is meeting individually with each player  on the team, listening to their complaints, annoyances and suggestions.  </P> <P> It's still unknown, of course, just how long Riddoch will be able to continue  his first-aid effort. He has a managerial contract through the end of the  season. If Padre chairman Tom Werner likes what he sees, he'll exercise the  option that will pay Riddoch about $180,000 next season. If Werner wants  someone else, Riddoch has been guaranteed that he will continue as a coach, for  about $100,000 less.  </P> <P> "Everything seems to be going wrong right now," Werner said, "but I'm not going  to judge Greg on some of the problems he inherited.  </P> <P> "He's very clearly a guy who is aware of the problems on the team, and has some  solutions to solve them. I feel this is a step in the right direction. He's a  good motivator and teacher, and I think he's in the mold of a Tom Trebelhorn  (of Milwaukee) and Tony LaRussa (of Oakland).  </P> <P> "I believed in Greg when we chose him. And I still believe in him."  </P> <P> Funny, that's what everybody's saying about the guy.  </P> <P> "He has a wonderful way of making life enjoyable for people surrounding him,"  said Tom Runnells, third base coach of the Montreal Expos, who played for  Riddoch in high school. "I've never seen anything like it. He has a way of  getting people to enjoy coming to the park and wanting to work, but he has the  ability to get everything out of youngsters and veterans.  </P> <P> "There's no doubt in my mind that he'll turn around that team. Once they get  going, there's no looking back."  </P> <P> Riddoch, who has spent his life working in almost every facet of baseball,  seems to make an indelible impression on everyone he encounters. Why else would  a man receive 55 congratulatory messages on his hotel phone the night he  received the job, and about 40 more calls and telegrams the next day?  </P> <P> There was one man in particular who was so exuberant at the news that he  thought he was going to cry. His name?  </P> <P> Eric Davis, All-Star outfielder of the Cincinnati Reds.  </P> <P> They first met in 1981. Davis had just graduated from Fremont High School, an  inner-city school in Los Angeles, and was leaving home for the first time in  his life. He went to Eugene, Ore., where he was assigned as an eighth-round  draft choice of Cincinnati.  </P> <P> Well, after batting .219 with one homer and 11 RBIs in 33 games, Davis wanted  out. He had basketball scholarships awaiting at Arizona State and Pepperdine.  Who needed this aggravation?  </P> <P> "I was really unhappy," he said. "But every day he kept talking to me. He kept  telling me not to give up. I think everybody was down on me, but Greg, he not  only battled for me, he went to war for me.  </P> <P> "He's made such an impression on me that he'll always be special in my life.  He's like a part of family now. I'd do anything for that man.  </P> <P> "Let me put it like this: If it wasn't for Greg Riddoch, I wouldn't be here  today.  </P> <P> "It's that simple."  </P> <P> Almost 10 years to the day after Riddoch first managed him in short-season  Class-A ball, Davis will face Riddoch the manager for first time today in San  Diego.  </P> <P> And who knows just what would have happened if Davis had known Riddoch would  manage the Padres?  </P> <P> "Hey, don't ask me that one, that's a tough one," Davis said, laughing.  </P> <P> Perhaps the secret to understanding Riddoch's charm with people who come in  contact with him is looking at this background.  </P> <P> He never knew his real father and wasn't close to his stepfather. He was reared  in California and attended Garden Grove High School.  </P> <P> For those of the '63 graduating class who are trying to remember him, take out  your yearbook and look under the name of Greg Bezlij. That was the last name of  his stepfather. It wasn't until several years later that he reverted to his  natural father's name.  </P> <P> Even today, Riddoch isn't the most publicized graduate of the class. A fellow  by the name of Steve Martin, the comedian/actor, also happened to be part of  it.  </P> <P> Riddoch went off to the University of Northern Colorado on a baseball and  basketball scholarship and four years later was drafted and signed by  Cincinnati.  </P> <P> "He was a home-run hitter in college, but when we saw him, I don't remember him  hitting a single one," said Dick Poole, who's now the Chicago Cubs' pitching  coach. "He wasn't what we called a tough out."  </P> <P> Riddoch spent six years in the minors chasing his dream, which by his account  was two years too long. He finally quit and became a teacher at Greeley (Colo.)  High, where he helped run everything from the band to school plays to baseball.  </P> <P> Bob Howsam, the Reds' farm director, telephoned Riddoch one month later and  asked him if he would manage one of their minor league teams during his summer  months. Why not? Riddoch spent each summer managing in the Northwest League.  When he was promoted to assistant principal and didn't have enough time to  manage, he became a regional scouting supervisor.  </P> <P> Then one day, after watching an American Legion game in Butte, Mont., he  returned to his hotel room and received a message from Howsam, who had retired  in 1978 from the Reds.  </P> <P> Said Howsam: "They're going to let (General Manager) Dick Wagner go tomorrow. I  want to refine the Big Red Machine, and I want you to be part of it."  </P> <P> Riddoch wasn't sure what to do. He hated to uproot his family. But the more he  listened, the more excited he became. Howsam was going to groom him to be the  next general manager and was so sincere that he was offering him a three-year  guaranteed contract totaling $180,000. When you're making $28,000 as an  assistant principal, the decision becomes quite simple.  </P> <P> Everything went fine for two years. Riddoch vaulted through the system, from  assistant director of player development and scouting to the minor league  director and had been told that in four months, he would be assistant general  manager.  </P> <P> Well, that changed on July 7, 1985. Howsam met with new owner Marge Schott for  more than 12 hours.  </P> <P> The next day, Howsam announced his retirement. Schott became the new president  and chief operating officer, Riddoch a lame duck.  </P> <P> Riddoch still had a year left on his contract, but he made it easy on her. He  resigned effective Dec. 31, 1985. He was going to work in the Seattle Mariners  organization.  </P> <P> Well, just a few weeks before he was getting ready for the move, he was told  the job wasn't available after all.  </P> <P> Much to Riddoch's surprise, offers started coming in from all directions. It  was Tom Romenesko, Padre director of player development, who finally wooed him.  He started work on Jan. 1, 1986, as associate director of minor leagues and  scouting. In seven weeks, he came director of the department. In eight months,  he became a coach on Larry Bowa's staff. And now, after 3 1/2 years as coach,  he's the 13th manager of the Padres.  </P> <P> "Kind of makes you dizzy, doesn't it?" Riddoch said. "My feet still aren't on  the ground.  </P> <P> "Who'd have thought a guy like me would be doing this?"  </P> <P> Jack McKeon, who was manager and vice president/baseball operations, said to  Riddoch: "You know, one day, I think you're going to be manager."  </P> <P> Said Riddoch: "Thanks, but, uh, if you don't mind, let's don't even talk about  that stuff. I just want to concentrate on coaching."  </P> <P> McKeon agreed not to bring it up again, and Riddoch walked away thinking that  in three or four years, maybe he would be manager.  </P> <P> "Now, here I am," Riddoch said, "feeling absolutely naked. But I think  everything will work out, I really do."  </P> <P> "Maybe this is the way it's supposed to be. Maybe the Good Lord is saying,  'Greg, I never said this would be easy, but I believe you're the right man.  </P></p>

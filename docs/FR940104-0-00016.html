			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Tenneco asserts that while the Commission recognized in Order No. 497&hyph;D that the EBB requirements in Order No. 636 obviate the need for pipelines to file Form 592 with the Commission, the Commission failed to recognize that certain information currently required in Form 592 will have little use to anyone in the post-Order No. 636 world.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tenneco states that Item Nos. 7 and 8 require that a pipeline report the position of its marketing affiliate in the pipeline's transportation queue and the total number of requests in the queue respectively. Tenneco submits that in the unbundled world pipelines will allocate available capacity among requesting shippers not on a first-come, first-served basis, but on the basis of the relative value of the request to the pipeline. Tenneco states that the value of the requests for transportation will involve a calculation based on the price offered and the term of the request, and the precise method of determining which offer has the highest value to the pipeline will be stated in the pipeline's tariff. Tenneco asserts that without a first-come, first-served queue in effect, there is no advantage to be gained by maintaining these two information requirements. Tenneco further asserts that the pipeline capacity release programs will provide yet another avenue through which shippers desiring firm transportation capacity can obtain it, thus further reducing the utility of the required information. Tenneco contends that these changes brought about by Order No. 636 will thus eliminate the need for pipelines to report the queue position of their marketing affiliates and the total number of requests in the queue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tenneco states that Item Nos. 23 and 24 require pipelines to report whether or not the pipeline will receive take-or-pay credits for transporting an affiliate's gas and what percentage of the gas transported will be subject to credit. Tenneco states that because the Commission's take-or-pay crediting program terminated on December 31, 1990, pipelines have not been able to receive take-or-pay credits since December 31, 1990. Therefore, Tenneco asserts that maintaining this requirement serves no purpose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tenneco states that Item No. 32 requires pipelines to identify the location of the producing fields from which gas requested to be transported for an affiliate originates. Tenneco argues that with the implementation of flexible receipt and delivery points and capacity release, this information becomes useless. Tenneco contends that shippers will be using secondary receipt points on their own contracts and acquiring each other's capacity much more than they have historically. Tenneco asserts that this is precisely the outcome that the Commission is trying to bring about by mandating flexible receipt and delivery points and capacity release. Tenneco submits that with this increase in the number of transportation transactions that involve the use of points other than the primary receipt or delivery point of the entity requesting transportation, requiring pipelines to report this information serves no purpose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tenneco states that Record No. 3 requires pipelines to report requested receipt and delivery points for transportation requests of their marketing affiliates. Tenneco asserts that the advent of flexible receipt and delivery points renders this information useless. Tenneco argues that the marketing affiliate, like any other shipper, will have the firm right to use any receipt or delivery point on the system to the extent that capacity is available. Thus, Tenneco contends the utility of maintaining a list of requested receipt and delivery points is vastly diminished.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the information required by Item Nos. 7, 8, 23, 24, and 32 of Schedule 2 and all of Schedule 3 will no longer have value after full compliance with Order No. 636, Tenneco requests that the Commission clarify that this information need not be maintained on pipelines' EBBs. Tenneco asserts that eliminating the requirement to report it is consistent with the Commission's goal to decrease needlessly burdensome regulation. Tenneco requests expedited action on this issue as pipelines are currently setting up their EBBs, and a swift affirmative response will enable the new EBBs to more accurately reflect the required information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Contest for Los Angeles mayor is too close to call LOS ANGELES residents go to the polls today to choose a mayor in a tightly fought contest. Mr Michael Woo, a 41-year-old councillor and liberal Democrat who is the grandson of Chinese immigrants, aims to become the first Asian American mayor of a large US city. But he faces a close race against conservative Republican Richard Riordan, 62, a political newcomer and millionaire businessman. The winner will replace Mr Tom Bradley, a Democratic liberal, and one of the first black mayors in the US, who is retiring after 20 years in office. Mr Woo has won broad support from Los Angeles' large immigrant community. His campaign has focused on South Central Los Angeles, the backdrop for last year's riots which were sparked by the acquittal of four policemen accused of assaulting a black motorist, Mr Rodney King. In contrast, Mr Riordan appeals to more affluent suburban voters; one of his last campaign stops was in a San Fernando Valley park where a two-year-old was fatally shot during a gang-related incident on Easter Sunday. Mr Woo, who is well known in the city as a councillor, was an early favourite in the mayoral race. However, Mr Riordan, with superior financial resources has quickly gained recognition. The state Democratic party, alarmed by Mr Riordan's rise in the polls, persuaded President Bill Clinton to make the unusual move of endorsing Mr Woo. Mr Riordan, who says the top three campaign themes are 'safety, safety, safety,' has pledged to put 3,000 more police officers on the streets with a plan financed in part by leasing the city-owned Los Angeles International Airport to a private group. Mr Woo's public safety plan is less ambitious. He promises to increase gradually the number of police with money cut from budgets of the mayor and City Council and from other city departments. He is also supporting a city ban on cheap handguns, known as Saturday Night Specials. He has won the endorsement of the Los Angeles Times, the city's leading newspaper. It said of him: 'In a city with a hundred different voices straining to be heard - in a city with a lot of conflict and much too much bad feeling - he is the better listener, and so the better conciliator. And in this fragmented city, it is the better conciliator who'll get results.' Whoever wins, he is expected quickly to become a leading figure in state and national politics as mayor of the second largest US city, which has become the focus of broad debate on the issues of immigration, racial tension and inner-city decay.</p>

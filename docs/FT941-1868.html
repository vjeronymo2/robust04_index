			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Battle for Hyundai site Canada's federal government and the state of Quebec are trying to find ways to re-open the Hyundai car assembly plant near Montreal. The South Korean group's CDollars 400m (USDollars 294.1m) plant was closed temporarily last summer because of poor sales of the Sonata car. It was to be re-tooled for assembly, from mid-1995, of the 1996 Elantra for the North American and European markets. Hyundai, however, maintains it can only build the Elantra economically in Korea. A weak Canadian dollar has driven up the cost of parts purchased in US dollars, and the North American Free Trade Agreement has raised duties on all imported parts. Hyundai said the Bromont plant would stay shut indefinitely. An Ontario wheel plant, meanwhile, will be shut down completely and sold. In Ottawa Mr Paul Martin, federal finance minister, said he had raised the Bromont closure with the Korean government. 'We're actively seeking alternative uses,' he said. The Quebec government hinted it might be willing to help if Hyundai agreed to re-open the plant.</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Paramount board recommends QVC The board of Paramount Communications last night recommended that shareholders reject a controversial Dollars 9.2bn offer for the entertainment company made last Friday by cable company Viacom and accept a rival Dollars 9.7bn offer from QVC Network. The decision does not settle the marathon five-month takeover battle, since shareholders remain free to accept either bid and Viacom could still make a higher offer by February 1, the date set for final bids. However, the board's re-endorsement of QVC's offer maintains the psychological advantage the television home shopping business has enjoyed in the battle since shortly before Christmas. That was when the Paramount board, which had previously supported a friendly merger with cable company Viacom, switched sides under pressure from the courts and said QVC's offer gave shareholders better value. Last Friday night, shortly before QVC's tender offer was due to close, Viacom announced a new bid which increased from Dollars 85 a share to Dollars 105 a share the cash it is offering for 50.1 per cent of Paramount's stock, but sharply cut the value of the securities it is offering in a 'second step merger' for the remaining 49 per cent. Simultaneously, it announced an Dollars 8.4bn merger agreement with video rental group Blockbuster Entertainment, which is providing Dollars 1.25bn to finance the higher cash offer. The new Viacom bid offers Dollars 13 a share more cash than QVC, but the total value of its offer is some Dollars 5 a share less than the QVC bid. A statement from Paramount last night said the board had yesterday evaluated advice on the new bid from its legal and financial advisers. It had decided that 'although the per-share cash consideration offered in the revised Viacom offer is higher than that offered in the QVC offer, the aggregate consideration offered in the QVC offer and its second step merger, taken together, represents the best value available to Paramount stockholders'. Mr Martin Davis, Paramount chairman, said any future bids would continue to be 'rigorously reviewed with regard to their compliance with the bidding procedures.' He added that Paramount would not extend the February 1 deadline for final bids.</p>

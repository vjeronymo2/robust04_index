			<p>BFN     [Text] The ninth standing committee meeting of the eighth  provincial people's congress held its second plenary session  this afternoon to hear the work reports of the provincial  government, the provincial people's court, and the provincial  people's procuratorate. Gu Changchun, vice chairman of the  provincial people's congress standing committee, chaired the  session.    Cheng Wengui, deputy director of the provincial planning  commission, said in his report on Jilin's commodity prices:  Regarding Jilin's 1993 price work, aiming at establishing the  socialist market economy system, a goal put forward at the 14th  party congress, we gave better play to the regulatory role of  the lever of prices in economic operation and achieved fairly  good results. Major problems in Jilin's 1993 price work were  that prices rose by a rather large margin, with the retail price  index increasing by 11.3 percent in the province; and that  collection of unwarranted fees, fines, and donations still  occurred frequently, making the task to check this practice very  arduous. In carrying out the price work in 1994, Jilin should  focus on the priorities, achieve a good command of the extent,  promote the price reform in an active and prudent manner in line  with the capacity of the state, enterprises, and the people to  bear the strains, gradually establish and improve the means of  price regulation and control, and adopt resolute measures to  strictly control price rises and stabilize the general price  level.    In his report on the trial of major and serious cases by the  courts in the process of the anticorruption struggle, Yang  Qingxiang, president of the provincial higher people's court,  said: From January 1993 to February 1994, the province  registered 220 major and serious economic cases involving 235  persons and concluded 202 cases of them, which involved 212  persons. Of the concluded cases, 196 involved over 10,000 yuan  each; and of the 212 criminals punished, five were cadres at and  above the county or section level. Public trial and  pronouncement of sentences effectively frightened economic  criminals and enhanced the people's determination to oppose  corruption and advocate honesty.    In his report on the endeavor of Jilin procuratorial organs  to investigate and handle major and serious cases in the process  of the anticorruption struggle, Li Xiangwu, chief procurator of  the provincial people's procuratorate, said: From January 1993  to the first quarter of 1994, procuratorial organs throughout  Jilin Province accepted 3,375 economic cases on embezzlement and  bribery and placed 2,333 on file for investigation, of which 766  were major and serious cases, and concluded 1,654 cases. By  handling these cases, they recovered 113.8 million yuan in  economic losses for the state and the collective.</p>

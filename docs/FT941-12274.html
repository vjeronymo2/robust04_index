			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Emerging Markets: Japan yen remains market's focus - Currency Markets In a big week for monetary policy watchers the Japanese yen is likely to remain the centre of attention for foreign exchange traders. The aftermath of the Saturday deadline for political reform and the continuing uncertainty surrounding economic and trading relations between Japan and the US will determine the movements of the yen. Although the dollar weakened by over three yen last week, many analysts argued that this was a short-term move dictated by the confused political situation in Tokyo and that the dollar should be a strong currency over the medium term. Late on Friday hopes were growing that conditions might be in place for a new fiscal package to boost the economy, possibly presaging a new shift in sentiment. Monetary authorities in the UK, Germany and the US will review official interest rates this week. A change in UK rates seems unlikely when Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, meet on Wednesday. But the outcome of Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting and the US Federal Open Market committee meeting on that day and Friday is less clear. Last Friday's news of subdued US inflationary pressures in the fourth quarter has dampened expectations of an early Fed tightening. It also gave a boost to the D-Mark, triggering hopes in Germany that the Bundesbank would no longer be deterred from cutting its official interest rate by weakness of the currency. However, the possibility of labour unrest, signalled by threatened stoppages from the IG Metall trade union in support of a 6 per cent pay claim, may persuade the Bundesbank to remain cautious. IG Bau, the construction union, is also demanding 6 per cent while banking sector unions hold wage talks in two weeks time. With regards to the dollar the markets are looking ahead beyond the last quarter's robust growth to the future. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief currency strategist at Citibank, argued that: 'The Fed will act cautiously on interest rates. I don't think they will act aggressively at all.' He reasoned that although the economic data has been bullish, tax rises in the current quarter will weigh on economic growth. Some commentators said hesitation by the Fed would have a positive impact on Europe. Mr Tony Norfield, UK treasury economist at ABN-AMRO bank, said that the prospect of European rate cuts had become more likely because the likelihood of a tightening of policy by the Fed had receded.</p>

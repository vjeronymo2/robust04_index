			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mine investment may be diverted from Australia MINING investment is likely to be diverted from Australia to other countries if the government bans mining at the disputed Coronation Hill site in the Northern Territory, the mining industry warned yesterday. 'International miners and Australian miners are saying we might as well go to other places where the government is interested in further development,' said Mr Lauchlan McIntosh, director of the Australian Mining Industry Council. His comments followed the release of a report into Coronation Hill by the Resource Assessment Commission (RAC), a government advisory body set up to investigate the competing claims of miners, aboriginal landowners and environmental groups. The government initially indicated that mining at Coronation Hill would be allowed, but imposed a temporary ban in 1989 after environmental groups claimed it would threaten the Kakadu national park, a wilderness area adjacent to the site. Significant gold reserves have been identified at the site by the Coronation Hill Joint Venture, which comprises Newcrest Mining (formerly BHP Gold Mines), Norgold, and Plutonic Resources (formerly Pioneer Minerals (Gold). The RAC report says mining would have only minor environmental consequences, but would infringe the religious beliefs of the Jaowyn tribe, the traditional aboriginal owners of the land. It also hints that a ban on mining would not have serious economic consequences if the government explained carefully to mining companies that the site was regarded as a special case. The report makes no recommendations, but sets out a series of seven options ranging from a ban on mining, through limited development in consultation with the Jaowyn, to full development as proposed by the joint venture. However, Mr McIntosh said Coronation Hill was seen as a 'litmus test' by the mining industry, and warned that limits on mining would be regarded as confirmation that the government was prepared to break its own rules. 'It has clearly become an emotional issue because of the way the government has handled the whole crisis,' he said. 'The country is going broke, and it would be disappointing to think that we cannot get to the stage where we can have some more pragmatic decisions.' Mr McIntosh said Australia would be regarded as 'elitist and preservationist if we continue with this nonsense of saying every tiny area in the country has some special significance to small groups of people.' Mr Bob Hawke, the prime minister, said the RAC report presented the government with a difficult decision, but refused to comment further. Mr Hawke has previously argued that Coronation Hill is a special case 'involving a combination of complex and sensitive issues which would only rarely occur.' The federal cabinet is expected to discuss the report shortly, and a decision is expected early next month.</p>

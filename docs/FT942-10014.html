			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: Record profits for Aoyama Trading Aoyama Trading, the Japanese men's apparel retailer, reported record profits for the year ended last March after expanding its sales network. The company, which started the discount boom in men's suits, said non-consolidated pre-tax profits rose 1.6 per cent to Y30.68bn (Dollars 298m), on a 20.8 per cent rise in sales to Y182.3bn. After-tax profits rose 4.1 per cent to Y15.9bn. The annual dividend will rise by Y10 to Y40. In spite of the record figure, it was the first time since 1987 that Aoyama had seen only single-digit profit growth. Increasing competition and saturation of the discount men's suit market has affected business.</p>

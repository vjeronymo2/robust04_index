			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / BP hopes for lift in N Sea oil output THE North Sea could produce more oil and gas in the next 20 years than it has produced in the past 20 years, Mr John Browne, managing director of BP, said yesterday. This would be achieved through more advanced technology and lower operating costs, and would be helped by the UK government's new petroleum revenue tax regime. Mr Browne, opening the biennial Offshore Europe Conference and Exhibition in Aberdeen, said the North Sea was mature after 20 years of high production levels but was not finished, even though output was declining in some fields. He held out the possibility that UK oil production would stay at its current level of 2.2m barrels a day well into the next century and even reach 2.8m b/d, and that the UK government would receive an income of between Pounds 2.5bn and Pounds 3.5bn a year for 20 years. He believed that within 20 years new technology could raise the proportion of an oilfield's recoverable reserves from the current 45 per cent to 60 per cent or even 70 per cent, and it could permit production from very small fields. Other productivity improvements would come from developing closer partnerships between oil companies and offshore contractors to seek the most cost-effective ways of operating. 'Given a further 30 per cent reduction in capital costs and a 50 per cent reduction in operating costs over the next 20 years, it is possible to raise the total volume recoverable from the North Sea by 25 per cent - from around 65bn barrels to around 75bn barrels.' Mr Browne said the reductions in petroleum revenue tax in the last Budget were a further incentive to reduce costs and would be seen over time to have brought great benefits to the North Sea. Proposals for a Pounds 100m energy park, offering research and development facilities for energy-related companies, were unveiled yesterday by Teesside Development Corporation. The corporation, whose chief executive Mr Duncan Hall dismissed science parks as 'somewhat passe', said the energy park will establish Teesside as an international R&amp;D centre for the energy industry.</p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: How much is yours worth? MICHAEL HESELTINE has ensured an outbreak of house price neurosis, because of his linkage of the new Council Tax to seven distinct bands of property value (details: Page III). Top-of-the-range homeowners, in band seven, face paying two and a half times the local tax rate of bottom band home owners. But as the Valuation Office of the Inland Revenue supervises the price banding of the country's 22m houses and flats, how many owners will cheer on learning that their home has been slotted into one of the lower price bands? Consider the horror for status conscious homeowners if the local valuer gives them the benefit of the doubt and brands their home as a band five or six when they have always thought of themselves as one of nature's band sevens. A ticklish problem of etiquette that is not addressed in the government's otherwise exhaustive consultation papers is whether socially sensitive owners can appeal to have their valuation raised into line with their affectations. The home sale implications of the change are equally perplexing. Buyers pay for status as much as accommodation. Now that the government has nailed the national house price average for all to see, who wants to boast about moving to a below average property? Should vendors broadcast their existing price band and have prospective buyers reach for a calculator and the nearest national house price index to see what layer of averageness to bid? Alternatively, should they try to present their home as a band or two above its station and trust that no-one will ask how much council tax they are expected to pay? Thanks to the changes which have left local taxes absorbing only a small part of councils' total spending, this week's proposals are unlikely to have any wider impact on property values. Once the existing poll tax arrangements end in 1993, the current extra costs of owning a second home will be reduced once more. The council tax charge will be effectively halved by the allowance of two 25 per cent personal discounts. The arrangements for residential investment properties have yet to be worked out in detail, but the proposal that multi-occupied rental properties be brought within the scope of non-domestic rates would bring the local tax charge onto a more realistic business basis. Since all-student houses will get a 50 per cent discount, the temptation for students to share accomodation will be all the greater. Otherwise, the only fundamental question for housing values in the medium and long term is whether, under the Councul Tax regime, individual boroughs and local authorities will have the resources to maintain an adequate level of services.</p>

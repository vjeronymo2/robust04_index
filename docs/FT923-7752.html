			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / International Company News: MGM stays in the red at halftime MGM, the Hollywood studio now controlled by its French bank creditor Credit Lyonnais, yesterday posted a second-quarter operating loss of Dollars 37.8m, compared with a deficit of Dollars 33.9m a year earlier. MGM is still untangling its balance sheet after being run for nearly a year by Mr Giancarlo Parretti, the controversial Italian financier who officially lost control of the studio in December. Towards the end of Mr Parretti's tenure, film production ground to a virtual halt at the financially-troubled studio. MGM said its development and production activities have now started to pick up. 'However, due to the long lead time required for the development and production of feature films, the effects of these increased activities will not be fully reflected in the company's results of operations until 1993 and beyond,' it said. For the three months to June 30, MGM had a net loss of Dollars 59m, or 98 cents, on revenues of Dollars 195m, against a deficit of Dollars 59.3m, or 99 cents, on revenues of Dollars 208.3m the previous year. Its pre-tax loss narrowed to Dollars 50.3m from Dollars 62m. The results were muddied by a one-time items, including about Dollars 20m in gains from the settlement of litigation and a higher tax provision in the latest quarter. For the first six months, MGM had a net loss of Dollars 113.7m, or Dollars 1.89, on revenues of Dollars 493.9m. This compared with a loss of Dollars 159.9m, or Dollars 2.67, on revenues of Dollars 500.8m for last year's corresponding period.</p>

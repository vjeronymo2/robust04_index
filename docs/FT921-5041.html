			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Hopes fade of deal on tariff reductions THE continuing impasse over cuts in farm trade subsidies in the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks has delayed detailed market access negotiations which will form a vital ingredient of the final package. By yesterday, four days after the March 1 deadline, only a dozen or so participants (including the EC) had submitted detailed draft tariff schedules, and those of the major traders contain important omissions. The draft schedules are meant to provide the basis for final adjustments of tariff cuts for each country, with an overall target reduction of one-third, by the end of this month. Many officials in Geneva now say privately that meeting the Easter deadline for completion of the Uruguay Round in its entirety looks increasingly improbable, if not impossible. The US and the EC, by mutual agreement, have not included industrial tariffs in their schedules because they are still in the midst of intensive and sensitive bilateral negotiations, especially on textiles and sectors to be covered by 'zero-for-zero' deals. Some other countries have decided to wait for the outcome of those negotiations before tabling their own industrial tariff schedules. But the main problems still concern agriculture. The EC has provided information on current agricultural protection, including tariff equivalents for items now subject to import quotas and variable levies. But it has not proposed reductions in agricultural trade barriers because the EC is challenging the draft agricultural accord presented last December by Mr Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). Japan, Canada and South Korea, among others, have refused to provide tariff equivalents for farm imports now protected by quantitative restraints, as required by the Dunkel draft.</p>

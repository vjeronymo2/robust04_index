			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Li Nanling 2621 0589 3781 and Zhang Yijun 1728 </F> 4135 0193]    [Text] When interviewed by reporters, delegates from Hong  Kong attending the Second Session of the Eighth National  People's Congress (NPC) said that during the session they would  largely be speaking about and discussing the smooth transition  of Hong Kong, its prosperity, and its stability, along with  reform and development in China, and clean-administration  building in the hinterland.    A total of 28 delegates from Hong Kong will attend the NPC  meeting. Zeng Xianzi, Wu Kangmin, Liao Yaozhu, all members of  the Preliminary Work Organ for the Preparatory Committee of the  Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Hong Kong affairs  advisers to the State Council, and Zheng Yaotang, a Hong Kong  affairs adviser, were among the delegates who spoke to  reporters. As NPC delegates from Hong Kong, each said the  territory was their main issue of concern.    Delegate Liao Yaozhu said the heart of the dispute between  China and Britain over the Hong Kong political system lay in  fulfilling international agreements, in linking up with the Hong  Kong Basic Law, and in realizing a smooth transition for Hong  Kong. Complete insincerity on the matter of cooperation and  deliberate sabotage by Britain had led to the breakdown of  Sino-British negotiations over arrangements for the 1994-1995  elections in Hong Kong.    Delegate Zeng Xianzi said Hong Kong people should not harbor  illusions and should become united. With strong backing from  the motherland, Hong Kong's prosperity and stability would be  ensured.    Other delegates also expressed the hope that the Preliminary  Work Organ for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong  Special Administrative Region would increase its work,  vigorously prepare for China's resumption of sovereignty over  Hong Kong, and help ensure a smooth transition of Hong Kong.    On the issue of reform and construction, delegates Zeng  Xianzi and Wang Mingang said another major topic they would  address at the NPC meeting was good handling of the relationship  between reform, development, and stability. Zeng Xianzi said it  was necessary to emphasize the Chinese character "jian kang"  (healthy)," namely to stress increasing economic efficiency, if  the people wanted to maintain sustained, stable, and healthy  development of the economy. Carrying out reform well would lead  to healthy development of the economy and a developed economy  would lead to social stability. Many delegates also described as  astounding China's economic development over 15 years of reform  and opening up. As China was a big country with a huge  population, development was still uneven. To achieve common  development, it was hoped that the economically- developed  regions would enhance cooperation with less-developed areas.    On the issue of clean-administration building, delegates Wu  Kangmin and Zheng Yaotang said the CPC Central Committee and the  State Council had attached great importance to it, adopted many  effective measures on anticorruption work, and achieved certain  results. They hoped more efforts would be taken in this regard  to establish anticorruption supervision and restraint mechanisms.</p>

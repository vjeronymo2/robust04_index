			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, June 23 (CTK) -- Through its ill-considered  decision to remove ten Russian MiG-29 planes from its equipment,  the Czech Army has deprived itself of the most effective  fighters, Michal Ambroz from the national committee of the  Democratic Left Party (SDL) told CTK today.    "The Czech Republic now has practically no air strike force,  because the remaining Su-29 planes are not equipped for  fighting. These are certainly reasons arousing speculations  about whether or not the Czech air force is still capable of any  action," Ambroz said.    Today's issue of the independent daily MLADA FRONTA DNES  wrote that the decision to remove the MiGs had been made "in  spite of the fact that these Russian planes are still considered  in the world to be one of the best military aircraft."    "The Defense Ministry has said officially that it would be  uneconomical to keep this kind of fighters, because their  operation is too costly, while military experts say that the  army wants to get rid of them, because it wants to replace them  in the future with fighters bought somewhere else than in  Russia," the paper writes.    It quotes Defense Minister Antonin Baudys as having said  earlier that "the army is not interested in modernizing its  equipment by supplies from countries with unstable policy."</p>

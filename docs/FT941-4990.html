			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Steel manufacturers suffer an identity crisis: An industry embarrassed at having to omit dividends For Japan's steel companies, which pride themselves on being the pillar of the country's industrial might, being forced to pass their dividend is an embarrassment they have not had to suffer since just after the Second World War. 'We must grit our teeth and do our best,' Mr Matao Kojima, executive vice president of Sumitomo Metal Industries said yesterday after an announcement by the five big steelmakers that they all expected to incur losses in the year to the end of this month. The steel industry has found itself in these dire circumstances just four years after production levels reached a peak of 110m tonnes. At the time, the strength of demand from Japan's surging domestic economy was enough to halt fundamental restructuring programmes the industry had embarked on to cut overcapacity and prepare for leaner years ahead. With those reforms left incomplete, the industry has suffered a crippling slump in demand from its big customers in the domestic motor vehicle, electronics and construction industries as Japan's economy has continued its relentless slowdown. The weakness of consumer demand and the yen's sharp rise took their toll on the motor and electronics industries which in turn depressed demand for the steelmakers' products. Meanwhile, in the construction sector, private activity, with the general exception of private housing, has been slack. On the export front, Japanese steel makers have faced pressure in the US as a result of anti-dumping action by the American industry. Even before the US authorities made any official decision, fears of anti-dumping action had led to uncertainty about supplies. Baring Securities estimates exports to the US over the year will be down about 25 per cent. Even a relatively bright spot - the surge in exports to China - will not have the uplifting impact on earnings that might have been hoped for. While exports to China will be up about 100 per cent from a year ago, when Japanese exports to that country had reached a record high, these have been low value-added products which served not so much to raise profits as to keep the facilities of Japanese mills on stream. Perhaps the most telling illustration of the severity of the steel makers business slump is the securities sales they are being forced to make to minimise their losses. The companies are having to turn their backs on their traditional ties, cemented by equity holdings, with financial institutions and business customers and to sell at a time when share prices are low. Nippon Steel will sell about Y66bn (Pounds 420m) worth of securities holdings and Kobe Steel some Y31bn. To cope, the companies are reviewing ambitious diversification moves - into areas ranging from semiconductor production to liquor importing and flying instruction. Nippon Steel has pulled out of loss-making notebook computer sales while Kawasaki Steel is in negotiations to sell its silicon wafer production venture. More changes in non-core business plans are expected to follow. Costs are being attacked widely through significant cuts in jobs, capital expenditure and distribution. Kobe Steel intends to cut its labour force by about 3,800 while Kawasaki Steel will reduce 30 per cent of its managers. While in large part, job reductions will be achieved through natural attrition and transfers to subsidiaries 'there are no sacred territories in our bid to reduce costs', Sumitomo's Mr Kojima said yesterday. Japan's steel companies have yet to address the structural problem of overcapacity which is at the root of their difficulties and is likely to maintain pressure on profits. While the Japanese steel industry has capacity of about 110m tonnes, even the steel companies themselves admit that demand for their products is likely to range between 90m and 95m tonnes. 'It's always the most terrifying, the most expensive thing that is left to the very end,' says Mr Stephen Wolfe, steel analyst at Baring Securities. The Japanese steel companies have concentrated their efforts on cutting people, or raising production efficiencies, but that does not address the fundamental problem of collapsing prices, Mr Wolfe notes. For that, it is necessary to reduce capacity 'and to make sure people are scrambling for steel.' While any moves to cut capacity were virtually ruled out by Nippon Steel, which, as industry leader, has historically set a model for the others, Mr Wolfe is not counting out the possibility that the four other companies may be considering such a move. Their decision to pass their dividend in spite of Nippon Steel's determination to pay one may be an indication that the mighty Nippon Steel is losing its leadership, he believes. If that is the case, and Japanese steel makers are preparing to map out a more independent course, each for their own survival, the industry could emerge from its present predicament in much better shape. While they face growing competition from South Korean and other low cost producers at the lower end of the market, their ability to produce high quality products, such as cold-rolled steel sheet used in the car industry, remains unchallenged. 'The future of steel as a product is not over,' says Mr Kojima. 'In terms of technology Japan outdoes the rest. As long as we are competitive we can survive.'</p>

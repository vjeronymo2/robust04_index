			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (11): Salvation through exports / Company profile of Rambaudi THE managing director of Rambaudi sighs with relief when he recalls how the Turin-based machine tool builder changed its business strategy to face up to recession. 'With the domestic market as it is, you can imagine what our position would have been if we had not taken the steps that we did,' says Mr Claudio Piasenza. The medium-sized builder of milling and boring machines and machining centres is heavily dependent on mechanical industries at the forefront of recession. Set up to serve the Turin motor industry, it makes die and mould machines for the car market and also supplies the aircraft and energy industries. The group, founded in 1945 by Antonio Rambaudi - whose marble bust greets the visitor in the foyer, along with an early milling machine - saw turnover slip from a peak of L70bn to L52bn in 1991. Sales by the group's four companies improved to L60bn in 1992 and the company expects to break even this year, perhaps with a small profit in 1994. The measures taken by Rambaudi were: To widen the product range, while selling to the same markets. To increase exports, which were already worldwide, in specific countries. To collaborate with other producers to integrate products. In the internal market, to cut jobs where products were of low added value and to sub-contract some minor processes such as turning. The result is that the group's 500-strong workforce will have been cut by about 20 per cent by mid-1994. One collaboration, agreed earlier this year, is with FMT of Brighton, in the UK, which is one of the few surviving British-owned machine tool builders competing technologically with the Japanese in flexible manufacturing systems. The companies will market each other's complementary products - Rambaudi's vertical spindle machines and FMT's horizontal spindle machines - and work together on turnkey projects. The real salvation of Rambaudi has come through exports. Devaluation of the lira, says Mr Piasenza, has been a big bonus but the groundwork was laid during the shift in strategy. A most important commercial decision was to expand in China where Rambaudi, which has a representative office in Beijing, is co-operating with Chinese companies on two manufacturing projects. Rambaudi also relaunched its activities in the US and Canada through an agency in Rockford, Illinois. 'Results there were terrific in 1992,' says Mr Piasenza. The result of this push abroad has been that overseas sales have shot up from 45-55 per cent of turnover to 75-85 per cent. A walk round the group Ramco's subsidiary - which is being united with the main company to cut overheads - reveals that only a handful of its big-dimension milling machines are being made for the Italian market. The group remains in the control of Bruno, Antonio's son, who is chairman, and Franco, a cousin. 'We think a small and flexible structure is better,' says Mr Piasenza. He acknowledges, however, that a small-scale operation can also be weak, which is why Rambaudi has a sister company to tackle turnkey projects. When the recession lifts in machine tools Mr Piasenza expects exports to fall back to about 60 per cent of sales. But hard times called for drastic measures and he is convinced that it was Rambaudi's independence and relatively small scale which enabled it to react so rapidly to market changes.</p>

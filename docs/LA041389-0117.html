			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CUBS ARE SAVED BY WILLIAMS  </P> <P> The standings in the National League East must be upside down. The Chicago Cubs  are supposed to be battling the Philadelphia Phillies for last place, not  first.  </P> <P> The big difference in the Cubs, who improved their record to 6-2 with a 3-2  victory over the St. Louis Cardinals under the lights Wednesday night at  Chicago, is the bullpen.  </P> <P> Mitch Williams came to the rescue of Paul Kilgus with two out in the ninth  inning and recorded his fourth save in as many chances.  </P> <P> Kilgus and Williams were obtained in the deal that sent Rafael Palmeiro and  pitcher Jamie Moyer from Texas.  </P> <P> Kilgus, who has one of the Cubs' defeats, held the Cardinals to six hits and  was working on a shutout going into the ninth.  </P> <P> An error by shortstop Domingo Ramos put Vince Coleman on to open the inning.  Two outs later, Tom Brunansky hit a home run, and Williams was summoned. He  gave up a single to Tony Pena but struck out Jose Oquendo to end it.  </P> <P> It was a disputed strikeout. Umpire Charlie Williams ruled that an inside pitch  tipped Oquendo's bat.  </P> <P> "I didn't hit nothing," Oquendo said. "If I'd tipped it, they would have heard  it."  </P> <P> "I don't overpower anyone," said Kilgus, who started fast for the Rangers last  year but wound up 12-15. "But I don't walk many and I'm always around the  plate."  </P> <P> The Cardinals, who will play their first home game today, are now 2-4 and have  lost another starting pitcher. Scott Terry, hit in the knee by a pitch, had to  leave after three innings when the knee stiffened.  </P> <P> The Cardinals got a strong four innings from young Chris Carpenter in a losing  cause.  </P> <P> " Both Kilgus and Williams have helped get us off to the fast start," Manager  Don Zimmer said. "We didn't have anybody who get get a man out and save a game  last season. It certainly appears we have one now."  </P> <P> Philadelphia 6, Montreal 3 -- The Phillies did not treat their former pal,  Kevin Gross, very well as they improved their record to 6-2 and remained tied  with the Cubs.  </P> <P> Mike Schmidt, Von Hayes and Ron Jones all hit third-inning home runs, and the  Phillies took a 5-0 lead. With Steve Bedrosian in the bullpen, that usually  means victory.  </P> <P> Hayes, who hit only six home runs last season, has four in just eight games  this season. Schmidt hit his third of the year and the 545th of his career.  </P> <P> Cincinnati 3, Houston 1 -- The Dodgers thought that Paul O'Neill didn't hit  against anyone but them. It isn't true.  </P> <P> O'Neill doubled to left-center field to drive in all of the Cincinnati runs in  the ninth inning and give the Reds the victory at Houston.  </P> <P> Rick Rhoden and Larry Andersen held Cincinnati to five hits in eight innings as  the Astros took a 1-0 lead. Bullpen ace Dave Smith took over in the ninth.  </P> <P> His luck was poor. Eric Davis singled and went to third on a two-base error by  first baseman Glenn Davis. Todd Benzinger was given an intentional pass, and  Juan Agosto came in to face O'Neill.  </P> <P> "I was just trying to meet the ball and get a run in," O'Neill said. "I'm just  glad it got through."  </P> <P> Atlanta 5, San Diego 0 -- Tom Glavine held the heavy-hitting Padres to five  hits at San Diego in his second complete-game victory of the season.  </P> <P> In his other start, he held the Dodgers to four hits and an unearned run. Last  season, he led the league in defeats with 17.  </P> <P> Gerald Perry had four of Atlanta's 12 hits, and Dale Murphy homered with a man  aboard in the first inning. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

"We neither want nor can  impose our ideas on Mexican civil society through the use of  force, as does the current government when it imposes its  programs on the country by force," he added. Presidential,  legislative, and municipal elections are scheduled for 21 August.    In this pronouncement, Sub-Commander Marcos stated that  "when  a political and military force (such as the Mexican Federal  Government) asks another political and military force (such as  the EZLN) to hand over its weapons, that means in political and  military terms that it is asking for an unconditional surrender.  In exchange for unconditional surrender, the federal government  is promising what it always does: an internal settling of  accounts, a package of statements, promises, and more  bureaucratic entities," he regretted.    The guerrilla leader added that the call to lay down their  weapons "prompts the most suspicions. The historical lesson in  Mexico and Latin America is that those who surrender their  weapons trusting in the `pardon' of their pursuers winds up shot  dead somewhere by the weapons of any death squad of any  political or ruling faction."    In another communique, the EZLN command called on Mexicans  "to rally" around "the cause of a national revolutionary  movement where there is room for the broadest trends, the most  varied thinking, and different forms of struggle, yet there is  only one aspiration and goal: freedom, democracy, and justice."  "The EZLN calls on Mexicans to take up this cause, not the EZLN  cause, not the cause of an armed struggle, but the cause of what  is the right of every thinking being, the reason of our nation  and understanding of our people: freedom democracy, and  justice," it added.    In its analysis of the current situation, the EZLN command  attributes to civilian society more than to its own actions that  the possibility of dialogue on the problems in Chiapas State has  been achieved with the government. Military actions have not  "been as decisive for this shift in the conflict as have been  the different public demonstrations in the streets, the  mountains, and the news media by the most varied organizations  and honest and independent people who are part of what is called  civilian Mexican society."    The guerrillas affirmed that the uprising was the only path  "left to us," but admitted that "other modes of struggle exist  and are of great value," adding that the steps of all who are  marching with the truth must follow a single path: the one that  leads to freedom, democracy, and justice."</p>

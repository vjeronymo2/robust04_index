			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Royal Bank The equity market never likes to miss a turning point. It seems determined to scent one after Royal Bank of Scotland's 15 per cent increase in full-year operating profits. Management has belatedly recognised the need to cut costs. Though bad debt provisions of Pounds 401m were worse than expected, the theory is that these should decline as economic recovery takes hold. Maybe so, but operating profit is still only 2 per cent up on 1989-90. Royal made the mistake of lending heavily at the peak of the cycle. Now it is saddled with exposure to small and medium-sized corporate borrowers, who may continue to suffer even in recovery. That is not the only ground for caution. One can dismiss the seemingly foolish way in which Royal has parted with nearly a third of group pre-tax profit to Mr Peter Wood, head of its fast-growing Direct Line insurance business. Though large, his Pounds 6m bonus is effectively compensation for ceding his original equity stake. The real danger for the market is in overestimating Direct Line's current contribution. Its Pounds 15m profit pales against total operating profits of Pounds 469m as well as against the possible Pounds 108m claim from the liquidators of Wallace Smith Trust. Royal will struggle to increase its skimpy 2.6 per cent group net margin. Its surplus capital makes the dividend secure even if the latest payment is uncovered. But having too much capital can be unhealthy for a bank, especially one determined to expand aggressively in the US. The proof of that pudding will be in the eating. All in all, yesterday's 4 per cent rise in the shares is stretching things a bit.</p>

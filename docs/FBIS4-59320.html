			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] O sons of beloved Aden; O sons of proud Yemen: The  gang of apostasy and secession, led by the criminal and killer  al-Bid, knows quite well that precious Aden is now within the  range of the rifles of the forces of unity and legitimacy.  However, these forces have noble values and objectives that  stem from their concern about all the sons of our people,  especially the residents of beloved Aden. This is why these  forces would never permit terrorizing the residents of the city  of Aden or any other city.    But this treacherous gang that has abandoned all religious  and moral values is determined to provoke the feelings of our  people and the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy by  striking at residential neighborhoods in the steadfast city of  Sanaa with the missiles of treachery and meanness that have  claimed the lives of many innocent citizens.    However, the gang of the vile killers will never escape the  people's retribution. May God have mercy on the righteous  martyrs, the victims of treachery. It is a true promise to the  sons of our people to take revenge on the killers and their  criminal, cowardly leader al-Bid and all those who advocate  secession and apostasy.</p>

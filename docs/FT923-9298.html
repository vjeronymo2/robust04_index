			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Wickes stages recovery to Pounds 2.6m but passes dividend WICKES, the European DIY chain which teetered on the edge of disaster after diversifying into the timber business, has bounced back into the black recording an interim pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.6m after losses of Pounds 12.9m last time. Sales for the six months to June 30 slipped from Pounds 259m to Pounds 253m, but the company scored operating profits of Pounds 9.4m against losses of Pounds 3.2m last time. The dividend was again passed but Wickes said it would consider paying a final dividend if its full-year results justified it. Earnings per share amounted to 0.7p (5.8p losses). The company's core DIY business, which is tilted towards the trade end of the market, saw very strong growth with UK retail profits improving by 28 per cent while those from continental Europe rose by 32 per cent. Mr Henry Sweetbaum, chairman and chief executive, said the fierce discount war in the DIY sector in the UK had not had a substantial impact on Wickes. 'We had a short blip when it hurt us but it did not last for very long,' he said. He added that Wickes had concentrated on consistent low pricing which, he suggested, contrasted sharply with the sporadic discounting tactics adopted by the other DIY multiples. 'If they say they are going to have a sale on the Saturday then you could fire a shotgun through their stores on a Tuesday and not hit anyone,' he said. Wickes opened eight stores in the UK during the half year and the company said it continued to see considerable opportunities for growth in mainland Europe, especially in France. Losses at the company's Hunter and Malden timber businesses were sharply reduced. 'I think most of the surgery is now over. It is now a question of motivation, drive and the market,' Mr Sweetbaum said. Group debt declined during the half year by Pounds 22.3m and net borrowings at the period end totalled Pounds 84.7m. The interest charge fell from Pounds 9.8m to Pounds 6.8m. There was an extraordinary net gain of Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 2.4m charge) largely resulting from the conversion of the group's remaining Pounds 19m of convertible unsecured loan stock. Lord Sieff of Brimpton, the former chairman of Marks and Spencer, is to retire as a non-executive director. But earlier this week, the company announced the appointment of Mr Michael von Brentano, head of investment banking activities for Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Germany, as a non-executive director. COMMENT Over the past few years Wickes has been through the mangle with a vengeance but is certainly emerging as a leaner, fitter business. Since being saved by a Pounds 42.6m emergency rights issue last year, the company has substantially cut the losses at its timber business and continued to press ahead with its successfully distinctive DIY formula. Wickes is certainly one of the lowest-cost operators in the sector and has been able to derive substantial cost savings from its pan-European sourcing policy. Analysts have scaled back expectations for the full year - because of Wickes's cautious noises about the economy - but are still looking for between Pounds 12m and Pounds 14m. That puts the company on a prospective multiple of 17 with a token dividend also likely to be paid. After gaining much ground following the rights issue, Wickes's shares have fallen heavily in recent months. But its attractions as a recovery play are reviving - at least for those who still believe in recovery.</p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> MACHINISTS UNION VOTES TO STRIKE BOEING  </P> <P> An overwhelming majority of Boeing Co. workers, claiming their work helped make  the aerospace giant No. 1 in the industry, rejected the company's contract as  inadequate and voted to strike. Officials for the International Assn. of  Machinists and Aerospace Workers said about 57,000 members in the Seattle area,  Wichita, Kan., Portland, Ore., and scattered sites across the country voted by  an 85% margin to strike at midnight. The walkout, recommended by union leaders,  will be the first strike against Boeing since 1977. The three-year package  proposed by Boeing calls for a general wage increase -- the first since 1982 --  of 4% the first year and 3% in the second and third years. Meanwhile, the union  said it had agreed to extend its contract with Lockheed Corp. until at least  Oct. 22. The pact had been due to expire Oct. 1, a machinists union spokesman  said.  </P></p>

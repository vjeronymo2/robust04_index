			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMELDA MARCOS FAINTS AT TRIAL, IS HOSPITALIZED;  </P> <P> PHILIPPINES: THE FORMER FIRST LADY COUGHS UP BLOOD FROM GASTRITIS, BUT IS  STABLE. SOURCES SAY SHE HAD CONSIDERED FIRING HER DEFENSE ATTORNEY.  </P> <P> Imelda Marcos, who had spent some of the previous night considering family  advice to dismiss her flamboyant defense attorney, collapsed in a federal  courtroom Thursday morning after coughing up blood and was taken to a hospital.  </P> <P> The former Philippine first lady's condition was listed as stable and not  life-threatening. A hospital spokesman said tests found evidence of erosive  gastritis, or bleeding in the stomach lining.  </P> <P> It was the latest dramatic turn in the fraud and racketeering trial of Mrs.  Marcos, 60, who last month became emotionally distraught on two occasions and  suffered episodes of what her doctors called "dangerously high blood pressure."  </P> <P> On Thursday morning, Mrs. Marcos had appeared for trial after a nearly  sleepless night and over the objections of doctors and some of her attorneys,  who felt she was too ill to proceed.  </P> <P> During the trial session she began to cough into her handkerchief and then  slumped forward in her chair. She was carried out of the courthouse on a  stretcher, wearing an oxygen mask. Dr. David Case, Mrs. Marcos' personal  physician, said she had suffered stomach pains and had vomited blood clots.  </P> <P> The Times has learned that in an informal meeting between lawyers and the judge  prior to Thursday's morning session, Mrs. Marcos' own three-member defense team  apparently disagreed among themselves about whether the trial should be  delayed.  </P> <P> According to one of those present in the robing room of U.S. Dist. Judge John  F. Keenan, the judge asked to speak with Mrs. Marcos privately to assure  himself that she was well enough to proceed, but the request was blocked by her  lead attorney, Wyoming lawyer Gerry Spence.  </P> <P> "Spence said, 'Well, she wants to go on, so we want to go on,' " a source in  the robing room recalled, adding that the decision appeared to trouble other  members of the defense team and the judge.  </P> <P> Mrs. Marcos is being tried on charges that she and her late husband, former  Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos, conspired to buy New York real  estate, art and jewelry with hundreds of millions of dollars looted from their  homeland.  </P> <P> The Times reported in Thursday's editions that a major schism has developed  within the defense camp over Spence's conduct of the case. Members of the  Marcos family have advocated replacing the famous attorney with long-time  Marcos lawyer John Bartko of San Francisco, who has acted as Spence's assistant  throughout the trial.  </P> <P> Mrs. Marcos' collapse, coming barely an hour after other members of the defense  team had shown frustration at Spence's reluctance to press for a delay,  appeared to add to Spence's problems with the family and fellow defense  counsel.  </P> <P> Late Thursday, Mrs. Marcos' condition was reportedly improving at New York  Hospital, where she was expected to remain through the weekend. A hospital  spokesman said that she would be treated with intravenous medication "for  several days" and that the affected area was limited to the lining of the lower  portion of her stomach.  </P> <P> "It could be stress related," conceded Case, who has been treating Mrs. Marcos  for high blood pressure.  </P> <P> For more than a month Mrs. Marcos has been wearing a portable heart monitor,  strapped to her arm, that periodically measures her pulse rate and blood  pressure. Doctors said Thursday's seizure was unrelated to her blood pressure  problems.  </P> <P> Sources close to the family told The Times that Mrs. Marcos had gotten little  sleep Wednesday night, after a series of late-evening conferences with  attorneys, her children and her closest personal advisers to consider various  options -- including replacement of her lead attorney.  </P> <P> Spence had been harshly admonished for 20 minutes on Wednesday by Judge Keenan,  who angrily warned the defense lawyer, in front of the jury, that his courtroom  conduct could conceivably harm his own client. The judge accused Spence of  making "misleading statements in front of the jury," and Keenan appeared to  threaten Spence with contempt action if it happened again.  </P> <P> An apologetic Spence at first moved for a mistrial, then withdrew the motion.  </P> <P> The Wyoming attorney, who is noted for taking on difficult cases, has been  criticized publicly and privately by fellow defense lawyers and Marcos  associates for sometimes seeming unprepared in court or blundering during  witness cross-examinations.  </P> <P> Meetings to assess potential damage to Mrs. Marcos' case after the judge's  angry outburst Wednesday ran late into the night, sources confirmed, and  included private sessions between Mrs. Marcos and her children, Irene and  Ferdinand Jr., who have emerged as strong critics of Spence, sources said.  </P> <P> On Thursday morning, Mrs. Marcos complained of stomach pains. Her blood  pressure also was elevated, and her doctors advised her to stay home.  </P> <P> "But Mrs. Marcos wanted to proceed," Spence told reporters later. "She was  insistent on proceeding. She's a very brave lady. I think she's anxious to get  this trial finished."  </P> <P> It was unclear how her condition would affect the immediate future of the  two-month-old trial that was nearing completion. Prosecutors had predicted  earlier that they would rest their case next Tuesday or Wednesday.  </P> <P> The court was about to take a four-day break even before Mrs. Marcos became  ill. Only one additional prosecution witness was scheduled to appear when court  was to resume next week. The defense case, which is expected to be brief, was  scheduled to begin immediately after the prosecution finished.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Robert Shaheen -- a long-time aide to co-defendant Adnan Khashoggi  -- had just been cross-examined by Spence when, about 60 minutes into the  morning session, Mrs. Marcos suddenly began to vomit blood and then fainted. As  she crumpled in her chair, her head fell forward and banged down on the defense  table, causing people in the audience to gasp.  </P> <P> Attorney Benjamin Cassiday of Hawaii, who had earlier advised Keenan in the  robing room that Mrs. Marcos was ill, was sitting next to her when she  collapsed and tried to assist aides who rushed up from the audience to help.  </P> <P> "She didn't say anything. She was gagging on her own blood," Cassiday said. He  told reporters later that Mrs. Marcos had "been looking awful all morning."  </P> <P> Keenan immediately excused the jury and then cleared the courtroom, after which  Mrs. Marcos was given oxygen and taken by stretcher to an ambulance.  </P> <P> Rempel is a Times staff writer; Luz is a Philippine journalist.  </P></p>

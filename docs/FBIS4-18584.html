			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] It has been announced that Turkey has been  extending electrical power aid to northern Iraq since 3 April.  Speaking at his weekly news conference, Foreign Ministry  spokesman Ferhat Ataman said that Turkey has been supplying the  region with 20 megawatts of power by using the lines between  Silopi and Zakho. He recalled that the Iraqi Administration has  not been able to supply the Province of Dahuk with power since  last August. We have taken this step to temporarily solve the  problem confronting the Iraqi people, he said.    Ataman stressed that this aid should be assessed within the  framework of the humanitarian aid Turkey extends to Iraq. It is  important, he said, for the Iraqi Government to recreate the  conditions whereby it can supply power to the region.    According to information supplied by the Foreign Ministry  spokesman, the Turkish Red Crescent extended a total of 7,098  tonnes of food to 1,007,955 persons in Dahuk, Irbil, and  Sulaymaniyah during the past six months.</p>

			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Ask Not What Your Country Can Do for You: The U.S. government's new song "Wait  for Me" may not be on the pop charts yet, but people all over Nigeria are  singing along: "Dis tin them call love / na serious affair / make you think  well / before you gree," the song says in pidgin English. Translation: "This  thing they call love is a serious affair.  </P> <P> Think well before you agree." That's the population control message the Agency  for International Development is trying to get across all over the Third World,  where the agency is sponsoring similar songs in languages from West African  pidgin to Philippine Tagalog. The Nigerian hit was recorded by King Sunny Ade,  known in West Africa for a style called ju-ju, and Onyeku Onwenu. Ade has three  wives and 12 children. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

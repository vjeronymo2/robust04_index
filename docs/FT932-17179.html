			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News in Brief: Suchard takes Dollars 5m Polish stake JACOBS SUCHARD, the Swiss confectionery group owned by Philip Morris, has agreed to pay Dollars 5m for an 80 per cent share in the Olza factory, a chocolate wafer producer in southern Poland, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. The agreement, signed yesterday, includes a commitment for immediate investments in the plant worth Dollars 11.3m and to spend a further Dollars 15m at a later date. Olza's had sales last year of Dollars 24m, of which 15 per cent was exported. The purchase is Jacobs Suchard's first investment in Poland after it had a factory it owned in Krakow nationalised in the 1940s. The company has, however, been marketing its coffee and chocolate products there for the past two years. The disposal comes as a question mark continues to hang over Philip Morris's efforts to purchase the Krakow tobacco factory in a deal which could be worth in excess of Dollars 400m. Philip Morris has had its Marlboro cigarettes made in Krakow under a co-operation agreement since the early 1970s. Recently, the Sejm, (upper house of parliament) passed a resolution calling on the government to maintain a state monopoly in the tobacco and alcohol sectors. However, the privatisation ministry is still hoping to get the resolution reinterpreted to allow the purchase to go ahead.</p>

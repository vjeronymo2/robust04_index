			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> AT ITS BEST, IT'S DECADENTLY GOOD HEALTH FOOD  </P> <P> Health food chefs, listen up:  </P> <P> First learn how to cook, OK? Then subtract whatever evil ingredients your  theories tell you to. But not before you know what you're doing. The other way  -- deciding on the OK ingredients and then throwing them together in different  ways, is why health food restaurants serve such a stunted, disfigured sort of  cuisine.  </P> <P> It's not as if you had to invent health food cooking from scratch.  Vegetarianism, for instance, has been practiced for centuries by many Hindus  and Buddhists. They made most of their gastronomic mistakes a long time ago.  </P> <P> Go then and learn from them. Go to the Fragrant Vegetable Chinese Vegetarian  Restaurant in Monterey Park.  </P> <P> Or go to the new Fragrant Vegetable on the Westside, which, like the original,  has a color scheme of peaceful green but is more luxurious and restaurant-like.  Instead of simple Buddhist devotional art, there are fine wooden sculptures of  the Eight Drunken Immortals of Chinese folklore.  </P> <P> Anyhow, behold what can be done with vegetables. Instead of slovenly soyburgers  or nutburgers, the Fragrant Vegetable makes vegetarian "meats" from tofu or  wheat gluten that match the consistency of meat almost perfectly. Often the  flavor is fairly close, but even when it's not, it's at least pleasant.  </P> <P>  -- --  </P> <P> In the plate of cold appetizers, the lemon chicken is uncannily like chicken  skin, the roast pork could almost be pork, and the spicy beef (heavy on the  star anise) at least tastes good.  </P> <P> Meat, and sometimes fish, is mimicked in even stranger ways. "Mashed taro fish"  is taro mashed with some other pureed vegetables and arranged in the shape of a  fish. Scales are drawn on; a pea represents the eye. The effect is a lot like  deep-fried mashed potatoes with a less floury texture. And "Peking ribs" do  not, in truth, taste or even look a whole lot like sweet and sour spareribs,  but they are very good: pecans ("Peking" is a pun, see) in sweet and sour sauce  with pineapple chunks.  </P> <P> Even better than the mock meats are the mushroom dishes and wilder non-animal  edibles. For instance, the centerpiece of Buddha's cushions, a dish that  includes mushrooms and spinach, is made up of the cushions themselves: thin  sheets of tofu wrapped around a substance called black moss. It has an  unforgettable rich, loamy aroma, not blamelessly vegetable-like at all but like  some strange, long-stewed meat.  </P> <P> And for my money, the best dessert on the menu is white fungus and coconut  soup, which the kitchen will prepare for four or more people. This is slightly  sweet coconut milk -- actually a soup, served hot -- with a noble white fungus  floating in the middle like a Spanish caravel. The stuff looks like a  disembodied brain from outer space, but it has a pleasant, extremely delicate  flavor and a wonderful texture, crunchy without being crisp.  </P> <P>  -- --  </P> <P> There are, however, dishes that could be served in any Chinese restaurant and  be worthy of notice. I'm thinking of things like string beans in hot bean  sauce, actually Sichuan beans, I'd say. Even apart from the entertaining idea  of beans served in bean sauce, they're perfectly delicious; the black bean  sauce is hot, sour and garlicky -- unless, of course, you ask that garlic be  omitted.  </P> <P> Incidentally, the Fragrant Vegetable serves fixed-price lunches, not only the  sort of dishes found on its regular menu but also vegetarian versions of  conventional Chinese dishes like twice-cooked pork (better for texture than  taste) and a variety of noodle dishes. I've tried the fried broad rice noodle  Malaysian style and found it had a nice curry sauce, plus bell pepper, sprouts,  green onion and vegetarian "pork" in it.  </P> <P> It also had bits of egg, and so does the fried rice, because people expect egg  in such dishes; those who don't eat eggs should ask that they be omitted.  </P> <P> Recommended dishes: cold appetizers, $5.25; Buddha's cushions, $8.95; string  beans with hot sauce, $6.95; white fungus and coconut soup, $5.50.  </P> <P>  Fragrant Vegetable Restaurant, 11859 Wilshire Blvd., West Los Angeles.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] </F>   [Text] Vladikavkaz April 29 TASS -- Russian President Boris  Yeltsin intends to take part in the celebrations on the occasion  of the 220th anniversary of Ossetia's voluntary joining of  Russia and the 210th anniversary of the foundation of the city  of Vladikavkaz. This was reported by President of North Ossetia  Akhsarbek Galazov at his meeting with members of the Presidiums  of the Supreme Soviet and the Government of the republic, and  heads of the local self- government.    Akhsarbek Galazov said the Russian president stressed that  these memorable dates in the life of the multinational people of  North Ossetia should be widely celebrated in the Russian  Federation.    "I informed Boris Yeltsin of the situation in the zone under  state of emergency, the talks between the presidents and  official delegations of North Ossetia and Ingushetia which began  in the city of Nalchik on the initiative of the leadership of  North Ossetia, and the concrete steps being made by the Ossetian  side for the stabilization of the situation in the region," the  president of North Ossetia noted.    Akhsarbek Galazov also met with Russian Prime Minister  Viktor  Chernomyrdin with whom he discussed a wide range of issues  concerning the economic and social development of North Ossetia.    Speaking on the results of the closed meeting of the  Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of the Russian  Federation which considered the situation in the zone under  state of emergency, Akhsarbek Galazov said that he categorically  rejected the idea of the establishment of federal ruling in the  Prigorodnyy district. He believes that this is a deadlock  situation which may lead to a new tragedy in North Caucasus.  The main direction in the settlement of relations between the  peoples of North Ossetia and Ingushetia must be peaceful  negotiations.    According to the president of North Ossetia, it is necessary  to continue the talks with the Ingush side. "The dialogue  between the presidents of North Ossetia and Ingushetia, and  official delegations of the two republics is yet another step on  the road to peace and accord, and the possibility to untie a  tight knot of problems," Akhsarbek Galazov pointed out.    The date of the third round of talks in Nalchik is due to be  fixed by the working groups of the two republics.</p>

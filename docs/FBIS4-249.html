			<p>BFN     [Text] The Mozambican Government and the Mozambique  National Resistance [Renamo] have rejected accusations by Africa  Watch, a human rights organization, that they are hindering the  mine removal program by failing to ensure the functioning of  mechanisms created in terms of the General Peace Accord.    Labor Minister Teodato Hunguana has said Africa Watch's  accusations are an attempt to avoid pointing fingers at those  responsible for the failure to implement the mine removal  program.    In a communique issued in Washington last weekend, Africa  Watch blamed the Mozambican Government, Renamo, and the United  Nations for the failure to remove mines that have already  claimed some 10,000 lives.</p>

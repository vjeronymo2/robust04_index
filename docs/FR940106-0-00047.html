			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of the commenters believe that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain of our proposed changes at &sect;&sect;421.124 and 421.203  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are unnecessary. Those changes would allow the Secretary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take adverse action if an intermediary or carrier exceeds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the amount the Secretary finds to be reasonable and adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to meet the costs which must be incurred by an efficiently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and economically operated intermediary or carrier,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notwithstanding whether the intermediary or carrier meets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the published criteria and standards. Both the intermediary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and carrier contracts currently have a provision to allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary to request a committee of the contractors to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assist in efforts to effect improvements in the high cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contractor's performance. In addition, the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contractor Performance Evaluation Program (CPEP) contains  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures on contractor costs. If a contractor fails to meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the applicable criteria, its CPEP score is reduced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We do not agree that the proposed changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are unnecessary. This section of the regulation would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorize us to take adverse action for deficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance of a function not specifically evaluated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CPEP. Currently, CPEP only measures contractor performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in meeting the approved budget and the contractor's relative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standing among similar contractors. Moreover, beginning in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FY 1993, CPEP eliminated the concept of passing/failing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overall evaluation. Passing/failing now is determined on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard by standard basis. For example, if a contractor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fails to meet the approved budget, it will fail one standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in CPEP, not the entire CPEP. Thus, despite CPEP, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority to take adverse contract action against high cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermediaries and carriers is necessary. As the commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> note, current contracts allow the Secretary to request a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committee of the contractors to assist in efforts to effect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improvements in the high cost contractor's performance. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulatory change allows us to take the next  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> logical step in the event efforts to effect improvement have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failed. We will have authority to take adverse action based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on continued high cost performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters stressed that the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;421.124 and &sect;421.203 were vague. They asked that HCFA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further define ``reasonable'' amount, and how and when high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost would be calculated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We believe that the provisions at &sect;421.124  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and &sect;421.203 are clear and straightforward. It is our  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility to consider the funding levels that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable and adequate to meet the costs incurred by an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiently and economically operated contractor. To  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address this responsibility, we develop unit cost targets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for each contractor prior to the start of every fiscal year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These unit cost targets are forwarded to the HCFA regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offices as part of the Budget and Performance Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (BPRs) package and represent the benchmark for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negotiations between the regional offices and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contractors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

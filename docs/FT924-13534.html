			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Uphill struggle for the labour market: Jobless totals may not peak until 1995 THE recent surge in announcements of job losses from some of Britain's best-known companies has renewed speculation about when, and at what level, unemployment will reach its peak. As recently as two months ago, government economists were confident that unemployment would not touch 3m. That now seems highly optimistic. Many independent economists now say unemployment will peak at just over 3m - a little under 11 per cent of the workforce - at the end of next year or early in 1994. Some are more pessimistic, suggesting that the growth in unemployment will not cease until 1995. Confusion over the government's economic policy, in particular over movements in interest rates, makes it difficult for economists to forecast when unemployment will start to fall. The worst-case scenario of Ernst &amp; Young's Item Club - a forecasting body that uses the Treasury's economic model - sees an early return to the European exchange rate mechanism and tighter monetary policy. That might delay the recovery, in which case unemployment is projected to peak at about 3.6m in 1995. Even in that scenario, the lag between a resumption of growth and and a turnround in unemployment is expected to be shorter than it was in the early 1980s. When the economy started to emerge from recession in early 1981, the jobless level continued to rise until 1986, when it peaked at a rate of 11 per cent. This time, economists expect the lag to be much shorter. They argue that reforms affecting the labour market have created a much swifter link between a fall in output and a rise in unemployment, and conversely between an increase in output and a fall in unemployment. Another influence that should help to shorten the unemployment lag is demographic. Between 1981 and 1985, the working population was growing at an average of 200,000 a year as a result of the 1960s baby boom. Between 1991 and 1995 the working population will grow at only 20,000 a year. Recent announcements of further big job losses in the manufacturing sector have led to fears that there has been an acceleration in the trend growth rate of the jobless total from 30,000 a month. Mr John Philpott, director of the Employment Policy Institute, the independent think tank, says: 'It seems that a lot of employers were holding back over the summer, waiting to see what would happen to the economy. As the recovery still appears to be a long way off, employers have embarked on another round of big redundancies.' Apart from the most recent British Coal announcement this week, many of the recent cuts have hit the south-east disproportionately hard. The defence and electronics industries - such as those at British Aerospace - appear to have taken the brunt of recent cuts and both have a strong presence in the south-east. According to the latest survey by Hay Management Consultants on the distribution of job losses across the UK as a whole, the manufacturing, engineering and service sectors have suffered worst. But Mr David Fell, economist at Business Strategies, the economics consultancy, says that although unemployment is rising fastest in the south-east and the south-west, the level was lower in those regions at the start of the recession. Nevertheless he believes that regional differences in unemployment rates will be smaller in the future. However, the overall rates being predicted by Business Strategies for the mid 1990s look frighteningly high. It sees rates of above 10 per cent for every region apart from Wales and East Anglia, with the south-west at 15.3 per cent, the west Midlands at 14.4 per cent, and the north-west at 14 per cent. The recent devaluation of sterling might help those companies producing for export or in competition with imports, but it may take some time to show. Government economists point to the fact that even before the pound came out of the ERM on September 16, unit labour costs were growing at about the same rate as those of the UK's main competitors. So, in spite of the recent acceleration in unemployment, there is one ray of hope. The devaluation of sterling will give exporters a costs benefit, enabling them to expand market share, which should eventually boost employment.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [EC Document No. DOC/PESC/94/36: "Declaration by the </F> European Union on Rwanda"]    [Text] The European Union [EU] notes with dismay that the  widespread violence and atrocities are continuing and extending  in Rwanda, where very many lives have been lost since 6 April  1994.    The violence and the resulting chaos prompted the forced  evacuation of virtually all nationals of the international  community present in Rwanda.    As a result of the solidarity shown by member states, it was  possible to rescue those nationals in a satisfactory manner.    The EU repeats its pressing call for Rwandese lives to be  protected, and urgently appeals to the opposing forces to bring  the violence to an end and to resume negotiations on the basis  of the principles in the Arusha agreement.    It wishes to see appropriate humanitarian action organized  in  response to the human tragedy unfolding in the region, and  undertakes to play its part in such action.</p>

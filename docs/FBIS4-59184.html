			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 11, IRNA -- A morning English daily here  Wednesday [11 May] said that Washington's charges against Iran  and six other countries on supporting terrorist groups was only  meant to divert world public opinion from its own activities.    Commenting on the publication of a report by the U.S. in  which seven third world countries have been introduced as main  supporters of terrorism, the `TEHRAN TIMES' wrote in its  editorial that a brief look would reveal that all the seven  countries were those that were not prepared to give in to the  American global superpower role, and opposed Washington's  expansionist policies.    The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was the greatest  center  for training terrorists, and coup d'etats and assassinations  have been among the basic components of American foreign policy  in the decades after World War II, argued the paper.    It concluded by saying that the relations between the  American government and the terrorist groups was an "undeniable"  fact.</p>

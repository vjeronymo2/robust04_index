			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Krivov, leader of Kremlin group of </F> experts, by Stanislav Stremidlovskiy; place and date not given:  "Who Gets Poor Marks for Prompting the President?"]    [Text] Quite honestly, I find it hard to recall instances  when Russian President Boris Yeltsin has not been rebuked for  unexpected decisions which he has discussed with no one. The  president adopts an edict, and the interested top officials at  once spread their hands: We did not know about this, nobody  told us anything. Or: Did he consult with anyone at all?...    Back in the times of the USSR Boris Yeltsin, not yet  president, was approached by two people -- Igor Vasilyevich Nit  and Pavel Alekseyevich Medvedev, professors at Moscow State  University -- who proposed setting up a group of expert  economists. It was then that they reached agreement on the  rules: They would always tell Yeltsin the truth, and he would  always be ready to listen to them. Some staffers, postgraduates  of the Department of Mathematical Methods of Analyzing the  Economy at Moscow State University, and scientists from the  Academy of Sciences came along with Nit and Medvedev. At first  they worked on a purely voluntary basis. But now the group of  experts is accommodated in the Kremlin. Last year Igor Nit, its  founder, passed away, and Viktor Krivov acts as the group's  leader. We put our first question to him.    [Stremidlovskiy] You are an expert. Please assess how Boris  Nikolayevich adopts decisions.    [Krivov] Although the president is frequently accused of  adopting decisions hurriedly, in actual fact the overwhelming  majority of them are carefully worked out. How competent the  advisers and specialists to whom the president turns are is  another matter. I will point out that Yeltsin endeavors to  obtain at least two viewpoints on each question.    [Stremidlovskiy] How capable is Boris Yeltsin of taking on  board information which is unpleasant to him?    [Krivov] A difficult question. Of course, the president is  a man of character, and he knows how to get angry. And yet he  is a man with a very strong will, and so he is able to suppress  emotions.    [Stremidlovskiy] Has it ever happened that your opinion and  Boris Nikolayevich's opinion on some questions have differed?    [Krivov] Yes. For example, with regard to the "500 Days"  program. We were categorically against it in our conclusion and  emphasized that this plan did not correspond at all to the  country for which it was being written.    [Stremidlovskiy] At what percentage do you estimate your  influence over Yeltsin?    [Krivov] There is still a very serious problem here. It was  one thing that Igor Nit, our late leader, exerted real  influence. We have not yet attained such weight....    [Stremidlovskiy] How frequently does the president consult  with your group?    [Krivov] This happens most frequently now through the  president's aides -- Ilyushin, Korabelshchikov, Sukhanov. Or  through political consultants.    [Stremidlovskiy] Many people today believe that the  president is dealing less with the government now....    [Krivov] He is doing this deliberately. When Yeltsin headed  the government, he dealt with it. Now there is a prime minister  whom the president trusts. But control over the course of the  reforms is still retained. Every Tuesday there are one-to-two  hour meetings between Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin, at which  fundamental aspects of the government's work are discussed.    [Stremidlovskiy] Viktor Dmitriyevich, why, in your view,  did the president accept the resignations of Gaydar and Fedorov?    [Krivov] In our country the concept "reformer" is like a  label. But essentially.... It is important at some stage  resolutely to break what is old, while at another time it is  time to engage in building.    Whereas in 1990 Yeltsin's victory was linked with the fact  that he had geared himself to the enterprise directors, today  entrepreneurs have appeared. Therefore it is obvious that the  next government must be a government of entrepreneurs. The only  entrepreneur whom I know is Chernomyrdin. His presence in the  Cabinet of Ministers serves to guarantee the transformations'  continuation.    But the actions of members of the previous government  frequently resembled the actions of people dropped by parachute  into a foreign country.    [Stremidlovskiy] But Chernomyrdin's present cabinet is  called a government of "red directors...."    [Krivov] I believe that the directors are no longer the same  now. Essentially, each of them has become an entrepreneur.  They have large accounts in Western banks, and they seek  contracts. But, believe me, more serious problems exist in the  economy than "red directors."    [Stremidlovskiy] Which ones?    [Krivov] Owing to the inefficiency of our economy, our  prices, particularly those for raw materials, exceed world  prices. The saddest thing is that just a few people understand  the significance of this problem -- only Chernomyrdin.    We will have nothing with which to buy imported consumer  goods, which we import now.    We still have six months in which we can use administrative  methods to make the railroad carry freight more cheaply, at a  loss to itself. To make energy workers also trade at a loss to  themselves. But during this time we will prepare the  foundations for the structural restructuring of the Russian  economy.    [Stremidlovskiy] It turns out that additional loads will be  imposed on the sinking budget -- from here it is one step to  hyperinflation....    [Krivov] Inflation is, of course, a serious matter. But the  fact that enterprises are now coming to a halt is no less a  problem. Closing our eyes to this trend means getting a  seething, mutinous country in a few months' time....</p>

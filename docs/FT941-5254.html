			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Container venture to boost Indian exports Morteo, Europe's largest manufacturer of containers, has agreed a joint venture with India aimed at increasing India's food exports. The company, which is based in Genoa, Italy, signed a deal at the weekend with the Indian conglomerate, Dalmia-Mittal, to produce 10,000 refrigerated containers a year at a Bombay factory due to open next year. Morteo said it would invest a total of Dollars 20m in the container factory which will be the biggest in India and have an annual turnover of about Dollars 70m. Forty per cent of the new company, Morteo Transfreight Reefer Container, will be quoted on the Bombay stock exchange from October. The venture will receive government aid through the Industrial Development Bank of India. The project is the first in India for Morteo, which was privatised by the state holding group Iritecna a year ago, and has a strong presence in China. India is a big exporter of vegetables and fish and aims to increase its annual usage of refrigerated containers from 15,000 units to 50,000 over the next two years. Until now industry has relied on containers arriving empty at Indian ports.</p>

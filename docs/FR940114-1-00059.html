			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> School bus-related crashes result in fatalities not only to occupants of school buses and other vehicles, but also to pedestrians. Pedestrians accounted for 28 percent of the total school bus-related fatalities from 1986 through 1990. In crashes involving school buses during that period, an average of 38 pedestrians were fatally injured each year, with 72 percent being struck by the bus, while the remaining 28 percent were struck by another vehicle. Approximately 75 percent of pedestrian fatalities involving school buses from 1986&hyph;1990 were of school age (less than 20 years of age); of these, approximately 69 percent were struck by the bus. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The National Safety Council reports that during the 1989&hyph;1990 school year, most of these pedestrian fatalities involved individuals who were either approaching or leaving a loading zone and that more than half of the pupil pedestrian victims were struck by the school bus which they were boarding or exiting. The National Academy of Science's Special Report No. 222, ``School Bus Safety,'' (1989) states that injuries received at bus stops tend to be more severe than injuries received on board a bus. The report also states that, as pedestrians, children between the ages of five and six are particularly vulnerable and account for more than one-half of the young pedestrians fatally injured by school buses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> School bus crashes have a much different effect on the population as a whole than automobile crashes. When a child is fatally injured in a school bus crash there is a greater sense of loss and a greater sense of tragedy. For this reason, school bus fatalities and crashes often receive a high degree of public attention and draw an immediate and passionate response from the community. However, the number of fatalities in school bus crashes is small, particularly when considering exposure and when compared to the number of fatalities related to other priority programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1991, passenger cars were involved in 82.8 percent of all traffic crashes and 67.9 percent of all fatal crashes; whereas school buses were involved in only 0.4 percent of all traffic crashes and in 0.3 percent of all fatal crashes. These data demonstrate that the safety problem related to school buses is not great when compared to that of other types of vehicles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Have Effective School Bus Safety Measures Been Developed? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although statistics demonstrate that school buses already provide a remarkably safe form of transportation, the agency has taken steps to further improve school bus safety. At the request of Congress, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) studied school bus safety to determine which safety measures would be ``most effective'' in protecting school children while boarding, exiting and riding in school buses. (See, ``Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987,'' Pub. L. 100&hyph;17, 204(a), 101 Stat. 219, April 2, 1987.) In May 1989, the National Research Council (NRC), an agency of the NAS, issued a report entitled ``Improving School Bus Safety,'' Special Report No. 222. The report confirmed the high level of safety provided by the Nation's school bus fleet, and also suggested measures that could further improve the safety of school buses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the 1987 law, NHTSA reviewed the findings of the NAS report and, on July 13, 1989, published a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (54 FR 29629), in which the agency determined which safety measures would be most effective in protecting the safety of school children while boarding, exiting and riding in school buses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA found replacing pre-1977 school buses to be a ``most effective'' measure, because of the higher level of crashworthiness provided by NHTSA's 1977 school bus standards, the improved mirror systems, and other crash avoidance measures typically provided on newer school buses. The agency also found prohibiting standees on school buses to be a ``most effective'' measure. In addition, NHTSA found a number of measures which address the safety of children while boarding or exiting the bus to be ``most effective.'' They include equipping new buses with stop signal arms and cross-view mirrors and implementing student crossing, pedestrian safety education and school bus driver training programs. NHTSA also identified a number of measures as ``effective.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency took several steps to encourage the adoption of these ``effective'' and ``most effective'' measures. In FY's 1990 and 1991, NHTSA set aside, in accordance with provisions in the Highway Safety Act of 1987 (Title II, Pub. L. 100&hyph;17), funds to assist the States in implementing these school bus safety measures. The funds were used by States on measures that had been designated by NHTSA to be either ``effective'' or ``most effective'' in improving school bus safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, NHTSA conducted a number of rulemaking actions to upgrade the agency's school bus safety standards. For example, NHTSA issued a final rule on May 3, 1991, requiring new school buses manufactured after September 1, 1992, to be equipped with a stop signal arm (56 FR 20363); a final rule on November 2, 1992, revising the minimum requirements for school bus emergency exits and improving access to school bus emergency doors (57 FR 49413); and a final rule on December 2, 1992, requiring that school buses enable drivers to see, either directly or through mirrors, certain specified areas in front of and along both sides of the buses (57 FR 57000). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, as stated previously, in a final rule dated October 4, 1991, NHTSA and FHWA expanded the list of National Priority programs areas, which are eligible for section 402 funding using an expedited process, to include Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety. The agencies considered the problem of school bus-related pedestrian fatalities when they decided to add Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety to the list of priority programs, and specifically stated, in the final rule, that programs designed to prevent these fatalities are within the scope of this new priority program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

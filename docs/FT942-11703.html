			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Reuters active News and financial information group Reuters Holdings was the most significant casualty in the basket of leading UK stocks as a large trade added to pressure on the shares following weekend press comment. Dealers said the shares were restrained in early dealing in reaction to negative comment in the Sunday press. Then, in mid morning, securities house James Capel found a buyer and a seller for 2.3m shares and crossed the block at 513p. Also, the SEAQ trading screen showed a block of 4m shares traded at 515p on the official close. News that Liffe and the DTB, the UK and German futures exchanges were in final negotiations over Globex, Reuters derivatives product, came too late to prevent the shares falling 24 1/2 to 507p on exceptionally heavy turnover of 13m.</p>

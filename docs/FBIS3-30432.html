			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Dragan Djuric: "To the Last German Mark"] </F>   [Text] The debate on the set of acts by which the program  of reconstruction of the monetary system has been brought into  operation was held in a half-empty conference hall of the  Assembly. Thanks to the deputies of the Democratic Party of  Socialists [DPS], the hall was filled only during the voting.  This time, the quorum was ensured in time, and all 11 acts have  been adopted without any major problems. Even Federal Prime  Minister Radoje Kontic performed his role of a cog in the voting  machinery honestly, making no efforts to help his republican  colleague and party comrade [Milo Djukanovic] in the  argumentation and defense of the program, the main supporter of  which is actually Kontic himself. It seems as though the  silence of the DPS during the hot debate on the latest  anti-inflation program was calculated. The entire activity of  the ruling party's deputies boiled down to occasional attempts  to irritate the opposition. This time it is the party's  professional, Milutin Ojdanic, who was particularly active in  such attempts, together with the usual Beba Dzakovic and Danilo  Vuksanovic.  <H5>  Prime Minister in Clinch </H5>   [Montenegrin] Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic was not  particularly convincing. Which is no wonder. It is difficult  for anybody, except Sveto Marovic, to talk convincingly about  something that he or she does not believe in. As for the  long-term effects of Avramovic's program, nobody intelligent --  except, perhaps, Professor Mile Markovic -- believes in them.  While he was retelling the contents of that program, he  irresistibly reminded us of the good old days when he elaborated  the party doctrine in communities. The DPS deputies did not  react to the competent expert and political remarks by the  opposition to the proposed program. They left Djukanovic to  fight alone. The prime minister was courageously getting into a  clinch, but it was also clear to him that he was giving a  lecture on a very general topic.    Basically, the game was quite clear. The authorities were  making efforts to use the Assembly as a cover, and to water down  the responsibility for the imminent failure of the program by  telling stories about a political consensus. Thus the members  of the opposition were told in advance that it would be resented  if the program failed to succeed as a result of their  obstruction.    Milos Radulovic clarified the meaning vividly. When  engineers plan a plane, it will certainly fly, which cannot be  said for the planning of economic programs. And that is  precisely because of the limitations that cannot be influenced  by the government, since they are brought about by people and  their conduct. Such a mechanism for creating enemies did not  remain unrecognized. Though everybody competed in exposing this  mechanism, still, the most convincing were populists and  liberals. "The ruling party cannot demand our absolute and  unconditional support for the program, and if that support fails  to come, to declare us traitors," Dragan Soc said.    "The program is yours, you adopted it without asking for our  opinion, and you are implementing it without our participation."  The radicals were less eye-catching this time. They did not  demand any consciousness-raising [osvestavanje] regarding the  program this time.    The populists tried to refrain from any detailed discussion,  and to toss the hot potato of responsibility into the hands of  the DPS. Their general attitude is: "Why did you not adopt this  program earlier? May the ruling party take all the credit for  the program if it succeeds, but if it fails, it ought to take  the consequences." Misko Vukovic took upon himself to explain  the populists' unprincipledness by asking: "How could the party  whose minister in the Federal Government, that is the actual  architect of the program, is in charge of one of the most  important departments -- employment and social care -- how could  that party possibly dissociate itself from the program? In  response, Djukanovic made efforts to show the people that the  People's Party is unprepared to responsibly take part in dealing  with the burden that the current period is bringing about.  <H5>  Refreshment of Mind </H5>   The liberals tried the impossible, to force the DPS into  assuming responsibility for the implementation of the program:  "If the program fails, can you, gentlemen from the DPS, bind  your fate to it, and will you, in that, case announce early  democratic elections?" "The DPS is ready to assume the  responsibility, because the program has been elaborated by  experts, and it has won, if not an absolute, then a dominant  support of the economic intelligentsia of this country,"  Djukanovic responded.    Nevertheless, the Montenegrin prime minister put the key  responsibility for the implementation of the program on the  National Bank of Yugoslavia and the Office for Monetary Traffic  [Sluzba za platni promet] that are supposed to protect the  program from misuse. Petrovic's polemics referred to the  elections: "All your projects have failed. If I had been you,  I would have resigned as early as after the first failure, while  you, you do not even allow elections after so many failures."  The leader of the liberals adequately disturbed the atmosphere  in the Assembly by efforts to refresh the memory of the regime  representatives, reminding them of their countless "optimistic  starts." The essence of his performance would be: Montenegro  is looking more and more like Enver Hoxha's Albania because of  the projects are based on great deceptions, while the latest  program regarding the super-dinar is actually a super-swindle, a  preparation for the introduction of a state of emergency.    Djukanovic made sure that each question received a proper  answer. He connected the liberals with the odious West "that is  mercilessly starving our children," and thereby "morally  identified" the liberals' treason, as the, this time, quite  reticent Marovic would say. However, in polemics, one  frequently blurts out some quite important things. Djukanovic  maintained that the lifting of the sanctions does not depend  solely on Yugoslavia, and even explained that the government  elaborated the program because it can no longer wait for the  international community to recognize its mistake and lift the  sanctions!? The Montenegrin prime minister also explained that  the program actually means a return to the elementary economic  alphabet, which will do away with the sweet illusion of the  primary issue of money. Still, while saying that, he forgot his  own statement that it is precisely the government that  (independently from the elementary economic alphabet)  consciously and deliberately went for that sweet illusion, and  functioned with it quite well for a long time.    The social-democrats were particularly straightforward in  their critique of the program. Zarko Rakcevic pointed out that  everybody is aware of the necessity of endorsing such a program,  since the further rise of the inflationary spiral will lead  directly into an abyss. The cut was inevitable, but the  question is still open: Whether it was a real cut, and whether  it was made in the right place. The real causes of the existing  situation are in the sphere of politics, and they cannot be  eliminated by an economic program. Therefore the ruling party is  wrong when it claims that the program has no alternative. It  has, but for that alternative one has to change the trend in  politics. The planned expansion of the monetary union to both  Krajinas [in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina] means, actually,  financing the war in a different way. "Such a manifestation of  imperialistic policy will not find any support abroad," Rakcevic  said. The crucial problem that exists in the program is the  deficit of the public spending. The possibilities for that  deficit to be really covered are quite unclear and doubtful.  The fear that the pressure might be so great that in two months  the printing of fake money would start again is quite justified  as it happens, some extraordinary measures can be expected.  "Let us not allow the last remaining reserves of the citizens  to be exhausted in a fruitless battle," Dragisa Burzan warned.  <H5>  Disobedient Dealers </H5>   All in all, the opposition acted as an opposition, while the  authorities acted as authorities. For the Montenegrin political  circumstances even that is a considerable step forward. The  program has been adopted without the accord of the opposition,  who made great efforts, particularly the liberals and the  social-democrats, to state their own views of how to get out  from the civilizational blind alley. The way out is in a change  of the overall political atmosphere. "It is necessary that  Montenegro finally and resolutely dissociates itself from the  policy of violently tailoring and destroying our former  fatherland, and that the authorities finally stop disintegrating  the state-making and national being of its people, and  disturbing the cultural, religious, and national balance that  has always existed in this part of the world," Dragan Ivancevic  said.    Regardless of certain interpretations of the program that  allege it is to buy time for the government, the set of 11  taxation laws, by which the implementation of the program  (regarding public revenues, employment, contributions to  welfare, the tax on profit, the tax on property, the tax on  citizens' incomes, the turnover tax, the tax on private firms)  has been brought into operation, was adopted in a very short  time.    That same evening, with the Assembly debate still going on,  the street dealers in Podgorica were already exchanging 10  German marks for 11 super-dinars.</p>

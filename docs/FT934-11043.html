			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Inflation rate may exceed official 4% target, Bank warns THE BANK of England warned yesterday that inflation will rise in the months ahead, with a 'slight possibility' that it will briefly exceed the government's 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range in the first half of 1994. The forecast, in the bank's latest quarterly Inflation Report, helps explain recent statements by Mr Eddie George, the Bank governor, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, damping expectations of an early cut in bank base rates from 6 per cent. The report also made clear that interest rates will not have to increase to offset any short-term rise in inflation next year, provided the higher price level does not push wages higher. The expected acceleration of inflation in 1994 will largely reflect the impact of higher indirect taxes and changes to local authority taxes, announced in the March Budget. Indeed, the Bank appeared to give a green light to further tax rises in the November 30 Budget. It urged the government to take action that would steadily reduce the Budget deficit. That, it said, was crucial to sustaining the credibility of the government's anti-inflationary policies. 'It needs to be understood,' it said, 'that one-off boosts to the level of prices, for instance, from higher indirect taxes, do not mean any slackening of anti-inflationary policy, and should not be regarded as permanent increases in the underlying rate of inflation.' Mr George and Mr Clarke will meet today for confidential discussions on the present stance of monetary policy and the likely implications of the November 30 Budget for Bank policy. In its report yesterday, the Bank noted that most year-on-year measures of 12-month inflation had risen since its last report in August. 'Headline' retail prices inflation rose to 1.8 per cent in September from 1.2 per cent in June while the underlying rate, which excludes mortgage interest payments and is targeted by the government, advanced to 3.3 per cent from 2.8 per cent. But it said that slack in the economy, with moderate growth in demand and slow growth in broad money and credit, pointed to the possibility of further reducing inflation over the medium term, with growth of output picking up. Excluding tax changes, the Bank expects that inflation will start falling early next year and may reach a level close to the middle of the government's target range in 1995. The Bank's report provided no indication of whether it and the Treasury would lower interest rates in the event of a substantial tightening of fiscal policy in the Budget.

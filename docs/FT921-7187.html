			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Tories' allies dig deep into their corporate pockets THE CONSERVATIVE party approaches the general election buoyed up by an historically high level of cash contributions from supporters. Reports last summer suggested that the party fund-raising machine was facing increasing problems in attracting contributions but Conservative Central Office now says the party has beaten all records for a pre-election year. A nationwide appeal specifically for election funds will be made once the election date is announced and this is likely to involve both Sir John Cope, deputy chairman responsible for party finances, and Mr Chris Patten, party chairman. A senior party official dismissed suggestions that the recession had hit fundraising. He said that the prospect of the election was giving it an added spur. He added: 'Companies are thinking what is best for them over the next five years. They are worried about the tax implications of Labour policy on managers and the prospects for higher interest rates and inflation, a relaxation in trade union laws and greater government intervention in business.' A Financial Times survey of 40 top corporate contributors to the party bears out this assessment. It found that the 40 companies' contributions were Pounds 1.34m in 1991, down only Pounds 36,000 from the previous year. Most companies are planning to maintain or increase their payments this year. Although a number of companies have cut contributions, largely because the recession has taken a heavy toll on their finances, these cuts have been largely offset by increases from other companies. It is thought the election campaign could cost the Conservatives up to Pounds 20m, about Pounds 5m more than the 1987 election. Most of the money will be raised from constituency associations but the funds will be underpinned by a steady flow of contributions from companies led by increases from a clutch of big givers. T &amp; N, the motor components group, last week sent the party Pounds 25,000, having contributed nothing last year. It said it wanted the Conservatives to win the election because this would be in its shareholders' best interests. General Accident, the insurance company which has paid Pounds 35,000 to the party for the last four years, said it normally increased its payments in an election year. In 1987 it paid Pounds 60,000 against Pounds 25,000 a year in the previous three years. BPB Industries, the building materials group which contributed Pounds 10,000 last year, has made additional election contributions in the past. The issue is likely to be discussed by the board next month. Taylor Woodrow, the construction group which last year disclosed a cut its contribution from Pounds 150,000 to Pounds 24,000, will soon announce that its has decided to increase it. United Biscuits is one of the largest givers. It contributed Pounds 130,000 last year compared with Pounds 112,000 in 1990. The contribution from Smiths Industries, the aerospace and medical equipment group, rose by Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 15,000 for the year to last July, while Sturge Holdings, the insurance group, increased its 1991 contribution to Pounds 25,000 because the election was in prospect. Hanson, the industrial conglomerate, increased its donation by Pounds 20,000 to Pounds 100,000 in the year to last September. Shareholders at Foreign and Colonial Investment Trust may double its contribution to Pounds 25,000 when they meet at the group's annual meeting on April 7, just two days before the most likely election date. The length and depth of the recession is forcing several companies to consider cutting their contributions. Wimpey, the construction group, is almost certain to halve its contribution of Pounds 40,000 and Western United Investment, part of the financially troubled Vestey group, which gave Pounds 100,000 last year is reconsidering its contribution. Other cuts include Tomkins, the conglomerate, from Pounds 15,000 to Pounds 25,000, Willis Caroon, the insurance brokers, Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 25,000, and the Rank Organisation by half to Pounds 25,000. British Airways plans no change to its policy of no contribution this year against Pounds 40,000 last year. The 600 Group, the engineering combine, said it had given nothing so far this year and was unlikely to do so. Adwest Group, the automotive and electrical engineering group cut its contribution to Pounds 7,500 last year from Pounds 25,000 in 1989. It said: 'The driving reason behind the cut is the state of our business but it also reflects some considerable disappointment with the government's performance'. Only two companies indicated they might contribute to other parties. Kingfisher, the retailer which has given Pounds 25,000 to the Tories for the last five years, has also supported Labour fund-raising events with Pounds 12,000 and plans to include the Liberal Democrats in its 1992 funding programme. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, gave Pounds 25,000 to the Conservatives in 1990 but noted that the last time there was a chance of a hung parliament it shared the Pounds 25,000 between the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Social Democrats. Most of the Conservatives' big corporate backers have not changed their contributions and do not plan to. Those which made no change in the past year include Allied Lyons (Pounds 110,000); Capital and Counties, property (Pounds 15,000); GKN, engineering (Pounds 25,000); Glaxo, pharmaceuticals (Pounds 60,000); Hammerson Properties (Pounds 25,000); Kleinwort Benson, merchant bank (Pounds 40,000); Laporte, chemicals (Pounds 20,000); Lucas, automotive and aerospace (Pounds 25,000); P &amp; O, shipping and property (Pounds 100,000); Racal Electronics (Pounds 25,000); RHM, foods (Pounds 20,000); Scottish Eastern Investment (Pounds 15,000); Scottish and Newcastle Breweries (Pounds 50,000); Scottish National Trust (Pounds 20,000); Sedgwick Group, insurance (Pounds 20,000); Slough Estates, property (Pounds 22,500); Sun Alliance (Pounds 50,000); Sun Life (Pounds 20,000); Tarmac construction (Pounds 55,000); Tate and Lyle (Pounds 25,500); Trafalgar House (Pounds 40,000); Williams Holdings (Pounds 25,000).</p>

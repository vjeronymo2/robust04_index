			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Observer: Indigestion David Mellor, the minister of fun - and a lot of serious things as well - may spoil the appetite of certain BBC governors and bureaucrats over a working dinner tonight. They spent all yesterday beavering away deciding what the BBC is up to. Let's hope they come up with an answer that will satisfy the secretary of state for the national heritage. For Mellor is determined the BBC is not going to be propped up like a stately building or nurtured in perpetuity like a museum. 'They are going have to it all to do,' he warned, reverting to football-spiel. Observer assumes the haute cuisine at the Lucknam Park hotel does not rise to bombe surprise.</p>

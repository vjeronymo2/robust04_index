			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PETER'S PRINCIPLES  </P> <P> What right has Peter Greenberg to use his column for a diatribe against the  young, enthusiastic and attractive female cabin attendants that once made  flying a pleasure and less of the traumatic melodrama it has become (for which  aging stewardesses are partly to blame)?  </P> <P> After thousands of words of rhetoric, Greenberg finally makes his point that in  an emergency he'll feel safe in the hands of an old, experienced stewardess (or  steward?). But that is stretching a point, besides being his only one.  </P> <P> In the first place, an emergency situation exists less than a 10th of 1% of the  time. Secondly, a stew with just a year's service will have made over 150  flights and logged as many as a half-million miles. This surely is plenty of  experience.  </P> <P> Moreover, would Greenberg deny a youngster her first job because 1) she's  attractive and eager and 2) another woman twice her age has held the job for 20  years, isn't going to be promoted and won't give up her job? Finally, hasn't  frequent-flier Greenberg yet observed that as cabin attendants age, they become  complacent, bored, jaded, bossy, disinterested and totally reliant upon job  security and union rules that prevent them from having been replaced a decade  or so earlier?  </P> <P> OLIVER BERLINER  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / High hopes in Russia of IMF accord RUSSIA will try to conclude a standby agreement with the International Monetary Fund by October, Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister, said yesterday. While admitting that 'anything could happen', Mr Shokhin claimed that Russia could conclude a standby deal, setting tough conditions for further IMF balance of payments of assistance, within the next six months. This would happen, he suggested, if the central bank and finance ministry pursued 'responsible policies', which would depend on President Boris Yeltsin receiving appropriate support in a referendum due on April 25. Mr Shokhin, who concluded Russia's debt rescheduling with western creditor nations in the Paris Club last week, said the rescheduling could go ahead even if no standby deal was achieved. He said the Paris Club agreement would be followed by a similar deal with the London Club of commercial bank creditors by July. Anticipating the results of the London Club talks, he said Russia would only have to pay Dollars 3bn to service debts this year, including Dollars 2bn to the Paris Club, and Dollars 1bn to all other creditors. The debt rescheduling deal, although the biggest chunk of assistance granted so far to Russia, continued to go largely unnoticed in Moscow yesterday. Like most of the anti-Yeltsin press, a spokesman for the Russian parliament focused on criticising the Dollars 1.6bn US aid package given to Russia at the Vancouver summit on Sunday. 'The promised aid of Dollars 1.6bn is of course a noble deed,' Mr Konstantin Zlobin, said. 'But we know that aid in the form of money handouts usually disappears into a black hole or gets into the hands of wheeler-dealers who bank the money in the west.' In a front page headline, Sovietskaya Rossiya described the Dollars 1.6bn as 'light baggage' and elsewhere accused President Clinton of 'political madness' in backing President Yeltsin. Like most of the critics which claim they resent aid, Pravda added that it was far too little, amounting to 'just Dollars 10.98' per Russian citizen. The latest meeting of a round table organised by the government and parliament to try to find solutions to the country's economic problems showed how elusive a consensus remains. Vice President Alexander Rutskoi, who is on parliament's side in the conflict with President Yeltsin and the government, said the young radicals in the government had to be sacked before agreement was possible.</p>

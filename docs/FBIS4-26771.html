			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Ye Jundong (0673 0193 2639)] </F>   [Text] Guangzhou, 23 Jun (XINHUA) -- After inspecting areas  seriously affected by flood in Guangdong, Chen Junsheng, state  councillor and head of the State Flood Control and Drought  Relief Headquarters, pointed out: While performing relief work  at present, we should stress on properly providing food,  shelter, and medical care to flood victims and on assisting them  to resume production and to rebuild their homes as soon as  possible.    From 21 to 23 June, after inspecting flood-prevention  projects at dikes along the Beijiang River in Guangdong, Chen  Junsheng immediately led a central joint work team, and  hurriedly travelled over 1,000 kilometers to other  disaster-stricken areas. He successively inspected four  counties and districts in Qingyuan, Zhanjinag, and Maoming  cities that have been seriously affected by flooding. Chen  Junsheng and his party went into disaster-stricken areas,  visited households of flood victims, studied the flood  situation, and extended greetings and appreciation to cadres,  the masses, commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation  Army [PLA], officers and men of the armed police corps, and  public security cadres and police who have been performing  relief work at the forefront in disaster-stricken areas. After  studying the damage inflicted in the flooded areas and the  ongoing relief work being carried out, Chen Junsheng said: The  ongoing relief work has been very well organized and systematic.  Social order has been good; commodity prices have remained  stable; the society has been relatively calm; and the feelings  and spirit of cadres and the masses have been good, too.    While holding discussion meetings with leaders at  provincial,  city, and county levels in Guangdong, Chen Junsheng laid down  instructions on relief work at the next stage. He pointed out:  To resume production and to rebuild flood victims' homes are  top priorities of our relief work in the next stage. First, we  should stress on properly providing food, shelter, and medical  care to flood victims. We must ensure the supply of grain  rations to flood victims and absolutely no one is allowed to  starve to death. We should promptly renovate and rebuild houses  for flood victims so they can regain a stable living environment  as soon as possible. It is necessary to promote hygiene and  stress prevention epidemics in an effort to prevent epidemic  diseases that normally appear after a calamity. Second, we  should organize personnel to resume production as soon as  possible. In particular, we should properly handle grain  production. We should promptly fix up farmland that has been  destroyed by flooding and replant late-autumn crops. We should  strive to plant more late-autumn crops so as to harvest more  later, and cannot afford to miss the right timing. Relevant  departments should provide support and supply seeds, fertilizer,  pesticide, and diesel to disaster-stricken areas. When  renovating facilities that have been destroyed by flooding, we  should specifically and promptly restore roads, bridges, and  water conservancy projects.    Chen Junsheng pointed out: Guangdong's recent rescue and  relief work during the flood has fully demonstrated the rallying  forces of our party, that of reform and opening up, and that of  economic progress, and has also fully shown the fighting  capability of the PLA, that of officers and men of the armed  police corps, and that of public security cadres and police.  These rallying forces and their fighting capability were the  factors that enabled us to secure preliminary victories over our  first battles fighting a major disaster. He fully affirmed the  Guangdong format whereby members of its leading bodies, in  separate groups, respectively went to the forefront of  disaster-stricken areas to direct rescue and relief work. He  said: It has been a very good experience. We should  persistently promote the experience for a long time in the  future to attain a total victory in the rescue and relief work  during the flood.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Norsk Data shares to be delisted in Oslo SHARES in Norsk Data, the Norwegian computer service group, will be delisted from the Oslo bourse from May 3. The main reason behind the move is that the group's share capital has been wiped out, the bourse said. At the end of December, Norsk Data had negative equity, including deferred taxes, of NKr474m (Dollars 71.6m). Bourse officials also said an out-of-court financial restructuring of Norsk Data, agreed with Den norske Bank and Fokus Bank, two of Norway's top three commercial banks and the group's main creditors, was behind the decision. Under the restructuring, Norsk Data will pay a cash dividend of 25 per cent of what is owed to unsecured creditors. DnB and Fokus agreed to refinance Norsk Data's outstanding debt of NKr600m, of which NKr300m is in German bearer bonds. A share issue is to be undertaken by partly converting debt to equity. The six-year crisis in Norway's banking sector is set to continue, although it is no longer acute, according to Mr Finn Hvistendahl, chief executive of Den norske Bank, Norway's biggest bank. Mr Hvistendahl made the remarks at the annual meeting of the Norwegian Banks Association, the lobbying arm of the commercial banks of which he was yesterday elected chairman for a second term. He challenged the government to end competitive distortion in Norway's bank sector by dismantling annual state subsidies of an estimated NKr5bn, given in the form of subsidised interest rates to non-commercial state banks. Mr Hvistendahl also called on the government to create conditions which would allow the commercial banks to be reprivatised. Over the past six years, the state has injected more than NKr27bn into the banks to rescue them from insolvency. This has resulted in the state acquiring Christiania Bank and Fokus Bank, the country's second and third biggest commercial banks, and increasing its stake in DnB to 70 per cent from 55 per cent. Over the last two years of crisis, the commercial banks have been forced to reduce their balance sheets by by 15 per cent and the number of branches by 40 per cent. This has meant cost reductions of 30 per cent since 1988.</p>

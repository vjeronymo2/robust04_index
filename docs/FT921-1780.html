			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Hong Kong's securities regulator to resign THE chairman of Hong Kong's stock market regulatory body, Mr Robert Owen, is to resign. The former merchant banker and diplomat who was brought in to set up the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) in 1988 will leave on May 1, the third anniversary of the SFC's inauguration. His departure coincides with a new phase for the Commission. After three years of forceful action the SFC has established itself as the watchdog of a stock exchange with a reformed governing council no longer controlled by vested interests. Mr Owen will be replaced by deputy chairman Mr Robert Nottle, one of the five original executive directors and a former senior operations director of Australia's National Companies and Securities Commission. Three other original directors will remain, with Mr Ermanno Pascutto becoming deputy chairman. Director of enforcement Mr Gavin Eadie is to be replaced by the commission's legal counsel, Mr Gerard McMahon, while another internal promotion will see Mr Michael Wu becoming the first local Chinese member of the executive. Mr Owen said there was sufficient continuity within the SFC to ensure there would be no negative impact from his departure. 'The Commission is an accepted part of the scenery here. People understand what it is all about and it gets on with its job,' said Mr Owen. But this involved a struggle in a community where a laissez-faire ethos has long prevailed. The SFC has survived vocal attacks from legislative councillors and prominent businessmen and put into effect the recommendations of Mr Ian Hay Davison in his critical 1988 review of Hong Kong's financial markets. The SFC went beyond the Davison recommendations in undertaking a thorough reform of the Stock Exchange's ruling council. 'In terms of the international perception, I think it is fair to say that the 1987 cloud has now been well and truly dispersed,' said Mr Owen. International confidence in the exchange was shattered after its temporary closure by the chairman, Mr Ronald Li, in the wake of the October 1987 crash. Mr Li was subsequently jailed for corruption. Mr Davison had said 'an inside group treated the exchange as a private club rather than a public utility for the general benefit of members, investors and issuers'. Under the SFC reforms, the exchange's council was broadened in order to block the influence of vested interest groups. There has also been a large degree of ethnic tension in the dispute, with the expatriate SFC seen as an outside aggressor which did not understand the local market. Moves will be taken to redress the racial balance of the commission, with Mr Nottle's eventual successor likely to be a local Chinese. Mr Owen said the future direction of the SFC would be towards market development and also towards moves to protect Hong Kong's long-oppressed minority shareholders. 'I saw myself coming here to establish an organisation, implement the reforms and see them established with a reasonable degree of continuity. In that sense, the timing has worked out very well,' he said.</p>

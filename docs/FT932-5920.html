			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / German managers come out on top BRITISH managers think they are the best in Europe but this opinion is not shared by their continental European competitors, according to a survey of Europe's smaller companies, published today. German managers and their companies are the most highly regarded by their European competitors, though they are modest about their own achievements, the survey showed. Researchers from Cranfield School of Management questioned - on behalf of 3i, Britain's largest venture capital company - just over 1,000 managers of companies employing up to 500 people. Italian, British and Spanish managers think more highly of themselves than does the rest of Europe, with the British convinced they are the best. In the overall European ranking, French managers and their companies were rated most highly, after the Germans, then the British, the Italians and, last, the Spanish. European managers were asked to rank themselves and their foreign competitors on 12 characteristics. These included competence, reliability, trustworthiness, humour, and ability to get on with others. Companies were assessed on aspects such as market and product focus, customer service, financial viability, and attention to law, ethics and the environment.

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / People: Greener extends role at BAT BAT Industries is hoping to strengthen its clout in the insurance world by giving George Greener (right), chairman and chief executive of Allied Dunbar, responsibility for its other insurance subsidiary Eagle Star as well. The move follows the promotion of Martin Broughton, previously chairman of Eagle Star, to the position of group chief executive and deputy chairman of BAT from the beginning of last month. Broughton remains managing director of the group's financial services business, with Greener, now in charge of the whole of the UK, and Leo Denlea who runs Farmers in the US, both reporting to him. BAT says the elevation of Greener, who joined in 1991 after a 20-year career with Mars, to the position of chairman of Eagle Star Holdings reflects the belief that a more co-ordinated approach will give the group greater muscle at a time of considerable regulatory upheaval in the industry, particularly in the life insurance area. 'We believe people will take more notice of us if we are number four in the market than if we are, separately, both the wrong side of ten' BAT commented yesterday. Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star's combined premium income gives the group a 6 per cent share of the UK life, investment and pensions market. The group also hopes that the new format will increase its chances of success in the international arena. ''We were beginning to find potential international partners were unclear as to which bit of the group they would fit into. Now there is one person for them to talk to' a BAT spokesman added. In the past, the ethos of the two operations could not have been more different, with the brash Allied Dunbar sales technique contrasting sharply with the more traditional approach of Eagle Star. Now both are moving towards a multi-channel distribution strategy. Moreover, BAT believes that whereas Allied Dunbar had been 'so focused on its sales drive that it had rather lost sight of its market' one of Greener's achievements has been to redress that balance. Meanwhile, Clive Coates, finance director of Eagle Star, is promoted to deputy chairman, while Sandy Leitch, deputy chairman and managing director of Allied Dunbar, becomes its chief executive.</p>

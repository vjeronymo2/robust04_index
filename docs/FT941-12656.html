			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (7): New inflation rule will disrupt many plans - The Budget / The change to CGT took effect in the middle of the tax year - to the disadvantage of investors The principle that investors should not have to pay tax on inflationary gains was eroded by the Budget. Since budget day, it has no longer been possible to use indexation to create a capital loss, although it will still be possible to use indexation to reduce gains. Under the old system, if you bought an asset for Pounds 10,000, and then sold it, after prices had risen by 50 per cent, for Pounds 10,000, you would have had an indexation loss of Pounds 5,000. This will no longer be the case. You will still be able to offset losses in nominal value - ie, if you bought an asset for Pounds 10,000 and sold it for Pounds 5,000, that would be an allowable loss. This change may upset many people's tax planning. Take an investor with two assets, each worth Pounds 100,000. After five years, asset A has doubled in value to Pounds 200,000, while asset B's price has not changed. Meanwhile, prices have risen by 50 per cent. The total value of the investor's portfolio has risen to Pounds 300,000, or by 50 per cent, exactly keeping pace with inflation. Under the old system, the investor would have no CGT liability, since the indexed gain on Asset A of Pounds 50,000 would be offset by the indexed loss on Asset B of Pounds 50,000. Under the new system, there will be no indexed loss on Asset B. So the investor will have to pay CGT on his indexed Asset A gain of Pounds 50,000. With the current allowance of Pounds 5,800, a higher-rate taxpayer would face a bill for Pounds 17,680. What has particularly upset many readers is that the change applied from budget day, in the middle of a tax year. Investors who had already realised gains of more than Pounds 5,800 might have planned to sell other investments (for indexation losses) in order to realise an indexed loss. They will now be prevented from doing so. One beneficial change to the CGT rules will allow investors to roll over gains (ie defer the payment of tax), if the proceeds are reinvested in the shares of an unquoted trading company. This may yet develop into a large loophole in the CGT regulations; however, an investor with a large gain from, say, Glaxo shares may prefer to pay the tax, than take the risk of buying shares in an unquoted company. Income Tax While the chancellor did not alter the headline rates of income tax, he did increase the burden of the tax in various subtle ways. The personal allowance, and the higher rate band, were frozen at Pounds 3,445 and Pounds 23,700 respectively. Since wage inflation gradually draws more and more people into the tax net, and into the higher rate band, freezing allowances effectively represents a tax increase. The married couple's allowance (for those under 65) was frozen at Pounds 1,720. Furthermore, tax relief on the allowance which was already scheduled to fall to 20 per cent in 1994-95, will drop again, to 15 per cent, in 1995-6. This costs a higher-rate taxpayer Pounds 344 and Pounds 86 in succeeding years; for basic rate taxpayers, the cost will be Pounds 86 each year. Such changes might make it seem as if the married couple's allowance is doomed to disappear. However, the allowance was increased for those over 65. The only other piece of good income tax news in the Budget was the rise in the blind person's allowance from Pounds 1,080 to Pounds 1,200. The increase in the 20 per cent band (from Pounds 2,500 to Pounds 3,000) had already been announced by Norman Lamont. Miras One 'dog that didn't bark' in the Budget was the abolition of mortgage interest relief. The chancellor evidently felt that abolishing the relief would do too much damage to the fragile housing market. Nevertheless, Kenneth Clarke continued the old Treasury policy of allowing the relief to 'wither on the vine' and, indeed, added an extra spurt of weedkiller. Relief, which will be restricted to 20 per cent in 1994-95, will be further restricted to 15 per cent in 1995-96. The Treasury decided that restricting the rate of relief was fairer than reducing the size of loan on which relief was granted (from Pounds 30,000 to, say, Pounds 25,000). The latter option, the Treasury argues, would hit those with larger loans, where the debt problems are worst. New taxes Mr Clarke may not have extended the VAT base, as many feared, but he did find new items to tax. From October, general insurance premiums (such as on house contents or motor cars) will carry a 3 per cent tax. The reaction of insurance companies varied, but it seems inevitable that the charge will eventually be passed on to the consumer. Long-term life insurance policies (such as endowments) are exempt. Air travel will also be taxed; flights within the European Union bearing a Pounds 5 charge, and outside the EU Pounds 10. This tax will also apply from October. Private medical insurance Tax relief on medical insurance for the elderly is another relief which is being restricted, although to 25 per cent, rather than 20 or 15 per cent. Medical insurance premiums will also suffer the new 3 per cent tax. Another cutback is the change in the tax treatment of permanent health insurance benefits. These will now be tax-free for the first 12 months, rather than for the first tax year. Under the old rules, if someone started to take PHI benefits in May, they could receive them tax-free for 23 months. Retirement for women As expected, the government is extending the state retirement age for women from 60 to 65. This both meets the requirement for sex equality and, what is more important, saves the government money. Ageing populations mean that a number of western countries are extending retirement ages. The change will be phased in between 2010 and 2020, affecting those women currently aged under 44. The cut-off date is April 5, 1950. Women born on that date will be paid a pension at age 60. Those born thereafter will see their retirement age increase by a month, for every month they were born after April 5, 1950. So those born in May 1950, can retire at 60 years and one month; those born in June 1950 can retire at 60 years and two months; and so on. Those born after April 1955 will retire at age 65.</p>

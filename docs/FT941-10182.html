			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: Japan turns old debt into a new company - Finance ministry officials describe government proposals to allow the securitisation of bad debt as 'epoch-making', but not everyone agrees Japan's bureaucrats, scrambling for an ultimate Japanese Way to solve the bad loan problem of their country's banks, presented their answer this week with a government economic package. 'It's epoch-making,' said a triumphant finance ministry official, after explaining its proposals to deal with the mounting bad loans and increasing number of corporate restructuring programmes for which the banks are having to provide financial aid. The traditional 'Japanese Way' of dealing with bad or risky loans has been to sit on them until conditions improved - or until the borrower went bankrupt. Such methods have been under scrutiny, with critics contending that Japanese banks should learn from their US counterparts to write off bad loans or make loss reserves for dubious ones. Non-performing loans at 21 leading institutions rose 7.7 per cent to Y13,800bn (Dollars 126bn) in the first half to September, but this figure might well be doubled if the broader, western interpretation of non-performing loans is used. The finance ministry's new policy guidelines allow banks to shift deteriorating assets off balance sheets by securitising the loans, Japanese style. Banks will be allowed to set up a special company to buy loans made to non-bank financial institutions, to which banks have waived all or most of the interest. Through the plan, the ministry wants to wipe away concerns over problem loans to non-bank finance companies, including housing loan companies caught up in the buying frenzy of the late 1980s, which have been weighing heavily on the Tokyo stock market and business confidence. The ministry says that unlike the US securitisation of loans - where a third party buys the securities - the company, financed by the banks, will purchase the loan at a discounted price, and monitor the financial restructuring of the borrower. The scheme will allow banks to define their losses on such loans and, by keeping the loans within the existing group of creditors instead of selling it out into a secondary market, the non-bank finance companies and banks can maintain their ties. But in spite of the enthusiasm by the authorities, some Japanese bankers contend that the loan securitisation scheme does not fundamentally solve the problem, since the ties between the creditor bank and the non-bank financial company remain, and financing the special purchasing company will be an additional cost. 'It's a bit masochistic,' says one bank official. Mr David Marshall, analyst at IBCA, the UK bank rating agency, says: 'The measures do give some encouragement to banks to write off problem loans and may pave the way for a more fundamental solution for the non-bank problem.' However, he adds that the plan may allow banks to remove chunks of problem loans from their balance sheets and hide them in the special-purpose companies. The scheme also highlights the close involvement of the ministry of finance in matters that in the West would be left to banks' management and auditors. Meanwhile, the finance ministry will ease the restrictions on making taxed loan loss reserves. The measure will allow banks to add loan loss reserves to cover risky loans so long as they are willing to pay tax for it; so far, banks which wanted to reserve against a loan had to undergo strict ministry scrutiny that the borrower could not repay its debts. Ms Alicia Ogawa, analyst at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, regards this scheme as good news so long as the banks have enough profits to pay the taxes. But without tax incentives, bankers say making reserves against risky loans is too much of a burden. 'It does allow us to look forward and leave the problems behind, but it's not beneficial, profit-wise,' says one commercial bank official. 'But most of us are so busy dealing with unrecoverable loans, that looking at those with a risk of going bad doesn't have much priority at the moment.'</p>

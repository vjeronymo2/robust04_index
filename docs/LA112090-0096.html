			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Columbia S&amp;L Says Seizure Probable: The Beverly Hills thrift, insolvent by  nearly $710 million because of junk bond losses, for the first time conceded in  an SEC filing that it is "extremely likely" to be taken over by federal  regulators. The disclosure comes as no surprise. Regulators have held off  seizing the Beverly Hills thrift while its management tries to sell its  portfolio of junk bonds, now worth about $2.5 billion.  </P></p>

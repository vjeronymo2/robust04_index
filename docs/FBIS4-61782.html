			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Agreement on Common Principles in the Sphere of the </F> Development of Interethnic Relations and Ethnic Cultures in  Ukraine" signed by 12 organizations and parties]    [Text] We, representatives of political parties,  movements, ethnic culture societies, and other public  organizations, having discussed the proposals by the Association  "For Interethnic Peace and Harmony in Ukraine" in its statement  of 23 December 1993, share the concern expressed there about  Ukraine's future as an independent, indivisible, and democratic  state.    Distressed by the political confrontation, escalation of  violence, and exacerbation of relations among various social and  ethnic groups in nearby foreign countries, as well as by the  territorial claims upon Ukraine and adhering to democratic  principles in resolving sociopolitical problems and defending  human rights, we consider interethnic harmony in Ukraine to be  one of the main preconditions for maintaining and strengthening  our statehood. We also consider the provision of social  stability and civic peace in our society to be one of the major  task of all political forces of the country, especially during  the period of the formation of new power structures.    Proceeding from these principles, the signatories to this  agreement have agreed on the following main principles in their  policy in the sphere of development of interethnic relations and  ethnic cultures:    1. Observation of the ethnic and religious rights of all  citizens of Ukraine and the revival and development of all of  its nationalities.    2. Opposition to all manifestations of chauvinism,  xenophobia, ethnic prejudice, or disrespect for national  dignity. Such phenomena must primarily be rejected by those  organizations from whose national midst they originate.    3. Protection of the rights of the individual in harmonious  combination with respect for his ethnic rights and satisfaction  of his ethnic cultural needs.    4. Provision for the rights of all nationalities and ethnic  groups of Ukraine in the new constitution.    5. Satisfaction of the needs of believers of all faiths and  opposition to the incitement of interethnic hostility.    We are ready to create a civic committee, composed of our  representatives, to fulfill this agreement.    The agreement is open to signing by all political forces and  public organizations.

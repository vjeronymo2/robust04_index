			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norske Skog to increase newsprint prices Norske Skog, the Norwegian papermaker, announced yesterday it would increase newsprint prices in the UK market by 15 per cent from the beginning of next year, writes Deborah Hargreaves. The company which has a 10 per cent share of the British newsprint market, said the increase was the minimum it could ask for to cover sharply higher raw materials costs. Many newsprint mills are seeking to raise prices from the beginning of October, which is likely to lead to increases in general of 7 to 8 per cent this year. But the market could be pushed higher when annual negotiations with newspaper publishers open towards the end of the year, when mills will be looking to pass on costs which have doubled and even trebled this year. Prices in continental Europe and North America are also set to increase as rebates are eliminated in a more buoyant economic climate. Newsprint prices could rise by as much as 30 per cent in the US market.</p>

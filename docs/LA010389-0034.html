			<p><P> January 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WARNINGS TO SCANDINAVIAN LINE TAKEN SERIOUSLY;  </P> <P> BOMB THREATS SPARK AIR SECURITY ALERT  </P> <P> Three bomb threats -- at least one apparently linked to Stockholm's role in the  opening of a U.S.-PLO dialogue -- prompted Scandinavian Airlines System to  mount one of its tightest security operations ever on Monday, disrupting the  airline's flights worldwide.  </P> <P> An English-speaking caller telephoned the airline and said an internal flight  from Gothenburg in western Sweden would be sabotaged on Monday morning, the  airline reported.  </P> <P> It was the third threat SAS has made public.  </P> <P> Although there were delays on all SAS flights Monday because of security  checks, no signs of sabotage were found.  </P> <P> "But we are taking all the threats seriously, and security is stringent at all  our airports," airline spokesman John Herbert said.  </P> <P> On Saturday, the airline said it had received a letter saying an SAS plane on a  domestic route would be attacked because of Sweden's mediating role that led to  the United States opening direct talks with the Palestine Liberation  Organization.  </P> <P> That threat was followed by a tip-off from Interpol, the international police  organization, that an unidentified group may be planning to attack one of its  planes, causing SAS to alert its staff around the world.  </P> <P> Herbert said Swedish secret police had not been able to specify who had made  the threat, which came from Budapest.  </P> <P> Herbert said there was no information suggesting that either threat was linked  to last month's crash of a Pan Am Boeing 747 in Scotland that killed all 259 on  board and at least 11 people on the ground.  </P> <P> He said the extra security had already caused severe delays and would mean  extra costs for the airline, in which the governments of Sweden, Norway and  Denmark share a 50% stake.  </P> <P> As a result of security measures following the threats, some charter flights  have been delayed by up to 13 hours. Scheduled flights have suffered much  shorter delays.  </P> <P> Swedish newspapers speculated that an Iranian fundamentalist group was planning  an attack as revenge for Sweden's recent involvement in the negotiations with  the PLO.  </P> <P> Herbert said he had no such information.  </P> <P> "Right now we have no idea who is behind this. But Interpol has advised us to  consider the latest threat seriously," he added.  </P> <P> Sweden in early December arranged a meeting between PLO leader Yasser Arafat  and a group of prominent American Jews, and soon afterward the PLO made clear  its implicit recognition of Israel and renunciation of terrorism.  </P> <P> Sweden was instrumental in coaxing Arafat to clarify the PLO stand at a news  conference in Geneva, a move that persuaded Washington to open talks for the  first time in 13 years.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the West German state attorney's office in Frankfurt, where Pan  Am flight 103 originated with a smaller plane Dec. 21, said Monday that  investigators have found that freight, including four bags of U.S. military  mail, was loaded on the plane without security checks.  </P> <P> The spokesman said the freight was loaded on the Pan Am 727 that flew the first  leg of Flight 103 from Frankfurt and transferred to the ill-fated Boeing 747 in  London, again without a security check.  </P> <P> He added, however, that the mail bags were "constantly guarded by U.S. military  personnel."  </P> <P> The West German weekly Bunte said Monday that a document box from Manufacturers  Hanover Trust also was loaded in Frankfurt and transferred in London without  being checked.  </P> <P> The German spokesman said investigators are still examining the possibility  that a bomb was loaded on Flight 103 in Frankfurt but so far have found "no hot  trail."  </P> <P> Two months ago, police discovered an arms cache of the Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine-General Command in Frankfurt that included the  Czech-made plastic explosive Semtex and an altitude detonator. Semtex or a  plastic explosive like it is suspected of causing the Pan Am crash.  </P></p>

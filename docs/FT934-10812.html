			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Survey of Morocco (1): Press on the accelerator - Morocco is more self-confident than in 1983 when a balance of payments crisis forced it to reschedule foreign debt. King Hassan provides stability and there has been some progress on liberalising the economy Morocco is in the process of reviewing its identity. Geo- graphically, it is part of north Africa, but emotionally it is strongly tied to the Arab world. Devotionally, it belongs to Islam, but economically it has decided that it wishes to be linked to Europe. The priorities given to those potentially conflictive characteristics, under the leadership of what remains ultimately an absolute monarchy, is likely to define Morocco's capacity to realise its considerable potential during the remaining years of this century. The one apparently sure thing is that the changes will be gradual and the signposts may simultaneously point in different directions. King Hassan II, who appears to sit more comfortably on his throne than at any time since he took over from his father Mohammed V in 1961, exercises his power with acknowledged skill but not always with the most obvious intentions. The interpretation of royal wishes, like the sources of information and the identity of the most influential advisers at the royal court, has long been one of Rabat's most engrossing activities. There are, however, certain imperatives which no monarch or government can safely ignore. Morocco's population of some 26m (it could be a million or two more) is growing by at least 2.2 per cent a year. Some 50 per cent of Moroccans are under 20 years old and more than 50 per cent of adult males are illiterate. Urban unemployment is unofficially estimated at 20 per cent or more, while there is considerably greater underemployment in rural areas. World Bank studies suggest that 13 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line, with another 8 per cent only marginally above it. Income disparities are substantial, particularly between town and country. Across a wide range of social indicators, Morocco lags well behind other countries with similar per capita incomes. The need for social advancement, especially among the most disadvantaged, has taken on greater urgency with the spread of Islamic militancy throughout the Arab nations. The alarming social, political and economic deterioration in neighbouring Algeria is an uncomfortably close reminder of what can happen when an entrenched government fails to respond adequately to popular demands. Plentiful reasons can be advanced to explain why Morocco will continue to avoid the pitfalls suffered by its neighbour. King Hassan enjoys widespread respect, if not always affection. His judgment and policies on major foreign policy issues, such as the Arab-Israel conflict and the Gulf war, have been substantially vindicated. The visit to Rabat in September by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, recognised the importance of King Hassan's long-term commitment to a negotiated peace settlement. His support for the western-led military action to evict Iraqi forces from Kuwait flew in the face of popular sentiment, but is now seen by many Moroccans to have been a politically astute decision. The 'green march' in 1975, which brought the Western Sahara under Moroccan control, is still disputed by the international community but looks increasingly irreversible and was, in domestic terms, arguably the single most important decision of King Hassan's reign. As Commander of the Faithful and a direct descendant of the Prophet, King Hassan can also claim a religious authority which appears to be largely unchallenged. Some Moroccans say they sense a growing Islamic militancy, but are hard pressed to provide evidence of it. The country's political parties are all, to a greater or lesser extent, monarchist. When this embraces even the communists, the scope for ideological debate is necessarily limited and confines itself to policy priorities rather than fundamental aims. The first round of elections for a new parliament earlier this year was thought by independent observers to be relatively free. The second round, for reasons that are not immediately obvious, fell miserably short of that objective. But despite the disputed outcome, Morocco is advancing, however slowly, towards a more representative form of government in which the prime minister theoretically enjoys greater freedom of action. Rather more impressive progress has been made during the past decade in the structural readjustment of the economy along lines encouraged by the IMF and World Bank. The budget deficit has been reduced to about 2 per cent of GDP, the current account deficit has dropped sharply as exports increased, rescheduling agreements have lowered the debt service ratio and inflation has been reduced to around 5 per cent. Windfall benefits, such as Saudi Arabia's agreement to wipe out debts of more than Dollars 3bn following the Gulf war, have, however, been offset by two years of drought which last year curtailed agricultural output and caused an estimated 3 per cent fall in gross domestic product. The vagaries of the weather, and the consequent sharp fluctuations in annual GDP, lend even greater weight to arguments advanced by members of the business community for a more vigorous approach to the liberalisation and diversification of the economy. They acknowledge that the government is edging in the right direction. A range of measures over the past few years, including a reduction in tariffs, lower import duties, an easing of licensing restrictions, the convertibility of the dirham, financial sector reforms and the privatisation programme is helping to make the economy more market-oriented. One immediately beneficial result has been a sharp increase in direct foreign investment which last year was estimated at Dollars 500m, more than double the figure for 1990. But whether this is happening quickly enough to create the hundreds of thousands of new jobs that Morocco needs every year to satisfy new entrants to the labour market is open to doubt. The pace of industrialisation remains sluggish compared with many other countries at a similar stage of development. It must accelerate if Morocco is to take full advantage of the partnership agreement it is negotiating with the European Community. The economic picture is additionally complicated by the ill-defined but undoubtedly substantial 'informal sector', which ranges from an impressive array of illegal imports to the flourishing production and export of cannabis, said by some diplomats to account for about 30 per cent of Europe's annual consumption and to be worth around Dollars 2bn a year. Such trade can only complicate Morocco's desire to strengthen its links with the EC, while also posing uncomfortable questions about the country's policing and judicial system. How keenly Morocco intends to address these issues depends heavily on King Hassan and the legacy he wishes to bequeath. He is only 64 and in good health, but the political dominance of the monarch is such that any discussion in Rabat about Morocco's future cannot avoid the issue of the succession. The king's experience and skills in manipulating and balancing the diverse centres of power and influence within the country are unlikely to be inherited intact by Crown Prince Sidi Mohammed, who may anyway wish to pursue a less directly interventionist role. Many Moroccans accept that for the next few years at least the country will need a strong, unifying force at the centre. If there is a vision and an example of how Morocco should evolve in the next two decades, the most often mentioned is that of Spain, just 14 kilometres away. Morocco, like Spain in the 1950s and 1960s, is authoritarian, close to Europe but far from it politically, agricultural but with huge industrial and tourism potential, and with a growing nucleus of young professionals who are internationally aware but increasingly frustrated by a cumbersome and restrictive bureaucracy. By the time of General Francisco Franco's death in the mid-1970s, the growth of the Spanish economy and a burgeoning middle class had laid the basis for a relatively smooth political liberalisation and eventual transfer of power. It might seem wildly fanciful today to see Crown Prince Sidi Mohammed as a future King Juan Carlos, but as a signpost for the future it points in a general direction that most other Arab populations would envy.</p>

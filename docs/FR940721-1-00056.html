			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department also received allegations that the final rule created uncertainty about whether referral fees were in fact prohibited by RESPA. Specifically, some commenters claimed that the introduction in the final rule of an employer-employee exemption from the prohibition on referral fees prompted some persons to set up sham employer-employee relationships to shield prohibited referral fees, and prompted others to ``extort'' referral fees from other settlement service providers on the premise that HUD now allowed such compensation. The final rule did not authorize such practices; however, some commenters argued that the existence of confusion about whether it did suggested that the final rule failed to establish a bright line, comprehensible to industry participants, between permissible and impermissible activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given the controversy over the final rule, the Secretary determined that a review of the previous policies was needed, particularly focusing on the final rule's impact on consumers. The Secretary also articulated three principles to guide that review:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) HUD's responsibility is to protect the consumer_not to mediate among industry interests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) HUD should regulate multibillion dollar industries responsibly_principally by acting quickly to end uncertainty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Technological and business arrangement innovations have the potential to provide significant consumer benefits, and HUD does not serve consumers well if its regulations unduly stifle such advancements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 6, 1993, in an effort to ensure that the new Administration heard the views of all interested parties, the Department published a ``notice of written comment period and informal public hearing'' (58 FR 38176), inviting testimony and written comments on the impact on consumers of the following four provisions of the final rule:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Issue 1 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 3500.14(g)(2)(ii), which provides that RESPA Section 8 does not prohibit ``an employer's payment to its own employees for any referral activities *&blank;*&blank;*.'' (Hereafter, this issue is referred to as the ``employer-employee exemption'' or ``Issue 1''.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Issue 2 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 3500.14(g)(2)(iii), which provides that Section 8 of RESPA does not prohibit ``any payment by a borrower for computer loan origination services, as long as the disclosure set forth in Appendix E of [the final rule] is provided the borrower.'' (Hereafter, this issue is referred to as the ``computer loan origination (CLO) exemption'' or ``Issue 2''.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Issue 3 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 3500.13(b)(2), which provides that ``in determining whether provisions of State law or regulations concerning controlled business arrangements are inconsistent with RESPA or this part, the Secretary may not construe those provisions that impose more stringent limitations on controlled business arrangements as inconsistent with RESPA, as long as they give more protection to consumers and/or competition.'' (Hereafter, this issue is referred to as ``preemption policy'' or ``Issue 3''.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Issue 4 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 3500.15(b)(1), which provides for a ``written disclosure in controlled business situations, in the format of the Controlled Business Arrangement Disclosure Statement set forth in appendix D of this part'' of certain information regarding the ownership and financial relationships between referring and referred-to parties, and for certain timing and other methods for disclosure. (Hereafter, this issue is referred to as ``controlled business disclosure policy'' or ``Issue 4''.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At a public hearing held on August 6, 1993, at the General Services Administration (GSA) Auditorium in Washington, DC, all 36 parties who had requested to testify did so. Twenty-two witnesses opposed provisions of the rule and 14 witnesses supported provisions of the rule. The Department also received 1,553 written comments. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  Of the 1,526 comments reviewed, 1,148 comments opposing provisions of the final rule were received from mortgage lenders, or State or regional organizations representing mortgage lending professionals; consumer organizations; 3 Federal agencies; and, in both combined comments and separately, several State Attorneys General. An additional 325 critical comments were received from law firms and title insurance companies. Twenty-four comments were wholly or generally supportive of the final rule, including comments from individuals and organizations in real estate-related industries, lenders or title insurance providers, real estate brokers, a builder, and the Federal Reserve Board. The remainder of the comments were not characterized. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A total of 1,553 comments were officially logged in by the Department's Rules Docket Clerk. More than two dozen were duplicates, leaving 1,526 unduplicated comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. The Secretary's Position: A Brief Summary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on a complete review of the substantive arguments in support of and in opposition to the final rule provided in the testimony at the August 6, 1993, hearing; the written comments received; and a review of the RESPA statute, its purpose, and its history, the Department reached certain conclusions about its policy objectives on Issues 1&hyph;4, set forth above. The Department therefore proposes to amend the final rule as described below. Recognizing the rapid evolution of technology and business practices, the Department believes that development of the final rule will require additional collateral information about how certain details of this proposal will work in practice and whether these details will further the Department's policy objectives. Therefore, the Department has developed a series of questions about specific aspects of the proposal and asks commenters to offer any information they may have about how the rules would work. These questions are detailed throughout this preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

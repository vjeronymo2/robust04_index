			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Election 1992: Ineffectual dons - Ballot Box University dons have never been bosom pals of the Tories. Remember the litany of 365 economists savaging Sir Geoffrey Howe in 1981, not to mention Oxford's ostentatious refusal to award an honorary degree to Margaret Thatcher. Yesterday's attack on the government by 900 dons - 115 of them from Oxford - is therefore par for the course. So are polls suggesting that the Tory don vote has fallen a third behind the Liberal Democrats - down to a meagre 17 per cent. Might one dare to ask, quite what the dons expect to get out of a Labour government? Jack Straw's spending plans would add 0.7 per cent to the education budget - and even that is to go mainly to primary schools, not Oxbridge high tables. Where are the 100,000 extra students planned for the next decade to go? And who is to teach them? Just as well, perhaps, that Straw was made a visiting fellow of Oxford's Nuffield College before the election.</p>

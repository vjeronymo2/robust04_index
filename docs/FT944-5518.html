			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Guinness trial lawyer convicted A solicitor who acted for one of the defendants in the Guinness trials was himself convicted of fraud yesterday. Mr Simon Easton was found guilty at Southwark Crown Court of submitting false invoices to claim legal fees for a client's divorce. The invoices led to money being removed from the client's business and its pension fund. Mr Easton was a partner with law firm Calow Easton in 1989 when the fraud took place. Among his clients was US lawyer Mr Thomas Ward, who was prosecuted over his role as adviser to Guinness during its 1986 takeover of Distillers. Mr Ward was acquitted last year of the theft of Pounds 5.2m from the drinks company. The solicitor acted for Mr Ward after the former Guinness adviser was arrested and charged but stopped acting for him shortly before the trial started. The court heard that Mr Easton charged a total of Pounds 114,000 in legal fees for handling the Derbyshire businessman's divorce proceedings. However, he submitted three separate invoices - one to the client for Pounds 68,000, a second to the client's company for Pounds 26,000 and a third to the company pension scheme for Pounds 17,000. In his defence, Mr Easton claimed the splitting of the bill had been an honest mistake. Mr Easton was found guilty on 10-2 majority verdicts of three counts of false accounting. He will be sentenced on December 22 and was released on unconditional bail until then. Mr Easton's solicitors said afterwards they would be considering an appeal.</p>

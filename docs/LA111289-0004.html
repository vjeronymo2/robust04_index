			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES TO TAPE  </P> <P> The Quiet Man (TBS Sunday at 9:50 a.m.): John Ford's glorious romantic comedy  set in Ireland and starring John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara, whose red-haired  beauty was perfect for Technicolor. (2:40)  </P> <P> A Star Is Born (Channel 28 Sunday at 2:30 p.m.): Although not as stunning or as  subtle as the 1954 musical version, this 1937 William Wellman version is  nevertheless a potent myth-making entertainment with Janet Gaynor and Fredric  March. (1:30)  </P> <P> The Awful Truth (TMC Wednesday at 8:30 a.m.): Archetypal '30s screwball comedy,  directed by Leo McCarey and starring Irene Dunne, Cary Grant and Ralph Bellamy.  A timeless, scintillating treat. (1:30)  </P> <P> Ride the High Country (Channel 5 Wednesday at 1:30 a.m.): Sam Peckinpah  persuaded Randolph Scott and Joel McCrea to come out of retirement to play old  friends who become adversaries in this wonderful 1962 Western. (2:00)  </P> <P> Thieves Like Us (A&amp;E Saturday at 1 a.m.): Robert Altman's unjustly  neglected 1974 take on the rural '30s gangster movie. Demanding and subtle,  it's a seductive reverie and stars Keith Carradine and Shelley Duvall. (2:30)  </P></p>

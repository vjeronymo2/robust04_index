			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dirk Hoeren report: "FDP: Rebellion Against Minister"] </F>   [Text] Leading Free Democratic Party [FDP] politicians are  angry with FRG Justice Minister Sabine  Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger (FDP, 42)! Some of her party  colleagues resent her criticism of the deportation of violent  Kurds from Bavaria. The minister is of the view that Turkey is  not a "safe country of origin."    Deputy FDP Chairman Wolfgang Gerhardt: "Turkey has signed  the international agreements against torture and the death  penalty. The credibility of our rule-of-law state gets into  danger if violent criminals cannot be deported. It cannot be  that the FRG must accept any acts of violence committed by  foreigners without doing something against that, just because of  the behavior of other countries."    FDP legal expert Burkhard Zurheide: "The Bavarian  authorities are acting correctly. Anyone who commits acts of  violence in our country must be deported as quickly as possible.  We cannot permit the state to be undermined by the deeds of  violent Kurds.    "We also deport criminal foreigners to other countries where  the death penalty still exists. They just have to assure us  that they will not sentence the person in question to death."</p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Hosokawa to cut income tax to stimulate economy THE JAPANESE government yesterday confirmed that it plans to cut income tax early next year in an attempt to stimulate stubbornly poor domestic demand. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, said he would implement tax reform in line with yesterday's long-expected proposals from a government tax panel, for a cut in income tax, to be funded by an increase in consumption tax. Japanese business groups and the US government agree that a cut in income tax is vital to help pull Japan out of recession. The changes are part of a wider overhaul of the tax system, designed to spread the tax burden more evenly and avoid a drop in government tax revenue as the population ages. The panel left the precise size and timing to the government, but economists assume the income tax cut will be worth Y5,000bn (Pounds 31.5bn). That should lift next year's growth by 0.6 per cent, Asahi Bank forecast yesterday. The main recommendations are: The top rate of income and residential taxes combined should be cut to 50 per cent from 65 per cent (of which 50 per cent is income tax and 15 per cent residential). Income tax on low incomes should also be reduced. Tax reform should not worsen Japan's tight fiscal position. Consumption tax should be raised from its current rate of 3 per cent. Food and other necessities should not be exempt. Inheritance taxes should be reviewed to ease burden on transfers of property and companies. Corporate taxation should be reduced.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more or adversely affect in a material way the economy,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with an action taken or planned by another agency;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of recipients thereof; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Executive Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order 12866, it has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been determined that the proposed Federal Implementation Plans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are ``significant regulatory actions''. As such, these actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were submitted to OMB along with regulatory impact assessments of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed actions and salient alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The estimated annualized control cost to meet the Ozone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NAAQS is $150 million in the Sacramento Metro Area as well as in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ventura County with 2005 as the attainment date for both areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The estimated annualized control cost to meet the Ozone NAAQS in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the South Coast Air Basin is $3 to $4 billion with 2010 as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment date. The incremental cost to achieve the Carbon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Monoxide NAAQS in the South Coast Air Basin is zero. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhanced inspection and maintenance provisions to achieve the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ozone NAAQS will together with other acceptable state measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also accomplish the Carbon Monoxide NAAQS objective. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated cost for the enhanced inspection and maintenance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision was reflected in the cost to achieve the Ozone NAAQS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the South Coast. The attainment date for the Carbon Monoxide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NAAQS is 2000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the environmental and economic gains from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Implementation Plans are real and potentially large in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terms of the human population affected as well as the amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> crop and forest acreage affected. Furthermore, because of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jointness of certain control measures, benefits will not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited to reductions in ozone and carbon monoxide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations. Benefits will also accrue in the form of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions in nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter and air toxics  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Scientific and data limitations preclude a quantitative and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comprehensive assessment of benefits. Without such an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment, the Agency cannot determine whether these FIPs are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allocatively efficient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Due to the short deadlines in the court ordered schedule for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rulemaking, OMB did not have time to carry out its normal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review under Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 and 1992 EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidelines require the identification of potentially adverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts of Federal regulations on small entities. Small entities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include small businesses, organizations, and governmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jurisdictions. These proposed rules may adversely affect such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entities. Consequently, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required and has been prepared.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential impact of the proposed rules will vary among  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected entities both large and small. In some cases, cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> savings may accrue to affected entities. In other instances,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost increases may be relatively modest. In other instances,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control costs may exceed 10 percent of anticipated sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, due to uncertainties regarding source identification,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Agency cannot distinguish between small emission sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owned by small entities and those owned by larger firms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, uncertainties in the cost and process economics data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preclude specific findings on where averting and mitigating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures are warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Paperwork Reduction Act requires that a Federal agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepare an Information Collection Request to obtain OMB clearance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for any activity that will involve collecting information from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ten or more non-Federal respondents. The proposed Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Implementation Plans necessitate preparation of an Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Collection Request. The information requirements associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed rules include reporting, monitoring, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recordkeeping and will affect the private sector as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local, state, and Federal authorities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The information collection requirements have been estimated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and summarized in the Information Collection Request and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forwarded to OMB for review and approval under the Paperwork  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Until OMB approves the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Information Collection Request, the reporting, monitoring, and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recordkeeping aspects of these rules are not effective. OMB is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently reviewing the Information Collection Request and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supporting documentation. Given the potential for changes in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elements of the package prior to promulgation, OMB will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approve the Information Collection Request until that time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Federalism Implications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A federalism assessment has not been conducted under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Executive Order 12612. However, federalism effects have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered through the development of the proposed rules and will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to be addressed in the period between proposal and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgation. In particular, the Agency has worked closely with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the local and state authorities to reflect their concerns in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fashioning of these rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

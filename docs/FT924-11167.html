			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / International Bonds: NTT five-year deal favourably received THREE Eurodollar bond offerings emerged yesterday, as borrowers rushed to take advantage of swap opportunities at the short end of the market. Expectations that dollar interest rates are set to rise soon have increased the number of fixed-rate payers keen to lock in rates in the swap market, causing three-year swap spreads to widen sharply. Investor demand for dollar securities remains rather slim, due to the soft tone of the US bond market, although some European retail investors are said to be showing an interest in the sector as a means of taking a view on the currency. Of yesterday's three new issues, Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone's Dollars 200m five-year deal via JP Morgan, priced to yield 44 basis points over the comparable US Treasury, fared the best. The deal was considered fairly priced for a relatively rare, top-quality borrower and avoided the overloaded three-year area of the market, where attractive swap spreads have focused attention. Finnish Export Credit's Dollars 200m three-year deal via Goldman Sachs was considered fairly priced at 99 basis points over the curve, but Finnish credits are currently a difficult sell. Credit Local de France also tapped the three-year area, with a Dollars 200m offering priced at 42 basis points over the curve, which also met sluggish demand. Of the recent batch of three-year offerings, General Electric Capital Corporation's Dollars 200m deal launched at 45 basis points over the curve late last week has already tightened to 37 basis points, but oversupply is hampering further deals. Elsewhere, Northumbrian Water reopened the Eurosterling bond market with a Pounds 100m 10-year issue, which benefited from a rally in the gilts market. Lead manager Credit Suisse First Boston attributed demand from the UK, Asia and Europe to the market's eagerness for current coupon paper. Continental European investors in particular prefer not to take the capital loss involved when buying bonds at a premium to their par value. The deal was priced at 85 basis points over the comparable gilt issue, which was described as slightly aggressive. but right for the environment. Meanwhile, pricing will take place today of a Dollars 200m issue for Grupo Televisa, the Mexican media concern which is making its debut in the international capital markets. Chase Investment Bank is arranging the offering, which is part of Televisa's Dollars 400m Euro-medium term note programme. The bonds will be priced to yield 410 basis points over the five-year Treasury, indicating a coupon of around 10 per cent at a small discount to par. The proceeds will help fund recent acquisitions.</p>

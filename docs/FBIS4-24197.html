			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial published in English] </F>   [Text] The Government's decision to raise the fuel price  has again angered many consumers.    The fuel price bears no relation to what its market price  should be. The reason the price of fuel is so high is because  it is deliberately inflated by Government, in part to fill its  own coffers, and in part because it is obligated towards  protecting inefficient state subsidised industries, such as  Mossgas [Mossel Bay Gas Project] and Sasol [South Africa Coal,  Oil, and Gas Corporation].    Rather than preserving an array of indirect or "hidden"  taxes  -- such as reflected in the fuel price, amongst other prices --  government should make taxes as direct as possible.    At least then the taxes would be more visible, and people  would have a better idea of how much government costs them.  People would no longer be temporarily confused and anguished by  such contrivances as a sharp increase in the state determined  fuel price.    The state could then still use its direct tax revenues for  chosen areas of investment.    One of the mandarins of the old apartheid system, Mineral  and  Energy Affairs Minister Pik Botha, opposes real deregulation of  the fuel price because he believes it will lead to job losses.    This is, basically, an argument that economic inefficiency  should be tolerated as long as some people make money and are  employed as a result.    It is a factor which must be borne in mind when approaching  deregulation. But alone it is not convincing. After all, on  this basis, any kind of activity may be justified, including  digging earth works with teaspoons.    Job creation must instead take place within a process of  both  wealth creation and development. Let the market function  freely, whilst the state directs tax revenues into development.    The fact is that Sasol and Mossgas are white elephants. They  were strategic industries for an economically isolated apartheid  state.    They are no longer important in the way they were. Like  other huge, inefficient, state-erected industries elsewhere in  the world, they must now make the transition towards the market.    In doing so they may well have a market edge in certain  areas, and provide goods and services which consumers want, at  cheaper prices than competitors. If so they will remain viable  enterprises -- in these areas. But other functions probably  deserve to be wound down. The funds released, as stated, could  then be directed into productive avenues -- avenues which  provide both jobs and economic growth we need.    Concomitant fuel deregulation would mean consumers would no  longer be subsidising organisations which should not be in  business. The immediate effect would be a huge drop in our fuel  bill.</p>

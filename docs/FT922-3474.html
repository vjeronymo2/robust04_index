			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market report COCOA prices dropped to fresh 16 1/2 -month lows at the London Futures and Options Exchange yesterday in a continuation of Tuesday's sharp decline. Dealers could find no fundamental reason for the fall, which left the September delivery position Pounds 10 down at Pounds 539 a tonne, Pounds 4 above the day's low. Likewise in the COFFEE market lack of supportive news rather than any notable deterioration in fundamentals was blamed for another sharp fall. The September robustas price closed at Dollars 723 a tonne, down Dollars 11 on the day. 'People just get tired and they sell it down to a level where other people are comfortable to hold on to a few longs for a couple of days,' one trader said. At the London Metal Exchange the recent declines in NICKEL and ALUMINIUM prices were arrested and other contracts closed with modest gains. An upturn in COPPER values quickly ran into resistance at the same dollar level that marked the end of the previous bounce in the middle of last week. The cash price closed at Pounds 1,233.50 a tonne, up Pounds 4.50. Market talk of Chinese selling at the higher levels could not be confirmed although it was sufficient to make buyers cautious.

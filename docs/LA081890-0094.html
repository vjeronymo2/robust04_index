			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESERVISTS CONTACTED ON MEDICAL DUTY  </P> <P> Doctors, nurses and other medical reservists in Southern California and across  the country are being asked to consider serving at military hospitals should  shortages of medical personnel develop because of the Persian Gulf crisis.  </P> <P> An aide to the Army surgeon general in Washington, who declined to be  identified, said that office started the recruitment operation, which he  described as unprecedented in its scope and speed, on Wednesday.  </P> <P> Army Reserve administrators in Santa Ana, San Bernardino and Riverside on  Thursday began calling about 120 medically trained reservists in Southern  California, asking them to decide within 24 hours if they would be willing to  do duty at a U.S.-based hospital.  </P> <P> "What we're doing is developing a contingency plan in the event that the Army  medical staff is used up and moved out to the Middle East," said Walter  Shelton, staff administrator at the Army Hospital in Ventura, which oversees  all local medical reserve units.  </P> <P> Shelton called the response positive but declined to provide figures on how  many have accepted.  </P> <P> Those reservists contacted are being offered a choice of three hospitals. They  could work for a period of three months to perhaps a year.  </P></p>

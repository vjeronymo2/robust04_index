			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the Panamanian elections,  scheduled for 8 May 1994. Source is cited in parentheses  following each item.    Presidential hopeful Ruben Dario Carles said on 8 January  that should he become president, he would be willing "to  negotiate keeping U.S. military bases in Panama." Carles said  "there is a Permanent Neutrality Treaty that allows the United  States to remain in Panama or intervene in our country if it  wants to without having to consult Panama to do so." According  to the presidential hopeful, he would be willing to negotiate an  agreement that would allow the United States "to stay 10 or 15  years in Howard [Air Force Base], Rodman [Naval Station], or  [Fort] Kobbe," provided Panama could export beef, fish, sugar,  and other products as compensation. (Panama City LA PRENSA in  Spanish 10 Jan 94 p 7A)    After the Arnulfist Party (PA) and the Nationalist Liberal  Republican Movement (Molirena) broke off negotiations, PA  President Mireya Moscoso de Gruber announced that conversations  have been under way for several weeks with leaders of the  National Unity Mission (MUN) and the Independent Democratic  Union (UDI) to negotiate an alliance with Moscoso de Gruber as  the presidential candidate. MUN President Jose Manuel Paredes  and UDI President Jacinto Cardenas met on 11 January with  Moscoso de Gruber to discuss details of the presidential slate,  which must be approved by their respective party conventions  scheduled for 23 and 30 January. (Panama City Circuito RPC  Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 11 Jan 94)    Meanwhile, presidential candidate Ruben Blades, of the Papa  Egoro Movement, rejected on 11 January any alliances, as "these  only obey political interests." Blades said he will not seek  alliances or give up his presidential aspirations, saying: "I  cannot transfer the people's support to another person." Blades  also urged the other political parties to present their  platforms, inasmuch as only the Papa Egoro Movement has  presented a government platform. (Panama City Circuito RPC  Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 11 Jan 94)    It has also been reported that Guillermo Ford, another  presidential hopeful, has said the majority of the Molirena  convention delegates will vote for his nomination on 23 January.  Ford has reiterated that if he is nominated, "he will not yield  the presidential nomination to any alliance." Ford has added  that Molirena, the Christian Democratic Party (PDC), and the  Solidarity Party will possibly form an alliance and that there  is no reason to fear the Democratic Revolutionary Party.  (Panama City Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 11 Jan  94)    The Electoral Tribunal magistrates and the Justice and Peace  Commission members met recently to coordinate their work so that  the May elections will be held "in an atmosphere of peace and  calm." Commission member Bishop Jose Luis Lacunza has warned  that political and social differences "must not be solved  through violence," and he voiced fears about the many firearms  in the hands of civilians. (Panama City Circuito RPC Television  in Spanish 2300 GMT 11 Jan 94)    The Electoral Tribunal on 11 January decided that the  Popular  Alliance (AP) will be unable to participate in the May  elections, rejecting its recognition, as it nullified the  conventions held by two conflicting factions in October 1993.  One faction is led by Omayra "Mayin" Correa and her sister,  Noris Correa, while the other faction is led by Matilde Mendez  and Tomas Gonzalez. The Electoral Tribunal has said that the  two factions have violated the Electoral Code several times.  (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 12 Jan 94 pp 1A, 8C)    PA President Mireya Moscoso de Gruber has disclosed that the  Authentic Liberal Party (PLA), the UDI, and the AP have  confirmed they will ally themselves with the PA. The Popular  Nationalist Party (PNP) and the MUN will reach a decision on 16  January. Gruber has also said that if Molirena remembers that  the Arnulfists will head the presidential ticket, "negotiations  could be resumed." (Panama City EL PANAMA AMERICA in Spanish 12  Jan 94 pp 1A, 8C)    The AP faction led by Matilde Mendez has appealed the  Electoral Tribunal's decision not to recognize the party, noting  that the Tribunal has not fully considered all of the evidence,  which shows Mrs. Mendez should be recognized as party president.  Electoral Tribunal Magistrate Guillermo Marquez has announced  that the tribunal will "study the request for a reconsideration  of the tribunal's ruling." (Panama City Telemetro Television  Network in Spanish 1730 GMT 12 Jan 94)    Molirena legislators are trying to get one of their two  presidential hopefuls--Ruben Dario Carles or Guillermo Ford--to  give up his presidential aspirations. The legislators met on 12  January with Carles to analyze his candidacy, while they met on  13 January with Ford to exchange viewpoints. RPC Television has  learned the legislators are requesting that Ford decline, as  Carles seems to have more support within the party.    Meanwhile, members of the Social Christian Unity Movement, a  dissident faction within the PDC, insist they will support  Carles, and they feel that any alliance nominating PDC leader  Ricardo Arias Calderon does not stand a chance. (Panama City  Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 11 Jan 94)    Panamanians should be very careful about poll results, and  these "should be taken with a grain of salt," Tomas Herrera,  president of the Civic Renewal Party, has said, adding that his  party has never been included in these polls. (Panama City  Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 11 Jan 94)    PDC presidential candidate Ricardo Arias Calderon has  demanded "urgent changes" in various departments of the Attorney  General's Office; otherwise, drug trafficking "might take over  this government office." Arias Calderon said the Panamanian  people seriously mistrust the Attorney General's Office, and the  president of the Republic must do something. (Panama City  Circuito RPC Television in Spanish 2300 GMT 11 Jan 94)    The PDC presidential candidate, Ricardo Arias Calderon, has  also said the law enforcing authorities should remain  apolitical. Arias Calderon has said: "I think it is very  important that the National Police should stay out of politics."  The institution was created to protect all Panamanians, Arias  Calderon said during a meeting with young professionals,  students, and workers. He also downplayed the results of recent  polls, adding that 60 percent of the voters are still undecided.  (Panama City Telemetro Television Network in Spanish 1730 GMT  14 Jan 94)</p>

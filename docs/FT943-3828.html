			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Hong Kong Last Friday's US inflation figures, which were released after the local market had closed, will be at the centre of attention today in the colony, where the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to itse US counterpart and interest rate movements are closely shadowed, writes Louise Lucas. Brokers had been looking for the market to surge following last week's break through the 10,000 level, buoyed by a return of liquidity. Both Japanese and American money poured into the market last week, partially oiled by the perceived improvement in US-China relations after the visit to Beijing by the US commerce secretary, Mr Ron Brown. Corporate issues will return to the fore towards the end of the week, when the Jardine group kicks off its interim results. Jardine International Motors reports on Wednesday, Dairy Farm on Thursday, and Mandarin Oriental and Hongkong Land on Friday. Market participants will be interested to see if the four elect to follow the parent, Jardine Matheson, and Jardine Strategic Holdings, and delist from the Hong Kong stock exchange in favour of the Singapore exchange at the beginning of next year.

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Markets: Perot's campaign upsets the Apple cart - Wall Street THE Vice President was in town this week on his annual bash-the-Big-Apple campaign, but it was that other giant of contemporary politics, Ross Perot, who ended up doing the most damage to New York's sense of well-being. Such is the would-be-president Perot's current stature, it was nothing he did or said that put the collywobbles up the stock market this week, but what he might do in the autumn elections that troubled Wall Street the most. In the space of three days the Dow Jones index dropped 80 points, or 2.4 per cent, in part because of the wildly uncertain political climate that Perot has done so much to create. While there were plenty of other factors behind the decline in prices - of which, more later - this week was the first time that Perot was widely mentioned as a market-moving influence. It is difficult at the moment to come up with any hard reasons why investors should fear Perot, either as candidate or as President. He has said precious little about what he might do if elected, and the usual platitudes about getting America back on its feet have hardly added up to an economic policy deserving of Wall Street's scrutiny. Yet his unsettling presence on the political scene, and the trouble he has been giving the Bush White House, have undermined the market's confidence in its ability to correctly gauge the political future. Perot's apparent popularity - several recent polls showed that he would take California from Bush and Clinton if an election were held now - has forced investors to re-evaluate their long-held yet increasingly shaky forecast that George Bush will win the election this November. After all, Bush's successful re-election was priced into equities as far back as the Gulf War, when the master of the New World Order was riding high in the polls with 80 per cent-plus approval ratings. Only now, with Bush down at 35 per cent in the approval ratings, are investors realising that it may be time to give back some of that generous discount. Even Perot in one of his hyper-confident moods, however, cannot claim all the credit for the market's decline this week. The entrails of the US economy continue to provide uninspiring reading. On the bright side, housing starts jumped 11 per cent in May, the biggest rise in more than a year. On the darker side, however, there was a puny 0.6 per cent increase in May industrial production, a smaller-than-expected 2,000 drop in weekly jobless claims, and a widening in the monthly trade deficit, which rose from Dollars 5.6bn in March to Dollars 7bn in April. The trade numbers were especially worrying in that they suggested second quarter real gross domestic product growth will probably not break 2 per cent as expected, and will certainly come in below the 2.4 per cent growth achieved in the first three months of the year. The strength of overseas demand for US-made goods has been one of the few bright spots during the past year. The biggest of the foreign economies, however, are now either contracting or stagnating. Over the short-term they cannot be expected to provide much additional momentum to the domestic US recovery, although the recent weakness in the dollar (down 6 per cent against the D-Mark and more than 5 per cent against the Yen in the past six weeks) may provide some compensation. If the economic outlook offers investors little cause for celebration, US monetary policy is likely to be equally unaccommodating. Wednesday's release of the Federal Reserve's 'Beige Book', its report on nationwide business conditions, offered only frustration for policy watchers. The picture the book painted of the economy lived up to the bland colour of its cover: neither bullish enough to suggest corporate earnings might pick up sharper than expected, nor bearish enough to suggest the Fed might be prompted into another interest rate cut. If interest rates are staying where they are, if the recovery remains lethargic, and if the billionaire Texan continues to muddy the political waters, then the stock market could be in for a long, hot summer. But one the market's hottest stocks of the past year, Telefonos de Mexico, ran into some heavy selling this week following sharp declines in its home market. That man Perot was again partly to blame, say analysts. His protectionist tendencies have cast a cloud over the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Mexican investors believe is so vital to their country's economic future.  ---------------------------------------- Monday      3354.90    +     0.54 Tuesday     3329.49    -    25.41 Wednesday   3287.76    -    41.73 Thursday    3274.12    -    13.64 Friday      3285.35    +    11.23  ----------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Crisis in the UK Economy: Tory middle ground applauds slowdown - Ivo Dawnay and Alison Smith gauge backbench views on John Major's European policy IT TOOK that always rare creature, a fully paid-up Tory intellectual, to make the simple but perhaps most revealing observation. After the French Yes vote, MP Mr David Willetts, one-time director of the Centre for Policy Studies, remarked that the prime minister was now sounding a great deal less gung-ho on Europe than he had done after the Danish No vote in June. Much the same could be said for the vast bulk of Conservative MPs who regard themselves as neither Euro-sceptic nor Euro-enthusiast. Plucky little Denmark can bleat as much as it likes. But when the pound has been sandbagged by the D-Mark and the French  - quintessential apologists for the European Community  - express doubts, then the ramifications are profound. Talking to a selection of backbench MPs not clearly identified with either camp in the great Maastricht debate demonstrated yesterday that Mr John Major was wise in his decision to put on the brakes. Initial inquiries showed a surprising consistency in opinions on the central consequences of the past week. First, not one of the five MPs contacted had dissented from the economic and European policies peddled by the government up to just a week ago. None, also, would level criticism either at the prime minister or the chancellor for the conduct of those policies or the attempt to see them through, in spite of Black Wednesday. All also endorsed Mr Major's call for a summit and his warnings that the UK could not go back into the European exchange rate mechanism until it was reformed. Acknowledging that the events had proved a watershed, three of the five agreed that if the consequences mean Britain must now accept life in the slow lane of a two-speed Europe, then so be it. Caution was the watchword. Mr Willetts, MP for Havant, argued that party feeling was 'not a mood to rush into a ringing endorsement' of Maastricht. He thought the domestic circumstances of Germany and France made the prospect of a two-tier Europe less likely than it had seemed in the past. Another member of the new intake, Mr Edward Garnier, MP for Harborough, took a similar view, claiming that the ambivalence of the French referendum result had 'altered the scenery'. He added: 'There is scepticism in France and concern in Germany about the D-Mark. The road towards union has steepened and hairpin bends have been put in the track.' Everything would now slow down. Only one of the MPs interviewed admitted to having made a 180-degree turn into outright opposition to the Maastricht blueprint. Mr Gary Streeter, MP for Plymouth Sutton, confessed to having shifted 'dramatically' over three months into the No camp. 'A close federation will end in tears,' he said. 'There is no heart in this country for political and economic union.' If Britain were to return to the ERM it could only be on the basis of an entirely reformed system where flexibility was emphasised. Even that Mr Streeter regarded as unlikely, urging that the government instead seize the opportunity to lower interest rates and stimulate industry with tax incentives. While accepting the inevitability of Britain's ERM withdrawal, Mr Peter Atkinson, MP for Hexham, confessed that the UK would now have a more volatile and less stable economy. He added: 'If Britain's European partners are not prepared to alter the system, we cannot go back to it.' In the present circumstances, Mr Willetts said he believed that the priority must be to establish a credible financial framework that can deliver low inflation. His own preference would be for a return to monetary targets. Unlike those of his colleagues who are panting for dramatic cuts in interest rates, Mr Willetts is expecting the government to strike a 'sober' note on future reductions, in Thursday's emergency Commons debate on the economy. 'Having been on a starvation diet, we can't go on a binge,' he said. Such a pragmatic approach among the new intake of MPs appears to endorse the prime minister's approach in the wake of the currency turmoil and the French plebiscite. It also gells with the views of a veteran observer of the international scene, Mr David Howell, Tory chairman of the cross-party foreign affairs committee. He interprets events as pointing towards 'if not an actual precise renegotiation of the Maastricht treaty, then a whole range of modifications to it  - add-ons and codicils  - to bring it into the sort of shape needed to address the situation that has now emerged'. The Tory party, he said, wanted a positive path out of the difficulties. 'If the new policy of rethinking Maastricht is now developed with vigour, I think the party will follow that.'</p>

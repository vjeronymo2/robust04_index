			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEFENSE / PORT CALL;  </P> <P> U.S., SINGAPORE HAGGLE OVER MILITARY ACCORD;  </P> <P> WHO GETS LEGAL JURISDICTION OVER AMERICAN PERSONNEL COULD BE A STICKING POINT.  </P> <P> When a U.S. naval task force led by the carrier Midway steamed into Singapore's  harbor last month on its way to the Middle East, it was an indication of the  close military relationship that Washington enjoys with this tiny island  nation.  </P> <P> But the visit of several thousand U.S. sailors was also a reminder that despite  more than a year of negotiations, the two countries have been unable to resolve  their differences over a formal agreement granting the United States increased  access to military facilities in Singapore.  </P> <P> A Western diplomat familiar with the talks said an agreement was "90%  completed," but the remaining 10% could take several more months of  negotiations to resolve.  </P> <P> Under the proposed agreement, the United States would have permanent access to  naval shipyard facilities in Singapore to service its vessels. It would also  keep a squadron of F-16s on virtual constant rotation at Paya Lebar airfield, a  joint military-civilian air base.  </P> <P> The agreement would provide for the stationing of 180 to 200 U.S. military  personnel permanently in Singapore, although both U.S. and Singapore officials  have studiously avoided the word bases in referring to the arrangement. The  U.S. Navy now maintains a staff of just 10 sailors in Singapore to provide  supplies to visiting ships.  </P> <P> The talks with Singapore come at a time when the Philippine government has made  clear its determination to take over control of two big U.S. bases -- Clark Air  Base and Subic Bay Naval Base -- when their leases expire next September.  </P> <P> When Singapore proposed that the United States make greater use of its  facilities in 1989, it said the main reason was to show Philippine President  Corazon Aquino that it is willing to share the burden of an American military  presence in the region. But the proposal immediately caused an outcry in  neighboring Indonesia and Malaysia that has only recently died down.  </P> <P> Singapore is still a firm proponent of a stable U.S. military presence in the  region.  </P> <P> According to Western diplomats and Singapore officials, the main sticking point  in the facilities talks is the question of legal jurisdiction over sailors and  airmen while they are on Singapore territory. The United States wants the  Singaporeans to hand over lawbreakers to face trial under U.S. military law.  </P> <P> But Singapore has refused to relinquish jurisdiction. Officials said they are  particularly sensitive about Singapore's drug laws, among the toughest in the  world, which provide for the death penalty for possession of small amounts of  heroin and other narcotics.  </P> <P> Diplomats said the possibility of U.S. military personnel being put to death  for infractions considered relatively minor in the United States could make  getting the deal through Congress difficult.  </P> <P> A Singapore official said his government will not relinquish its jurisdiction  but might agree to consult with U.S. authorities before charges are brought  against any serviceman.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA has also evaluated the information submitted by Calgene concerning soil microorganisms and agrees with Calgene that there would be no increase in kanamycin-resistant soil microorganisms because it is highly unlikely that the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene could move from the plant genome into soil microorganisms via horizontal gene transfer. Further, the agency has determined that, even if such transfer could occur, the rate at which it could occur is such that it would not result in a detectable increase over the existing background population of kanamycin-resistant bacteria (Ref. 36). Based on the foregoing, FDA has concluded that the use of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene does not pose safety concerns in terms of increase in the population of antibiotic-resistant pathogens due to the potential for horizontal transfer of the gene. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Response to Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA received 47 comments on Calgene's request for an advisory opinion on the use of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene in the development of new varieties of tomato, oilseed rape, and cotton plants. Comments were received from members of academia, industry and industry-related organizations, State and Federal agencies, environmental groups and other nonprofit organizations, and individual consumers. Additionally, several comments on the agency's 1992 policy statement addressed the use of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most of the comments supported the use of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene in crop development, stating that there were no health or environmental issues precluding its use. Several comments expressed opinions on a wide range of issues including regulatory approaches for genetically engineered foods, concerns relating to human and animal food safety, and to the environmental effects of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene, and whether foods containing the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene and APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II should be specially labeled. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Regulatory Issues <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some comments stated that it was not appropriate for FDA to evaluate the safety of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene and APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II under an advisory opinion and that the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene and APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II should be treated as food additives by FDA. FDA has discussed above the basis for its decision not to regulate the DNA that makes up the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene itself as a food additive. Further, in light of Calgene's conversion of its request for advisory opinion on the use of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene to a food additive petition, the comment concerning the regulation of APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II as a food additive no longer requires a response. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Food Safety <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several comments stated that the presence in food of APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II raised no food safety concerns whatsoever. Others questioned whether Calgene had supplied adequate data to ensure the safety of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> kan <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  gene and gene product, APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II, when present in food. The substantive questions raised are discussed in sections IV.B.1 through 5 of this document. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Glycosylation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two comments stated that APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II might be glycosylated (i.e., might contain sugar molecules attached to the protein via the amino acid asparagine (N-linked) or via the amino acids serine, threonine, or hydroxyproline (O-linked)) when produced in tomatoes or other plants and, therefore, might become a food allergen. One of the comments asserted that for this reason, Calgene should be required to test whether APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II is glycosylated. The comments, however, did not provide any information showing that glycosylated APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II is likely to be, or is, allergenic. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At this time, FDA is unaware of any practical method to predict or assess the potential for new proteins in food to induce allergenicity. Although many food allergens that have been characterized at a structural level are glycosylated (Ref. 37), the agency is not aware of any information on structural or other properties of glycosylated proteins that would be predictive of their allergenicity. As noted, the comments did not provide such information. Moreover, glycosylated proteins are widespread in food. For these reasons, glycosylation is not a useful positive predictor of a potential allergenic effect. Accordingly, FDA did not request that Calgene determine whether APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II is glycosylated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nevertheless, in a submission dated October 24, 1991, entitled ``Response to Public Comments,'' Calgene addressed whether APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II is likely to be glycosylated and concluded that it is not. Calgene noted that APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II lacks the amino terminal sequence of amino acids (commonly referred to as a ``signal peptide'') that is necessary to direct the protein into the cellular compartments where glycosylation occurs. Calgene also asserted that the unchanged molecular weight of APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II in plants (relative to the molecular weight of bacterial APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II, which is not glycosylated) supports the conclusion that APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II is not glycosylated in plants. Finally, Calgene stated that the amino acid sequence (asparagine-X-serine/threonine) that is required to direct N-linked glycosylation to specific asparagine moieties is not present in APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II. (Calgene noted that a corresponding argument for the lack of the appropriate amino acid sequence to direct O-linked glycosylation cannot be made because the sequences that direct O-linked glycosylation have not been defined.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA has considered the information and arguments submitted in the comments and Calgene's response and has concluded that the available evidence indicates that APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II is not glycosylated in plants. However, even if glycosylation had been demonstrated, FDA emphasizes that glycosylation alone does not necessarily establish that APH(3 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;)II is likely to produce an allergenic response because the positive predictive value of glycosylation with respect to the potential for inducing allergenicity has not been demonstrated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

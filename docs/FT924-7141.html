			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Credit card holders losing out CREDIT CARD holders have seen a drop of only 4.7 percentage points in the cost of their borrowing in the past two years, according to figures supplied by the Credit Card Research Group, compared with a drop of 8 percentage points in base rates. Base rates are now 7 per cent, but the average interest rate paid by credit card holders is 25 per cent APR (annualised percentage rate) and many store card holders are paying well above this. The group, members of which include banks and building societies, said the average credit card rate was 29.7 per cent APR in October 1990 - before base rates fell that month from 15 per cent to 14 per cent. Ms Elizabeth Phillips, the group's director says that only 40 per cent to 50 per cent of the cost of running a credit card is related to the issuer's cost of funds. The other 50 per cent to 60 per cent represents fixed costs of administering the card and dealing with fraud. Store card borrowing is even more expensive and has been highlighted by the Consumers' Association as credit to be avoided. Customers at Harrods, the exclusive London store owned by House of Fraser, are paying 34.4 per cent APR - the same rate as in January 1990 - although the rate will drop to 29.8 per cent APR from December 1. About a third of the business transacted at House of Fraser stores is through its storecards. The company said: 'Almost everyone who has a Harrods store card clears it on a monthly basis. People are well aware of their own self-interest and use cards for convenience rather than credit.' Customers who clear their store card each month pay no interest. The card offered by John Lewis Partnership aims to undercut interest rates on other store cards. It reduced its rates last month for the first time since February 1990 to 19.5 per cent APR from 23.8 per cent APR. Banks, building societies and high street stores are often slow to make changes in rates. Base rates have changed 14 times since January 1990, but few institutions have changed their rates more than a couple of times in the same time. Credit card issuers say they are struggling to make a profit. Credit card and charge card fraud has increased steeply. However, Ms Jean Eaglesham of the Consumers' Association believes the institutions are squeezing the personal sector. 'They are relying on customer inertia and will charge as much as they can get away with,' she said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Washington-based correspondent Chin Chang-ho] </F>   [Text] An official from the North Korean UN mission met  with U.S. State Department officials at the UN Headquarters in  New York at 1000 on 3 December and conveyed the official North  Korean position regarding the permission to inspect part of  North Korea's nuclear sites by the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA]. This is North Korea's affirmative response [as  published] to the 24 November U.S. demand that North Korea allow  nuclear inspections in the first place, as agreed upon by the  ROK and the United States in their Washington summit. This  affirmative response of North Korea could represent a  significant step forward toward resolving the North Korean  nuclear issue.    The unofficial North Korea-U.S. contact on 3 December was  attended by Thomas Hubbard, deputy assistant secretary of state  for East Asia and Pacific affairs; Kenneth Quinones, official in  charge of North Korean affairs of the State Department; and Ho  Chong, deputy head of North Korea's UN mission. The contact  lasted about two hours. THE WASHINGTON POST reported that the  U.S.-North Korean contact in New York was a very positive one  and that significant progress was made regarding the IAEA  inspection and the nuclear inspection monitoring cameras  installed in the nuclear facilities in Yongbyon. The paper  reported that a U.S. official said that further discussions with  the North Korean side are necessary as to the specific points.    The paper reported that the U.S. State Department officials  proposed that President Bill Clinton and the IAEA closely  discuss the North Korean proposal contained in the 3 December  response.    The paper reported that the U.S. officials said that a more  specific review ought to be made as to the technical matters  connected with the appropriateness of the new inspection and  that the United States will discuss the overall situation with  the ROK before it sends an official reply to North Korea.    U.S. State Department spokeswoman Shelley, in a routine  briefing on that day, said that an unofficial contact was made  between the United States and North Korea based on the latter's  2 December request for a contact in New York. She added that  the U.S. Government will first discuss the response with its  allies before it makes a decision on the next step toward North  Korea.    It has been learned that the U.S. State Department's  decision  on the next step means the resumption of the New York contact  next week.    The ROK Embassy in Washington hinted that although the North  Korean response in the North Korea-U.S. contact was far short of  U.S. expectations, it was not totally pessimistic.</p>

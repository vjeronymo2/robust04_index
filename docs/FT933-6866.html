			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / TUC may fine unions that poach workers: Tough penalties proposed to combat rivalry ANY TUC trade union poaching members from another union could face heavy financial penalties under plans aimed at preventing conflict between rivals. A tough system of fines by the TUC is proposed in a confidential consultative document sent to union general secretaries. It is designed to operate after November 30 this year when workers will be given the legal right to join the union of their choice. The document calls for a TUC body to be set up to judge poaching cases if conciliation fails. It would be headed by a legally qualified director backed by two outside experts and serviced by TUC staff. The TUC previously suspended or expelled unions refusing to accept rules covering inter-union relations aimed at preventing competition and ensuring stability. This is its first suggestion for imposing financial punishments on defiant unions. The TUC has always fought any move by the state to inflict financial penalties on trade unions. The document says: 'A new system of penalties might be developed based not on requiring the exclusion of members or on rescinding of agreements but on financial damages and compensation.' This would be linked to the loss of income to a union for one or two years. The document does not specify the amount of such fines. Other proposed sanctions against a union found guilty of poaching would be censure by the TUC general council or the annual congress. The TUC would also refuse to act on any complaint by an offending union until its case had been resolved. In a further policy departure, the TUC proposes encouraging trade union mergers. Under the new Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act, a worker has a legal right not to be either excluded or expelled from a union unless he or she fails to satisfy union rules restricting membership to people employed in a specialised trade, industry or occupation. The TUC warns in the paper that unions could be dragged 'increasingly into inter-union skirmishes and wars' if they failed to adapt to the legislation. 'An increase in inter-union conflict would feed the growing hostility to collective bargaining and recognition among a growing number of employers and fuel the fashion for arguing the smart thing to do is to get rid of unions,' it says. The document explains that under the new law 'a disaffected group of members will be able to apply for membership of another union and, provided they are qualified for membership, the other union must accept their application whether it wishes to or not and must provide representation and services.' The TUC would, however, still try to stop unions organising recruitment campaigns among the members of its rivals.</p>

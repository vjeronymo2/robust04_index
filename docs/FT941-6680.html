			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Independent staff urge MMC probe Journalists at The Independent newspaper called yesterday for a full Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation of the bid for its owner by a consortium which includes Mirror Group Newspapers. The appeal came in a formal statement to the Department of Trade and Industry yesterday from the National Union of Journalists branch at the paper, which represents 270 journalists out of 340 eligible editorial staff. The journalists accused Mr Andreas Whittam Smith and the other founders of The Independent of abandoning the paper's principles. The statement said: 'If ever a takeover bid called for the impartial, public scrutiny of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission this one does.' The consortium - which groups MGN with The Independent's founders, El Pas of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy - has made an improved offer for the shares of Newspaper Publishing, owner of the two titles, valuing the company at Pounds 73m. The NUJ yesterday criticised the view of the consortium that an MMC investigation should be waived on the grounds that it is 'a matter of great urgency'. It said: 'The degree of interest from other quarters suggests the exact opposite.' The journalists argue that if the plight of the newspapers really is urgent all the leading shareholders including Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of Independent Newspapers of Ireland which holds 29.9 per cent, should try to reach agreement on working together. Newspaper Publishing is still awaiting an improved cash alternative to the consortium offer before it can become a recommended bid. Independent journalists believe redundancy terms may be causing a delay.</p>

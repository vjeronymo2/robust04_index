			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION political editor] </F>   [Text] The Prime Minister was engaged in an amazing Downing  Street verbal brawl today with Dr Ian Paisley, in his biggest  battle yet over the joint peace declaration on Ulster's future.  Tempers became so frayed that at one point Mr Major banged the  declaration down on the table in front of him. But officials  fiercely denied Dr Paisley's claim that Mr Major was "throwing  papers around."    It was the kind of rowdy setback to the Downing Street  declaration that everyone expected. In fact, some observers  were astonished that the meeting ran its full 30 minute course.  They assumed Dr Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionists,  would have stormed out within the first few minutes.    And there was plainly no prospect that the Prime Minister  could influence Dr Paisley's implacable stand against the  declaration and the peace process, which he had already  denounced as "a sham and a deceit."    The meeting was destined to be a shouting match from the  moment Dr Paisley, and his colleagues, Peter Robinson and  William McCrea, strode into the Prime Minister's study. It was  the first "formal" meeting between Mr Major and Dr Paisley since  the declaration was proclaimed on December 15.    The versions of the stormy encounter from Downing Street and  from Dr Paisley did not tally in all respects -- but what was  clear from both accounts was that this was the biggest row  Downing Street has seen for years. Their reports left the  impression that Dr Paisley was roaring like a bull -- and that  the Prime Minister's own voice was more than once untypically  raised in anger. Although this was not the sort of  confrontation the Prime Minister relishes, there is a widespread  feeling that he was well-prepared for an onslaught. It will  make not the slightest difference to his faith in the  Declaration.    In other developments today:     -  Northern Ireland Secretary,  Sir Patrick Mayhew, repeated there could be no negotiations in  return for a temporary IRA ceasefire;    -  Foreign Secretary Douglas  Hurd, speaking in Dublin, underlined that all-party talks on the  Province's future still offered the best path to peace, despite  the Unionist threat to boycott any new discussions.    But the Downing Street row dominated. Afterwards, Dr Paisley  said that Mr Major was "very, very angry."    "It was a very rough meeting. I have never seen the Prime  Minister more angry. I had to raise my voice in order that the  Prime Minister could hear because he was shouting so loudly," he  said.    Dr Paisley said he urged Mr Major to abandon the declaration  and made clear he would make it the main issue at the  Euro-elections in June. The Prime Minister, he said, was  "throwing papers around -- he must have thrown them around three  or four times or more."    "We served notice on him that we were seeking a mandate from  the people of Northern Ireland against the joint declaration in  June," said Dr Paisley. "He said he wanted to have peace. We  told him that you don't have peace with surrender. He was very,  very angry. He refused even to listen to the points we were  making. He abandoned the meeting and said we would have to meet  again."    Dr Paisley described the declaration as "a rotten, sinking  vessel which is going down now in confusion."    Junior Northern Ireland minister Michael Ancram confirmed  that the meeting was "very frank" and Mr Major made his views  known "forcibly." He added: "The Prime Minister took Mr Paisley  to task for misrepresenting the declaration on a number of  occasions."    Downing Street said Dr Paisley handed over a submission, "a  printed piece of paper about his view of things." Officials  said he denounced the declaration as "iniquitous" and utterly  rejected it as a "farce" -- a description the Prime Minister  called "rubbish."    And as Dr Paisley continued to condemn the declaration, the  Prime Minister took the opportunity to point out that he had a  mandate from the people of the United Kingdom. Mr Major said  they wanted all the constitutional parties to take part in the  talks.    Dr Paisley and Mr Robinson continued expressing their  hostility to the declaration "in rather loud terms."    The Prime Minister said he had been very patient with Dr  Paisley but had had enough of listening to his misrepresentation  of the declaration. "Dr Paisley continued to misrepresent the  declaration and Mr Robinson then accused the Prime Minister of  giving way to violence. The Prime Minister retorted by saying  how could he justify that statement when the Government  maintained nearly 20,000 troops in Northern Ireland."    Mr Major was said to have been "very calm, very firm,  extremely tough and vigorous." But officials afterwards claimed  it was probably salutary that Dr Paisley had been given a  "correct interpretation" of the declaration.    Mr Hurd, said after hour-long talks in Dublin with Irish  Foreign Minister Dick Spring that fresh talks were "the only way  in which progress was going to be likely." He said: "We all  know this is a difficult path and that it will not be easy.  That has been proved over and over again. But the status  quo...is not acceptable either. We all have a duty to find ways  of making progress. And we -- the two governments -- believe  the talks offer the best way. So we intend to pursue that path."    Mr Hurd said the peace declaration was not a "bargaining  offer."    And Sir Patrick repeated that there could be no negotiations  in return for a temporary IRA ceasefire. A temporary ceasefire  carried the risk that the terrorists would start their campaign  again, he said in Newcastle, Co [County] Down.</p>

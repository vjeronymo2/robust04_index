			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: Reliance Group to sell life operations RELIANCE Group, the quoted insurance company, is trying to sell its life insurance operations in an attempt to bolster its capital base. The company said negotiations had produced two potential buyers - the first of which offered to pay about Dollars 525m. However, Reliance said, it was not possible to agree terms with this potential purchaser, and negotiations with a second bidder - at a higher price - had started. The first potential buyer is now suing. Reliance maintains the litigation is 'without merit'.</p>

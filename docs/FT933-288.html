			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (19): Practical visionary / Profile of Hernando de Soto CHANGES have started to happen in Peru since the mid-1980s, when Mr Hernando de Soto published one of the most influential works on political economy ever to emerge from Latin America - but not influential enough for de Soto's liking. De Soto has demonstrated the power of the word. His book excoriated the authoritarianism and the corruption of government in Peru, but its name, The Other Path, together with its message, threw down the gauntlet in the direction of Shining Path, the brutal Maoist revolutionary movement which threatened the Peruvian state. One evening in July last year, as de Soto sat in his office in Lima's Miraflores district, Shining Path tried and to blow him and his organisation, the Institute of Liberty and Democracy (ILD) out of existence with a 400kg car bomb. The attempt failed. De Soto's achievement was to see, in Lima's teeming millions of hawkers and hustlers, not the dubious activities of marginals but the great mainstream of history. He examined the consequences of the migration from country to cities over the last 40 years, which has quintupled Peru's urban population. Drawing parallels with the emergence of capitalism in Europe in the 19th century, de Soto described Peru as a mercantilist state in which most participants in the formal economy were concerned not with the creation of wealth but rather with the extraction of favours from government. This mercantilist system, bolstered by governments of both the left and the right in Peru, resulted in thousands of regulations which effectively forced most of the new migrants to work outside the formal economy. Yet it was a mistake to see only chaos in the shanty towns around Lima: internal rules were established; rights over property were often recognised, and a system of security established. De Soto estimates that there are 30 informal banking systems in the country. From an economic standpoint, the problem with this is that it is tremendously inefficient. To use de Soto's metaphor, it condemns individuals to an existence in small pools. By bringing these people into the formal economy by means of big deregulation, they will be able to join the river. Thus one of the book's central messages was a plea to unleash the energy of the informal sector by abandoning the mercantilist approach which has linked government with the private sector in Peru for so long. The informal system 'shows us that what Peruvians want, first and foremost, is firm property rights, reliable transactions and secure activities.' De Soto estimates that 92 per cent of all rural land holdings in Peru are not in the formal economy sector. Similarly, 60 per cent of urban land holdings are untitled. Land makes up 80 per cent of the assets of all Peruvians - and more than 90 per cent of the assets of the poor. De Soto argues that being able to establish formal title over property is the key to prosperity, as it was in Britain in the second half of the 19th century. If things have begun to change since he wrote his book, it is partly because de Soto's organisation is pursuing land titling. Using simple forms and computers, some 100,000 land titles have been registered in the last 15 months. While this is only a start, De Soto says the titling has been done more quickly and much more cheaply (Dollars 8 per title) than in similar exercises elsewhere in Latin America. Only 5 per cent of claims have been the subject of dispute. In zones where the ILD have carried out titling campaigns, the price of property has doubled immediately, and should continue to rise over time. He says that terrorists have moved out (although not necessarily their political organisations) and the level of violence has fallen. And banks have moved in - because the titles provide physical evidence of ownership and security for lenders. Another practical consequence of The Other Path has been the successful campaign to bring the thousands of companies operating in the informal sector into the formal sector, through cheap and quick registration procedures. As an example for the book, ILD's researchers, in the summer of 1983, had attempted to establish an imaginary clothing factory - legally. It took a group of them 289 days of full-time labour. It cost Dollars 1,231, including expenses and lost income; the equivalent of 32 minimum monthly wages. Bribes were solicited on 10 occasions, but only two were paid. Setting up a street kiosk required 43 days and Dollars 590. Now the procedures require one day and the payment of a small fee. Although moving into the formal sector brings the risk of having to pay taxes, says de Soto, it allows small entrepreneurs to avoid paying bribes and, for example, to advertise their existence to potential new customers. As daily lines for registration continue to form outside the ministry of industry, the number of businesses being registered has grown from 2,000 a month in 1990 to 11,000 a month now. But if these have been modest successes for de Soto, there have been setbacks. He was formerly President Alberto Fujimori's special adviser on drugs; he resigned last year, frustrated at the lack of progress of his plans. He had brought together 182 local leaders from the remote areas where coca, the raw material for producing cocaine, is grown. The idea was to drive a wedge between the traffickers, who would continue to be hunted, and the growers, who would not be touched. After Mr Fujimori's auto-golpe on April 5 last year, however, de Soto's plans began to run into the sand. If he is less than sanguine about the long-term impact of the drugs trade on those areas of the country where 1.6m people earn a living from the coca plant, he credits the Fujimori government with making progress on the economic front and introducing some deregulation. He favours privatisation of inefficient state enterprises - a policy the government is pursuing aggressively. Yet while change has begun, most Peruvians have not noticed it. 'Deregulation has taken place at the top; yet there has been little or no deregulation at the level of the poor,' de Soto says.</p>

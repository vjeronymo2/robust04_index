			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Srinivas Laxman: "DRDO May Develop </F> Anti-ballistic Missiles"]    [Text] Bombay, December 25--The Defence Research and  Development Organisation (DRDO) is currently carrying out a  feasibility study to develop what is known as an "anti-ballistic  missile system."    The aim of this system is to guard against incoming missiles  from rival countries.    The first hint of such a project came from the chief of air  staff, Air Chief Marshal, S.K. Kaul, who expressed the need of  an "anti missile-missile system," while addressing a news  conference at Avia-India 93, during the Bangalore air show, last  week.    Subsequent inquiries made by this correspondent with  aerospace scientists at the air show threw light on the fact  that a feasibility study for such a project was being carried  out.    They, however, emphasised that no firm decision as yet had  been taken regarding the matter.    The final decision, as with other projects, lay with the  Union cabinet which would go into all aspects, particularly the  financial implications and the political fallout, before giving  the green signal, they said.    Speculation in aerospace circles pointed to the possibility  of the anti-ballistic missile system being based on the  formidable "Akash" system.    The "Akash" system utilises the "Rajendra" multi-function  phased array radar in a ground support role which has been  developed for the first time in India.    It is capable of multiple targeting, surveillance and  missile  handling. The phased array radar was on display at the air show  and drew a lot of interest from foreign delegates.    In another significant development, about 80 per cent of the  structural components for the prototype of India's Light Combat  Aircraft (LCA) have already been fabricated.    The LCA has been designed as a total weapon system where the  aircraft constitutes a precision weapon launch platform which  can carry and deploy a wide range of weapons and stores with a  quick turnaround time.</p>

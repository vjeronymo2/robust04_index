			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a military source, the U.S.  imperialists committed a midnight aerial war exercise aimed at a  surprise invasion of the North on 22 April. About 100 planes,  including war planes, were mobilized from overseas bases, in  addition to the fighter bombers, assault planes, observation  planes, and reconnaissance planes affiliated to the U.S. Air  Force occupying South Korea, were committed in this provocative  war exercise.    This war exercise was carried out frantically from 2300  [1400  GMT] 21 April to 0400 [1900 GMT] 22 April in the skies over the  areas of Osan, Yongwol, Kapyong, and Tongduchon. It was a  dangerous playing with fire aimed at a nighttime preemptive  strike on the strategic targets of the Northern half of the  Republic.    The E-3 early-warning plane, which took off from Okinawa on  22 April, made a double flight over the skies of Kangnung,  Chunchon, and Tokchok Island. It was running amok in carrying  out all-out plans and commanding the various types of plane  units that were bustling about in exercises, such as bombing  targets, giving ground support, and aerial war exercises.    As the aerial war exercise took place over a long period of  time, a KC-135 refueling plane, which was already mobilized and  deployed in South Korea from an overseas base, was mobilized  over the skies off the coast of Kunsan and refueled scores of  fighter bombers and assault planes participating in the war  exercise. Thus, this instigated an atmosphere of war.    Also on this day, a RC-135 strategic reconnaissance plane  that took off from Kadena base in Okinawa flew into South Korea  and flew over the areas of Pochon, Inje, and Kojin for a long  period of time. Thus, it committed an act of taking aerial  photographs and electronic reconnaissance of the overall regions  of the Northern half of the Republic.    Over 500 war planes and 15 reconnaisance planes of various  types aimed at invading the North were running amok in the  aerial war exercise and espionage acts over the skies of South  Korea on 22 April alone.    The frantic commotion of playing with fire being committed  day after day by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean  puppets aimed at the Northern half of the Republic is driving  the condition on the Korean peninsula to a dangerous situation.</p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading Dealers were surprised once again by the hefty premium in the futures market and said it was largely responsible for preventing the cash market slipping into negative territory, writes Peter John. The cash market wanted to take a pause after hectic post-Budget gains but the futures contract on the FT-SE 100 index, expiring in two weeks, refused to give ground. When the December contract opened at 3,243 it was at a premium of some 29 points to cash. Most marketmakers calculate however that for the last two weeks of its trading life the contract should have no estimated fair value and should, perhaps, be at a small discount to cash. December closed at 3,247 with some 12,900 contracts traded. The cash market closed at 3,234.2. Options volume was down to more normal levels with turnover of almost 42,000 contracts. Hanson was the most active stock option with more than 4,300 lots dealt.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Dmitriy Chubarov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 25 Mar -- As before, Georgia is in favor of  a political settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia. The  Georgian Foreign Minister Aleksandre Chikvaidze, who is in  Moscow on a working visit said this at a news conference today.    In the minister's words, a dangerous concentration of armed  formations is occurring on Abkhaz territory near the border with  Georgia. All the same, Georgian diplomats are seeking ways out  of the crisis. All of us -- Georgians, Abkhazians, Ossetians --  need to take an active part in devising the draft of the new  constitution. This will make it possible to avoid  confrontation, the minister said.    Chikvaidze said that the implementation of a preliminary  accord with Russia on sending Russian peacekeeping forces into  Georgia was one other way of settling the conflict.    Regarding the results of Eduard Shevardnadze's visit to the  United States, the Georgian foreign minister put a figure on the  loans granted to the republic within the framework of the United  Nations -- $400 million. The Georgian diplomat noted that this  money should help the republic's economy, which is in a very  grave state.</p>

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / West may back Yeltsin on debt THE West is expected to offer a debt rescheduling package to Russia and other former Soviet republics in what is intended as a show of political support for President Boris Yeltsin when he meets leaders of the Group of Seven industrial nations next week. The package would give Moscow a grace period of up to five years to meet principal and some or all interest payments owed on debts incurred before January 1, 1991. Details, such as whether the grace period will be three or five years, and whether all or part of the interest will be covered, are still being negotiated among creditor governments. It is therefore not yet clear how much relief the former Soviet Union will be offered on foreign debt totalling Dollars 65bn (Pounds 35.1bn). The package is a response to strong political pressure to step up support for Russia despite uncertainty over Moscow's economic reform schedule. It is likely to upset an already irate banking community because the banks could be forced to extend the same concessions on commercial debts as those agreed by governments on official debts. 'It does not make sense for the West to inject large sums of money into Russia if the Russians do not even have a tax system capable of preventing capital flight,' said Mr Dominique Menu, the representative for Banque Nationale de Paris in Moscow. The package would be 'unorthodox' because it is being offered before a standby deal with the International Monetary Fund is in place. However, it would be a condition that the rescheduling package would be withdrawn if Russia fails to agree a standby agreement by a deadline which is expected to be set for some time this autumn. The deal, which does not touch still substantial debts incurred after January 1 1991, enables G7 governments to offer something concrete to President Yeltsin in Munich next week, while attempting to keep up pressure on Moscow to agree to a standby IMF programme. The main difficulties in the standby negotiations between Moscow and the IMF negotiators remain budgetary policy - it is not clear how far the Russian government will manage to tighten the budget deficit - and the ability of republics which remain in the rouble zone to conduct a concerted monetary policy. The rescheduling, which will drive Russia's creditworthiness to new lows, follows the failure of attempts to make the former Soviet republics share the debt burden under a more modest package of debt relief, which deferred principal payments. This deferral was renewed only last week for commercial bank debts for another 90 days. Russia, which is the only republic actually repaying any of the debt not covered by the deferral, is already in arrears, and proposed a five-year moratorium in the first place.</p>

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Money Markets: Slightly softer INTEREST RATES had a slightly easier tone on the London money market yesterday. Trading was quiet, lacking fresh factors, but the important three-month sterling interbank rate continued to point towards a cut of  1/2 point in UK bank base rates. Three-month interbank was quoted at 11 9/16 -11 1/2 per cent, compared with 11 5/8 -11 1/2 previously, while 12-month money was unchanged at 11 1/4 -11 1/8 per cent. Prices of short sterling futures were firmer on Liffe. June delivery opened higher at 88.80 and closed at 88.87, against 88.78 on Friday, discounting an offered rate of about 11 1/8 per cent for three-month cash at delivery. Credit remained in very short supply on the money market. The Bank of England initially forecast a day-to-day shortage of Pounds 1,400m, but revised this to Pounds 1,600m at noon and to Pounds 1,550m in the afternoon. Total assistance of Pounds 1,544m was provided. An early round of help was offered and at that time the authorities bought Pounds 320m bank bills outright in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. Before lunch another Pounds 665m bills were purchased, by way of Pounds 71m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 594m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. In the afternoon the Bank of England bought Pounds 249m bills, via Pounds 7m Treasury bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 242m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent. Late assistance of around Pounds 310n was also provided. Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up of Treasury bills drained Pounds 1,598m, with exchequer transactions absorbing Pounds 180m and bank balances below target Pounds 130m. These outweighed a fall in the note circulation adding Pounds 510m to liquidity. In Frankfurt call money was steady at 8.85 per cent after the Bundesbank offered liquidity via a 35-day securities repurchase agreement at an unchanged fixed rate of 8.60 per cent. This will be required to replace an earlier agreement of DM23.7bn expiring today. In Brussels the Belgian National Bank cut its seven-day advances rate to 8.75 from 8.80 per cent, following a slight widening of Belgium's interest rate advantage over Germany and the strong position of the Belgian franc in the ERM. In Amsterdam the Dutch Central Bank left its special advances rate at 8.70 per cent at a tender for seven-day money.</p>

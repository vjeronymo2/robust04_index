			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- The telecommunications  minister Friday [18 March] sought the opinion of his advisory  panel on licensing experimental broadcasting of the Japanese  high-definition television (HDTV), hi-vision.    The blanket license to make test hi-vision broadcasting is  currently granted to the Hi-Vision Promotion Association. The  association is made up of 140 companies, including the Japan  Broadcasting Corp. (NHK), commercial telecasting companies,  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT), major trading  companies, electrical manufacturing companies and banks.    The license is due to expire at the end of this year.    Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Takenori Kanzaki is  considering taking that occasion to switch to individual  licensing -- granting licenses to individual broadcasting  companies.    Kanzaki asked the Radio Regulatory Council about his  proposal, seeking a recommendation by about May. Kanzaki hopes  to grant licenses to individual telecasting companies this  summer.    Experimental broadcasting hours will be divided between or  among the companies that have won licenses.    Kanzaki's proposal forms part of his ministry's policy of  expanding and reinforcing hi-vision broadcasting.    That represents part of the ministry's preparations for the  start of regular hi-vision broadcasting, using the first of  next-phase broadcasting satellites to be launched in the summer  of 1997.    Kanzaki's inquiry to the council drew applause from Mikio  Kawaguchi, NHK president, who said, "I am very pleased by  today's inquiry."    Kawaguchi said the ministry has clearly articulated its  policy on hi-vision broadcasts, and its commitment to  hi-vision's future.</p>

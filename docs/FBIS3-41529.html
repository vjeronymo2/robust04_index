The representatives of the NEPA [National Environmental  Protection Act] coalition filed suit three years ago with a U.S.  court calling for environmental impact studies to be undertaken  at the U.S. military facilities at Atsugi and Yokosuka in  Kanagawa Prefecture and Iwakuni in Yamaguchi Prefecture.    They had called for the study to be ordered in accordance  with the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA), a U.S.  law that requires environmental impact studies on federal  projects.    But the U.S. federal district court in Washington ruled last  November that the plaintiffs lacked legal standing in seeking  remedies from U.S. courts. The ruling followed the U.S. Navy  counsel's argument that NEPA does not extend to overseas U.S.  military operations.    NEPA coalition representatives said the decision was taken  because the chances of an appeals court overturning the November  ruling appeared dim.    They said the coalition would continue seeking ways to get  the U.S. Navy to reduce noise emitted by planes simulating  carrier landings and takeoffs at the airfield.</p>

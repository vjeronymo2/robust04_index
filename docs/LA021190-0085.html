			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIXED MEDIA;  </P> <P> ROCK INNOCENCE AND DECADENCE;  </P> <P> ****: THIS PERIODIC SURVEY OF POP-RELATED BOOKS, VIDEOCASSETTES AND LASER DISCS  ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A CLASSIC).;  </P> <P> "BLINDS &amp; SHUTTERS" PHOTOGRAPHS BY MICHAEL COOPER PUBLISHED BY  GENESIS/HEDLEY ($595)  </P> <P> Michael Cooper is not a name that most rock fans will recognize, although he  earned a small place in pop history by taking the cover photographs for both  the Beatles' "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" and the Rolling Stones'  "Their Satanic Majesties Request" albums.  </P> <P> However, this extraordinary, limited-edition book -- whose photos are  reproduced in fine-screen lithography and bound in Moroccan leather paper and  buckram -- links the late London photographer's name with the swinging London  scene of the '60s and early '70s in a way that may prove indelible.  </P> <P> It's a fascinating look at the innocence and decadence of what many still feel  was rock's golden era; a time when a generation of artists felt society was  being forever changed -- and, to some degree, they may have been right.  </P> <P> Cooper took more than 70,000 photos, concentrating not only on the rock stars  who defined the era, but also a wider circle of creative artists who  intersected with the musicians. Those other figures from literature and art  ranged from novelist Terry Southern and gallery owner Robert Fraser to artists  Andy Warhol and David Hockney.  </P> <P> Rather than the highly composed and sometimes sterile images in much of Rolling  Stone magazine's recent "The Photographs," Cooper's works lean more toward the  warm accessibility of candid snapshots.  </P> <P> "Michael had that perfect ability to take all those pictures without annoying  anybody," Keith Richards says in a remembrance that appears beneath a picture  of the Rolling Stones guitarist holding a coke spoon to his nose. "It would be  accepted by whoever was around -- people wouldn't know they were having their  picture taken."  </P> <P> This personal quality is what makes looking through the more than 600 photos in  "Blinds &amp; Shutters" -- for anyone who lived through the early  Beatles/Stones era -- a bit like rediscovering a school yearbook or a family  scrapbook that had been in the garage for 20 years. Indeed, Cooper's photos  were stored away until 1985 after his suicide in 1973.  </P> <P> Cooper's son Adam and his former assistant Perry Richardson began work in 1985  on reviving Cooper's dream of a book of photos. Their efforts led to Brian  Roylance, owner and editor of Genesis Press, which had published  limited-edition books by George Harrison and Beatles publicist Derek Taylor. He  served as editor of the project.  </P> <P> "I was told Michael had wanted to do a book that would be a collaboration of  all his friends and that's what intrigued me," Roylance said in an interview.  "There was such a tremendous range of people in his photos, a mix of musicians,  artists and writers that mirrored the cultural (exchange) of the period -- an  interaction that doesn't exist anymore. The book seemed to be a way to  underscore that cultural richness."  </P> <P> More than 50 of Cooper's subjects -- from the Beatles and Stones to Eric  Clapton and Terry Southern -- joined in the project, writing remembrances of  varying lengths. The energy involved in assembling this ambitious book and the  gentleness of the recollections stand as an act of love to a lost friend and a  lost age. Each copy is autographed by at least 10 of the book's subjects.  </P> <P> Roylance said there are no plans at present to publish a more conventional  version of the book. "Blinds &amp; Shutters" can be ordered from Christopher,  Cabot &amp; Fuller Ltd. in Atlanta, (800) 828-5861. ROBERT HILBURN  </P></p>

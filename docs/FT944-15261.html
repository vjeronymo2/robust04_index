			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Sidlaw calls for Pounds 23.7m to fund two-year reorganisation Sidlaw Group, the Scotland-based packaging, oil services and textiles company, yesterday launched a Pounds 23.7m rights issue to fund a two-year reorganisation and capital expenditure programme for its packaging division. The issue was priced at 180p a share. The shares closed down 17p at 208p. At the same time, it announced that pre-tax profits for the year to September 30 would be in line with expectations at not less than Pounds 14.5m (Pounds 11.1m) and that earnings would be at least 20p (20.3p). It also said that, while the textiles division remained in the black - operating profits for the six months to March 31 were Pounds 326,000 (Pounds 298,000) on turnover of Pounds 13.3m (Pounds 12.3m) - the division was no longer central and would be sold. In July 1993, the group acquired the flexible packaging businesses of Courtaulds for Pounds 78m, funded in part by a Pounds 53m rights issue at 275p. Mr Digby Morrow, chief executive, said that 'more than half of the current expenditure needed for the division could not have been foreseen at the time of the acquisition'. Mr Morrow said the division, while 'exceeding expectations', had 'pressing requirements'. He did not want to get to the position where customers could be disappointed. Behind the cash call, he said, lay the need to provide a pan-European service, called Tranflex, operated in partnership with the customer. This 'partnering' involved standardisation of product quality across the plants in the UK, the Netherlands, France and Spain. At the same time the cost base needed to be reduced, said Mr Morrow, via reorganisation and upgrading of production facilities. While the rights is raising some Pounds 24m, the group will have access to a total of Pounds 36m, thanks to a Pounds 12m additional borrowing capacity. Reorganisation will use up Pounds 15m; support for customers - particularly a greenfield investment 'for an existing blue chip customer's expansion' - will take Pounds 9m; about Pounds 5m will be invested in the French and Spanish plants; and some Pounds 3m will go on another production line in Bristol. The initial effect of the rights issue will be to reduce gearing, which stood at 73 per cent at the half-way point. Morgan Grenfell are the underwriters and Cazenove the brokers.</p>

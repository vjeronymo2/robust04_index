			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Hurd explains 'Euro-lunacies' SCARE stories about the European Community's actions or intentions are often given screaming headlines in the British media while positive accounts about Community action of real benefit to Britain are given little coverage, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said yesterday. Mr Hurd said in a speech in his Witney constituency that the EC was often used as a whipping boy for the sins of others. Bureaucrats in local and even central government frequently blamed unpopular regulations on imaginary edicts from Brussels. Mr Hurd listed three types of such stories. 'Euro-myths', he explained, were amusing anecdotes which had no basis in fact. He gave as examples the 'Euro-lavatory', which was supposed to limit the amount of water that cisterns could flush, and the banning of home-made jam, round cheeses and the wearing of hairnets by fishermen. All these were false. 'Euro-scares' resulted from a misunderstanding of what had been agreed and 'Euro-lunacies' were genuine examples of unnecessary or intrusive Community rules. Some 'Euro-scares' arose from early EC proposals which were then amended or where 'we subsequently negotiate sense into a directive', Mr Hurd said. One example was the supposed EC move to ban flavoured crisps. The abandonment of such proposals was seldom mentioned in the media. Among the 'Euro-lunacies' Mr Hurd listed Community rules on maximum noise limits for lawnmowers and cucumber norms which decreed that they should be of a certain curve and colour.</p>

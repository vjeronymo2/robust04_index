			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GULF WATCH: DAY 73;  </P> <P> A DAILY BRIEFING ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CRISIS.  </P> <P> Diplomatic Front:  </P> <P> Kuwait's exiled rulers promised to restore a democratic parliament if their  emirate is freed from Iraqi occupation. At a meeting of more than 1,000 Kuwaiti  exiles in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, the Kuwaiti crown prince and prime minster,  Sheik Saad al Abdullah al Sabah, said the reforms are a reward for Kuwaitis'  loyalty in the wake of Iraq's invasion.  </P> <P> Embargo Front:  </P> <P> Thousands of Iraqi children carrying empty milk bottles marched past the U.S.  and British embassies in Baghdad to protest the U.N. trade blockade imposed on  their country Aug. 6. The march emphasized Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's  contention that the blockade would be responsible for starving innocent  children.  </P> <P> Terrorism Front:  </P> <P> Egyptian police arrested several suspects in Friday's ambush murder of Speaker  of Parliament Refaat Mahgoub. Egypt's national news agency said the suspects  were taken into custody as they tried to leave the country on forged passports.  Some sources said the attack may be linked to Egypt's stand against Iraq's  invasion of Kuwait.  </P> <P> Western Citizens Still in Iraq and Kuwait:  </P> <P> * Britain: 1,420  </P> <P> * Yugoslavia: 1,300  </P> <P> * Poland: 1,213  </P> <P> * United States: 700-plus  </P> <P> * Romania: 640  </P> <P> * France: 330  </P> <P> * Italy: 310  </P> <P> * Ireland: 260  </P> <P> * Netherlands: 173  </P> <P> * Canada: 100  </P></p>

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Arts: The Bed before Yesterday - Theatre In 1975, old Ben Travers - author of the between-the-wars Aldwych farces A Cuckoo in the Nest, Rookery Nook and Thark - suddenly had a new West End success with The Bed before Yesterday. Since he was then in his 90th year, there was a 'Wonderful for his age]' factor in that, as well as the unworldly quaintness of making an old-fashioned, paper-thin comedy serve as a starry-eyed tract for sexual liberation (especially among divorced or widowed persons of a certain age). The Almeida Theatre has chosen to revive it now, probably rashly. At the start of The Bed before Yesterday widow Alma Millett - almost upper-middle, well-to-do, inexplicably lonely for a male companion - has Victor Keene to tea. She is a prickly, contentious creature but eminently sensible and good at heart, he a 60-year-old gentleman impoverished by his ex-wife's gambling. Alma has engineered the meeting; after some fussing, she soon puts the obvious proposition to him, and with only modest resistance he soon accepts it. Brenda Blethyn and Charles Kay play this charmingly, in period West End style (it is Coronation Year) without the old, tiresome brittleness. But the real theme has barely been hinted at: obliquely suggested, the question 'Bed?' gets a 'Don't mind if I do, but don't really mind' response from him, a thumbs-down from her. Having had a Bad Experience on her first wedding-night, she has taken care never to repeat it. They settle down happily enough in chaste fashion; but in what seems no time at all, Alma has encounters that stir her strangely. First with Ella, the sex-happy, guilt-free girlfriend (Jacqueline Deferrary) of Victor's feckless son Aubrey (hopelessly underwritten, but nicely realised by Paul Reynolds as the 'What, me worry?' boy from MAD magazine); then with a declassee cousin (a ripe, delicate cartoon by Lill Roughley) who enjoys a vigorous erotic life with her transient lodgers in Ealing. The light dawns. Alma entices Victor into a sensual afternoon - instantly, improbably successful - which sets her afire, on the favourite model of male wish-fulfilment. In what seems no time at all, she is foraging boldly abroad, because old Victor tires fast. He is mock-grumpily complaisant, whilst himself carrying on with the liberated cousin. Ella slips into honest prostitution, and Aubrey profits. Everybody is happy. That is the message: achieving good sex is like getting your natural plumbing into full working order, without hypocrisy nor serious implications for anything else in your real life. Here we believe none of that, because the twists that nudge the action along are so inconsequent. Alma is no less scatty than she is anxiously self-possessed, Victor a tame, settled MCC type; yet their actions - whenever they find themselves having to act - are those of enlightened, arch-liberal souls. We do not know why, and if we are meant to admire them we cannot at the same time find them eccentrically funny. The net result is to hang a naive, irony-free plea for sexual freedom upon a desperately thin, jerry-built farce: DH Lawrence meets What the Actress Said to the Bishop. Peter Wood directs with faithful tact, and Johan Engels supplies what must be the most reactionary set ever seen in the Almeida (a beautiful design, neatly elegant and economical). Something more would be needed to rescue this piece, for all its quaint appeal. I doubt that anything now could be sufficient.</p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Steelmakers face record Pounds 76m fine Competition authorities at the European Commission looked set last night to seek a record fine on 17 EU steelmakers they have found guilty of operating a cartel to supply the construction industry. The opening bid of the Brussels competition directorate at a meeting of senior officials last night was expected to be for a fine of about Ecu100m (Pounds 76m), say Commission officials. The biggest penalties Brussels has imposed until now were of Ecu75m in 1991 on Tetra Pak, the Swedish packaging group, for restrictive practices and predatory pricing, and of Ecu60m in 1986 on 14 chemical companies for running a cartel in polypropylene. But the officials warned that the Commission could reduce the figure at its full meeting today, depending on the outcome of a dinner at which Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, and Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, were due to meet leading European steelmakers. The companies facing sanctions after the three-year inquiry include British Steel, Arbed of Luxembourg, a division of Usinor-Sacilor in France, Cockeril-Sambre of Belgium, and Fried Krupp-Hoesch, NMH Stahlwerke, Saarstahl and Thyssen of Germany. The Commission has found that they infringed EU antitrust rules by sharing out markets and fixing prices for heavy steel sections and beams. 'This is a terribly serious infringement,' one official said. He pointed out that when steelmakers were hauled up by the Commission in 1990 for operating a stainless steel cartel, they escaped with a token fine. But they were warned then that the EU crisis regime for steel, which licensed certain market collaboration between manufacturers until 1988, was at an end. Under EU competition rules, the Commission can levy fines of up to 10 per cent of annual turnover in the sector being distorted, although 2 per cent of sales has been the normal ceiling. Suggestions by officials that British Steel could face an Ecu10m fine are in line with the lower threshold. The Commission estimates that British Steel's turnover in the 1990 reference year was about Pounds 400m in steel beams, 2 per cent of which would be roughly Ecu10m. British Steel yesterday said it was 'most likely' to contest the sanction. At last night's dinner Mr Van Miert and Mr Bangemann intended to press private steelmakers to deliver capacity cuts of up to 25m tonnes as part of the EU restructuring plan for steel.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Staff Brigadier General brother 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur  Hadi, the defense minister, this morning convened a meeting at  the ministry with Staff Brig. Gen. brother 'Abd-al-Malik  al-Sayyani, chief of the General Staff; his deputies; the  defense minister's advisers; and ministry department heads.    The chief of the General Staff began by congratulating  brother Mansur Hadi on his appointment as defense minister and  the trust placed in him by brother Lieutenant Gen. 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih, the Presidential Council chairman and commander  in chief of the Armed Forces. The chief of staff told the  brother minister that he can count on the cooperation of  everyone to advance national unity and constitutional legitimacy  and to stand up to all forces of apostasy and secession who are  out to plunge the Armed Forces into a bloody war to promote  their despicable plans and sick dreams. Brig. Gen. al-Sayyani  went on to emphasize that what the apostate separatists are  after is to tear the united Yemen asunder and set it back to the  pre-22 May, 1990 era.    The chief of staff declared that under the kind of decisive  circumstances the homeland is going through now, the Ministry of  Defense and the General Staff Command have ahead of them a  formidable task. Granted, he said, ours is a demanding mission,  but by our cooperation and boundless confidence in the  capabilities of the brother minister, which we have come to know  first-hand throughout his service, should make its achievement  possible. Brig. Gen. al-Sayyani praised the defense minister's  performance as commander of the al-Bayda' axis, where he and the  military distinguished themselves in battle against the forces  of apostasy and secession, and accomplished their mission with  minimal losses.    The chief of staff stressed that the forces of unity and  legality are following up on their successes in al-Bayda' and  elsewhere with further gains against the treasonous and apostate  gangs led by secessionists in the [Yemeni] Socialist Party.  They are fulfilling their assignments with admirable  proficiency in Abyan, al-Dali', Lahij, and Aden, and elsewhere  on the battlefront.    For his part, Brig. Gen. 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur Hadi said he  took  pride in the confidence placed in him by Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih. He said he will extend every cooperation to his brothers  at the General Staff Command and army commanders to translate  this confidence into physical reality. The brother minister  applauded the distinguished performance of the Armed Forces who,  he said, are now engaged in fierce combat with the Socialist  Party's gangs of apostasy and secession. He noted their  remarkable steadfastness and successes in the field as they  upheld the will of the people for unity, democracy, and  constitutional legitimacy.    We are fighting a battle forced upon us by this tyrannical  coterie against the wishes of the political and military  echelons, who are anxious to spare the lives of the valiant  military's personnel and the blood of the citizens of the united  Yemen. We have no choice but to stand fast and fight on, the  brother defense minister added. The forces of unity and  legitimacy will soldier on and pound all the fortifications of  the agent secessionists until, God willing, sure victory is  attained.</p>

			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Minding Your Own Business: A craft with export appeal AT FIRST glance, you might be hard-put to find a link between the small north Wales town of Denbigh and Medina in Saudi Arabia, the second most holy city in Islam where the prophet Mohammed is buried. But connection there is  -and a colourful one at that. The link is a company called Craig Bragdy Design, based on a Denbigh trading estate and founded by Jean and Rhys Powell. It makes ceramic murals and over the years has built-up a thriving business with Araby - indeed, 98 per cent of its output goes to the Gulf states, contributing to its annual turnover of Pounds 450,000. Earlier this year, it was retained by the Saudi authorities to tile seven domes of the Mosque of the Prophet in Medina - inside and out. The catch is that because Medina is closed to non-Moslems, local men will have to oversee the work. The Powells accept this, although they prefer to see through their jobs personally. Other difficulties can arise - Iraq's invasion of Kuwait was one and that could prove costly to the company. Kuwait built the world's third-largest telecommunications tower and invited applications to tile the outside - all 19,000 sq. metres of it. The Powells made their pitch last summer and, in spite of keen competition, were confident of success. They still are. As Jean says: 'I am sure that if Kuwait sorts itself out, we would be in with a very good chance.' Craig Bragdy Design is a family concern, helped along by two of the Powells' four sons. Murals are made specifically for the area proposed by the client and after discussion on the theme a detailed design scheme in colour is produced. Tile samples are included showing, among other things, textures and glazes. The murals tend to be hugely colourful. Many have been designed by Jean herself although the firm has other design staff. 'Our ceramic murals differ from other kinds of murals because we lay out clay on the floor to the size of the (client's) wall,' says Jean. 'We lay it out like a piece of pastry, we put our design onto it, and then we cut it up like a giant jigsaw puzzle. It is not mosaics. It is really an individual job for particular people, so no-one has a repeat or a mass-produced effort. And this is what people really like - having something particularly for them.' The company started in the 1950s, when the Powells began to make pottery. They based themselves in a succession of old mills, mainly in north Wales, which they converted into workshops and living accommodation. Twenty-five years ago, they decided they wanted some-thing more challenging and turned to small murals. Their first was for a Liverpool brewery, for which they received Pounds 27.10s (old money). 'Then we did a lot more work in Liverpool - for the Catholic Blind Institute and the Dental Hospital and for the Teaching Hospital and many, many pubs,' says Jean. 'About 12 years ago, there was a cut back in UK building. We wanted to continue with murals so we looked around. We didn't have very much money so we couldn't shoot off to America. But I have always been interested in Middle East design and decoration. We got a job in Kuwait for an oil company and then we met one or two Kuwaitis and they liked our work. We designed and made murals for three tower blocks. 'Then we went to the Emirates and opened an office there. We got some really interesting jobs and more and more work in the area.' The Powells were making their murals on the spot but: 'We got to the stage where we had to come back and make them in north Wales. We found we could do without our office in the Gulf, which was expensive, and we manage to get work by going to the Middle East two or three times a year.' The commissions cover a wide spectrum. One involved a mural on the inside of a dome in Sharjah souk. 'The ruler wanted it to be like the sky at night, so we did the signs of the zodiac and the pole star. Eight tons of tiles went out of this little factory in Denbigh.' The 'little factory' was acquired seven years ago. 'We were able to buy it just at a point when we had some really big jobs.' Craig Bragdy Design employs 15 people although an increasing amount of work is being sub-contracted and extra people are taken on to help out with specific jobs. But as Jean says: 'It is difficult to find people to work in Denbigh, particularly the sort of people with an artistic background that we need.' On the other hand, costs in Denbigh remain relatively low. Craig Bragdy Design, Colomendy Industrial Estate, Denbigh, Clwyd LL16 4LN. Tel. 074571-5656.</p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / US foreign policy official resigns MR Clifton Wharton last night said he was resigning as deputy secretary of state, the first change in the US foreign policy team since President Bill Clinton took office. Mr Wharton, a former university president and head of the largest educational pension fund, held extensive weekend talks with Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state. Announcing his decision last night, Mr Wharton said in a written statement: 'In the past two weeks it became unmistakeably clear that I was being subjected to the classic Washington practice of sustained anonymous leaks to the media.' The son of the first black American ever to attain ambassadorial rank, Mr Wharton was mostly engaged in administrative affairs, including the reorganisation of US foreign aid programmes. But with the administration's conduct of foreign policy under fire on several fronts, Mr Christopher has reportedly been pressing for a stronger team, with elevation of an articulate and possibly experienced diplomat to serve as deputy believed on his agenda. The foreign policy triumvirate of Mr Christopher, Mr Anthony Lake, national security adviser, and Mr Les Aspin, defence secretary, have all been subject to direct criticism. The secretary of state himself, according to the New York Times, has even suggested recruiting someone along the lines of Mr David Gergen, counsellor to the president, to ensure foreign policy dissemination is co-ordinated properly. Several internal candidates exist. They include Mr Thomas Pickering, currently ambassador to Russia, Mr Strobe Talbott, who has proved particularly effective as ambassador-at-large for the former Soviet states, and Mr Winston Lord, the mandarin now serving as undersecretary for Asian affairs. Outsiders from the extensive Washington foreign policy establishment also cannot be excluded.</p>

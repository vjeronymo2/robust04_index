			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Survey of Latin American Finance and Investment (8): An envied programme - Mexico / Privatisation MEXICO'S privatisation programme, the envy of much of Latin America, is finally coming to an end this year. The government plans to sell by December the six remaining banks, and an assortment of smaller industries, headed by insurer Aseguradora Mexicana and plants at Fertimex, the fertiliser producer. All remaining state companies - such as Pemex, the oil monopoly, and the Federal Electricity Commission - will (legally) stay in the public sector, as dictated by Mexico's Constitution. So will end a series of around 200 public sales in a little over three years that have raised about 51,000bn pesos (about Dollars 17bn), or 6.6 per cent of GDP. The lion's share of the money has come from the sale of Telmex, the monopoly telephone company, which fetched more than Dollars 4bn, and the 12 banks, which have brought in about Dollars 10bn. The government raised a further Dollars 340m in cash, and Dollars 545m in debt by selling off the troubled steel companies, collectively known as Sidermex. The finance ministry plans to sell another 5 per cent (of the 9 per cent it still owns) in Telmex next month, and its outstanding share in Bancomer, the second largest bank. The privatisations have gone so well in part because the process was seen to be fair, which has encouraged rich Mexicans to participate; but mainly because the government waited until the economic growth had picked up before selling off the large companies. The banks have thus been sold for an (unweighted) average multiple of more than 20 times historic earnings, well above international valuations for privatised banks, because their new owners are convinced that Mexico's economy will grow by an average of about 5 per cent a year over the next decade, and that bank earnings growth will double that. Three years ago, with a much poorer economic outlook, the government would have been lucky to raise half the Dollars 10bn which the 12 banks fetched. However, the privatisations have also contributed to the economic recovery. President Miguel de la Madrid, Mr Salinas's predecessor, closed down hundreds of loss-making public sector companies. The shutdowns explain much of the strengthening of public finances, and helped turn a primary budget deficit of 8 per cent in 1981 to a surplus of the same magnitude two years later. The primary budget surplus helped bring down inflation to below 20 per cent. The later privatisations helped stimulate substantial capital inflows, which are necessary to finance the burgeoning trade deficit. Mr Jacques Rogozinski, the head of Mexico's privatisation unit, describes last May's Dollars 2.4bn offering of Telmex as Mexico's 'ticket to the world capital markets'. The Telmex offering of US-dollar denominated American Depository Receipts paved the way for a series of offerings by other Mexican companies, including a New York Stock Exchange listing by Vitro, Mexico's largest conglomerate, and a Dollars 940m offering by Televisa, the TV giant. Similarly, the bank privatisations - one has been sold on average every three weeks for nine months - contributed to the momentum of economic success that has kept the Mexican name in international markets. Money has thus kept flooding in, and one-month interest rates, a barometer of confidence, have fallen to 11 per cent. The strategy has had its drawbacks. In retrospect the regulation of Telmex has been much too lax, with the company making Dollars 2.3bn profits last year, 77 per cent more than profits in real terms than 1990. If the Mexican government had been less concerned about selling off the stock to eager international investors, it could have split Telmex into two companies and thereby promoted competition and better service. Failing that, it could have toughened up Telmex's regulation, forcing more investment than is being made, and cutting further exorbitant prices on international and long-distance calls. Further, the Mexican government has been criticised for not using privatisations as an opportunity to democratise the ownership of capital in Mexico's already heavily concentrated capital markets. Instead the government has auctioned off the banks, Telmex, and other companies to those rich businessmen who already control much of Mexico's financial wealth. Since there are few companies left to sell, the government may have missed a golden opportunity to turn Mexico's oligarchic capitalism into something more broadly based. Even though the big public sales will have come to an end by this year, the government will continue to promote private investment in public sector infrastructure projects. The Salinas administration has handed over the construction of four-lane highways to the private sector, and is now selling concessions to the private sector on those highways built by the government. Similarly the private sector is being invited to build electricity plants, ports, water treatment centres, train carriages, and other similar projects. In effect, having sold off most of the state companies, the government is now looking to privatise public sector responsibilities through lease-backs, temporary concessions, and other creative financing schemes. In the next three years, for example, the private and public sector will build around 3.500km of four-lane highways at a cost of Dollars 6bn-Dollars 6.7bn, of which about half is expected to come from abroad. Even Pemex, Mexico's hallowed national oil company, is being privatised indirectly (and admittedly slowly). The government has already allowed private and foreign investment in what were once 'primary' petrochemicals, and a further opening is expected soon.</p>

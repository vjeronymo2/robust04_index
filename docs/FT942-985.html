			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Rail talks possible today Talks on the rail dispute are likely to resume today at the offices of Acas, the conciliation service. A further 24-hour shutdown of the network is due on Wednesday. Railtrack, the state-owned company responsible for the railway infrastructure, told Acas officials yesterday that it was ready to restart negotiations with the RMT, the transport union. The signalmen's dispute has already cost taxpayers Pounds 24m. The company said it was keen to discuss the restructuring pay offer for signalmen that was presented at Acas last Monday, even though it was rejected as 'derisory' by union officials. The company said: 'We want to discuss our offer in more detail.' The RMT, which starts its annual conference in Liverpool today, was cautious last night. It said delegates would decide this morning whether the union's negotiators should return to Acas. Mr Jimmy Knapp, RMT general secretary, said the situation was 'difficult and delicate'. Union officials remain pessimistic about an early breakthrough in a conflict that has brought two one-day rail stoppages. They believe that there cannot be any basis for settlement until Railtrack addresses the need for an interim pay rise for signalmen for past productivity improvements. Railtrack, which is chaired by Mr Robert Horton, still appears to insist that any increase for the signalling workers above the 2.5 per cent general pay rise offered must come through a negotiated package of restructuring measures including job evaluation, more flexible hours and changes in working conditions. Railtrack denied suggestions at the weekend that it made the wrong pay offer to RMT negotiators last Monday. The company said the view that it had made a mistake was 'taken out of context'. It added that the only pay figures at the negotiations which had not been revealed in detail were for relief signalmen, and RMT officials had been told that these would result in increases of up to 15 per cent. However, the continuing confusion over details of Railtrack's offer is bound to increase criticisms of what many believe to be the incompetent way in which it has handled the issue. The RMT is threatening to take legal action against Railtrack over the use of untrained managers to operate signals during the previous one-day strikes. Letters, Page 22</p>

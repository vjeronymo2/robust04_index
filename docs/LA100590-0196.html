			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FIRST FILM RATED NC-17 IS BANNED NEAR BOSTON;  </P> <P> MOVIES: TOWN OFFICIALS THREATEN TO REVOKE THEATER'S LICENSE.  </P> <P> A movie theater bowed to pressure from town officials and canceled the showing  of "Henry and June," the first film rated NC-17, the designation that replaced  the X rating.  </P> <P> Showcase Cinema was to have started screening "Henry and June" today. The film  based on the diaries of Anais Nin chronicles her affairs with writer Henry  Miller and his wife.  </P> <P> "They can call it whatever they want to call it," Anthony Taurasi, chairman of  the town's board of selectmen, said Thursday. "If it walks like a duck and  quacks like a duck then it's a duck. Let's call it what it is."  </P> <P> The Motion Picture Assn. of America replaced the X rating with the NC-17 rating  on Sept. 26. NC-17 means no one under age 17 can be admitted to the films.  </P> <P> Selectman Frank Geishecker told the Patriot Ledger of Quincy on Wednesday that  he would consider revoking the theater's license if the film was shown.  </P> <P> "We are not censors," he said. "The censoring is done by the rating bureau. All  we care is that we preserve the community standards of the town of Dedham. That  is our mission; that is our job."  </P> <P> Both selectmen admit they have not seen the film released by Universal  Pictures. Directed by Philip Kaufman and starring Fred Ward and Uma Thurman,  "Henry and June" received the NC-17 rating because of two lesbian sex scenes  and a shot of an erotic drawing.  </P> <P> Ira Korf, chief executive of Showcase Cinema's parent company, National  Amusements Inc., said he pulled the film from the Dedham theater because of  complaints from the two selectmen.  </P> <P> "I pointed out very strongly this film wasn't rated X," said Fred Mound,  president of distribution for Universal Pictures. "There was extreme pressure  coming down. Obviously, I'm very disturbed by it."  </P> <P> The MPAA switch was made exactly to avoid these situations, Mound said. The  association changed the designation because the X rating carried the stigma of  pornography.  </P> <P> Korf said National Amusements had decided to show NC-17-rated films because the  new rating means they cannot be confused with hard-core pornography films.  </P> <P> Taurasi said that Showcase Cinema had a gentleman's agreement with the town not  to show X-rated films that the NC-17 rating was "just a way around the ratings  bureau."  </P> <P> Dedham is a middle-class suburb with more than 25,000 residents, about 10 miles  south of Boston.  </P></p>

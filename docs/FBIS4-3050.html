			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Provincial News Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] In a recent notice, the Provincial Port Navigation  Supervision Bureau requested that all port navigation  departments resolutely stop nonpassenger boats from the  unauthorized ferrying of passengers. Since the beginning of the  spring tourism season, unauthorized ferrying of passengers by  nonpassenger liners in various localities has seriously  endangered water traffic safety. The Provincial Port Navigation  Supervision Bureau asked port navigation supervisory offices at  city and prefectural levels to intensify spot checks against  boats engaging in carrying passengers in violation of the rules.  Nonpassenger boats desiring to transport passengers must obtain  approval from shipping authorities at the county level and  above, with strict observance to maximum load capacity and  should be equipped with standardd lifesaving and fire prevention  facilities.</p>

The scheduled second instance of dumping was canceled.  However, there are some decommissioned nuclear submarines which  have been left untouched at a submarine repair base in the  Russian Far East region. The base in is great need of facilities  at which radioactive waste produced during the process of  dismantling nuclear submarines can be processed and stored.  Officials of the Maritime Kray Government cannot conceal their  uneasy feelings about the possibility of "instances of nuclear  pollution that can occur anytime." Today, we will report on the  actual state of the dismantling of the nuclear submarines and  the treatment of radioactive waste.    We drove two and half hours from Vladivostok, where the  headquarters of the Russian Navy's Pacific Fleet is located. A  harbor with repair and dismantling dock facilities came into  sight as we passed a checkpoint at the entrance to Bolshoy Kamen  city. Nuclear submarines were being dismantled in three dry  docks. Dark hulls which had been aged by many long voyages were  cut crosswise, and some people were working there to take out  radioactive waste.    According to military officials and people who work at the  Zvezda (meaning "star") dockyard, which is the largest submarine  repair factory in Russia, and at Stella, which is a Russian-U.S.  joint venture established last spring, jointly dismantle the  nuclear submarines. About 50 submarines have already been  retired from service. The submarines still possessing nuclear  reactors were being left out in the harbor and on beaches, for  the dockyard can dismantle only four submarines a year. About  50 more submarines are scheduled to be retired from service by  the year 2000. A simple calculation tells us that 25 years are  needed to dismantle all these vessels.    Radioactive wastes are being separated into solid and liquid  wastes. Solid wastes are buried underground, but many of the  solid wastes remain piled up in the open air because they are  being removed from the submarines faster than the workers can  bury them. Liquid wastes are stored in two storage tankers, the  Pechega (which has a 700-ton capacity) and the TNT (which has a  900-ton capacity). The TNT was used to dump radioactive waste  into the Sea of Japan. One thousand tons of radioactive waste  are stored on the two ships; their remaining capacity is only  600 tons.    According to reporter Pashko (age 30), who works for an  organ  of the same fleet, about five dumpings at sea were carried out  each year from the end of the 1980's to 1991. Reportedly, 373  tons of solid waste (with radiation levels of 6 trillion  Becquerels) and 3,000 tons of liquid waste (with radiation  levels of 925 billion Becquerels) were dumped into the Sea of  Japan. The radiation levels of these wastes are far higher than  that of the liquid wastes which were dumped last month.  According to an already-made announcement, the radiation level  of the liquid wastes dumped into the Sea of Japan last month was  about 40 billion Becquerels.    Assistant Commanding Officer Maksimov (43), who belongs to a  chemical unit of the same fleet, said, "With our current storage  capacity, our facilities will be full in 18 months."    On the other hand, Maritime Kray Deputy Governor Stegnyy  [name as published] (45) stated: "We need to build processing  and storage facilities as soon as possible. This is the way to  safety. We will call on the Japanese Government for its  assistance."</p>

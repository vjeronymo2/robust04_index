			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Serbs accept blockade monitors Serbia has accepted international monitoring of its blockade of rebel Serbs in Bosnia and members of a 135-strong force are being deployed on the border next week, according to Mr Jan Egeland, Norway's deputy foreign minister. The force will check that no weapons or other supplies are getting through to Bosnia from rump Yugoslavia, comprising Serbia and Montenegro. Monitoring of the blockade could lead to an easing of United Nations sanctions against Belgrade.</p>

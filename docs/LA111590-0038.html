			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE WATCH: CRAWFORD'S RETURN JUICES UP 'PHANTOM' SALES  </P> <P> Michael Crawford's Dec. 31 return as "The Phantom of the Opera," announced last  week, has goosed the show's box office, where sales had been lagging.  </P> <P> After the news hit the papers Friday morning, the box office grossed $467,265  in one day -- and $1,545,038 by the end of Tuesday. On an average day, the  gross is between $80,000 and $100,000, reported a spokeswoman. She added that  it wasn't possible to separate, out of the latest figures, the sales for the  Crawford performances from those for the remaining performances starring Robert  Guillaume, who's in the show through Dec. 30. But the announcement of  Crawford's return certainly made a big difference.  </P> <P> It occurred during the worst-selling week in the history of "The Phantom" in  Los Angeles. The gross for last week's performances was $629,518. The weekly  ceiling for the show ("if we were to get full price for every ticket," said the  spokeswoman) is $730,000, and the show had been grossing an average of $700,000  until recently.  </P> <P> Tickets bought from the box office or the official telephone charge line cost  $32.50-$50, but many tickets, especially for weekend orchestra seats, command  higher prices at ticket agencies, which buy blocs of tickets. And these  agencies took note of the news of Crawford's return.  </P> <P> One agency doubled its tariff from $125 for the remaining Guillaume  performances to $250 for the Crawford shows -- and jacked up the price of its  remaining New Year's Eve tickets (which cost $75 at the box office but are sold  out there) from $195 to $650 upon learning that Crawford will return at that  performance. Fourteen New Year's Eve tickets were available at this agency as  of Tuesday.  </P> <P> Another agency exercised more restraint, raising prices from $80-$175 to  $100-$200.  </P> <P> Houston-based North American Ticket Outlet Inc. ran an ad Sunday, which had  been prepared prior to the big Crawford announcement, noting rumors of his  return and offering $99 weekend orchestra tickets to Crawford's shows if the  buyer also purchased the same number of tickets to a Guillaume performance at  the same price.  </P> <P> "All I'm doing is protesting scalping," said Cameron Frye, owner of North  American, which he said he created specifically for the purpose of selling  "Phantom" tickets.  </P> <P> Prior to entering the ticket business, Frye -- who said he has seen "Phantom"  13 times -- had been offering "Phantom" tickets to clients of his insurance and  shipping businesses, buying them at $200 apiece from scalpers. "It became quite  a burden," he said.  </P> <P> So he decided to employ classic scalper technique to bring down the resale  price for the public, as well as his clients. He had his employees call the  ticket charge line every 30 minutes to find out when new blocs of tickets were  put on sale (usually months in advance of the performances) -- and when he got  a nibble, he immediately used a number of different credit cards to buy the  maximum five tickets per card.  </P> <P> "I put $300,000 on the line" in his pursuit of "Phantom" tickets, he said. He  reeled off the numbers of orchestra seats he had for Saturday nights in  January, ranging from 212 to 297.  </P> <P> Frye contends, to quote from his ad, that "We are ticket brokers, not  'scalpers'." He claimed he's doing it all for "the ordinary person" and that he  isn't making any money on it, after deducting phone bills, ad costs and other  expenses.  </P> <P> He declared that if he ever sells "Phantom" tickets for more than $99, "they  can come and shoot me."  </P> <P> Other ticket brokers have called him since his ad ran, trying to buy tickets  from him for resale at higher prices, he said. Though they don't reveal their  identity, he said he could detect them -- because they "sound like New York  used car salesmen."  </P> <P> Among those who plan to be in the audience on New Year's Eve to welcome  Crawford back are Dean Willard and his daughter, Emily. It was Willard who paid  the top bid of $27,500 for a pair of Crawford's house seats last April (the  money went to charity) at what was billed as Crawford's final performance, as a  present for his daughter.  </P> <P> "She's enthusiastic and we're all pleased," said Willard. He doesn't resent the  fact that the performance last April wasn't so final after all, he added. In  fact, he paid $1,100 for four Dec. 31 tickets.  </P> <P> His daughter, who has seen "Phantom" 38 times, agreed that the news of  Crawford's return was "wonderful."  </P> <P> In other "Phantom" news, an Actors' Equity official confirmed that the union  waived two rules to allow Crawford's return. One prohibits actors from being  replaced by non-resident aliens (Crawford is British), and another requires a  year to pass before a foreign star can return to a role.  </P> <P> The waiver was linked to an agreement by the "Phantom" producers to meet to  explore ways to increase the employment of minority actors in "Phantom," said  Equity business representative Ralph Braun. However, a spokeswoman for the  "Phantom" producers denied the linkage. Such a meeting will take place, she  said, but it's "part of an overall industry effort" to examine minority  casting. "These are two separate issues."  </P> <P> Another Equity official noted that waiving the rules for Crawford protects  other Equity jobs, because "Crawford's tremendous draw" helps extend the run of  the show.  </P> <P> 'VORTEX' CAST: Stephanie Beacham and Rupert Everett will star in Noel Coward's  "The Vortex," at the Doolittle Theatre, Jan. 17-March 31.  </P></p>

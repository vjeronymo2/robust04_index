			<p>BFN     [Text] The first round of direct talks between the  representatives of the Tajik Government and the opposition was  held in Moscow this afternoon, under UN auspices and attended by  representatives of the Islamic Republic of Iran.    A few minutes ago, in a telephone conversation, we asked our  country's ambassador in Moscow about the manner in which the  session had been held. He said:    [Begin recording] The talks -- which started in Moscow today  between the Tajik Government and the opposition -- were held in  a very amicable atmosphere, in the presence of (Pierre) Ballon,  the representative of the UN secretary general. First he called  on the two sides to proceed with the talks without expressing  their opposing stances in detail and, in the meantime, to  present their proposals to him.    As host and overseer, Kozyrev expressed the wish that the  talks should definitely achieve a positive result. He declared  his support for the talks and that of his government. Then  Zuhurov, the Tajik labor minister, who is the representative of  the Tajik Government, made a speech. He expressed the hope  that, since the people of Tajikistan have suffered hardship  during this period and are very much in favor of peace, the  talks will lead to peace as desired by the people.    Latifi, as the representative of the opposition, then began  to speak. First he thanked all countries which have helped and  received refugees, including our country, Iran. While declaring  his readiness for the talks, he stressed that any agreement  reached at the talks should be in accordance with UN principles.  [end recording]</p>

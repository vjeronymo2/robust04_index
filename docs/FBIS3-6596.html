			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["AP, YONHAP from Washington"] </F>   [Text] James Woolsey, director of the Central Intelligence  Agency, warned that North Korea's nuclear development and new  long- range ballistic missile development greatly threaten world  stability.    In an academic seminar held under the auspices of the  Central  Intelligence Agency on the evening of 18 March, Director Woolsey  said that the United States worries greatly over North Korea's  nuclear weapons development, as well as its development of long-  range missiles.    In particular, Director Woolsey confirmed some reports that  North Korea is developing new additional missiles with ranges  greater than that of the Nodong missile, and said: If these two  missiles are developed and tested, they could put at risk all of  Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific. Also, if they  are exported to the Middle East, they could threaten Europe as  well.</p>

			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: RADIO  </P> <P> Tom Dixon, the veteran classical music announcer who worked for KFAC for 40  years, will be back on the air this summer. He has been signed to host a  seven-night-a-week 6-10 p.m. program on KKGO-AM (540, stereo) which is targeted  to switch to a classical music station in July. Dixon's program will include an  8-10 p.m. "Evening Concert," which was a KFAC staple for many years. Exact date  for the start of the classical music format is yet to be set, awaiting  installation of new equipment, including a 25,000-watt AM transmitter. KKGO-FM  (105.1) will continue with a jazz format. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

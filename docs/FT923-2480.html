			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Britain: Counting cost of conviction NOW MR John Major must assess the cost of conviction. During 22 frequently turbulent months in No 10 Downing Street, the prime minister has weathered his share of crises, but yesterday's turmoil on financial markets confronts him with the most serious test of his political career. As the currency markets jeered his government, the official message was that Mr Major remained determined to hold sterling at the rate at which he took it into the Exchange Rate Mechanism two years ago. The speculators were unimpressed. When the pound slid below its ERM floor, the question asked in Whitehall - and left unanswered - was whether his determination would be enough. An emergency meeting of senior ministers called by Mr Major last night intensified speculation that the government would be forced to admit that sterling's position was no longer sustainable. There was no such ambiguity in briefings from the prime minister's aides. Mr Major was committed to the defeat of inflation, they said. In spite of recent turbulence, he regarded the ERM as the framework to achieve that objective. He would do 'whatever is necessary to defend the parity'. But as Mr Major tied his government's future irrevocably to the fate of sterling, criticism from the business community was matched by recriminations from the Conservative back benches. Some ministers were arguing privately that there had to be a point beyond which even Mr Major could not take his commitment to sterling's DM2.95 central rate in the ERM. 'Will it be 25 per cent (base rates) by Friday?' one asked. For Tory Euro-sceptics, the threat that higher borrowing costs would drive the economy from recession into slump is an ideal recruiting ground in the campaign against the Maastricht treaty. Even before yesterday's drama, the Euro-sceptics were promising that the prime minister would receive a stormy reception at the party conference in Brighton in two weeks. It was once supposed to be a celebration. Now they are pledging open revolt. A French Yes for Maastricht in Sunday's referendum would ease some tensions on the financial markets but it would still foreshadow a bitter struggle with the Tory rebels. There was acknowledgement in Whitehall yesterday that even if the treaty was endorsed by the French, it would be some time before interest rates fell again to 10 per cent. With one or two MPs publicly calling for Mr Norman Lamont's resignation, the possibility of a symbolic challenge to Mr Major's leadership can no longer be dismissed as fantasy. The Chancellor acknowledged the risk of a political backlash in the statement that followed the first base rate rise. In an attempt to strike a note of reassurance, he voiced hopes that the move would be short-lived. It was a mistake. The markets took the comment as a sign of weakness. There has been no sign of revolt in the senior ranks of the government. When the absolute commitment to sterling's parity was underlined by Mr Lamont at last week's cabinet meeting, no one voiced dissent. As one senior minister said later, even the cabinet room is too public a place to voice doubts about the chancellor's handling of the pound. There was renewed speculation yesterday that if the government is defeated by the markets Mr Lamont will have to leave the Treasury. Inevitably, the parallel that was being drawn was with the resignation as chancellor of the then Mr James Callaghan in 1967, when he was forced into devaluation. This time it is not that simple. Mr Harold Wilson, then prime minister, distanced himself from his chancellor's handling of the sterling crisis. Mr Major has done the reverse. The strategy now is to try to hold the line until Sunday, hoping that a Yes vote will bring a return to sanity. Senior Downing Street officials pointed out that even if Mr Major wanted to devalue - and he did not - Italy's experience in the past few days demonstrated that that would not offer an easy escape route. The markets seemed disinclined to offer even that brief respite. There was a real fear in Whitehall that the scale of speculation against the pound would sweep away all the government's good intentions when the markets reopen today. There was also barely concealed fury at the Bundesbank's role. Two weeks ago, Mr Lamont was winning plaudits for organising a co-ordinated EC assault on the German central bank's refusal to cut interest rates. The view in Downing Street now is that the Bundesbank has been wreaking its revenge with persistent hints that it believes sterling should be devalued. Mr Major's instinct is to tough it out. For him, the prize of victory against the markets would be a credibility for his anti-inflation strategy that has eluded every British post-war government. It is an enormous gamble. The markets have been unimpressed by conviction politics. If Mr Major wins against the odds, he will emerge as strong a prime minister as any in recent history. But last night, speculation in Whitehall was focused on the cost of losing.</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Indonesian plans HK newspaper stake Indonesian tycoon Mr Oei Hong-leong has emerged as an investor in Ming Pao, the prestige Hong Kong daily newspaper whose chairman was forced to resign last month amid revelations concerning a past criminal conviction. Mr Oei's China Strategic Holdings will buy a 10 per cent stake in Ming Pao from CIM, the newspaper's controlling shareholder, in a deal valued at about HKDollars 200m (USDollars 25.87m). Mr Yu Pun-hoi, Ming Pao former chairman and chairman of CIM, said CIM had no interest in disposing of its controlling interest in Ming Pao. A 10 per cent stake would be disposed of in two tranches of 18m shares each over the coming three months and would leave CIM still owning 50 per cent of the company. Since Mr Yu's resignation last month, in response to the censure by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange over his failure to declare a 1979 criminal conviction, the Hong Kong market has been awash with rumour and speculation about CIM's continued ownership of Ming Pao. Mr Robert Kuok, the Malaysian financier, and Mr Jimmy Lai, the publisher of Next magazine, were rumoured to have been interested in acquiring an interest in Ming Pao. In the end it was Mr Oei - whose family controls Sinar Mas, Indonesia's second largest business empire - who emerged in the lead. In addition to his private interest in Indonesia, Mr Oei is a big investor in property in Singapore, where he has made his home. In Hong Kong, he is chairman of China Strategic which is his family's vehicle for investment in China. The company has many joint ventures in China but most of its profits come from three areas of activity: it is China's biggest tyre manufacturer, it produces about 10 per cent of the country's output of paper, and it owns five breweries. A year ago Mr Oei joined a consortium of Asian businessmen who paid USDollars 10m for a 70 per cent interest in Myanmar International Airways - the flag carrier of Myanmar (formerly Burma).</p>

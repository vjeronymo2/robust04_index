			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / International Company News: French groups in defence link-up CAP Gemini Sogeti, the French computer services group, and Matra, the French electronics-to-transport company, are to merge their defence software and computer imaging businesses. The move reflects the pressure on the French defence industry, where the government plans to freeze defence spending in real terms over the next three years. It will create a FFr1bn (Dollars 198m) turnover per year group with 1,000 staff, around the same size as the defence software activities of the partners' main competitor, state controlled Thomson-CSF. The link forms part of the strategy of Mr Jean Luc-Lagardere, the chairman of Matra, of seeking partners where the group can no longer compete alone. It will start operations early next year, specialising in computer systems for handling civil and defence satellite pictures. The subsidiaries making up the joint venture are Matra-Sep Imagerie et Informatique (Matra MS2i), which had turnover of FFr542m last year and Cap Sesa Defense, which had sales of FFr346m in 1991. MS2i makes imaging systems for scientific and military clients, while Cap Sesa Defense makes information and command control systems for the French military. The partners have already worked together for the past several months on a project to computerise army battlefield communications. Cap Sesa Defense will be in charge of industrial management at two of its own sites and two MS2i sites. Marketing will be through the international offices of Matra Espace, Matra's space systems division, to help both partners win more foreign contracts.</p>

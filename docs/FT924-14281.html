			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Teachers may face merit-only pay rises PAY RISES in the future for some 400,000 school teachers in England and Wales should depend entirely on performance, Mr John Patten, education secretary, said yesterday. In evidence to the School Teachers' Review Body, he proposed a wholesale move to discretionary pay rises for all teachers, sweeping away automatic increments and annual cost-of-living awards. Mr Patten's proposals are a direct challenge to the pay review body, which earlier in the year outlined a scheme to award bonuses rewarding improvements in performance to schools, which would pass them on to individual members of staff. The review body argued that that would go with the grain of schools' existing management and culture. Its view is robustly opposed by Mr Patten, who said that merit pay for teachers should be decided by governors and not solely according to a school's position in exam-based league tables or truancy and staying-on rates. Mr Patten also said that no new money should be required for the switch, which could be funded out of existing resources. Performance-related pay should not depend on receiving 'bolt-on' extra cash but should be taken from the existing pay bill. His submission calls for action to introduce performance-related pay as soon as possible. Trials should begin next year and the new system be implemented from 1995, when the new system for teachers' appraisal would be fully in place. Mr Patten's evidence produced an immediate response from the unions, most of which oppose any form of performance-related pay. Mr Nigel de Gruchy, NAS/UWT general secretary, said it was 'outrageous'. Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, the largest teaching union, said it was impossible to operate such a scheme fairly. Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, which has not set its face against performance-related pay, said that extra money for the scheme was essential. He added: 'Whatever scheme the government has in mind, it won't work without the backing of the heads and deputy heads who must have to administer it.'</p>

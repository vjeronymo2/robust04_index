			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Antonio Jaquez] </F>   [Text] Torreon, Coahuila--"We are saying that things have  to be transformed in our country and that the transformation has  to be the work of the masses themselves...in a very strong class  struggle, in a confrontation with the bourgeoisie. From that  standpoint we have to wage a great revolutionary war."    So reads a document from Popular Line, a movement that began  in this city in the early 1970's and later spread to other  regions of the country, including the Chiapas jungle, where it  sowed the ideological seeds of the guerrilla war, according to  Jesuit priest Mardonio Morales.    According to the document, the Vietnamese started "with  small  bases that later grew larger, on the one hand. On the other, the  bases were isolated, and they gradually integrated them. Our  process has also been like this. We started with little points  in various areas of the country, and these points have been  spreading. In the beginning they were isolated; now they are  being integrated...They are support bases for the revolutionary  movement; they are the embryo of a Proletarian State."    According to the testimony and pamphlets compiled by this  reporter, Popular Line's "little points" emerged in this city in  1970 and soon spread to other towns in the Lagunera region,  Coahuila, and Durango through the invasion of urban and rural  lands. In addition, Popular Line's "cadres" came to dominate  most of the schools of the Torreon Unit of the Autonomous  University of Coahuila (UAC). During a second expansion phase in  the mid-1970's the movement spread to Monterrey, Monclova,  Durango, Valle del Yaqui (Sonora), Zacatecas, San Luis Potosi,  Hidalgo, and the Chiapas jungle.    Popular Line, also known as the Mass Line, had the support  of  around 12 priests in the Lagunera region; they helped out in the  efforts at consciousness-raising and organization among colonia  [urban settlement] residents and peasants.    "We supported them because we saw it as organizational work,  as furthering the common good, as a search for answers to the  problems of the poorest people. It was overt work. We remained  discreet in some matters, but there was no underground activity  or apologies for violent solutions," several of these priests  say.    Father Benigno Martinez says that brigade members of Mass  Line penetrated the Chiapas jungle on the express invitation of  the bishop of the diocese of San Cristobal de las Casas, Samuel  Ruiz: "He was in Torreon, saw the work that they were doing, and  liked it...And he invited them into Chiapas. That was in late  1976." Two years before, Bishop Ruiz had said no to the Torreon  Group, Father Mardonio told Guillermo Correa last September  (PROCESO 880).    The same source says that the "visible heads" of the Mass  Line movement are Adolfo Orive, the current director of training  of the National Peasant Confederation (CNC), and Hugo Andres  Araujo, a PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] deputy and  leader of the confederation: "The one we had the most contact  with was Hugo Andres, because he practically lived in La Laguna,  although he traveled a lot. Orive, in contrast, showed up from  time to time. Neither of the two liked to keep a high profile;  they did not want to appear in the press or anything like that."  Gustavo Gordillo, the current deputy secretary of the SRA  [Secretariat of Agrarian Reform], was prominently involved in  the Yaqui Valley; he later wrote about his experiences in his  book `Campesinos al asalto del cielo' [Peasants Attacking  Heaven]."    For a long time, says Father Benigno, "we believed naively  that Araujo and Orive did not have political contacts. We  thought that they were acting independently. We realized later,  especially after 1976, that they have political godfathers...."    A native of Mexico City, where he graduated from the  National  School of Economics of UNAM [National Autonomous University of  Mexico] (the 64-69 generation, according to the Biographical  Dictionary of the Mexican Government), Araujo de la Torre  settled in Torreon in 1970. He began working as a professor in  the economics department, which at the time was part of the  Humberto Perez Hinojosa School of Business and Management of the  UAC (Perez Hinojosa was a Popular Line activist). For a month  now he has been the PRI president in this municipality.    By 1971, the Popular Line philosophy, contained in a thin  book called "Hacia una politica popular" [Towards a Popular  Line], was already making the rounds in university circles, to  which this reporter belonged. The 48-page text clarifies in its  introduction that this is the second edition of a document that  was originally written "by student brigade members for student  brigade members. It was even written on the basis of a whole  series of implicit assumptions about the student movement and  severely criticizes certain tendencies that posed a very direct  threat to the movement back in November 1968."    "Why publish it again then? The fact is that the document is  a text suited to the present moment, inasmuch as it tells us  what must be done urgently: to join with the masses to pursue a  grass-roots policy with them. But it is also a text for the long  term in that it proposes a grass-roots policy as a general  political line to transform Mexico...This time the document is  designed not only for students but for every Mexican who  sincerely wants to engage in politics with the lower classes."    Through its brigade members, most of them university  students, Popular Line steadily penetrated urban centers,  particularly among colonia residents who lacked housing and  public utilities. In 1972 it established its first "social  support base": the Tierra y Libertad colonia. It was later  joined by other colonias in the eastern outskirts of the city,  including Francisco Villa and Division del Norte. In the nearby  city of Gomez Palacio, the Ricardo Flores Magon, Ruben  Jaramillo, and Jacinto Canek colonias were organized.    Father Jesus de la Torre, who helped organize these colonias  and is currently in charge of public relations for the Torreon  diocese, recalls how he had made contact with Popular Line:  "Father Jose Batarse and I hosted a TV program, called Sign of  the Times, in which we addressed social and political issues. It  was an open program, so much so that we even criticized the  waste during Luis Echeverria's presidential campaign. I assume  that Adolfo Orive heard about us through this program; he sought  us out and proposed that we work together."    He and other priests "were already doing work in very poor  colonias. We were helping people organize to meet their needs.  We started running into university brigade members...and we  managed to get along, although not without some tension. Little  by little we gained the ability to argue with them and we had it  out on some issues. We cared about the people, not a given  political line. What we saw was that all these joint efforts led  to the development of a very broad solidarity movement and a  very strong motivation to stay involved, which to us was  inspired more by the Book of the Apostles than by Maoist texts."    The Popular Line people "were, I thought, quite studious,  quite quick in analyzing the times, dogmatic on some issues.  They were systematic, very pedagogical; they analyzed  everything, from the president's reports to the pope's  encyclicals...I never heard either the brigade members or Orive  or Araujo talk in favor of weapons as an answer to problems, and  I am not aware that they engaged in underground activities. To  be sure, they acted with discretion, especially Araujo, who used  to say that he had to be careful because he was not from La  Laguna."    Benigno Martinez, the current parish priest in Concordia in  the municipality of San Pedro de las Colonias, relates that in  the early 1970's in the Torreon diocese "several of us priests  were very motivated by the proposals in the Medellin documents.  We were trying to get the Catholic movements to push forward and  find options for a commitment in tune with the demands of the  real world. One day Father Jose Batarse went to Durango to give  a talk at the university, and in the audience was Adolfo Orive,  who became very enthusiastic about what Pepe was saying."    Orive came to Torreon "and explained Popular Line's program  to us. We thought that its proposals were very sensible and in  accord with those of the Mexican Social Secretary. The point was  to invigorate the intermediate bodies, in other words, to  encourage people's involvement in decision-making, in opposition  to the prevailing custom of having only the leaders of the  colonias take action. The point was also to have the people take  care of their needs and, at the same time, to grow politically  and ideologically. We, as pastors, wanted to see their faith  become an element that would revitalize an entire grass-roots  process."    Once contact had been established with Orive, Araujo  "introduced himself to us as a commissioner around 1971. Because  he was a university student, he established connections there  and won over people who later developed nicely, among them  Miguel Murillo and Salvador Hernandez Velez (now a member of the  CNC). We began to spur the worker-grass-roots movement, first by  trying to democratize the railway union, Section 27. Then came  the Tierra y Libertad colonia, in which what would become the  Mass Line was established."    "First we identified the most strongly felt needs, and  everyone who was experiencing the problem organized to solve it,  not in a pyramid arrangement but rather by acting on the  decisions of the rank and file. The colonia residents organized  block assemblies, then sector assemblies, and finally came the  general assembly, which was the highest body. Once this  structure had been established, a brigade was formed with the  most advanced elements, whose job was to guide the others. The  brigade encouraged discussion and general involvement; it was  what was called the ideological apparatus. There was also the  political apparatus, which executed all of the resolutions: to  go and see certain authorities, to hold rallies, demonstrations,  etc."    The highest body of the Popular Line was the so-called  Guiding Ideological Organization (OID), which was officially  established in 1976 according to the document "Major Issues  Concerning Our Line and Our Organization," published in June  1978.    When Mass Line grew, both in this region and elsewhere,  Father Benigno says, "the feuds in the top echelon, the OID,  began, and two factions appeared in the organization: the  so-called Proletariats, led by Adolfo Orive, and the so-called  Christian Democrats or Ultrademocrats, represented by Araujo. At  that time, Orive was in Monterrey.... The internal struggle led  to the abandonment of the working-class colonias, emigration,  and the so-called Policy of Two Faces (hit the internal enemy  hard but pursue a policy of negotiations with the external  enemy)."    "I do not know whether by pursuing this policy Orive and  Araujo wound up working together for the government, thus making  a turnaround that we still do not understand and that hurt a lot  of people who believed in them, especially Araujo. He helped  people discover how corrupt the system was...and now he is part  of the system. What I do know is that the ideological struggle  and the struggle for power that Orive and Araujo waged back then  wound up separating them. Orive founded Proletarian Line, and  Araujo continued with the Mass Line."    By 1976 the Mass Line had spread to several municipalities  in  rural La Laguna, in particular San Pedro in colonia Emiliano  Zapata and Francisco I. Madero on the small estate Batopilas and  in colonia 2 de Marzo. Several priests also helped out in this  expansion, most prominent among them Benigno Martinez, Jesus de  la Torre, and Jose Batarse. The latter relates that the shining  moment during this stage was the struggle of the day laborers at  the Batopilas winery (owned by Manuel Suarez). It began as a  strike in January of that year to demand decent wages; then the  workers invaded the lands in April to ask that they be turned  into an ejido, which finally happened on 21 May.    During the invasion at Batopilas, Father Martinez asserts,  "we started to realize Hugo Andres' political connections." The  action triggered mobilizations in several municipalities, also  demanding lands that were in the hands of latifundio holders. In  response, the government of Oscar Flores Tapia began cracking  down in October 1976. Araujo de la Torre, some 20 peasants, and  Fathers Benigno Martinez and Jesus de la Torre were arrested and  all thrown in prison in Saltillo. The priests were behind bars  for five days, Araujo for two months.    In October 1976 Bishop Ruiz was in Torreon. "And it was on  that occasion that he invited those of us in Mass Line to  Chiapas," says Concha Castro, who back then was a brigade member  and today is coordinating the opening of the CNC's Institute of  Rural Area Studies in this city. "Some 12 of us brigade members  went to Ocosingo. I was there from September 1977 to December  1988. We took part in forming the `Quiotic ta Lecontusel' ejido  union and we spurred several economic projects."    She says that the work of the Mass Line brigade members in  the Chiapas jungle involved "organizing, raising the awareness  of people through workshops and seminars, all designed to  relieve the most pressing hardships. Our work was overt, not at  all clandestine. Neither the communities nor we ever proposed  violence as a way of resolving problems. If Father Mardonio says  that we planted the ideological seed of the guerrilla war, that  is his opinion. We never brought up the issue of the armed  struggle, nor did people bring it up with us." She says that  Araujo was not in Chiapas.    According to newswoman Olga Quirarte, who at that time was  news chief for the paper LA OPINION, Araujo, his wife Carmen,  and a lot of university students "went into the Chiapas jungle.  Some returned very soon. Others, like Hugo Andres and Carmen,  stayed for a few months. It was a sort of great March, an  imitation of the one that Mao did into Beijing. When the Chiapas  mosquitoes got the best of them, they left. It was the big  pullback of 1968. There were not guerrillas; they were people  who went to support the most backward people in La Laguna."</p>

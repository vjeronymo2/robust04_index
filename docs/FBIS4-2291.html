			<p>BFN     [Text] Shijiazhuang, April 8 (XINHUA) -- The trade volume  of the rural and urban trade centers in north China's Hebei  Province topped 32.1 billion yuan in 1993 with a hefty 52.1  percent rise from the year before, equaling 54 percent of its  total retail sale, according to a top official.    Developed from roadside markets and village fairs as early  as  the 1980s, the official said, the rural and urban farm products  markets have played a vital part in promoting commodity trading  across the province and the country over the past few years.    He attributed 1993's surge in trade fairs and farm-products  markets to an increasing investment in market building by the  local government.    He said that the investment in market construction in 1992  jumped to over one billion yuan, more than double that of a  four-year period from 1988 to 1991. And at least 130 million  yuan was added in 1993 to the previous year's total.    Over the past two years, nearly 800 such new trade centers  and markets have been built or rebuilt in the province, ranging  from open markets to modern high-rise business centers to  multi-function luxury hotels.    A medicine trade center, called oriental, covering an area  of  12 hectares with an investment of 140 million yuan, is expected  to go into operation soon. Within the center, about 500  business buildings and a luxury hotel funded by a Hong Kong  investor have been built.    By the end of 1993, the number of various kinds of special  markets reached 641, with a trade volume totalling 17.95 billion  yuan, accounting for 57.7 percent of the amount for all trade  centers.    In Yongnian County, one vegetable trading center is able to  handle 500 million kilograms of vegetables yearly, which are  sold to more than 50 cities in 19 provinces and regions  throughout the country, and partly to Japan and other Southeast  Asian countries.    The Lixian County Fur Center has a daily trading capacity of  200,000 fur pelts worth nearly 10 million yuan.    In mid-March, a three-day national stock products trading  fair was held in Lixian County, with a transaction volume of  1.08 billion yuan.    More than 4,000 businessmen around the country and over 60  overseas tradesmen from eight countries and regions throughout  the world, including the United States, Japan and Hong Kong,  attended the fair.</p>

Among confiscated samples sent for inspection to the state  laboratory was the same heroin that killed Vasilis Tsaklof,  containing 24 percent of the drug and 54 percent of lactose.  That combination in itself is not necessarily fatal but the  victim had combined it with Hypnostedon pills.    Attica police headquarters said that heroin in the Greek  market used to be only ten to 15 percent pure. The state lab  inspected ten different samples of the drug, confiscated in  Athens, and discovered that their heroin content ranged from 22  to 55 percent.    The number of victims this month in Athens from "instant  death" heroin has now risen to 15 whilst heroin addict Dhimos  Tsagalidhis, 27, is in a coma at a hospital in Serres, northern  Greece.</p>

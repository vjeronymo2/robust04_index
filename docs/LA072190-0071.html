			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXXON TANKER LEAVES DRY DOCK  </P> <P> After nearly a year in dry dock in San Diego Bay, the Exxon tanker involved in  the nation's worst oil spill returned to water Friday night after undergoing  multimillion-dollar repairs.  </P> <P> Towed by four tug boats, the Exxon Mediterranean, formerly the Exxon Valdez,  was floated out of its dry dock for the first time and moved into the bay.  </P> <P> It was escorted a quarter of a mile to an outfitting pier, where it was berthed  to undergo 10 days of equipment checks and other tests to evaluate its  seaworthiness. A two-week sea trial is scheduled for early August, followed by  a voyage to the Middle East.  </P> <P> When the damaged ship was brought to San Diego last July for $30 million in  repairs, officials said whole sheets of the tanker's skin on the starboard side  appeared shredded, twisted and crumpled, as if it were flimsy aluminum, not  3/4-inch thick steel.  </P></p>

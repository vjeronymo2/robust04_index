			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, June 5 (YONHAP) -- North Korea, facing  U.N. sanctions for its suspected nuclear arms development  program, recently bid for the import of some 100 consumer items,  including rice, corn and sugar, from Hong Kong traders.    A trader, who has received North Korea's written inquiry  about the import, told YONHAP News Agency Saturday that North  Korean businesses had placed with many Hong Kong traders orders  for rice, corn, sugar and some 100 other consumer items,  hurrying to strike deals by the early part of June.    The trader, who has long business relations with North  Korea,  said North Korea had informed him that it would send a  three-member government buying mission, headed by the vice  chairman of the Light Industry Commission, to China's special  economic district of Zhuhai in southern Guangdong Province in  early June.    The North Korean mission will stay in a dormitory for  members  of the five North Korean firms operating in Zhuhai, not in a  hotel for security reasons, for seven days, making deals with  Hong Kong traders in the dormitory, he added.    Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said he could not  disclose a full list of the items, including the quantities and  values, North Korea ordered because of the business interest  involved.    In addition to making deals with Hong Kong traders, the  North  Korean mission will meet a Hong Kong lawyer in Zhuhai to discuss  ways of recovering the 4 million U.S. dollars still remaining in  North Korea's deposits in the bankrupt Bank of Credit and  Commerce International in Hong kong, the trader said.    North Korea has withdrawn 6 million dollars out of the 10  million dollars it deposited in the Hong Kong bank since its  declaration of bankruptcy in 1991.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Zagreb, April 24 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb forces  appear to have complied with a NATO ultimatum to withdraw three  kilometers from the center of Gorazde or face air strikes, the  head of UN forces in the former Yugoslavia said Sunday [24  April]. In an interview with AFP here, French General Bertrand  de Lapresle said the Serbs were observing a ceasefire and "have  withdrawn beyond the three-kilometer line, as far as we can  tell."

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  suggested Tuesday [31 May] that the government is considering  introduction of a new local consumption tax to secure funds for  social welfare in the aging society.    "A decision has to be made sooner or later," Hata told a  session of the House of Representatives Budget Committee  reviewing the long- delayed state budget for fiscal 1994, which  began April 1.    The remark showed Hata's positive stance concerning such a  new tax in line with the government's tax system reform program,  observers said.    Government sources said, however, that the Finance Ministry  opposes the idea for technical reasons, including complicated  tax- collection procedures.    A local consumption tax would increase revenues of local  governments and could be used to ease the burden of medical and  other costs to care for aged residents.    Backing up Hata's remark, the head of the government's tax  commission, Kan Kato, told reporters commission members have  agreed on the need for new revenue sources, and the local tax  idea cannot be ignored when a hike is implemented in the present  3.0 percent consumption tax.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / International Company News: Nixdorf, Fujitsu extend alliance SIEMENS NIXDORF, the German information technology group, and Fujitsu, Japan's largest computer maker, are extending their co-operation in mainframe computers to include next-generation machines. Fujitsu will supply Siemens with high performance semiconductor manufacturing technology to be used in Siemens's entry-level and mid-range machines, while Siemens will provide Fujitsu with the central processing unit technology for Fujitsu's entry-level range. Siemens and Fujitsu will work together on operating systems software and on components. The tie-up extends the relationship the two companies have had in mainframes, in which Fujitsu has supplied Siemens with high-end mainframe computers. The extended relationship underlines both companies' belief that high costs need to be reduced in view of the length of time it takes to develop mainframe computers. Fujitsu is one of the largest makers of mainframes in Japan, but this is a shrinking business with users increasingly switching to equally powerful but much cheaper workstations and PCs. Applied Materials of the US, the world's largest maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and Komatsu, the Japanese construction machinery maker, are setting up a joint venture to develop, manufacture and market equipment to make liquid crystal displays. Applied Materials and Komatsu will each take a 50 per cent stake in the joint venture, which will be established in Japan. The new company will take over the business of Applied Displays Technology, a subsidiary of Applied Materials established in Japan in 1991 to develop equipment to manufacture LCD panels. The market for LCD panels, which are used in laptop computers and compact televisions, is expected to show strong growth.</p>

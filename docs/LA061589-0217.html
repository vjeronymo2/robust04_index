			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> 'RARE' BASEBALL CARD JUST A $10 COPY  </P> <P> A supposedly rare baseball card stolen from a 14-year-old boy who had hoped to  use it for his college education turned out to be a replica worth $10 at the  most, investigators say.  </P> <P> The stolen card, thought to be a 1910 Honus Wagner tobacco card worth about  $100,000, lacked the tobacco stamp that would have shown that it was an  original, said Detective Phil White of the Contra Costa County Sheriff's  Department.  </P> <P> The boy, who still hasn't recovered the stolen card, was shown a replica  Tuesday and said it was "exactly the same card stolen from him," White said.  </P> <P> "Up until yesterday we had no way of determining if the card was authentic or a  replica," White said. "We didn't even know a replica existed, not being  specialists in that field. We had nothing to compare it with."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (3) The waste must be treated using the technology specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the table (``technology standard''), which are described in detail in &sect; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 268.42, Table 1_Technology Codes and Description of Technology-Based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (b) For wastewaters, compliance with concentration level  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards is based on maximums for any one day, except for D004  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through D011 wastes for which the previously promulgated treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards based on grab samples remain in effect. For all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonwastewaters, compliance with concentration level standards is based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on grab sampling. For wastes covered by the waste extract standards,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the test Method 1311, the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found in ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Methods'', EPA Publication SW&hyph;846, as incorporated by reference in &sect; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 260.11, must be used to measure compliance. An exception is made for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D004 and D008, for which either of two test methods may be used:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Method 1311, or Method 1310, the Extraction Procedure Toxicity Test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For wastes covered by a technology standard, the wastes may be land  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposed after being treated using that specified technology or an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent treatment technology approved by the Administrator under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the procedures set forth in &sect;268.42(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (c) When wastes with differing treatment standards for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituent of concern are combined for purposes of treatment, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment residue must meet the lowest treatment standard for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituent of concern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (d) Notwithstanding the prohibitions specified in paragraph (a)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this section, treatment and disposal facilities may demonstrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (and certify pursuant to 40 CFR 268.7(b)(5)) compliance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment standards for organic constituents specified by a footnote  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the table ``Treatment Standards for Hazardous Wastes'' in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section, provided the following conditions are satisfied:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (1) The treatment standards for the organic constituents were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established based on incineration in units operated in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the technical requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subpart O, or based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combustion in fuel substitution units operating in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable technical requirements;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (2) The treatment or disposal facility has used the methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referenced in paragraph (d)(1) of this section to treat the organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituents; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (3) The treatment or disposal facility may demonstrate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with organic constituents if good-faith analytical efforts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> achieve detection limits for the regulated organic constituents that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do not exceed the treatment standards specified in this section by an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order of magnitude.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (e) For characteristic wastes (D001, D002, and D012&hyph;D043 that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are subject to treatment standards in the following table ``Treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standards for Hazardous Wastes,'' all underlying hazardous constituents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (as defined in &sect;268.2(i)) must meet Universal Treatment Standards,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found in &sect;268.48, Table UTS, prior to land disposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  (f) The treatment standards for F001&hyph;F005 nonwastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituents carbon disulfide, cyclohexanone, and/or methanol apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes which contain only one, two, or three of these constituents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Compliance is measured for these constituents in the waste extract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from test Method 1311, the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found in ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Methods'', EPA Publication SW&hyph;846, as incorporated by reference in &sect; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 260.11. If the waste contains any of these three constituents along  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with any of the other 25 constituents found in F001&hyph;F005, then  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with treatment standards for carbon disulfide,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cyclohexanone, and/or methanol are not required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

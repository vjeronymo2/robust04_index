			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Pierre Lefevre: "The Russians and Americans </F> Are Readjusting Their Relations -- Moscow Will Join NATO's  Partnership for Peace"]    [Text] Russia will soon join the Partnership for Peace  [PFP] proposed by NATO, Moscow has just announced. The three  ambassadors sent to the Russian capital to present this  initiative judged the Russian reaction to be "very positive."  This decision, taken after long hesitations, essentially  indicates that Moscow intends to continue its policy of  cooperation with Western countries.    The announcement of a forthcoming meeting between Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher on 14 March in Vladivostock to "repair"  Russian-U.S. relations, it is said in Moscow, also points in  this direction. It is true that since the Clinton-Yeltsin  summit in mid-January these relations have been subject to  increasing tensions, creating uncertainties.    Strong rivalry has reappeared in East-West relations. In  Sarajevo then Tuzla, Russia has imposed itself forcefully and  skillfully without even consulting UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Force], as soon as NATO started to act without it. It has also  opposed any new UN resolutions regarding other Bosnian safe  areas, and any other threat of using force against the Serbs.    In a wider perspective, Russia has refused any enlargement  of  NATO toward the East. And when U.S. President Clinton invited  Rabin and 'Arafat to Washington to try to save the peace process  after the Hebron massacre, Moscow immediately sent its own  emissary to Tunis and Jerusalem to see the PLO. Certainly the  sword of Damocles named nationalism no longer allows the  occupants in the Kremlin the slightest weakness on the  international front.  <H5>  Questions and Doubts </H5>   On both sides questions are also being asked about the real  intentions of the other party. In Washington they are wondering  about the new Russian policies which, from Kozyrev to Yeltsin,  are reaffirming their pretensions to a sphere of interest beyond  Russian borders. They are asking what is the new military  doctrine, which has still not been presented by Moscow. They  are asking what cooperation can be expected from the Russians,  not only in Bosnia, but also in the Near East or North Korea.    In contrast, in Moscow they are wondering about the reasons  for Washington giving so much publicity to the arrest of the  Ames spy couple. This operation was in fact revealed at the  very moment when Strobe Talbott, the advocate of unrestricted  cooperation with Russia, was confirmed by Congress for the  number two position in the State Department. In the United  States a quiet battle for influence is taking place between new  doves and new hawks in order to reorient the White House's  Russian policies. Moscow is entitled to wonder about its  outcome.    Things have suddenly turned cold. Washington has reverted to  a certain prudence. It has refused President Yeltsin's proposal  for a summit conference on Bosnia. In the economic field the  recent meeting of the finance ministers of the G-7 countries  also indicated that there would not be any major new financial  aid for Russia without an effective revival of the reforms,  which looks very improbable today. In turn, worried by NATO  going it alone in Bosnia, Russia fears isolation and exclusion  from the debate on security in Europe, and the loss of its  status as a European great power.    Nevertheless in recent days the two partners have  rediscovered the language of moderation and are seeking to show  consideration for their respective sensitivities. Russia will  join the PFP, but on special terms respectful of its great power  status. Moscow has approved the attack against Serb planes  which were violating the Bosnian no-fly zone, but in turn NATO  has been careful to not identify the origin of this provocation  too closely, just as it has carefully avoided any attacks in the  demilitarized, highly sensitive zone around Sarajevo. Between  questions and concerns, rivalry and cooperation, the Russians  and Americans can still find ground for agreement, it seems.</p>

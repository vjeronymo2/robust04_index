			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CD CORNER: ROULETTE STARS TOP RHINO'S LATEST OFFERINGS  </P> <P> There are some weeks when it seems appropriate to call this column the Rhino  Records Corner, because the Santa Monica-based label continues to come up with  so many impressive CD reissues from the early days of rock.  </P> <P> The latest examples are the first four titles in a series of packages that are  being released in connection with Rhino's acquisition of the North American  rights to the catalogues of Roulette Records and associated labels.  </P> <P> Two of the "best of" collections are by prized R&amp;B groups that got their  starts in the '50s: Frankie Lymon &amp; the Teenagers and Little Anthony &amp;  the Imperials.  </P> <P> Lymon was just 13 when he recorded "Why Do Fools Fall in Love," one of the most  celebrated hits from rock's first decade. One of the great young voices of  early R&amp;B and a big influence on Michael Jackson, Lymon went through a  series of personal problems in the '60s and died of an apparent drug overdose  in 1968.  </P> <P> Little Anthony -- Anthony Gourdine -- was not as noteworthy a stylist as Lymon,  but he was responsible for some memorable hits, including "Tears on My Pillow,"  "Goin' Out of My Head" and "Hurt So Bad."  </P> <P> The two other Rhino releases center on '60s rock groups: Tommy James &amp; the  Shondells and Mitch Ryder &amp; the Detroit Wheels. James also recorded his  first hit when was 13: "Hanky Panky." Among his other hits were "I Think We're  Alone Now" and "Crimson and Clover." After going on his own, James returned to  the Top 10 with "Draggin' the Line," which is also included in the Rhino album.  </P> <P> Next to Lymon and James, Ryder (real name: William Levise) was a slow starter.  He was 20 when he broke into the national charts with the high-energy "Jenny  Take a Ride." The group's other Top 10 hits included the "Devil With a Blue  Dress On"/"Good Golly Miss Molly" medley that Bruce Springsteen has often  saluted in concert.  </P> <P> Like most Rhino collections, all four CD albums come with extensive liner notes  and photos. Among the Roulette-related artists who will be featured in future  anthologies: Jimmie Rodgers ("Honeycomb" and "Kisses Sweeter Than Wine"),  Ronnie Hawkins (whose backing group once included some members of the Band),  Joey Dee ("Peppermint Twist"), the Marcels ("Blue Moon"), the Cadillacs  ("Speedo") and the Cleftones ("Little Girl of Mine").  </P> <P> IN THE BUDGET BIN -- The latest four entries in Capitol Records' excellent  "Collector's Series" (budget CDs featuring at least 20 tracks per album and  handsome liner note/photo booklets) spotlight the Four Preps, the Five Keys  (one of the first R&amp;B groups signed by a major label), Dean Martin and  Wayne Newton. . . . Other budget collections in the stores: the Eagles' "Live,"  Al Green's "Call Me" and "Full of Fire," Joan Armatrading's "Walk Under  Ladders," Squeeze's "Singles 45s and Under," Laura Nyro's "New York  Tendaberry," Jefferson Airplane's "Crown of Creation," Buffalo Springfield's  "Buffalo Springfield" plus Bette Midler's "Bette Midler" and her "Divine  Madness" sound-track album.  </P></p>

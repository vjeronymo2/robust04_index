			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Observer: Prod into action Poor Romano Prodi. The chairman of Italy's IRI state holding company, which among other things runs Alitalia, this week had the indignity forced on him of having to fly by another airline. British Airways took him from Heathrow to Rome. Almost all flights of Alitalia - which the Brits helped establish after the second world war - were grounded because of a pilots' strike. The BA captain couldn't resist inviting passengers to fly BA again, to be sure of a reliable service. Prodi was not amused. But he might be smiling soon; rumours are again flying of an equity link between BA and the troubled Italian carrier.</p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD FIRMS' PRESIDENTS MAY BE RESIGNING  </P> <P> Both PolyGram and Chrysalis record companies appear to be losing their  presidents.  </P> <P> Sources at PolyGram in New York said Wednesday that Dick Asher, the company's  president and CEO since October, 1985, resigned on Tuesday. Asher was said to  have walked around the firm's New York offices saying goodby to co-workers and  employees. Company officials said they expect to make a formal announcement,  including the effective date of Asher's resignation, next week.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Chrysalis' U.S. president, Mike Bone, has reportedly given notice  that he will leave as of Dec. 15 from the post he has held since July, 1987.  </P> <P> Both moves have been long-rumored in industry circles and result in part from  the consolidations and new ventures that characterize the record business at  this time. In July, Thorn-EMI purchased 50% of London-based Chrysalis, while  over the last several months PolyGram, owned by the Dutch conglomerate N.V.  Philips, has solidified its position as the No. 3 U.S. record company behind  the CBS and Time-Warner groups by acquiring independent powerhouses Island and  A&amp;M.  </P> <P> The enlarged PolyGram is expected to reorganize into two operations: a New  York-based Mercury label and a Los Angeles-based Polydor. Island and A&amp;M  will continue as autonomous entities. An official statement regarding Asher's  resignation will be released next week.  </P> <P> Each resignation has also fueled speculation about future executive moves.  Island's president Lou Maglia and A&amp;M president Jerry Moss have been  mentioned as the most likely candidates to succeed Asher. According to a source  at Island, Maglia has said that he is definitely not taking the job, while  Moss' office would not comment on the situation.  </P> <P> Bone, meanwhile, is expected to take a top position with the new record company  that the Walt Disney Co. is reportedly starting, working directly under Peter  Paterno, a powerful music industry attorney and longtime business associate and  friend. Bone was not in his office on Wednesday and Chrysalis had no official  comment on the reports.  </P></p>

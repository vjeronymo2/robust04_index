			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Paraguayans have first free say in 182 years: The Election ELECTIONS in Paraguay used to have only one serious contender. General Alfredo Stroessner ruled Paraguay with an iron fist for 35 years but was ritually 're-elected' in polls that were neither free nor fair. The Stroessner era ended in 1989 when his former right-hand man, General Andres Rodriguez, toppled him in a military coup. To the surprise of many, Gen Rodriguez has kept his promise of bringing democracy to Paraguay - a country ruled by generals and dictators since independence from Spain in 1811. Mr Rodriguez promises that the general election on Sunday will be free and fair. He was himself confirmed in power in a reasonably clean snap election months after the 1989 coup. Mr Rodriguez, who is constitutionally barred from standing, has repeatedly stated in public that he will respect the result of the election for president and for congress, even if the opposition wins. The likelihood of an opposition victory is less remote than once seemed possible. The formidable electoral machine of the Colorado party - which, together with the army, has run Paraguay for almost 50 years - is split and demoralised. Its lacklustre candidate for president, Mr Juan Carlos Wasmosy, is lagging in the polls. Mr Luis Maria Argana, his opponent in a bitter primary election, is calling on voters to back any candidate rather than Mr Wasmosy. Furthermore, an unending stream of reports in the unshackled press about political repression during the Stroessner years and corruption under Mr Rodriguez has further darkened the reputation of the Colorados and the military. Opinion polls put two opposition candidates in the lead. Mr Domingo Laino, veteran opponent of the Stroessner regime and candidate of the Authentic Liberal Radical party is running neck and neck with Mr Guillermo Caballero Vargas, an independent pro-business candidate of Encuentro Nacional, a coalition grouping. None of the three leading candidates would be expected to make any radical policy shifts. Mr Wasmosy pledges continuity. Mr Caballero would take a more pro-business line. Mr Laino wisely promises to avoid antagonising the armed forces. The government has not been helped by a mixed economic record. Despite its free-market policies, last year the economy grew only 1.7 per cent. This year things are looking up, with stronger export prices and forecasts of 4 per cent growth. All this has not gone down well with the armed forces or the Colorado party. Gen Lino Oviedo, commander of the 1st army corps, which is strategically based in the capital, Asuncion, said the armed forces would 'co-govern' Paraguay with the Colorados forever - a view publicly shared by other top officers. But on Saturday Mr Laino attracted 200,000 people to a rally in Asuncion, which analysts see as an eloquent public rebuke to the military. There is also widespread belief that the Colorados could simply rig the elections. Or they could use their majority in congress - which will have the last word in disputes over the elections' outcome - to maintain their hold on power. If all else fails, the army could intervene. But it will be harder to get away with dirty tricks than before. International observers will be vigilant. Argentina and Brazil - Paraguay's two powerful neighbours - say they will not tolerate a return to the past. US President Bill Clinton has told Mr Rodriguez he trusts the elections would be free and fair and would proceed as scheduled. The US has had a crucial role in coaxing Paraguay towards democracy, as it had in keeping Mr Stroessner in power. That is why level heads in Asuncion are confident that Mr Rodriguez will be as good as his word and turn over power to a legitimately elected successor - for the first time in 182 years. It is another question whether an opposition leader can govern without the backing of the military, still the arbiters of power in Paraguay.</p>

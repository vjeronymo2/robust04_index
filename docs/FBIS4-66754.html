			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mamduh al-Wali: "Will Investment Funds Compete </F> With Savings Strategies?"]    [Text] Investment funds are new financial vehicles that  will offer themselves to the public in the coming period. The  funds seek to invest in securities.    Their concept is based on offering the fund's capital to the  public for general subscription, the fund's capital being  divided into equal portions, each of which is called a  certificate of investment. From the amount collected from  subscriptions to the investment certificates the fund engages in  trading--buying and selling--securities (bonds and stocks). From  this operation are realized the fund's profits, which are  distributed equally to the investment certificates. However, not  all operations are necessarily profitable: sometimes the fund  may lose, but the diversity of the securities and the experience  of the fund managers work to offset the loss through other  operations.    In this way, investment funds are an appropriate, safe  alternative to investment companies. Investors who do not want  to deal with banks can invest their money in investment funds,  which therefore are a strong competitor to the other savings  vehicles in the banks.    As Dr. Mahmud Subh of the 'Ayn Shams business faculty says  that the size of a fund's profits or losses depends on the  quality of the securities it holds. Dealing with the funds thus  is subject to profit and loss. There is no guarantee of a  definite rate of profit as with bank deposits. However, with the  increased risk attendant on the acceptance of the principle of  profit and loss comes the opportunity to realize high rates of  gain on a certificate's holding--returns much higher than those  of banks--if good securities are chosen that yield high rates of  return through capital gains or stock dividends.    Now that the funds exist, there is no longer any reason for  the small investor who knows nothing about how to deal with  securities to hold back. Specialized management companies will  study the market for him, determine the condition of companies,  acquire the securities of good companies, and unload the  securities of companies that may be face difficulties for long  periods.  <H5>  Bank Securities </H5>   A major problem that will face the funds is the shortage of  good securities in the market. Currently existing brokerage  companies and financial portfolio formation companies complain  of this problem. How much more of a problem there will be with  the entry of the greater demand that the funds cause! It may  cause an excessive rise in the price of some securities.    Husayn Shukri, a financial expert, says that one should take  into account some securities already on the market, in addition  to securities that will be opened to public subscription in  privatization operations. The cement companies and the  al-Dakhilah Paints and Iron Company, among others, will be  offered in coming months. Shares to increase the capital of the  International Commercial Bank will be delivered to their owners  soon. All this will increase the supply of securities. The  market is expanding with an increased volume of supply and an  increased amount of demand at the same time.    Another factor making for an increased supply [of  securities]  is that some banks are offering part of their portfolios of  sluggish securities for circulation. The bank's affiliated fund  will have priority in taking advantage of some of these  securities. Farid Ibrahim, vice president of al-Ahli Investment  Funds Company, notes that over 30 percent of banks'  assets--those invested in securities--are stagnant. These are  good securities, but the banks are satisfied with the dividends  they collect on them. The securities could yield more if the  banks sold some of them, bought others, and made their portfolio  circulate, instead of the current tendency to target and hoard  stocks with current dividends. Some banks have begun to believe  in circulating their portfolios, instead of hoarding. Al-Ahli  Bank's portfolio will have a share in the fund's portfolio.  However, the quality of the security is the first and last  criterion.    Dr. Ahmad Sa'd 'Abd-al-Latif, at Cairo University's school  of  business, points to another aspect: legally approved securities  that have not yet gone on the market. We now have many  securities according to the laws; yet they are not on the  market. Law 146 granted joint-stock companies that are not  subject to the law the right to issue financing instruments. The  law also allowed the issuance of preferred stocks; the market,  however, has not seen them. Although one faltering joint  commercial bank has turned to them to encourage interest in  subscribing to increase its capital, other companies are in need  of the same procedure.  <H5>  There Is a Difference </H5>   Farid Ibrahim, vice president of al-Ahli Investment Funds  Company, noted the difference between the funds and investment  companies, despite the similarity in goals and aims. It is a  difference in the methods followed. The most prominent of these  is the principle of asset distribution. When a fund's resources  are short term, their investment must be short term and highly  liquid, so that they can be converted into cash quickly, thus  enabling the investor to withdraw his money at any time.  Conversely, the investments of investment companies have been  directed toward such long-term areas as agricultural and  manufacturing projects and real estate.  <H5>  Certificate Price and the Small Investor </H5>   The first fund to offer its certificates will offer them at  a  price of 500 pounds per certificate, with a minimum purchase of  1,000 pounds. This raises the problem of whether the  certificate's price suits the abilities of the small investors  whom the fund intends to encourage to deal in securities. Some  think this price is too high and will prevent the involvement of  ordinary people--especially young people and government  employees--who would have been brought in by a lower certificate  price.    Dr. Nadiyah Abu-Fakhrah, of the business administration  department of 'Ayn Shams University's business school, thinks  that during the initial phase the ordinary person will not be  interested in buying investment certificates. Such people turn  to the postal savings fund. As awareness about investing in  securities increases, some of these people may turn gradually to  buying investment certificates. In the first phase, one can  therefore expect the purchases of investment certificates to be  concentrated on those who have an awareness about securities  investments, particularly companies and banks.    Dr. Khayri al-Jaziri, a finance teacher at Cairo  University's  business school, says that the Egyptian market still lacks  studies to determine the characteristics of the Egyptian small  investor and ascertain his financial abilities and what kind of  investment suits him in terms of liquidity, yield, and degree of  risk. This is where we should begin. After such studies exist,  they can be translated into setting the value, type, and  characteristics of the securities offered, so that they will  suit the small investor.    Dr. Ahmad Sa'd 'Abd-al-Latif thinks that the certificate's  price is reasonable because one can assume that anyone who  invests in securities does not need the invested amount for a  period of time. Thus, if the amount undergoes some losses, they  will not affect his standard of living, because the money is  surplus that is not needed for daily expenditures. Thus the sum  is appropriate. In case the holder of the certificate needs to  reclaim its value, the value of its yield must exceed the costs  of his going to the bank and must be suitable for the time in  which he can reclaim it. The relative greatness of the value  will also make management operations within the fund easier.    Dr. Mahmud Subh of the business administration department of  'Ayn Shams business school thinks that, if it is merely a matter  of shifting some of the money of bank depositors, who will shift  some of their money deposited in the banks to the purchase of  certificates, we shall not thereby add much to the market. We  ought to be attracting new money that is outside current bank  deposits with their accumulated liquidity, so as to expand the  circle of investment.    Many experts think that the time is not right for the  emergence of the funds. It would be better for the constituent  factors for their success to be present first, as any failure in  the first phase will affect the entire experiment. Others think  we must begin, because we are already late: the picture will  become clearer with experience; encouraging factors will appear  that can be used to advantage; and we shall become aware of  impeding factors, so that they can be remedied.    Dr. Ahmad Sa'd 'Abd-al-Latif says that we have a limited  number of financial analysts--people to provide information  about stocks for making decisions to buy or sell securities at  appropriate times. A stock has a cycle of rise and fall, and  only a financial analyst can know where a stock currently stands  in this cycle. Only he can predict the directions of stock  prices. As everyone knows, we do not have studies to predict the  condition of Egyptian companies. Although accountants currently  perform the task of financial analysis, they concentrate on past  information, while analysis requires past, present, and future  information. Although we have past information, we have a  shortage of present information and very little future-oriented  information.    Husayn Shukri says that we have financial analysts. Although  they are accountants by origin, they are being enlisted to serve  in securities analysis. As for an absence of studies to predict  securities prices, the funds will attend to this. Companies will  emerge in the coming period to do research based on their  successive visits to the companies whose condition they are  analyzing. In most countries of the world, brokerage firms have  research departments. With time, this will happen in Egypt.    Dr. Khayri al-Jaziri commented that the profession of  financial analyst does not necessarily require that the analyst  have a background in accounting, management, or economics. It is  a profession in which anyone who has the tools can succeed. We  have a sufficient number of financial analysts in Egypt at the  present time.    The problem lies in the shortage of people who can read  financial analysis and benefit from its conclusions, so as to  translate the results of financial analysis into financial  decisions.</p>

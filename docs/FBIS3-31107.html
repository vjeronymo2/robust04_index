NATO deputy secretary-general Sergio Silvio Balanzino told  journalists: "For the time being we notice with satisfaction  that the truce, the ceasefire, is being by and large respected."    The ceasefire began on Thursday one day after NATO warned  that it would launch air strikes against Bosnian Serb artillery  encircling Sarajevo unless it was withdrawn or placed under  United Nations control by midnight next Sunday.    But Balanzino brushed aside a question about demands from  the  Bosnian Serbs that they should be allowed to retain the  artillery in their own quarters, subject to UN surveillance,  instead of physically handing the weapons over.    "The goal is to have the guns and heavy weapons put under  control. Now there could be a variety of controls. As to  techniques, these are steps to be worked out," Balanzino said,  refusing to elaborate any further. [passage omitted]    A senior UN officer warned in Sarajevo that air strikes were  inevitable if no substantial withdrawal of the Serb guns had  taken place by Friday.</p>

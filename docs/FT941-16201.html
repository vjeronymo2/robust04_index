			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: RMC and Wolseley hit highs The building materials sector provided two of the best performers in the FT-SE 100 Index yesterday in Wolseley and RMC, both of which raced up to all-time highs. Wolseley, the builders merchant, took pride of place in the sector, the shares climbing 25, or 2.9 per cent, to a record 895p as the market became increasingly optimistic about the outcome of a visit by UK analysts to the company's French interests, called Brossette, acquired in 1992. Brossette is France's leading plumbing materials supplier and performed exceptionally well last year in spite of the weak French economy, improving both turnover and profits via gains in market share. Analysts also focused on the exceptionally good figures for November released by the Builders Merchants Federation last week. These showed an 11.3 per cent increase in real turnover levels, the 10th consecutive month to show an upturn. And Wolseley shares featured in a basket of call warrants issued by Morgan Stanley involving shares in four UK building companies. Morgan Stanley (Jersey) issued 1m call warrants, with each basket containing 14 Tarmac shares, three Wolseley, 17 Taylor Woodrow and three RMC. RMC shares moved through the symbolic Pounds 10 barrier for the first time, closing 11 higher at 1002p, boosted partly by their involvement in the Morgan Stanley basket, but also by general optimism on interest rates in Europe, particularly in the UK and Germany. Tarmac, however, settled 2 off at 192p, reacting to flurries of profit-taking after its recent strong showing. Taylor Woodrow also came under pressure, closing 5 cheaper at 159p, with one UK broker said to have adopted a cautious stance on the shares.</p>

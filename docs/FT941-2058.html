			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Fed steers course between White House and markets: Michael Prowse examines the background to Alan Greenspan's action to increase the Fed funds rate After keeping financial markets on tenterhooks for several hours yesterday, Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, duly announced the expected tightening of monetary policy. A move by the Fed was seen by markets as almost certain following President Bill Clinton's decision last week to summon Mr Greenspan to the White House for talks on economic policy. Had the Fed not moved after the White House meeting, it would have been accused of bowing to political pressure. Long-term yields, already nearly 7 per cent, might have moved even higher - something that would have upset both the Fed and the Clinton administration. But the quarter point increase in the Federal funds rate to 3.5 per cent signalled by Mr Greenspan was not exactly a decisive move. It was the smallest increase the Fed could have announced. It was not accompanied, as some analysts had hoped, by an increase in the discount rate which remains at 3 per cent. A rise in the latter, say to 3.5 per cent, would have created a bigger splash. In US newspapers, discount rate changes make the front page while quarter point shuffles in the Fed funds rate are buried in the business sections. Mr Greenspan is thus pursuing the same 'softly-softly' approach he adopted when lowering rates during the recession. Yesterday's move followed rather than led market expectations: three month Treasury bill rates, for example, had already risen sharply. But Fed-watchers were intrigued that Mr Greenspan, as in his first tightening move on February 4, followed Bundesbank procedure in formally announcing the increase in rates. In the past, the Fed has left financial markets to work out for themselves whether a change in pressure on reserve positions signals an increase in short-term rates. The new approach seems designed to counter congressional criticism of Fed secrecy. But one side-effect will be to increase greatly the volatility of financial markets on the day when the Fed holds a meeting of its policy-making open market committee. And it will not mollify leading congressional Democrats, such as Mr Henry Gonzales, chairman of the house banking committee, who last week described Fed policy as a 'true abomination'. In financial markets, the immediate reaction to the Fed's announcement yesterday was positive. Share and bond prices rose sharply, reflecting relief that a debilitating period of uncertainty was over. But the relief could prove short-lived. After all, Mr Greenspan signalled in congressional testimony last month that the Fed wanted to raise rates from the abnormally low levels of recent years to a 'neutral' level - one consistent with sustainable non-inflationary growth. Given an underlying inflation rate of 2.5-3 per cent, a neutral level of short-term rates is generally taken to be about 4-5 per cent. Until short-term rates reach this level financial markets are likely to remain jittery, constantly wondering when the next rate increase will be announced. 'It is unlikely that this marks the conclusion of a move to a neutral policy,' said Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, the New York brokerage. In his view, the way to ease bond market jitters is to raise rates rapidly to about 4 per cent. Having moved decisively, the Fed could then afford to sit back and see if it had done enough to convince markets it was serious about controlling inflation. 'This is not enough,' says Mr Mickey Levy, chief economist at NationsBank in New York. He believes further rate increases will be needed in coming months to cool an economy that has acquired 'significant momentum'. Recently revised figures showed the economy grew at an annual rate of 7.5 per cent in real terms in the fourth quarter of last year. And a raft of data in the past few weeks - from car sales to industrial production - suggest that the pace of growth remains robust in the first quarter of this year, despite the adverse impact of severe winter weather. But while a more decisive tightening of monetary policy might be the best way to allay fears in financial markets and thus bring down long bond yields, Mr Greenspan may feel he cannot afford to ignore the views of the Clinton administration which has still to fill two vacant seats on the Fed's seven-member board of governors. The White House has argued repeatedly that inflation pressures are minimal, implying that it sees little rationale for further increases in rates. Yesterday, perhaps trying to make amends for the confusion in markets created by Mr Clinton's ill-timed meeting with Mr Greenspan, the Treasury issued a short statement reiterating its support for Fed independence. 'The administration and the Fed have the same objective: sustainable economic growth and low inflation,' it said. However, administration economic forecasts last month were based on the assumption that short-term interet rates would average 3.4 per cent this year. The tightening of policy announced by Mr Greenspan yesterday means this target rate has already been exceeded. It is thus safe to predict a period of continuing tension between the White House and the Fed, protestations of cordiality notwithstanding.</p>

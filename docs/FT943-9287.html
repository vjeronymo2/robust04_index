			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Energy costs lift producer index The underlying rate of US inflation at the wholesale level remained modest in July, in spite of the producer price index's largest increase in 15 months. The index's 0.5 per cent advance, after no rise at all in June, was almost entirely the result of higher energy and coffee prices, with the core element up only 0.1 per cent. For the year to date, wholesale prices have risen at an annual rate of 2.2 per cent, which constitutes some recent acceleration as the rise over the last 12 months has been only 0.6 per cent. The Commerce Department also reported yesterday a 0.1 per cent decline in retail sales in July, following a revised 0.8 per cent rise in the previous month. The drop was largely attributable to a 1.7 per cent fall in vehicle sales. Although the jump in wholesale prices exceeded most market expectations, Wall Street took the new data in its stride, with the stock market climbing modestly in morning trading. This week's sharp drop in coffee futures removes one large element of the July increase. Greater attention will be paid to the consumer price returns due to be published today, to the industrial production returns out on Monday and to next Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's open market committee, which may well result in the fifth increase in short-term interest rates since February. Merrill Lynch's economic commentary yesterday was representative of market analysis. The latest data, it said, confirmed that the economy was on a path of moderate growth and low inflation and 'should be read as encouraging news for the financial markets and for the Fed'. 'Nevertheless,' it continued, 'we still expect the Fed to tighten monetary policy next week, probably raising the Fed fund rates by 25 basis points to 4.5 per cent.' On the wholesale front, energy prices rose 2.5 per cent in July, led by petrol, up 8 per cent, and heating oil, 6.4 per cent higher. Coffee prices were 42.8 per cent higher as a result of frost damage in Brazil. Overall food prices rose by 0.5 per cent. The Labour Department also reported a small (6,000) weekly increase in the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits. This now stands at a seasonally adjusted 321,000.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 27 Feb (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has  said that Egypt insists on the peace process being conducted in  accordance with the principle of exchanging land for peace. He  added that Egypt intervenes in this process only to defend the  interests of Palestine and other Arab countries because it sees  things from a different perspective than the United States,  Europe, and Israel. The foreign minister said that the day will  come when Egyptian efforts in this area will be brought to light.    In an interview that will appear in tomorrow's edition of  the  weekly magazine ROSE AL-YUSUF, Musa said that peace means the  restoration of land that was lost on 5 June 1967 as well as  Palestinian rights.    The Egyptian foreign minister said that any analysis of the  talks will show that the Palestinian side is the weakest, for  the Palestinians do not have many cards while Israel has the  land, the power, and international assistance. Therefore, it is  necessary for the Egyptians to throw their diplomatic weight on  the Palestinian side to give it the momentum and power to  negotiate.    Musa pointed out that Egypt has intervened on the side of  the  Palestinian delegation on more than 12 occasions. In each of  these cases, the Palestinians would reach a certain point and  then the Egyptians would step in and introduce alternative  ideas, he explained.    Minister Musa said that there are no concessions being made.  If we give Israel part of the land, this is a gain because the  land was completely lost and there was no Palestinian presence  or authority there that could be used to regain it.    The foreign minister said that if we let this opportunity  slip by for five more years it will be lost completely. He  noted that between 1967 and the late President Anwar al-Sadat's  peace initiative in 1977, there were no more than a handful of  settlements [built in the occupied territories] and only a few  hundred settlers. Today, we are dealing with 180 settlements  and upward of 200,000 settlers. If we fail to face this  situation, the number of settlements will rise to 300 and the  number of settlers to 0.5 million. The Jews will become a  majority and we will not be able to get them out, Musa said.    The foreign minister denied that the situation in South  Africa is analogous to that in the occupied territories. There  is a great difference, he said. In South Africa there is a  white minority and a black majority, no land is occupied, and  discrimination is on the basis of skin color. The problem in  Palestine is one of Israeli occupation coupled with thousands of  immigrants pouring in from abroad and the millions that are  being spent on them. The standards of international powers  allow Israel to win land every day, he stated.    Minister Musa said that, had the Palestinians participated  with us in the Camp David accords, we would now be discussing  self-determination. Those who call for deferring the issue to  future generations overlook the erosion of land, political  momentum, and Palestinian presence. The also forget that  Palestinians are living in hell and have no jobs or hospitals,  Musa pointed out.    The foreign minister rhetorically asked if it is not better  for Yasir 'Arafat to return to Jericho; tour the occupied  territories; take control of Nablus and other towns; and open  universities, schools, and hospitals.    In his interview, Musa noted that Egypt has never abandoned  its role in Somalia. He said the first phase of the Somali  problem required the sending of food and humanitarian aid. This  role was undertaken by the rich states and the international aid  organizations, which managed to stop the famine.    Musa noted that the political role of reforming the  situation  in Somalia is a very complicated matter. It is impossible for  one state, no matter how strong, to undertake a drastic action  in Somalia alone.    Musa explained that Egypt could not have intervened alone to  separate the warring factions in Somalia. He noted that the  United States was the only state that was able to implement the  Security Council resolutions. The United States was the only  state that could move a whole army and its ancillary equipment  to Somalia.    Musa said Egypt is calling for four things in Somalia: the  establishment of a government or a transitional administration,  the achievement of national reconciliation, the disarmament of  the Somalia factions, and the reconstruction of Somalia. He  said that Egypt emphasizes that national reconciliation must  include all factions without discrimination. Therefore, it has  invited all factions, including the faction of General Aidid,  because it rejects the principle of electing one person from  among the factions and installing him because soon afterward the  civil war would resume.    Musa stressed that Egypt can help Eritrea and compete with  Israel's role. However, it cannot compel Eritrea not to  cooperate with Israel because this is considered intervention in  its internal affairs. He indicated that it is in Egypt's  interest to help Eritrea, instead of Israel.    Musa called on the Iraqi regime to recognize Kuwait without  preconditions so that the Arab crisis with Iraq can end. He  noted that the crisis lies in the Iraqi regime's insistence that  Kuwait is Iraq's 19th province.    Musa explained that Egypt is against the partition of Iraq.  However, it cannot approve of Iraq's stance on Kuwait or call  for lifting the blockade on Iraq unless it complies with the UN  resolutions. He stressed that Egypt is prepared to do  everything to ease the Iraqi people's suffering. However, Egypt  does not have the last say on this subject. Musa denied that  there are any direct or indirect Egyptian-Iraqi contacts.    On Egypt's stance on Libya, Musa explained that Egypt  respects the UN Security Council resolutions but is against  escalating them out of concern for the Libyan people's interest.  He stressed the need for the trial [of the two suspects in the  Lockerbie incident]. If there is disagreement on the venue of  the trial, the Libyan demand must be taken into consideration  because it is just.    Asked about the fate of Libyan opposition figure Mansur  al-Kikhya, Musa said that contacts with Libya are still  continuing, but we cannot accuse anyone until we have all the  evidence.    Asked about Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's statement  that the regime in Egypt is "shaky and unstable," the foreign  minister affirmed that Egypt has received an official denial of  this statement from Israel. Otherwise, there would have been a  strong Egyptian reaction to it.    Regarding the terrorism issue, Musa said that it should  neither be underestimated nor exaggerated because it is not new  and has existed since the forties. He affirmed that the  terrorist attacks and murders that are taking place will not  affect political, social, economic, and technical progress. The  issue is marginal. There are exaggerations in the foreign media  in depicting the situation in Egypt.    Musa expressed the view that some neighboring countries  support terrorism, but he refused to name these countries.    Asked about Egyptian-Sudanese relations, the foreign  minister  affirmed that despite the differences between Egypt and Sudan  there is an opportunity for dialogue with the brothers because  historic relations must not be allowed to collapse. He  emphasized that Egypt opposes the secession of southern Sudan.  At the same time, it believes that there should be no bloodshed  among the same people because the people of the south are part  of Sudan.    Musa affirmed that Egypt and Iran are large countries in the  same area, and what links them is stronger than what separates  them. The opportunity is available for the establishment of  good relations between Iran and Egypt.    The foreign minister noted that he has good relations with  Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati. He said that  Egypt, as a government, does not want a permanent split with  Iran but the obstacle is the difference in views.    Musa noted that Egypt has often criticized Iranian policy  toward the Gulf states, Iraq, and some African states because it  wanted to draw Iran's attention to the fact that Egypt rejects  any attempt to undermine Arab national security or infringe on  the territories of any Arab state, and the United Arab Emirates  in particular.    Musa said that Egypt has the largest market. The economic  reform program goes hand-in-hand with the peace process. At a  certain point in time we will achieve peace and a favorable  Egyptian economic situation. If other favorable economic  conditions are added, there will be no fear that Israel will  control the situation. It is difficult to imagine that a small  country like Israel can threaten us economically.    He added that the Israeli economy distinguishes itself in  technological services and not in heavy industries, mass  agriculture, or mass consumer production. He said that  investors will go to the state that offers better conditions.  For this reason, we must be able to provide favorable  conditions for investment and economic progress, and this  demands reaching an Arab understanding on this issue.    The foreign minister explained that the Middle Eastern  market  is a slogan. We are talking about a new situation in the Middle  East with new economic, security, and political elements.    Musa affirmed that a Middle Eastern market cannot be  realized  before peace. Otherwise, where will Syria and Palestine stand?  The Middle Eastern market means sitting together and defining  the role of each party. This has not taken place and has not  been raised until now.</p>

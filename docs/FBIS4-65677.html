			<p>BFN     [Text] Magdeburg (DPA) -- Saxony-Anhalt Free Democratic  Party [FDP] chairman Peter Kunert has called upon his party's  representatives to vote for the Johannes Rau, the Social  Democratic Party's [SPD] candidate, in the presidential election  in Berlin on 23 May. In a statement published in Magdeburg on  20 May, he says that it would be a wrong signal to vote for a  conservative like Roman Herzog, the candidate of the Christian  Democratic Union/Christian Social Union.    Kunert does not assume that his own party's candidate,  Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher, will get a majority of the Federal  Convention. He argues that, unlike Herzog, Rau has the  capability of integrating people and building bridges beyond  ideological differences. Kunert says that the social democrat  could be the federal president of all Germans, beyond party  borders.</p>

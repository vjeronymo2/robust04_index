If the IAEA Secretariat,  provoking us, tries to put another pressure upon the DPRK, we  will have no other alternative but to respond to it with a  resolute step."    The spokesman for the General Department of Atomic Energy of  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea served this warning in  a statement today.    Recalling that the DPRK accepted an inspection of the IAEA  necessary for the continuity of safeguards from March 1 to 15,  the spokesman says:    This inspection was aimed exclusively to maintain the  continuity of safeguards, proper for the unique status of the  DPRK characterized by the temporary suspension of its declared  withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty.    Therefore, on the basis of our desire to implement in good  faith both the DPRK-USA agreed conclusions and the DPRK-IAEA  agreement in the whole period of the presence of the inspection  team, we permitted all the inspection activities within the  scope needed for maintaining the continuity of safeguards and  provided the inspection team with our unreserved cooperation for  its work.    Consequently, the agency's inspection team was able to carry  out satisfactorily all the activities in the DPRK's nuclear  facilities as specified in the Vienna agreement of February 15,  including the reloading and servicing of containment and  surveillance devices, the verification of the physical  inventories, the examination of a number of records and  documents, verification of the design information, samplings and  measurements.    While the inspection was proceeding, however, the agency  Secretariat and the inspection team unilaterally claimed that  their inspection was a safeguards agreement-bound inspection,  not an inspection necessary for providing the continuity of  safeguards and pressed their inordinate demands that would make  their inspection equivalent to routine and ad hoc inspections, a  wanton violation of what was agreed in the Vienna agreement of  February 15.    The agency Secretariat gave the inspection team instructions  inconsistent with the Vienna agreement and made the inaccurate  report from the inspection team a fait accompli, taking it at  its face value, and insisted on unreasonable demands for  samplings from locations where seals as the means of containment  remain unbroken, gamma mapping at most of the points, instead of  a few selected points, and even verification of the cooling  systems, which the Vienna consultations had never dealt with.    In addition, the agency Secretariat went the length of  threatening us with its telex messages addressed to us three  times, saying that it "will have to report to the board of  governors that the agency is not in a position to verify  non-diversion of nuclear material," unless its demands are met.    On the other hand, the inspection team members during their  stay in our country found themselves helpless when the operators  gave them logically reasonable explanations with regard to the  requested samplings from locations where seals remain unbroken,  and excused themselves for their demands, saying "it cannot be  helped because this is the task from the agency Secretariat."  Moreover, even after they confirmed firsthand the maintenance of  the original seals they placed last August, they illogically  made out their case, saying that "we cannot believe the  integrity of the one-year-old seals."    The unjust demands of the agency Secretariat including  request for sampling from the input accountability tank  contained by the agency's seals have no relevance at all to the  aim and character of the recent inspection designed to verify  the absence of nuclear activities, and constitute a flagrant  violation of the Vienna agreement of February 15.    During its inspection we have shown flexibility as an  expression of our good will by agreeing to the impertinent  demands from the IAEA Secretariat, including samplings at some  locations where containment devices remain intact, and the gamma  mapping at all the necessary points.    Therefore, the recent inspection activities performed by the  IAEA inspection team are sufficient to enable the agency to  fully verify non-diversion of nuclear material at our nuclear  facilities and definitely ensure the continuity of safeguards as  well.    In fact, the receiving stage and major processes at the  radiochemical laboratory remain controlled by dozens of IAEA  seals, surveillance cameras and IAEA's tracer chemicals, so  that the facility is a placed under the agency's double and  triple containment control.    Notwithstanding this fact, before the analysis of the  inspection results was available, the IAEA Secretariat announced  its unjust conclusion that "although many of the agreed  inspection measures were carried out as envisaged, some other  activities were restricted at the radiochemical laboratory," and  that "the agency was not in a position to verify that there had  been no diversion of nuclear material, at the facility." And the  Secretariat is making a dustup by scheduling a meeting of the  IAEA Board of Governors on this matter.    This is an utterly unjustifiable action of openly revoking  the DPRK-USA agreed conclusions and the DPRK-IAEA agreement with  respect to the continuity of safeguards, and there can be no  justification for this action in any case.    All the facts demonstrate that the agency Secretariat has  been further widening its partiality and still continues  pursuing its ill-disposed political purposes under the United  States' manipulation in an attempt to strangle the DPRK.    If the IAEA Secretariat sincerely wants a fair resolution of  our "nuclear issue," it must rescind the unreasonable assessment  it had rushed to with regard to the result of the recent  inspection.</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Government Ethics Row: Blair gives Major blueprint for raising standards Mr Tony Blair yesterday set out Labour's proposals for raising standards in public life as he warned Mr John Major that his government was becoming tainted by allegations of sleaze. Speaking at prime minister's question time, the Labour leader put forward a three-point plan to restore 'the confidence of the British people in their government'. His move came as it emerged that a future Labour government would probably force companies to ballot shareholders before making political donations. Mr Blair's proposals were: No minister who has privatised a company should subsequently be allowed to sit on its board. A list of all members of quangos, payments, perks and any position with any political party should be published by the government; The 'cash-for-questions' inquiry should be broadened, 'held in public and be made fully independent'. Mr Blair said he noted the resignation of Mr Tim Smith as Northern Ireland minister and awaited the outcome of investigations into Mr Neil Hamilton. Earlier Mr John Prescott, Labour's deputy leader, said that the party's general election manifesto would 'be giving serious attention' to the question of balloting shareholders on the issue of political donations. Referring to an 'imbalance' in the treatment of political donations from companies and trade unions, Mr Prescott said it was not a situation that Labour was 'prepared to allow to continue'. Meanwhile Labour stepped up its attack on the government over sleaze by launching a study of links between appointees to quangos and the Conservative party. The party said the study showed 'in graphic detail' how government appointees to quangos were 'inextricably linked' to the financing of the Conservative party. Mr George Howarth, MP for Knowsley North who wrote the study, said: 'What is truly scandalous is that none of these relationships or placements is actually illegal.' Labour called for those serving on quangos to be subject to the same financial liability as local councillors and for the supervisory role of select committees to be strength-ened. Arguing that parliamentary scrutiny was no longer enough, Mr Prescott called for Mr John Major, the prime minister, to set up an independent assessment of standards of government and public life. The House of Commons' most influential select committee is set to investigate a controversial decision to give the vice-chancellor of Huddersfield University a severance payment of more than Pounds 400,000. The public accounts committee has received the green light to investigate the severance payment recently promised to Professor Kenneth Durrands. The inquiry by the committee will follow one to be carried out by the National Audit Office, the government spending watchdog. The NAO yesterday announced that it will carry out a preliminary investigation into the broader context of the decision to make the payment.</p>

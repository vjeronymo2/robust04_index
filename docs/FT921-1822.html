			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / An asset on the box Mr Paddy Ashdown, in his dashes this week across the UK, has tried to set a distinct agenda for the Liberal Democrats. But he has yet to generate a sense that third-party politics has regained momentum. He has been the most accessible of the party leaders, with less to lose from the unscripted remark and the most to gain from a confrontation that sparks publicity - such as yesterday's with Militant extremists, amid the municipal drabness of council flats in Liverpool. Party managers have restricted doorstep interviews by journalists, but Mr Ashdown has not refused to answer questions from voters - sometimes against his aides' advice. His first rally, at a Birmingham school on Thursday, was to an open rather than invited audience. Afterwards he admitted to wishing for a heckler or two. Liberal Democrats claimed early successes in raising the issues of a televised leaders' debate and constitutional reform. However, perhaps because of his tactics, Mr Ashdown's topics have been overshadowed in the media by those chosen by Mr Kinnock, Mr Major and news editors. He has adapted his programme to respond to the issue of the day. Yesterday, for example, he linked his reaction to the inflation figures with the subject of housing by citing appalling inner-city accommodation as the cost of the government's struggle against price increases. But his main theme has often been left on the floor of the television cutting room. Mr Ashdown has set the pace for leadership tours, with a frenetic schedule that will take him to every part of Great Britain, and to some areas more than once. As the party's most televisual asset, he has rarely stayed in one place for more than an hour. His campaign style has combined characteristics of the two main leaders. Like Mr Kinnock he has been at ease with the multitude, talking with furrowed brow to the unemployed or elderly, or racing through shopping precincts, hands held high, proclaiming: 'Good day, my friend.' Like Mr Major he has sometimes preferred more intimate sessions, gathering groups of businessmen or local activists and engaging in a brief seminar on, for example, the uniform business rate. Party strategists are content that the Liberal Democrats have not dipped in the opinion polls and may have advanced a point or two. But so far it seems unlikely that there will be much increase in the party's 22 MPs.</p>

			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Power deals offer lifeline: Contracts worth Pounds 5.5bn to British Coal pave way to talks on pits THE ELECTRICITY and coal industries yesterday cleared the way for negotiations aimed at saving threatened pits when they started signing contracts worth Pounds 5.5bn over five years to British Coal. The deals, concluded after nearly a year of intense negotiations just three days before existing three-year contracts expire, will secure a long-term future for the 19 pits which British Coal regards as its best. However, the future of a further 19 which will either stay open or be mothballed following last week's white paper will be determined by talks likely to begin within the next few weeks between British Coal and the generators. The 'core contracts' commit the generators to buying 160m tonnes of coal over five years, and the regional companies to buying the electricity generated from that. The signings started yesterday afternoon and were expected to be concluded either late last night or this morning. Announcements were expected to be made to the Stock Exchange this morning. Only one of the 12 regional companies did not participate yesterday - Eastern Electric signed deals with the generators for coal-fired electricity earlier this year. Yesterday's signings were concluded in a flurry of activity with the executives of some companies being driven around London to perform their roles in locations including offices, hotels and solicitors' offices. Legal advisers had been up until 5am on Sunday sorting out the fine print. 'It was like the final stages of buying a house,' said one regional electricity company executive. An executive of one of the generators said that although most of the contracts included confidentiality clauses, most regional companies had been comparing notes and this had resulted in last-minute requests for changes. The contracts have been expected on numerous occasions since last autumn, but new problems constantly arose whenever deals looked close. The government last week blamed the delays for the failure of the generators and British Coal to agree contracts for additional tonnages which will save the 12 reprieved pits. The negotiations on the additional tonnages are likely to be similarly fraught. Outstanding issues include the level of subsidy the government pays to enable British Coal to offer its output at world prices. The duration of the subsidies will also be crucial. Although the generators had previously indicated that they will be able to take up to 40m tonnes over five years, that was based on the assumption that subsidies would last five years and not the two to three years the government now intends before privatisation of British Coal goes ahead.</p>

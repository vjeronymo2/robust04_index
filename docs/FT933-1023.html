			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Small team, broad themes - Philip Coggan finds long-term thinking and a record to match / Unit trusts/St James Place THE investment team of St James Place unit trust group consists of three men  -Nils Taube, John Hodson and Cato Stonex - working from a tiny office in an elegant Palladian building in the West End. Sitting at desks, strategically placed within prospectus-throwing distance of each other, the three men spend the day swapping ideas and looking for investment themes, from which they hope their funds can profit. As well as the St James's Place range of unit trusts, the trio runs pension and life funds for J Rothschild Assurance, the life assurance company recently established by Sir Mark Weinberg and Lord Rothschild. Nils Taube is definitely the guiding spirit of the team. He has been a director of George Soros's Quantum fund for 15 years, and has been linked with Lord Rothschild since 1982. He has been managing the St James's Place International fund (which has had various names) since 1971. Taube's long-term record commands respect. The International trust ranked first out of 43 funds in the international equity growth sector over the 10 years to September 1, with growth of 459.4 per cent (offer-to-bid with income reinvested: source Micropal). It also achieved first quartile performance over the one, three and five year periods, with growth of 62.6, 62.7 and 99 per cent respectively. The trust follows a stock-picking style and he says the geographical allocation of assets stems from stock selection, rather than the other way round. The current split of funds under management is (all figures percentages) UK (16.9 per cent), US (22.5), Canada (3.8), Australia (2.4), South Africa (0.2), France (0.9), Germany (9.7). Sweden (1.1), Switzerland (4), Italy (14.4), Czechoslovakia (1.1), Japan (12.6) and Argentina (1.6). The remainder of the trust, just under 9 per cent, is invested in cash and bonds. Taube adds that he sees currency and stock selections as entirely separate. 'Probably what makes us different from the others,' he says, 'is that we are not in the least bit afraid of hedging currency risk if we want to. Although only 16 per cent of our assets are in UK equities, 46 per cent are in sterling.' The investment team looks for undervalued stocks round the world and is willing to be a long term holder. One stock, the US-based Pep Boys Manny Moe &amp; Jack, has been in the fund since launch - its original cost was Pounds 32,000, while its current value is over Pounds 1.5m. It is better still if a stock can be both cheap and fit into one of the team's themes of the moment. Like some other fund managers profiled in this series, St James's Place is enthusiastic about the prospects for the Italian telecommunications groups, SIP/STET, which at the end of January made up 6.44 per cent of the assets of the trust. The enthusiasm for SIP/STET, although based on the shares' cheapness relative to cashflow, fits into the theme of communications, which Taube believes will be the growth sector of the decade. Other stocks in the portfolio which fit the communications theme include News Corporation, Security Services (which owns a stake in the Cellnet mobile phone system), the Mirror Group and Nextel, a US telecommunications group. Another portfolio theme is insurance. The company owns stakes in Royal and Sun Alliance in the UK, TIG Holdings in the US, Munich Re in Germany, Alleanza in Italy, Swiss Re in Switzerland and, in Japan, stocks such as Mitsui Marine and Sumitomo Marine. 'I like the reinsurance companies because there has been a shakeout of capacity and premiums are rising,' says Taube, 'whereas we like Alleanza because the Italians are behind other countries in their use of life insurance.' Cross-border plagiarism is another general theme of Taube's. A development in one market, such as the US, will often be copied in other markets. An example was the way in which supermarkets spread from the US to the UK in the 1950s. The International fund remains relatively small, with Pounds 67m under management, although the link to J Rothschild Assurance may build up the fund over time. The group has two other funds in the international equity sector, growth (5th over one year, 30th over three years) and North American and International (43rd over one year, but 5th over the 10 year period). The three funds tend to own similar stocks, although with different emphases. Taube says that the growth fund has done better than the International fund over the past year because it had a large stake in SIP/STET. Charges. The initial charge is 5 per cent and the annual charge is 1.5 per cent. The bid-offer spread is around 5.5 per cent. The minimum initial investment is Pounds 1,500. There is no savings scheme attached to the trust. Both income and accumulation units are available, although the fund is manageds for capital growth, so the yield is very small - less than 0.1 per cent.</p>

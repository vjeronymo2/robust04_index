			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Deidesheim (DPA) -- On Thursday [12 May] at  noon, Chancellor Helmut Kohl (Christian Democratic Union) and  Russian President Boris Yeltsin arrived for a private visit to  the chancellor's Palatinate homeland. In the wine town of  Deidesheim, they were welcomed by a cheering crowd. When the  last Russian soldier withdraws from Germany on 31 August, real  reconciliation between Russia and Germany will be initiated,  said Yeltsin, who entered his name together with Kohl in the  Golden Book of the town of Deidesheim.

			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> GTE, Home Shopping Settle Suit: GTE Corp. accepted an undisclosed sum in cash  to settle its 2-year-long legal battle with Home Shopping Network Inc. The GTE  Florida and GTE Communications units won the libel and slander award in August,  after a circuit court jury in Florida rejected a $1.5-billion lawsuit in which  Home Shopping accused GTE of supplying inadequate telephone equipment and  service. The two companies agreed to end all litigation and claims against each  other. While the amount of the settlement was not disclosed, company officials  did say it was negligible in comparison to the $100-million jury award.  </P></p>

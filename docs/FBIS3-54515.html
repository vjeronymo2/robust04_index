			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Rabeh Kebir, official spokesman of the </F> Algerian Islamic Salvation Front [FIS], by Qusayy Salih  al-Darwish in Cologne on 24 January]    [Excerpts] [Al-Darwish] How do you assess the current  situation in Algeria?    [Kebir] The situation in Algeria today is really tragic  because, as everyone knows, the Algerian people had elected  their representatives and chosen their political program with  complete freedom, the people agreed on their chosen  representatives and moved toward forming a government to their  liking after three years of paralysis, but regrettably a group  of army commanders, generals, took an unsound course and  repressed the people. [passage omitted]    [Al-Darwish] What about the contacts made by the government  with the FIS leaders?    [Kebir] The contacts made with the FIS leaders here and  there, such as the contact we heard was made with Shaykh Abbasi  Madani and other shaykhs, were, we have been informed,  conditional. As if one would say I choose the people I want to  talk to and on my own terms, and if they accept my terms and  agree to do a number of things then I would hold a dialogue,  etcetera. This attitude, of course, shows the regime's lack of  seriousness. It also shows that the aim of bringing the parties  together is to gain some credibility, strike at the people's  resistance, and portray the newborn body that will succeed the  Higher State Council as an acceptable one born out of  reconciliation, and so on. The result of these unserious  contacts is certainly rejection because the FIS leadership,  whether at home or abroad, cannot accept such a thing and would  not lend credibility to those people just because they held  contacts and made attempts which clearly have the objective of  maintaining the same domineering power.    [Al-Darwish] It has recently been reported that the FIS  leaders have selected four of them to meet with the Dialogue  Committee, hear its offers, and convey the FIS' views. Can you  confirm or deny these reports?    [Kebir] As far as we are concerned these reports are not  true and have not been confirmed. I believe that you have read  Shaykh Ali Balhadj's message to the Dialogue Committee.    [Al-Darwish] But that was an old message which he wrote last  November when he was in Tizi Ouzou prison.    [Kebir] That is true but it covered matters of principle.  One cannot play games with such issues as the national dialogue  or change his mind so easily. At any rate, so long as we hear  nothing on that from our own sources, the report is untrue until  the opposite is proven. What I can confirm is that the FIS  leaders would never forfeit the Algerian people's rights.    [Al-Darwish] Is there any possibility of the FIS  participating in the national conference directly or indirectly  when it convenes tomorrow (Tuesday 25 Jan)?    [Kebir] I believe the FIS is not concerned with the  conference in any way. I believe that such a dialogue on the  regime's terms is a waste of time. [passage omitted]    [Al-Darwish] Even if the dialogue is not as serious as you  would like it to be, it has actually materialized on the ground  and in the minds of the politicians. Most parties demand it as  the only way out of the crisis, not to mention that many within  the regime have adopted the idea. But you, and you personally  in particular, have set extremely difficult conditions for  dialogue with the regime. Do you believe that such  intransigence will help end the Algerian crisis?    [Kebir] As far as I am concerned, the conditions were  logical and were required legally and reasonably. It is not just  a question of of the extraordinary courts set up illegally and  unconstitionally nor a question of the creation of  unconstitutional bodies. It has gone beyond that to mass murder  without trial. For instance, over the past weeks in eastern  Algeria, prisoners were taken handcuffed out of prison in trucks  to a jungle near the town of el-Kelaa and, with people looking  on, they were killed. This incident is known even to the  national press. Such actions and their timing reflect the real  views and ideas of the authorities. I cannot sit around the  same table with those who kill the people. I say it frankly,  they must be brought to justice with all the guarantees of  justice.    [Al-Darwish] But that means that you are not setting  coniditions but rejecting dialogue altogether. With whom is the  dialogue to be held? With those currently in authority,  naturally. If you are requesting dismissal and trial as a  precondition, it means that you completely reject the principle  of dialogue with the authorities?    [Kebir] No, that is not the case. We are not saying that  everyone in authority has committed such criminal acts. Those  who did commit and order these acts are known. They are a group  of generals not exceeding a handful. They are the ones who  should be brought to justice.    [Al-Darwish] You are talking as if you assume that there is  an authority in Algeria other than the military authority and  that it can bring the military command to trial. You know that  everyone sees the current conflict in Algeria as a conflict  between two powers: the Army and the FIS. When we talk about a  dialogue to resolve Algeria's current crisis resulting from that  conflict, we are in fact talking about a dialogue between the  FIS and Army leaders.    [Kebir] I say that the Army should get rid of some criminal  commanders and choose for itself some good men.    [Al-Darwish] Permit me to say once more that what you are  saying means that you actually reject dialogue with the current  authorities.    [Kebir] We reject dialogue with those who committed crimes  against the people.    [Al-Darwish] So, according to you, the resolution of  Algeria's current dangerous situation depends on the outcome of  the armed confrontation?    [Kebir] The armed confrontation is not an end in itself. It  has come to rid the country of the injustice that has occurred.    [Al-Darwish] But do you believe that the armed clash with  the regime launched by the Islamic armed movement or other  Islamic organizations can really bring the regime down?    [Kebir] I do not believe that military action can quickly  and decisively settle the issue in favor of one side or the  other, but resistance against injustice will unltimately lead to  change within the existing ruling authority itself. [passage  omitted]    [Al-Darwish] There are clear differences in the tones,  arguments, and positions of the members of the Executive  Committee abroad. I remind you, for instance, of the difference  between your statement and Sahraoui's statement on the  assassination of foreigners in Algeria.    [Kebir] When I talk I do so as FIS official spokesman and as  the official in charge of the Executive Committee abroad. When  others speak they give their own views and analysis. There is  nothing wrong with having differences of opinion in one way or  another within the context of general FIS policy.    [Al-Darwish] Did you form the Executive Committee abroad on  your own initiative, the five of you, or on the basis of a  decision by the FIS leadership at home?    [Kebir] It was a decision by the FIS, all of it.    [Al-Darwish] Are you really in contact with a legitimate  organized leadership at home, one that meets and decides  everything?    [Kebir] Certainly, there is coordination between the FIS  leaderships at home and abroad. That coordination may increase  or decrease according to circumstances but it is always there.  [passage omitted]    [Al-Darwish] At various stages since its foundation, the FIS  has assumed that the Algerian Army would not contribute to the  confrontation with it and that it would be divided within itself  if it did join in that confrontation, but the Algerian Army is  still noticeably the regime's only cohesive institution.    [Kebir] I believe that the forces used by the regime now  do not really represent the Algerian Army in its popular  dimension as we know it. They use specially brainwashed forces.  I believe that some time is required before we can see the real  results. If the Army continues to be used widely and  extensively, we will see the results later on. There have been  some results already. How many Army personnel have deserted and  joined the mujahidin?    [Al-Darwish] Do you have a numerical estimate of the Army  deserters?    [Kebir] It is difficult to give estimates but it is now  widespread in all sectors of the country. [passage omitted]    [Al-Darwish] Many observers do not understand your silent  appeasement of the "Armed Islamic Groups" which have been  fiercely attacking you and the FIS in their statements.    [Kebir] Regarding the statements issued by some criticizing  the FIS, its program, or its men, it is impossible to verify or  authenticate them because they are not signed by a known person.  Who issues these statements? Who is he and what does he  represent? So the possibility remains that the security  authorities might be behind them. What we know is that the  official leaderships of these groups inside Algeria do not adopt  such positions. [passage omitted]    [Al-Darwish] The Western media insists that the FIS has  links with some Islamic states or receives various aid from  them. The names of Iran, Sudan, Pakistan, and Afghanistan were  mentioned. What aid and facilities does the FIS get from these  states?    [Kebir] That claim is unfounded. We have said so  frequently. It is as if those making such claims want to cast  doubt on the Algerian people's support for the FIS. By God, I  believe that a cause upheld by the people does not need aid from  other states. [passage omitted]    [Al-Darwish] If the FIS' historical leaders, who are in  prison, agreed on a dialogue with the regime, do you believe  that they would be able to impose the idea of a dialogue and its  possible consequences on the armed movements and on the FIS'  current secret leadership structures?    [Kebir] What is certain is that the historical leadership of  the FIS consisting of Shaykh Abbasi Madani and Shaykh Ali  Balhadj is the real leadership of the FIS and is considered so  by all of the FIS's groups and frameworks. The positions they  take, therefore, are respected but that leadership knows that  the sacrifices it made were made in rejection of injustice. I  therefore believe that its position would be in line with the  aspirations of the Algerian people.    [Al-Darwish] In other words, it would not accept the  dialogue idea?    [Kebir] It cannot possibly accept a dialogue that would mean  forfeiting the Algerian people's rights and overlooking the  blood that has been spilled    [Al-Darwish] What do you think of the appointment of  Abdelaziz Boutaflika as head of state?    [Kebir] Has he been appointed?    [Al-Darwish] It has been reported that he is on his way to  being appointed.    [Kebir] As I have already said, the country's crisis was  caused in particular by a group of generals. When the necessary  conditions securing the Algerian people and their rights  prevail, then we will be able to express an opinion.    [Al-Darwish] What is your personal opinion of and position  regarding Boutaflika?    [Kebir] The problem in Algeria is now more than just a  problem of individuals. Furthermore, what would the appointment  of one individual mean if based on unsound foundations?</p>

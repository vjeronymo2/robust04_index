			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Martino by </F> Mario Tedeschini Lalli in Rome; date not given: "Immigrants Are  Welcome, They Make Italy Wealthier"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- [passage omitted] [Lalli] Mr. Minister,  you have stated that the EU's [European Union] decision [on  tightening immigration regulations] was "an egoistic choice from  an ethical viewpoint, and a mistaken one from an economic  viewpoint." Within the majority, opinions differ from your  own....    [Martino] I said what I believed. I have been saying what I  believe for the past 51 years, and I am not going to change now.    [Lalli] Your position seems closer to the Left than to the  opinions that a member of the present government would be  expected to hold.    [Martino] Well, you know...(Martino smiled -- LA REPUBBLICA  editor's note) this sort of thing happens when you think with  your own head. You may then find yourself closer to others than  to your own natural friends.    [Lalli] However, what are the grounds for this, so to speak,  "extreme liberalist" position?    [Martino] To begin with, let us draw a difference in our  minds between two very different issues. When I speak of  immigration, I am referring to the opportunity for people to  find work in other countries than the one where they were born.  This issue must not be confused with that of foreigners who  come here without a job, as tramps, or who carry out activities  which are possibly illegal. This is not the problem we are  referring to. This is a law-and-order problem which concerns  foreigners, and Italians too. I believe that, if we manage to  keep the two issues distinct -- the law-and-order problem  concerning vagrancy, and the other problem -- as regards  immigration, we can follow a less egoistic policy than the one  suggested by the EU.    [Lalli] Why is this?    [Martino] First, for an ideal reason. I believe that if you  believe in freedom, this must include the freedom to move. The  fact that I may wish to live in another country forms part of my  freedom to move. Secondly, on economic grounds. Migration has  been a major factor in the production of wealth. Milton  Friedman (the ultraliberal economist who led the "Chicago  school" -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note) said: "Every immigrant  brings along a mouth to feed, but also two arms." That is to  say, he contributes more to production than to consumption.  Today, speaking at a Senate commission meeting, I again  recalled the fact that, in 1870, Australia was an empty  continent with the highest per capita income in the world. The  United States was also an empty continent. From 1870 to 1926  the United States followed an open door policy, whereas  Australia followed a selective immigration policy. Australia  remained an empty continent, whereas the United States become a  world power. In short, immigration is a factor contributing to  a country's wealth. The greatest resource consists of men and  their skills. Immigrants -- when they have a regular job, and  so on -- make the country wealthier, contribute to its wealth.    [Lalli] What is your reply to your allies in government who  are saying that, on the contrary, immigrants steal jobs from  Italians?    [Martino] I reply that all the available sociological  investigations show that these two groups of workers look for  jobs in completely different markets, there is no competition  between foreign workers and Italian workers. The typical  immigrant's profile is that of a worker with few formal  qualifications, whereas the typical unemployed person is highly  qualified.    [Lalli] What should the Italian Government be doing to  tackle  this problem?    [Martino] I believe that the Martelli law [on immigration]  must be reviewed, that a distinction must be drawn between  illegal immigrants entering the country without a job (and  sometimes giving rise to problems which people rightly deplore),  and immigrants coming here to work, and I believe that  foreigners who wish and manage to get a job in Italy ought to be  allowed in.    [Lalli] Even though this may involve according them a  different treatment as regards social security benefits?    [Martino] You see, the problem is the following: If we  establish the same type of treatment for these workers, we will  in fact be preventing many of them from finding work in Italy.</p>

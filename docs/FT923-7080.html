			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Economic Viewpoint: The benefits of lower house prices Is there a contradiction in calling for lower inflation and a rise in UK house prices? Of course, there is. Asset prices, whether of commodities, houses or shares, are more volatile than the general rate of inflation. When inflation merely slows down, asset prices fall. When inflation rises slightly, asset prices rise by leaps and bounds, although there is no neat synchronisation. Just as most of the more sensible documents related to popular equity ownership contain a warning that share prices can go down as well as up, there should be a similar notice in every house agent's window. If we are serious in wanting stable prices, then we can hardly want a revival in house prices at so early a stage in the economic cycle: and schemes which attempt to bring this about are misconceived. House prices are on average some 10 to 20 per cent below their 1989 peaks, depending on the index used. But the regional variations have been large. According to Nationwide, the price to a first-time buyer in East Anglia is now a third below its 1989 peak. Any forthcoming economic package should be limited in intention to trying to discourage further falls and not to restarting the disastrous housing escalator. It is time to consider the benefits of lower house prices. In his article in the Weekend FT of August 8, John Authers mentioned that the initial annual mortgage payment, expressed as a percentage of average earnings, had fallen by a third for a first-time buyer from its 1989 peak. This is a great gain. Such couples are nevertheless still reluctant to buy, partly because of the general lack of confidence, but also because they are holding out for further price falls. The worst way to try to overcome this hesitation would be by an inflationary boost to the housing market. A rising trend of house prices would make it more expensive for future newly formed households to acquire accommodation, and thus impede the mobility of labour which ought to be one aim of housing policy. Another bonus from lower house prices has been the long-delayed revival of the rented sector. There have been numerous cases where letting has recently seemed a better proposition than leaving properties empty or selling them at a knockdown price. A sitting tenant is no longer always the drag on house values he or she used to be. The combination of rent decontrol on new tenancies and the house-price slump has given the rentals market the biggest kick start it has had for decades. Rented accommodation is inherently more convenient for many people, including the young and professionally mobile, than the commitments of home ownership. Such people were deterred from renting both by the lack of suitable properties, following decades of rent control, and by the belief that they would be fools to miss out on an investment which was sure to beat inflation by a comfortable margin. It will be a great gain from recent developments if people now regard houses as places to live rather than as guaranteed double-your-money investments, and allow the choice between buying and renting to be dictated by circumstances. People will no longer feel an economic imperative to 'trade up', and will decorate their homes to suit themselves rather than the estate agent. An even bigger social gain will be the end of houses as a topic of dinner table conversation. (If we could banish schools as well, we would really be getting somewhere.) Last but by no means least in the litany of benefits has been the puncturing of the price of urban land. At the end of the last decade, land constituted nearly 45 per cent of the price of a new dwelling in the south-east and East Anglia. This was a diversion of the national income from both capital and labour to the providers of space, for whom it was just a windfall gain. And one did not have to be an egalitarian to dislike the distributional effects which diverted an increasing proportion of the national income both to the owners of landed estates and the pension funds. In Greater London the average price of a hectare of land shot up from Pounds 390,000 in 1981 to Pounds 3.096m in 1989. By the first half of 1990 it was down again to Pounds 2.078m. There will be few tears about any further drops. The main focus of attention in recent discussion has, however, not been today's buyer, but the plight of those who bought homes in the boom of the late-1980s, whose dwellings are now worth less than the outstanding value of their mortgages. The Bank of England has estimated that there are nearly a million of these householders, with a total negative equity of Pounds 6bn, three-fifths of whom are to be found in the south-east. But it would be no more reasonable to restart inflation for their sakes than it would be to restart it for the benefit of property developers and their banking backers who are having difficulty in maintaining their policy of upwards-only rent revisions. There is an analogy with the victims of commodity price fluctuations. The latest thinking is to avoid rigging prices and instead to extend direct credits to the victims. Indeed, a special compensatory finance facility of the International Monetary Fund exists for this purpose. The aim is to cushion the well-being and spending power of the victims without impeding necessary price changes. A similar approach should be applied to homeowners in difficulties. An example of the right sort of relief would be to raise the Pounds 10,000 limit on building societies' unsecured lending, so that they can lend to homeowners who are good credit risks, but have been caught out by recent developments in the property market. An increase in total mortgage interest relief should be avoided like the plague, but the existing concession could be rearranged to make more available in the early years. It is important not just to avoid panic attempts at house-price boosting now, but to break the boom and bust cycle in the longer term. It is the boom that causes the bust as well as troubles of its own. There is no law of the Medes and Persians that house prices must in the long run rise at least as fast as earnings and twice as fast as the retail price index. This apparent trend was due to the rapid growth in households, 'Nimby' planning restrictions, rent controls and fiscal privilege for home ownership. The Nimby restrictions remain, but many of the other influences are declining. The restriction of mortgage interest relief to the basic rate will reduce fiscal privilege. So will the council tax due to start next year, which will re-establish in small measure some taxation of the benefit in kind from home ownership. Obviously the early 1990s have not proved the ideal time for either reform. But neither could be made while Mrs Thatcher was prime minister, with her misidentification of home ownership with economic virtue. If we wait for the ideal time no reform will ever be made. The task should be not to lose the benefits of the housing shake-out, but to convert them into long-term structural gain which will remain when recovery comes.</p>

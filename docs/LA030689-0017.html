			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'BAD SCENE IN SOUTH TEXAS'  </P> <P> Helton's polemic against the INS typifies blatant bias parading as reason. He  would substitute for the "low-level functionaries" of the INS (an agency guilty  of having a "law enforcement mentality) some low-level functionaries of the  Justice Department. Is it because he thinks the difference lies in the fact  that the Justice Department does not have a "law enforcement mentality"? Or is  it perhaps the fact that the low-level functionaries of the Justice Department  might be more inclined toward his political biases than are those of the INS?  </P> <P> JACK ISKEN  </P> <P> Encino  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, April 29 (AFP) -- About 25,000 villagers  have fled heavy fighting between government troops and the Khmer  Rouge along National Route 10 in northwest Cambodia, aid  officials said Friday.    The residents of villages along the road joining the  guerrillas' Pailin headquarters to Cambodia's second city of  Battambang, fled along with retreating government soldiers as  Khmer Rouge rebels advanced.    The rebels backed-up by three tanks, overran a strategic  government military base at Treng, around 40 kilometers (25  miles) west of Battambang early Thursday, a humanitarian relief  official said.    It was the first time since 1989 that civilians in the area  have been displaced on such a large scale by fighting, the  official said.    A government official said government troops destroyed a  Khmer Rouge tank, before retreating 10 kilometers (six miles) to  Sdao. Khmer Rouge radio, however, said Friday that the  guerrillas had seized a government tank.    The government troops then regrouped and counter-attacked,  forcing the guerrillas back out of Treng late Thursday, the  official said, adding: "But the situation is still quite  serious there."    A Police officer told AFP by phone from Battambang that the  government troops were back in Treng, but were facing hit and  run attacks from the Khmer Rouge.    A curfew from 8 PM to 5 AM has been imposed in Battambang  city for fear of guerrilla sabotage, the officer said.    Treng was the government forces' frontline position before  they launched their offensive on Pailin, advancing some 40  kilometers (25 miles) and capturing the Khmer Rouge's  resource-rich "capital" on March 19.    Government commanders vowed to hold Pailin "forever" but  lost  the town to a guerrilla counter-attack on April 19.    Explaining the battlefield set-backs, one government officer  said the rank and file troops were demoralised and disillusioned  with corrupt leaders and felt they had little incentive to risk  their lives.    The soldiers said they were promised a share of the spoils  from capturing the gem and timber rich Pailin region which  bankrolled the guerrilla organisation, he said.    In the end, however, most foot soldiers got nothing, with  some even complaining that they did not receive their meagre  salaries, while certain superiors laid claim to all valuables,  he said.    Further north in Banteay Meanchey Province, the government  troops were holding their ground near the normally bustling  border town of Poipet, a government official said.    Heavy fighting has taken place around Poipet over the past  three days as Khmer Rouge guerrillas tried to capture the town,  which lies on the Thai-Cambodian border.    "But we still hold Poipet. We are still there," the  government official said.    Khmer Rouge radio said six government soldiers were killed  and 10 wounded, when guerrillas attacked and seized a former  royalist stronghold at Rumchang and three nearby villages, in  the Ampil district of Banteay Meanchey Province Thursday.    The Khmer Rouge's clandestine radio added that the  guerrillas  had destroyed two munitions depots.    An official from the Ministry of Defence, however, admitted  the guerrillas had attacked Rumchang and the nearby villages,  but dismissed their claim to have captured it.    "The Khmer Rouge have already withdrawn," he said adding:  "They still use the same hit and run tactics, so we did not  lose Rumchang.</p>

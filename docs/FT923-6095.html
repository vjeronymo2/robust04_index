			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / US may down Iraqi warplanes on sight IRAQI warplanes which defy a proposed 'no-fly zone' in southern Iraq will probably be shot down on sight without warning, a US admiral said in the Gulf yesterday, Reuter reports. 'I would guess that if the scenario plays out the way it is envisaged now they would be given an adequate warning by diplomatic notice not to fly in that particular area,' Rear Admiral Brent Bennitt told reporters on the aircraft carrier USS Independence. 'To me that would be sufficient warning. . .I wouldn't anticipate any warning shots,' he said.</p>

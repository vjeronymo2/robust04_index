			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Mandela faces dilemma over labour unrest South Africa's new all-race government of national unity is struggling to cope with a week-long wave of labour unrest, and there are fears that new strikes may break out, damaging international investor confidence. The current spate of industrial action has been sparked by a 10-day-long strike by 15,000 workers at food retailer Pick 'n Pay. Over the past few days a number of smaller wildcat strikes in the private and public sector have also broken out. The newly aggressive attitude among workers is being fuelled by raised expectations resulting from the economy's return to growth after a four-year recession, and the belief that the new government will be much more sympathetic to wage demands than its white-led predecessor. The African National Congress, which won the April elections, has strong links with the trade union movement. However, the government is torn between its natural sympathy for the strikers and its need to reassure businessmen and foreign investors about its commitment to a stable business environment and low inflation. However, violent clashes between strikers and police officers have led to accusations by workers of government bad faith in its labour relations policy. Despite a series of meetings with ministers, no solution to the strike has emerged although strikers and managment agreed to mediation terms yesterday. The Congress of South African Trade Unions, the country's largest trade union federation, which remains in formal political alliance with the ANC, has publicly called on the government to stop paying excessive attention to business interests and concentrate on its own constituency. After returning from a three-day state visit to Mozambique, President Nelson Mandela warned publicly that the strikes could scare off desperately needed foreign investment. However, Mr Sam Shilowa, Cosatu president, denied this would happen, charging that the principle of legitimate industrial action was globally accepted. This year has already seen the most industrial action since 1991, and with workers demanding substantial real wage increases in the current round of negotiations more major strikes are possible in coming weeks.</p>

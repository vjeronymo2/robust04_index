			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> SPIRITED SWING BY CRAWFORD, MCGRIFF IN BASIE BALLROOM  </P> <P> Well into their third year as a double-bill, alto saxophonist Hank Crawford and  organist Jimmy McGriff blew into town Tuesday evening for a one-night stand at  the Count Basie Ballroom at the Compton Lazben Hotel.  </P> <P> Playing an early, free show for about 300 senior citizens, the duo, accompanied  by guitarist Bob DeVos and drummer John (Ironman) Harris, strayed from their  blues-laden path to serve a handsome set that included a pair of standards  (three, actually, if you consider "America, the Beautiful" a standard) a ballad  and a crowd-pleasing spiritual. Only one blues, "All Right, OK, You Win," was  included.  </P> <P> Though encumbered by ill-suited acoustics that rendered much of the music  muddled and Crawford's announcements unintelligible, the quartet managed to  convey its swing message with spirit.  </P> <P> An opening "They Can't Take That Away From Me," swung gently and most pleased  the handful of dancers who took to the mid-room dance floor. An unrecognized  ballad followed, with Crawford exploring neatly the range of the alto saxophone  in a series of solo choruses.  </P> <P> McGriff was at his best on the blues, though both his comping and brief solo  statements were effective on a lengthy rendition of "Satin Doll." Though the  tune should have been retired from the jazz repertoire 20 years ago, it  nonetheless provided a good vehicle for guitarist DeVos, a capable player whose  solos were well-thought and superbly executed.  </P> <P> Drummer Harris kept time like a fine Swiss watch and showed himself a team  player with his attention to dynamics.  </P> <P> "America, the Beautiful" was given too funky a rhythmic feel to capture the  anthem's innate soulfulness, but it worked in giving way to "Lift Every Voice  and Sing," a glorious spiritual whose first few notes were inspired enough to  lift each of the attendees to sing.

			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPREAD THE WEALTH  </P> <P> Regarding John McManus' June 25 article on the millions that the NBA (and the  NFL) rake in from television rights: Why don't these sports-biz organizations  take some of this largess and form minor leagues to develop their talent and  stop the cynical use of colleges to do it for them?  </P> <P> It is not part of higher education's mission to produce athletes for the  professional sport leagues, and I, for one, have been infuriated to the point  of picketing an NFL game in the Coliseum last August and the final NBA playoff  game at the Forum in June asking that this action be taken.  </P> <P> I write letters, picket professional games and hand out literature advocating  this idea. The rest of you apparently have never let this idea cross your mind.  </P> <P> PATRICK KELLY  </P> <P> Monrovia  </P></p>

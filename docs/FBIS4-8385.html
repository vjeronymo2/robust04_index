			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Igor Zalewski: "Will Right Wing Be Walesa's </F> Artificial Limb?" under the "Analysis" rubric]    [Text] The right wing is facing a strategic choice. The  decision it will make regarding the presidency will not only  determine the camp's immediate victory or defeat but also define  the right wing's form and future.    The right wing has two possible choices: It can either seek  agreement with the camp associated with the Democratic Union  [UD] and the Liberal-Democratic Congress and strive to come up  with a joint, compromise-based candidate in the presidential  elections, or unite around Lech Walesa again. On a party level,  that would also mean an alliance with the Polish Peasant Party  [PSL]. Peasant activists will most probably have their own  candidate for the Belweder Palace, but, until such an official  candidate is named, Walesa will try to avoid alienating a  potential ally who could lend his popularity to the currently  unpopular head of state.    While deciding on one of the above-mentioned options, the  right wing will also choose the part of the political scene it  wants to occupy, and with whom it wants to rule Poland in the  future (of course, such are its aspirations): With Waldemar  Pawlak, Michal Strak, and Jacek Soska, or with Bronislaw  Geremek, Jan Rokita, and Donald Tusk?    Sympathies of right-wing politicians are diversified. It is  easier to predict the future of the liberal coalition made up of  the Union for Real Politics, the Conservative Party, the  Peasant-Christian Party, the Party of Christian Democrats, and  the Democratic-National Party because any kind of rapprochement  between the coalition and the PSL is impossible for program  reasons. But, on the other hand, this bloc (known as the Accord  of 11 November) also includes politicians who continue to  believe in Lech Walesa's lucky star. Despite many bitter  disappointments, they would most certainly be willing to place  their bets on this quite worn-out and uncertain card.    But support for Walesa's candidacy is regarded as a last  resort by the Accord of 11 November, while sympathies for him  are treated as a rather shameful trait. One party declares  unofficially--in a whisper and in secret--that there is still  some love for Walesa glowing in another party. The other party,  in the meantime, says the same thing--in a contemptuous  tone--about the first party. There is no one daring to admit  openly his like for the current president. That is even more so  because the little whispers are being efficiently jammed by  determinant and tough declarations by Aleksander Hall, the  conservatives' leader, who, ever since the "war at the top,"  remains Lech Walesa's vigorous critic.    It was precisely Hall who was one of the first activists to  initiate a campaign for the sake of a broad agreement among  Solidarity-derived forces and who has been calling for the  "After-August [1980] Poland" to come up with a joint  presidential candidate. And, according to Hall, Walesa cannot  be the one, if only because he makes a bad president, but also,  which is of importance, as well, because he has no chance for  reelection.    It is quite a different story with the other right-wing  bloc,  which comprises the Center Accord [PC], the Christian-National  Union [ZChN], the Movement for the Republic, the Peasant Accord,  and the Conservative Coalition [KK]. On the face of it, the  issue is less complicated in this case: The camp is driven by  anti-Walesa moods that spread from the PC and are gladly taken  up by the other parties. This right-wing dislike of Walesa can  be easily explained. In statements by politicians of this side  of the political spectrum, who, after all, contributed to  Walesa's taking over his post in the past, disappointment with  his actions is prevalent. They continue to hold it against him  that he strengthened the left wing and weakened the right, that  he betrayed his election program, that he approved and expanded  on the principle of a "thick line," and that he is looking for  support among remnants of the Polish People's Republic [PRL]  power apparatus.    The right wing list of accusations against Walesa is long,  and it seemed that the Belweder's cooperation with the  "screwups" [Walesa's description of right-wing activists] is  just an unrealistic fantasy. But, faced with the coming  presidential election, Walesa began to look vigorously for  allies: He vehemently attacks the postcommunists, and he  mentions a need for decommunization and file-checking. For the  moment, the right wing ignores the president and pretends that  it is not at all interested in the Belweder's occupant because  it is aware of the bankruptcy the previous investment in Walesa  resulted in.    But there is a trait in many people of the right wing that  could push them right into the incumbent president's arms again:  an obsessive hatred of UD. This hatred is sometimes the main  driving force of political action, and sometimes it is even an  indicator of "being right-wing." Such right-wing politicians as  Slawomir Siwek (who used to be in the PC) and the ZChN's Jan  Lopuszanski long ago called for the establishment of an  anticommunist and anti-UD front based on the Belweder. But,  back then, Walesa contemptuously ignored the proposals. Now he  is making an attempt to revive sympathy for himself (which has  waned significantly) among right-wing men. Reluctance to UD may  be helpful in that regard; this is even more so because, even  now, some right-wing politicians (who, it is true, are active on  the margins of the coalition of the "five") have been declaring  slogans for a return to Walesa's bosom, accompanied by the  spread of anti-UD banners. But a majority of right-wing leaders  (among others, PC President Jaroslaw Kaczynski, a majority of  ZChN politicians, and KK's Kazimierz Ujazdowski) are absolute  opponents of such a scenario.    The implementation of the scenario in practice would bring  about serious and long-term consequences. First of all, it  would turn out that the Polish right wing does not exist as a  subject on its own, while, without a battering ram like Walesa,  it is not capable of scoring a political victory. This would  reduce the right wing's role to one of an imitation, a dummy, or  an artificial limb that can be used to lean on when there is a  need, instead of a serious camp capable of political and  ideological influence over Poland. The right wing would mean  nothing without Walesa.    Second, right-wing voters could feel confused and could say:  First we are called on to support Walesa, then we are told  repeatedly that he is evil incarnated and a traitor, and then,  in the end, we are to support him again. What is this all  about? Have the wounds that were inflicted on the right wing in  political battles with the president healed completely? Will  Walesa not lead us astray this time? These are questions they  could ask, and quite justifiably.    Some right-wing politicians also think it is the PSL that  would be their best partner for a future ruling of the country;  Walesa would also see the PSL in his camp willingly. While  praising the "Christian-Democratic" and national aspects of the  PSL, the party's admirers fail to perceive its weaknesses. The  right wing would have to pay with economic concessions in return  for an alliance with PSL activists: Centralist and  state-control tendencies would most certainly score a triumph in  the economy.    But, first of all, it is precisely the PSL, along with the  Democratic Left Alliance, that has been defending the legacy of  the PRL period particularly willingly, and they are also the  ones that have been attacking especially aggressively the  accomplishments of the four years of Solidarity-derived  governments (in the latter aspect, the PSL is definitely even  "better" than the postcommunists themselves). It is Prime  Minister Waldemar Pawlak who surrounds himself with Polish  United Workers Party apparatchiks, whom the Social Democracy of  the Polish Republic tries to hide particularly well in the vast  areas of its premises. It is PSL politicians who have been  comparing the post-1989 years with the Nazi occupation. The  anticommumist right wing should keep that in mind.</p>

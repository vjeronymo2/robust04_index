			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Bury the colonial hatchet Sir, In your December 3/4 issue there are two articles, two studies in contrast, which make me doubly happy that we had our Boston Tea Party in the 1770s and sent you packing to your sweet King George. One is 'Drug claim on Gibraltar border' and the other 'It is China that will call the shots on the handover of Hong Kong'. I understand the power of 1bn Chinese buying Jaguars or Raleigh bicycles, but you are handing 5m British subjects to a communistic totalitarian country while you refuse to return Gibraltar to Spain, a friendly, democratic country. Gibraltar is a colonial relic, a historical rancour of England over Spain, and, for 40m Spaniards, it is a source of irritation and contraband, an ingrown toe nail in the foot of Spain. Here is my idea and wishes for the English millennium: that England, in its heart, makes peace with Spain, buries the war axe and returns Gibraltar to Spain; that a statue of Queen Elizabeth II and of King Juan Carlos I be set up on Punta Europa. Evelyn T de la Vega, 48 McFadden Hut, Brownsville, Texas 78520, US</p>

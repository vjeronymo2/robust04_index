			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (27): Handy for a fixed sum on a fixed date - Zero-dividend preference shares Zero-dividend preference shares (popularly known as 'zeros') promise repayment of a specified sum after a set number of years, to the extent that the company - typically an investment trust - has the assets to meet this preferentially-ranked debt. As the name indicates, there are no pay-outs of income on zero-dividend shares. Investors try to strike what they feel is a reasonable balance between the gross yield to redemption and what is known as the 'fulcrum point' - a calculation of the growth in assets needed, or shrinkage acceptable, in the time between the present and the redemption date. For example, the TR Technology investment trust issued zero-dividend shares at 100p in April 1988, due for redemption at 313.2p in April 1998. An investor who bought at the recent market price of 227p would receive a capital repayment in 1998 equivalent to a gross yield of 9.88 per cent a year, even if TR Technology's assets fell by 7.5 per cent annually for the next four years. This compares with a gross redemption yield of 8.49 per cent on a gilt-edged (government fixed-interest) stock with the same number of years to redemption. In contrast, M&amp;G Recovery will need to produce asset growth of 1.7 per cent a year in order to meet the April 2002 repayment target of 150p per share on the zeros it issued at 45p in April 1992. At the recent price of 69p, the gross yield to redemption on these shares was 11.16 per cent, against 8.93 per cent on an equivalent gilt. Demand for zero-dividend shares is usually strongest when interest rates are perceived as falling, since investors buy as a way of locking in a return over the remaining life of the shares. If investors continue buying as the share price rises and the redemption yield falls, cover on the zeros can rise to levels that could absorb regular catastrophic crashes. River Plate &amp; General, for example, could see its assets drop by 40 per cent in each of the next two years, and still redeem its zeros at 100p. The gross redemption yield on these shares is currently just 7.68 per cent. John Korwin-Szymanowski, of SG Warburg Securities, says investors simply do not need that amount of cover, suggesting that a sufficiently safe choice would be among shares relying on not more than 1 per cent annual growth to reach redemption level. Regarded as low-risk investments, zero-dividend shares adapt well to financial planning, since any return - either on sale in the market or redemption - is a capital gain that can be offset against the annual exemption (Pounds 5,800, and scheduled to rise to Pounds 6,000).</p>

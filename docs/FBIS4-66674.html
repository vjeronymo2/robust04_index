			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mezri Haddad, researcher in moral and political </F> philosophy and former editorialist in the Tunisian press: "The  Election of the King of Tunisia"]    [Text] The architect of "change," of the "new era," has  just been plebiscited by his grateful people, to the ecstatic  delight of the unanimists, the yes-men, and other sycophants.  The retiarii and myrmillos of ultrademocratism, who had been  fighting their own shadows for weeks, have therefore just won a  "historic victory," as some colleagues in the Tunisian press  will not fail to boast. These "presidential elections," a  euphemism to describe the self-confirmation of the existing head  of state, however farcical they were, are nonetheless full of  lessons. In the electoral sham of 20 March, he was the only  candidate to his own succession, because the candidacy of Moncef  Marzouki, a brave defender of human rights, was received by the  "pro-Ben Ali" camp if not as a snub, at least as "the  machinations of an isolated psychopath." This professor of  medicine is certainly not the only pathological case in this  country governed by a "philosopher king," because 100 Tunisian  academics published a communique "supporting Moncef Marzouki's  right to stand in the presidential election."    There is, therefore, no doubt that, in this country, there  is  no process of democratization, nor even the slightest intention  of moving toward a semidemocratic system. Instead, there are  many signs that Tunisia is sinking further and further into a  system that gives no place to even the most basic human rights,  or freedom of thought, or moderated opposition, still less to  serious elections. A system that relies only on the strength of  its police--18,000 policemen in 1986, 45,000 today--has a name:  police state. Gregarious men call it a "happily strong state."  "Happily" because such a state protects "civilian society" from  Islamic fundamentalism. Look at what is happening in the  neighboring country, the regime's feudalists add, as if Algeria  were in its death throes because of excessive democracy.    In reality, many intellectuals already knew that, with or  without the Islamic fundamentalist specter, Tunisia would  inexorably move toward a Syrian-style democracy. The second  regime, born in the confusion of colorful conspiracy and a  suspect trophy, received as its genetic inheritance the vices  and responses of the Bourguibian republic, which had been in a  deep coma since 1980. There was no shortage of signs to  contemplate while awaiting the face of the new Moloch state:  seizures of newspapers, relentless repression of political  oppositionists of all colors, infiltration and neutralization of  the former powerful trade union federation (the UGTT [General  Union of Tunisian Workers]), the systematic use of the legal  apparatus to concoct political trials, the "privatization" of  opposition parties.    But not everything is negative in the nonevent that Tunisia  has just lived through. Any action or political decision  contains within it what the sociologists call in their jargon  aggregation effects (secondary and unexpected effects). In the  new Tunisian situation, there are two.    1. The surprise candidacy of Moncef Marzouki breaks an old  taboo rooted in Arab and Muslim mentalities, namely that there  can be no salvation outside the president or petty king you  have. For years, or even centuries, no Arab head of state has  been seen to accede to the supreme office by a popular vote. In  our countries, you do not gain power, you seize it by violence  or usurp it. Similarly, nobody has ever seen an Arab head of  state give up power voluntarily.    2. A democratic and secular opposition, which had been  developing for months, has just been born in Tunisia. Men  disenchanted by their experience hope to change the "change"  peacefully. They are thus exposing this daunting deception,  which is keeping the country in hibernation, namely that there  are only two political protagonists in Tunisia: those who  aspire to govern in the name of history and those who want to  govern in the name of an eschatological messianism. Some men,  and not unimportant ones, think, like Rousseau once did, that  you can only legitimately govern in the name of the general will.</p>

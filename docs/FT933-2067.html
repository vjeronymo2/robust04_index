			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Arts: Today's Television Tonight's funniest programme may well be Whicker's World (10.40 ITV). Whicker is once again in South Africa, at a new 'pleasure park' called Lost City which, we are told, cost Pounds 150m to create. Whicker's dry, stylised and highly professional manner of reporting is very entertaining. Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer have taken their long stick and their big paper bag and hopped across from Channel 4 to BBC2 where they begin The Smell Of Reeves And Mortimer (9.00). The BBC describes their comedy as 'surreal', a word which applies to Samuel Beckett and Spike Milligan but not quite appropriately to Reeves. It would be pleasant to enthuse over Brighton Belles, a British version of 'The Golden Girls', but as yet unlikely. The series may still come right, but so far the funniest thing is the desperation with which the producers are manipulating the volume slides for the laughter track (8.30 ITV). C4 shows the third and last of its documentaries about DW Griffith: Father Of Film and tries to explain why the great pioneer worked so little for the last 17 years of his life (9.00).</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: Camdev posts first quarterly profit Camdev, the surviving company from the 1991-92 collapse and restructuring of Mr Robert Campeau's property and US retailing empire, has posted its first quarterly profit. Camdev remains a substantial owner of office buildings and land in Ottawa and Toronto. It reported net profit of CDollars 237,000 (USDollars 170,921), or 4 cents a share, for the three months ended April 30, against a loss of CDollars 211,000, or 3 cents, a year earlier. Revenues were little changed at CDollars 20m. However, chairman Mr Stanley Hartt, who was a lawyer and chief-of-staff to former prime minister Mr Brian Mulroney, warned the profit was mainly due to a CDollars 1.5m dividend received from a minority-owned California supermarket chain. He said the chain needed to reinvest its cash, and Camdev hoped to sell its 12.8 per cent interest. For the year ended January 1994, Camdev lost CDollars 1.5m, or 24 cents, against a loss of CDollars 13.7m, or CDollars 2.16, a year earlier. Mr Hartt said Camdev wanted to expand its property management and development activities through a new subsidiary, Finreal Properties. Finreal will buy distressed real estate and manage and develop properties for sale. It will finance its acquisitions through the capital markets and eventually be taken public, with Camdev retaining a minority interest. Earlier this year, the Liechtenstein supreme court dismissed an appeal by Camdev to seize Mr Campeau's Austrian chateau. The company has other litigation outstanding, concerning money it says is owed by Mr Campeau.</p>

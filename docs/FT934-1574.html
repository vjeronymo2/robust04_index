			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / EU faces dispute over industrial aid: Commission presses UK and France to reduce bids for regional funds A row is brewing in the European Union over the share-out between the 12 member states of structural aid for industrially depressed, high unemployment regions. The chief reason is that the UK and France are bidding for very large slices of an assistance fund worth Ecu30bn (Dollars 34bn). The funding is for so-called Objective 2 areas which are judged to be in industrial decline, and is part of the overall Ecu156bn regional aid budget for the 1994-99 period. Most of this goes to the four poorest member states, whereas Objective 2 funding is channelled to the black spots in larger economies. The current dispute arises because the regulations approved in July oblige the Objective 2 portion to be concentrated on a maximum of 15 per cent of the EU population. However, total bids put in by the 12 members would cover 23 per cent of the Union's inhabitants. European Commission officials say that after tough negotiations, 10 of the member states are satisfied. But the UK has bid for Objective 2 funding to cover 40 per cent of the British population, while the bid from France wants coverage for one-third of its inhabitants. Both countries have been asked to submit more reasonable bids. If they do not, the Commission will be obliged to make aid decisions for them, which would probably lead to serious political friction. Eligibility for Objective 2 aid has until now required an unemployment rate higher than the EU average, a higher percentage of industrial employment than the EU average and a decline specifically in industrial employment. These criteria, which are relatively easy to measure, were ratified in July. But new, more judgmental criteria were added, for instance on matters such as aid to rebuild inner cities. This prompted overbidding and complicated the share-out. Commission officials are also particularly dismissive of some of the areas on the UK's shopping list, such as the Isle of Wight and parts of south-east England, which they do not regard as meeting the criteria. After some delay, the Commission is expected to deal with the issue on Tuesday. The probable clash between Brussels and London and Paris could spread to other EU members if the Commission makes any significant concessions to the UK and France, since any extra funding they gain would have to be taken from their EU partners. This would prove difficult since Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, has in some cases, such as the Netherlands and Italy, already made firm funding commitments.</p>

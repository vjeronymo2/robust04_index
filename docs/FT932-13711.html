			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / People: Non-executive directors FKI, the Yorkshire-based manufacturing conglomerate, has finally found an American industrialist to hold its hand as it expands its North American business. John Rodewig, 58, president and chief operating officer of Eaton Corporation, has been appointed a non-executive director of FKI. Roughly half of FKI's business is in the US and the company had hired headhunters to find a non-executive director who could proffer advice about the US but also knew Europe. Bob Beeston, FKI's managing director, says that Rodewig (below) was the ideal candidate. Not only has his whole career been at Eaton, which employs 39,000 people, but he also spent ten years running Eaton's truck components business in Middlesex. FKI's board meets around half a dozen times a year - at least once in the US.</p>

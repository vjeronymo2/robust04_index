			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> COUPLES TIED FOR THE LEAD AFTER SHOOTING 67 IN WIND  </P> <P> Fred Couples extracted a 67 from gusty winds and tied Paul Azinger for the  second round lead Friday in the Doral Open golf tournament.  </P> <P> "That's about the best I could have got out of the round," said Couples, who  saved par and a share of the lead with an eight-foot par-putt on the final  hole.  </P> <P> Couples, seeking a second consecutive PGA Tour victory, completed two rounds on  Doral's Blue Monster course in 134, 10 under par.  </P> <P> He was tied with Azinger, who converted a good finish and a better start into a  66, the best round of the day.  </P> <P> "Fast start, fast finish," said Azinger, who opened his round  eagle-birdie-birdie and closed it birdie-par-birdie.  </P> <P> Mark Calcavecchia, playing hours ahead of Couples and Azinger in the worst of  the winds, with gusts to 30 mph -- shot a 67 that left him one stroke off the  lead at 135.  </P> <P> "Considering the winds, I played about as well as I can," said Calcavecchia,  winner of the British Open and two American titles last year.  </P> <P> The same, however, hardly could be said of Tom Kite, the 1989 Player of the  Year and one of golf's most consistent players.  </P> <P> Kite blew to a fat 78, his first score that high since a similar score cost him  the 1989 U.S. Open title. His 146 total was 2 over par and one more than  required to qualify for the final two rounds Saturday and Sunday.  </P> <P> It marked the first time in 37 tournaments, going back to 1988, he had missed  the cut.  </P> <P> Tom Purtzer was fourth, two back of Calcavecchia, at 137. He had a 70 in the  difficult conditions.  </P> <P> John Cook and Phil Blackmar were next at 138. Each had a second-round 71.  </P> <P> First-round leader Jim Gallagher went to a 74 and was at 139.  </P> <P> Jack Nicklaus matched par 72 and reached the tournament halfway point at 140,  six shots back.  </P> <P> Australian Greg Norman was 73-141. PGA champion Payne Stewart and Tom Watson  had matching scores of 73-143.  </P> <P> Azinger, who has won once and has a second place finish in six previous  tournaments this year, said his fast start "kind of caught me off guard.  </P> <P> "Going to the first tee I was a little insecure about the way I was hitting  it."  </P> <P> But he needed only a 5-iron second shot to reach the green on the par-5 first  hole.  </P></p>

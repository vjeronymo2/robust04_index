			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [By reporter Im Ho-chun] </F>   [Text] The half-joke-half-serious phrase, "the future will  be a police era," is circulating among those in the intelligence  field. There is a high probability that the police will surpass  the Agency for National Security Planning [NSP] and Defense  Security Command [DSC] in intelligence capability and that an  era will come when police information is treated as the "highest  class" intelligence.    This talk is not circulating because the police's  intelligence capability, that is its collection, analytical and  interpretation capabilities, is better than other agencies. It  is because, confronted by an era of civilian government, the  activities of the NSP and DSC, long exercising tremendous  influence, have been relatively reduced.    "Can police intelligence continue like this?" -- words  casually dropped by Home Affairs Minister Choe Hyong-u after his  appointment as minister. The words of Minister Choe became  widely known in political circles and there are many people who  interpret them as instructions to strengthen police intelligence  capability. Those in police intelligence were also greatly  encouraged by this one statement.    In connection with this statement, there are those who  ponder  the fact that last year the National Police Administration  created a new position in its Intelligence Bureau: Intelligence  Analyst. Some look at this and speculate, "The police have gone  into full-scale research to strengthen their intelligence  capabilities." Although the duties of the intelligence analyst  are not yet known in detail, attention has focused on the fact  that at a delicate point in time, a senior superintendent, with  the rank of police-station chief, was put in the position.    One thing to be considered carefully in connection with the  reduction of the activity of the NSP, considered the highest  intelligence agency, is the activation of the Telecommunications  Secrecy Protection Law. Actually, it is no secret that a  considerable portion of the NSP's intelligence collection  depended on wire tapping.    In an inspection of Korean Telecommunications by the  National  Assembly's Transportation and Communications Committee held  October 22 of last year, Democratic Party lawmaker Yi Yun-su  divulged, "The NSP has exclusive use of 9,000 telephone  circuits. Of these, over 5,000 are used for eavesdropping."    Rep. Yi demanded that they "reveal precise details," but  Korean Telecommunications representatives equivocated, saying,  "We don't yet have a grasp of it." "Considering that the police  have only 885 dedicated circuits and the DSC has only 383,  although both have similar intelligence duties, this supports  the view that the NSP depends for a considerable portion of its  intelligence on wiretapping," insisted Rep. Yi.    The intelligence activities of the NSP were dealt a fatal  blow last year when the Telecommunications Secrecy Protection  Law passed the National Assembly. The decoration of the pages of  daily newspapers by articles entitled, "NSP Employees Stop  Work," is not unrelated to this. "It's not that we have stopped  work altogether, as they are saying on the outside, but it is  true that morale has dropped considerably," said one NSP source,  indirectly conveying the mood within the NSP.    The DSC, which stirred up a controversy because of its  surveillance of civilians, already cut off its arms and legs  last year. Beginning with a sudden change of the DSC commander,  the DSC reorganization led into the abolition of its  intelligence office (Office II), which was responsible for  intelligence collection against civilians, together with the  movement of municipal and provincial-level security units to  within military bases. Also, over 400 veteran intelligence  agents who had been working in rear areas were moved to forward  areas. The DSC is now powerless in any arena other than  national-defense-related intelligence.    Such variables external to the police thus encourage the  idea  that, as far as intelligence goes, this is the "era of the  police."    In the vicinity of Seoul's Sogang University and in front of  Ehwa University, there are several offices with signs reading,  "Council" [as published]. In their names, these offices do not  fit in with the mood of a university neighborhood.    These offices are actually intelligence offices subordinate  to the Police Administration's Intelligence Bureau: they collect  various kinds of information tied in with politics, economics,  and the college area. The Police Administration has three such  offices within Seoul. The entrance to the National Assembly  building and political party buildings are also the  responsibility of police officers belonging to these  intelligence offices. The police's intelligence organization is  this broad.    Police intelligence activities tie the nation together as  with a spider's web. Those active in the front lines of  intelligence collection are the intelligence-section detectives  of each police station. Also, taking responsibility for one  police box each within their respective jurisdictions, they  gather information on important figures living in their areas  and public opinion within their jurisdictions. Thus, they in  fact have every quarter of the entire country covered.    The police station intelligence department is divided into  Intelligence Sections I and II. Pure intelligence-collection  activities are the responsibility of Intelligence Section II.  Although there are places with less than ten police officers,  20-30 detectives are active for police stations in areas of  Seoul with concentrations of major organizations and in areas  near universities.    Information collected at each police station is sent to the  municipal or provincial police intelligence-management  department. This once again goes up to the National Police  Administration, where the administration's intelligence analyst  interprets information based on this.    Even apart from this intelligence system with its vertical  organization, the National Police Administration, municipal and  provincial police also have separate, horizontal organizations.  The Seoul Municipal Police have an Intelligence-Management  Department with Intelligence Sections I and II. Other municipal  and provincial police also have similar structures. The  Intelligence Bureau within the Police Administration has  Intelligence Sections I through IV. This is the place that  epitomizes nationwide police intelligence.    Intelligence Section I is responsible for general affairs;  Section II, for collecting information on politics; Section III,  on economics and society; and Section IV, on academia and  religion. Intelligence Sections II, III, and IV manage  Intelligence offices 1, 2, and 3 respectively. It would not be  far off the mark to say that the entire public is confined  within the police intelligence network.    Besides this, the police even have officers dispatched to  the  Blue House, NSP, DSC, the courts, and public prosecutor's  offices. Of all government departments, the police have the  greatest number of government workers dispatched to other  places. Although not attached to duty, there is even a  designated person responsible for the media.    However, this does not mean that police intelligence has  tremendous influence. Although its collection capability is  outstanding, it has been considered to be relatively behind in  its analysis and interpretation capabilities. "Police  intelligence is rock-bottom intelligence: a collection of all of  the most detailed but trivial information," said one  intelligence police officer, "Accessing high-class information  is not an easy thing."    Let us look at an example. There was a police officer in his  fifties working at the Namdaemun police station in Seoul. He has  now moved to a different police station within Seoul, but many  people remember his activity when he was in charge of the  Samsung Group as a member of the intelligence section. As an  intelligence-section "detective," his rank was not that high,  but there was not a Samsung Group director who did not know his  name. This was because concerning internal information on the  Samsung Group, and particularly information about the movements  of the group's head, he was the quickest and most knowledgeable.    Among the intelligence he collected was information unknown  to even the NSP, the leader of intelligence agencies. Long  "frequenting" the Samsung Group headquarters, it was possible  for him to collect even trivial information on things such as  the exchange of the air purifier in the C.E.O.'s office.  However, his activities never got him much credit. The  information he collected was, in a word, fragmentary. Police  analytical capabilities were unable to thread this voluminous  information together to make a product. Even if they could have  been said to have made a "product," it was always behind that of  the NSP and DSC. This is because the police intelligence of the  Fifth and Sixth Republics had no influence.    The main reason the police were unlikely to access  high-class  information and so could not help but fall behind the NSP, was  "money," say sources associated with police intelligence. "The  NSP pours out bundles of money. Naturally, high-class  information follows," said one police-intelligence source.    Concerning the question, "Will a time come when the police  surpass the NSP and DSC in intelligence capability?" present  theories are unlikely to give a clear answer. This is because,  although there are clear signs of this, there is still no  movement in that direction.    "I have not heard a concrete commitment from Minister Choe  concerning the strengthening of police intelligence  capabilities," said Senior Superintendent General Yi Su-il, the  National Police Administration's Intelligence Bureau Chief. "It  is only speculation based on various circumstances. There have  been no concrete efforts taken within the Police Administration  to improve its intelligence organization and it is technically  impossible to change an intelligence organization in a day."    "The establishment of the position of Intelligence Analyst  was only a separation of the existing intelligence-analysis  personnel," said Yi. "It is unrelated to movements to  strengthen intelligence capability."    However, one source associated with the police said, "The  attempt by President Kim Yong-sam and Minister Choe Hyong-u,  representative victims of the past abnormal intelligence  activities of the NSP and DSC, to strengthen the legal  intelligence activities of the police in conjunction with an era  of civilian government is only natural." The source also said,  "Internally, the police will be deliberating on proposals now."    "The quality of intelligence has a deep correlation with  money," said one National Police Administration source, "even if  there are efforts at improvement, because if there is no budget  support the results will not be remarkable." "Even if it  changes, it won't change much in a short time," he forecasted.    Always crowded out by the NSP and DSC, even while having the  most massive organization and number of personnel of the three  intelligence agencies, the police now appear to be gradually  gaining strength. One police officer said, "Within the limits of  what is not damaging to the public, intelligence collection must  proceed, appearing to be and not to be at the same time."</p>

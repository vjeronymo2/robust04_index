			<p>BFN     [Text] Vladikavkaz, April 5, RIA -- The speaker of the  North Ossetian parliament, Yuriy Biragov, said that the decision  to hold a second round of talks between the leaders of Northern  Ossetia and the Ingush Republic in Nalchik on April 3 was a  major political success, capable of breaking the deadlock in the  relations between the two conflicting republics within Russia.  According to the Ossetian parliament leader, personal contacts  between North Ossetia's President Akhsarbek Galazov and Ingush  President Ruslan Aushev may have a positive role to play in  bringing peace to the south of Russia. Mr. Biragov said that  the Ossetian side would insist on two "fundamental" conditions,  namely that the Ingush republic abandon all territorial claims  to Northern Ossetia and declare illegal and unconstitutional any  attempts to settle the conflict by force.    According to the provisional administration in the disputed  regions of the two republics, its Armed Forces control the  situation in the state-of-emergency zone and continue to take  measures to restore law and order there. The confiscation of  illegal weapons from the population continues. On Monday  transport police officers and Russian Interior Ministry  officials discovered two Uzi automatic pistols in a sleeper of  the Baku-Kislovodsk train, but failed to identify and arrest  their owners. The investigation of the case continues.    A total of 246 submachine-guns, 22 machine-guns, 62 rifles  and 417 pistols have been confiscated since the imposition of  the state of emergency in the region.</p>

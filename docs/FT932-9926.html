			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Two held in Italian kickback inquiry ITALIAN magistrates investigating kickbacks to political parties made two new arrests yesterday which further implicated the former Communist party in the widening corruption scandal. The ex-Communist Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) until recently has been relatively untouched by the corruption inquiries. Magistrates arrested Mr Renato Pollini, former administrative secretary of the Communist party, and Mr Fausto Bartolini, ex-director of a building company associated with Italy's powerful co-operative movement, as part of inquiries into alleged kickbacks from the state railway system. The arrests followed the issue of 14 cautionary warrants on Monday against businessmen and Transport Ministry officials. The accused are alleged to have connived in an arrangement to split kickbacks on railway orders between Italy's main political parties. Among those sought by the magistrates are Mr Franco Ferlin, an adviser at the time to Mr Carlo Bernini, a former transport minister. The PDS is fighting to defend its image after a recent stream of leaks and arrests have prompted claims that its members participated in schemes involving kickbacks on public-sector contracts. The party has denied receiving kickbacks from companies dealing with the railways in the period up to 1988 when it had a member on the rail board. Mr Pietro Tognoli, a Bergamo businessman, was arrested last week on allegations of having paid a 3 per cent kickback on a L200bn (Pounds 85m) contract for track sleepers. According to press leaks, 60 per cent of the L6bn was shared between the Christian Democrats (25 per cent), Socialists (15) and PDS (20). The rest went to government officials. The PDS has denied any involvement. A committee of the lower house of parliament put off until next week hearings on lifting the parliamentary immunity of Mr Bettino Craxi, former Socialist party leader, and Mr Claudio Martelli, a prominent ex-Socialist and former justice minister.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By "JORDAN TIMES staff reporter" Nirmin Murad] </F>   [Text] Jordan believes that the only way to ensure the  protection of Palestinians in the occupied territories is  through the removal of the settlements in the occupied  territories, especially in high-tension areas such as Hebron and  Jerusalem, a senior official told the JORDAN TIMES Wednesday.    The Kingdom also wants to see a more active role for the  United Nations in the Middle East peace negotiations as well as  in guaranteeing the protection of Palestinian citizens.    "Jordan's declared position is that Palestinians in the  occupied territories have to be protected," said the official,  who asked he remain anonymous.    Jordan, along with its Arab partners to the Arab-Israeli  negotiations, pulled out of the Washington-based bilateral talks  early in protest against the massacre of 60 worshippers in  Hebron last week.    The PLO has placed several conditions on the resumption of  negotiations, including the dismantling of settlements  especially in Hebron and the Gaza Strip, move the issue of  settlements from final-status negotiations to be current  negotiations, disarm settlers and increase the number of  Palestinian policemen.    Israel has already freed around 1,000 Palestinian detainees  and announced it was ready to disarm 100 settlers. Israeli  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, according to reports, was willing  to accept international observers to supervise the transfer of  power from Israel to Palestinians, possibly dismantle  particularly trouble-some settlements, crack down on radical  Jewish settlers and increse the size of the Palestinian police  forces.    "We believe that the best security arrangements are that  settlements are dismantled especially in Jerusalem and Hebron,  the official said.    He said that these two areas are especially important  because  "of their historic value and the close contact between  fundamentalist settlers and Palestinian residents in those  areas."    "Jordan also calls for U.N. participation in negotiations,"  the official said.    But most importantly, the official said the issue of  settlements should be moved forward to the current Arab-Israeli  negotiations instead of relegating the sensitive debate to  final-status negotiations.    "Jordan always believed that the delaying of this issue will  have dangerous ramifications," the official said.    The official said that the head of the PLO political  department, Faruq Qaddumi, will not visit Amman as previously  scheduled and has instead gone to New York to discuss the  proposed U.N. resolution on the Hebron massacre.    U.S. and Palestinian diplomats had been holding negotiations  at the U.N. headquarters in New York to work out disagreements  on wording and reach a final draft for a U.N. Security  resolution condemning the Hebron Massacre.</p>

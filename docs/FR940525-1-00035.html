The risk-based capital treatment of recourse arrangements and direct credit substitutes is discussed in section III.D of this appendix A. The following definitions of the terms ``recourse'' and ``direct credit substitute'' apply for risk-based capital purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recourse is the retention, in form or in substance, of any risk of loss directly or indirectly associated with an asset a bank has transferred that is in excess of the bank's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  share of the asset. A recourse arrangement typically arises when an institution transfers an asset and retains an obligation to repurchase the asset or to absorb losses on the asset arising from a default of principal or interest or any other deficiencies in the performance of the underlying obligor or some other party.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A direct credit substitute is the assumption, in form or substance through a nonrecourse arrangement, of any risk of loss directly or indirectly associated with an asset or other claim in excess of the bank's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  share of the asset or other claim. A direct credit substitute arrangement typically arises when an institution issues a standby letter of credit, purchases a subordinated security that provides loss protection to more senior securities, or purchases servicing rights, such as mortgage servicing rights, that obligate the servicer to provide credit protection to the third-party owners of the assets being serviced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For most direct credit substitutes, the amount of the bank's exposure to be converted to an on-balance sheet credit equivalent typically is the full face value of the item. However, for direct credit substitutes, such as purchased subordinated securities that are carried on the balance sheet and directly or indirectly absorb the first losses from a third-party asset, pool of assets, or other claim, the full amount of the bank's off-balance sheet exposure that is to be converted is the entire outstanding principal amount of the asset, pool of assets, or other claim, less the amount of the on-balance sheet direct credit substitute against which capital is already held. This treatment applies regardless of whether the direct credit substitute fully or partially supports the asset, pool of assets, or other claim. The full amount of the bank's off-balance sheet exposure to be converted may be the same or greater than the face value of the direct credit substitute. For instance, in the case of purchased subordinated securities that absorb first losses, the entire outstanding principal amount of all more senior securities that are supported by that subordinated interest (to the extent they are not already reported on the bank's balance sheet) are converted to an on-balance sheet credit-equivalent amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan has  reaffirmed to France the government's policy that supplying  weapons to Cambodian government troops is not the solution to  ending Phnom Penh's conflict with the Khmer Rouge.    Surin met French Ambassador Jacques Rummelhardt on Thursday.    Three Western countries -- France, the United States and  Australia -- are considering a Cambodian request to provide  military aid, including weapons, to help fight the Khmer Rouge.    "During the discussion, I inform the French envoy that the  Thai position towards the request is that the supply of weapons  will not end the Cambodian conflict and it is not a suitable  solution," said Surin.    Members of the Cambodian government have reiterated calls  for  weaponry to attack the guerrillas after roundtable talks in  North Korea, called by King Norodom Sihanouk, failed to reach a  settlement.    The participants agreed to set up a joint committee which is  scheduled to meet for the first time on June 15 in Phnom Penh.    First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh declared at  Pochentong airport upon arrival from Pyongyang that war between  the Cambodian government and the Khmer Rouge is unavoidable.  Cambodia's foreign minister, Prince Norodom Sirivut, has toured  England and France, reportedly to request weapons.    Meanwhile, a high-ranking government source yesterday  confirmed reports that Malaysia has supplied munitions to  Cambodian troops.    "It is widely known in Phnom Penh that Kuala Lumpur has  supplied munitions to Cambodia in recent months," he said.    However, the source said, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir  Mohamed had told Prime Minister Chuan Likphai recently that  supplying weapons was not the way to end Cambodia's civil war.    The source noted that Western countries which have been  approached for aid are having second thoughts.    "Military aid does not mean only weapons, but also a  military  training programme for the ill-disciplined Cambodian troops in  various fields," he said.    The same source said that the West had no assurance that  weapons they supply would not be sold by the underpaid Cambodian  troops, even to the Khmer Rouge. Thailand has also expressed  deep concern that the weapons would be brought across the border  onto its soil.    The United States sent representatives to Phnom Penh last  month to observe the situation there before making any decision  on the aid request. The Phnom Penh Post reported the U.S. has,  however, already decided to send about 90 mine removal experts  and engineers to Cambodia, and that an advanced team had already  arrived.</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Switch to growth stocks mooted for Q4 Bourses weakened following the overnight drop in US equities, and yesterday's Federal Reserve support for the dollar came too late in the day to engender any recovery, writes Our Markets Staff. There was change to come, however, said Mr Francois Langlade-Demoyen of CS First Boston: his scenario was that growth momentum will start to fade in the fourth quarter of this year, and that cyclicals will lose their charm to the benefit of growth stocks. FRANKFURT followed CSFB's inclinations, or appeared to do so, with big gains in construction stocks and the computer software producer SAP, and falls in chemicals. The Dax index dropped 27.38 to 2,042.35 on the session, easing a little further after hours, and turnover more than doubled to DM6.1bn following Tuesday's holiday in some German cities. SAP rose DM17 to DM957 and, in construction, Hochtief and Holzmann put on DM29 at DM968 and DM18 at DM855. At Robert Fleming in Frankfurt, Mr Hans Peter Wodniok observed that construction shares tend to outperform in late autumn and winter, provided that sites are not frozen up for months on end. Among cyclicals, by the end of the afternoon, Bayer was down DM8.60 at DM341, Hoechst by DM7 at DM321.40, Continental, the tyremaker, by DM7 at DM213 and MAN, the truckmaker and engineer, by DM11.10 at DM369.90. Here, Mr Wodniok said that sector performance charts for the German market suggest periods of outperformance or underperformance lasting between 2 1/2 and 4 1/2 years; chemicals had been outperforming for close to 4 years in the present cycle, suggesting that this period was coming to an end. PARIS came back from two days' holiday to a fall of 1.7 per cent following Friday's 2.6 per cent gain, the drop of 32.09 in the CAC-40 to 1,873.90 reflecting weakness in US currency, bond and equity markets. Turnover was FFr4.05bn. However, the bourse found the ability to celebrate a 14.2 per cent rise in nine-month sales at Peugeot, which added FFr17 at FFr788, and to anticipate good nine-month results after hours from Roussel Uclaf, the Hoechst subsidiary, which climbed FFr16 to FFr591. MILAN turned back as Credito Romagnolo began to erect defences against Credito Italiano which, last week, bid L2,000bn for a 48 per cent stake in the Bologna bank. The Comit index dropped 9.89 or 1.6 per cent to 625.54. Romagnolo fell L654 to L16,295 in early trade before the shares were suspended as the board announced plans to merge its operations with those of Casse Emiliano Romagnole, a Bologna-based savings bank. Mr Bryan Crossley at Hoare Govett said that the move was clearly an attempt to make Romagnolo 'indigestible'. He noted that Romagnolo and Emiliano had previously discussed links and said that any such move would make strategic and commercial sense. Credito Italiano finished L51 cheaper at L1,589. Meantime, BCI fell L95 to L3,461 as the board met to discuss future strategy, prompting further speculation that it might be about to launch a bid for Ambroveneto. However, analysts were sceptical about any such move in the short term, pointing to the 34.4 per cent rise in the Ambroveneto share price between Wednesday of last week and last Monday. Ambroveneto was marked 9.1 per cent lower in early dealings, as investors digested developments at Romagnolo, before bouncing back to finish L79 higher at L5,315. ZURICH's SMI index eased 3.9 to 2,500.0. UBS bearers remained at the centre of attention, giving up SFr11 to SFr1,125 as investors continued to swap into CS Holding, SFr7 ahead at SFr564. SBC came under pressure, the bearers losing SFr6 to SFr353 after the bank reported nine-month figures and warned that it expected significantly lower full-year results. Exporters were unsettled by the weak dollar, Nestle losing SFr7 to SFr1,167, BBC easing SFr20 to SFr1,060, and Ciba giving up SFr6 at SFr721. Schindler bearers picked up SFr450 or 6.7 per cent to SFr7,200 on the view that the recent correction had been overdone. One analyst commented that the stock had seen a number of recent brokers' recommendations; Mr Martin Ebner's BK Vision was also rumoured to be a buyer. Oerlikon-Buhrle picked up SFr3.50 to SFr136.50 after the chairman gave a positive outlook for earnings developments in the coming years at an analysts' presentation in Zurich. AMSTERDAM saw the AEX index close 4.50 down at 405.75, and Akzo Nobel lost Fl 3.40 at Fl 208 although its third-quarter results were in line with most expectations. Merrill Lynch said the company was on track for good performance over the next few years and recommended using the recent share price weakness as an opportunity to buy. DSM picked up 40 cents to Fl 141.40 after Tuesday's sharp losses which followed its third-quarter results. Among companies expected to report today, Philips shed 90 cents to Fl 54.70 and KLM gave up Fl 1.20 at Fl 47.30. MADRID was dominated by outside influences as the general index retreated 3.06 points to 293.24 in turnover of Pta23.01bn. BCH rose Pta15 to Pta3,015 before disclosing, after hours, a 25 per cent decline in net profits for the first nine months of 1994.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Calcutta, January 12--The CPI(M-L) [Communist Party  of India--Marxist-Leninist] general secretary, Liberation group,  Mr Vinod Mishra, said here yesterday that his party will strive  for closer co-operation with the CPM and the CPI [Communist  Party of India] in the Hindi belt, particularly in Uttar Pradesh  and Bihar, to build up a "Left offensive."    He said this had become necessary as with the Janata Dal in  crisis everywhere, the Mulayam Singh government in Uttar Pradesh  had become dependent on the Congress. In the circumstances, one  could not expect the Mulayam Singh government to oppose the  Congress government at the Centre on major issues, like the new  economic policy.    At the national plane also, the CPI(M-L) would work unitedly  with the Left parties to oppose the "anti-people" policies of  the Rao government at the Centre. The party would participate in  the proposed rally by the Left parties in Delhi on April 5  against the Dunkel proposal, he added.    Mr Mishra, however, made it clear that while trying to work  unitedly with the CPM and the CPI elsewhere, the CPI(M-L) would  continue to oppose the "anti-people" activities of the CPM-led  Left Front government in West Bengal. Mr Mishra regretted that  corruption had become institutionalised in West Bengal during  the 17-year rule of the Left Front government.    Asked if they wanted the Left Front government in West  Bengal  to go, he replied that they would never like it to be replaced  by a Congress or the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] government.  They will support the Left Front government in the event of any  attack on the government by the Centre or communal forces. But  they would in no case agree to the CPM's demand that they should  give up their criticism of the Left Front government if they  wanted to be an ally of the Front.    Mr Mishra said that the CPI(M-L), which held its central  committee meeting for three days ending on January 10, had  decided that henceforth the Indian People's Front (IPF) an  associate body of the party, would no longer be an electoral  platform. Supporters of their cause would henceforth fight the  elections under the banner of the CPI(M-L).    Efforts were on to form a national level platform with the  IPF and organisation, like Narmada Bachao Andolan, Lal Nishan  Samiti of Maharashtra and Rajasthan Kishan Sangathan, to fight  unitedly major issues like communalism and the new economic  policy. Ms Medha Patkar was scheduled to visit Patna next month  for holding preliminary talks in this regard.    Asked to comment about the emergence of the Bahujan Samaj  Party, Mr Mishra said that a particular political situation had  brought the party to the forefront in Uttar Pradesh.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Kinyarwanda </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Prime Minister-designate Faustin Twagiramungu to </F> the nation on the delay in setting up transitional institutions  in Kigali on 23 February--live or recorded]    [Excerpts] Due to certain words uttered yesterday and today  on the setting up of the transitional government, I deemed it  important to brief Rwandans on the course of the current events,  especially now that our country is in difficulty. I wish to say  that the president of the Republic should not take advantage of  the difficult situation we are in by trying to set up  transitional institutions the way he wants them. That is why I  wish to explain to Rwandans the situation affecting the setting  up of the transitional institutions and also to inform them  about the content of our talks. [passage omitted]    It is not the prime minister's fault that the transitional  government has not been formed, but that of the president of the  Republic, who wants things done his way so that he can put in  place his own ministers from parties he agrees with and also  appoint deputies of his choice.    Concerning the Republican Democratic Movement, I would like  to reiterate that the Arusha agreement specified 11 deputies,  not seven. Therefore, I cannot agree that the governmebnt be  formed before the four deputies are reinstated. No one took  them to court; I am the one who was taken to court. Let them  allow me to defend myself and be defeated. Even if I were  defeated, so long as the deputies are not taken to court so that  they are defeated on their own account, they should [words  indistinct].    I would like to add that the meeting of parties called for  by  the president of the Republic for Friday [25 February] will be  useless [words indistinct] with the Rwandan Patriotic Front in  accordance with Article 14 of the Arusha agreement. In  accordance with that article, the meeting should be called by  the parties. If the president wished to take part so as to hear  what the parties say, then it is possible, but I do not think  that he has the power to call such a meeting. It cannot lead us  to anything tangible, since he has already taken decisions about  which he informed Rwandans. Thank you for allowing me to address  the Rwandans.</p>

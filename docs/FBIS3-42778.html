Some call them the "eye of the state," while  others, remembering bygone times, call them "party organs of the  Central Committee." At one time Nikolay Travkin, speaking from  the parliamentary rostrum, promised "to inform" on himself every  Wednesday if he is spared such representatives of the president.  According to available information, speaker of the Federation  Council Shumeyko is disposed to a radical resolution of this  problem. In all probability the near future will show how  reliable these assumptions are. But in the meantime a new  representative of the president, Kondrat Yevtushenko, has been  appointed representative of the president in Khabarovsk  Kray.    Only one thing identifies Kondrat Yevtushenko, the new  representative of the president in Khabarovsk Kray, with  Vladimir Desyatov, his predecessor: Both came to politics on the  crest of the democratic wave, and both supported its radical  wing. The similarity ends here. Yevtushenko thinks that the  self-isolation of the representative of the president from the  administration of the kray and the local democrats was the  reason for his dismissal. In this respect, Yevtushenko is the  complete opposite of his predecessor. Being a people's deputy of  Russia in the last convocation, he used his personal  capabilities to the maximum to resolve the kray's problems. This  ensured Yevtushenko the support of Viktor Ishayev, head of  administration, who half a year before this appointed Kondrat  Mikhaylovich manager of the executive branch of Amurskiy Rayon.    The opinion exists that the surgeon-traumatologist did not  make it as an administrator and business executive: For example,  in autumn he bought potatoes at an exorbitant price in Siberia  instead of getting them right there from his own farmers.  Important entrepreneurs are unhappy with the absence of support.  However, he himself thinks otherwise: In this half year the city  has become cleaner, asphalt has appeared, and they have started  to build a waterline and finish building purification  installations that were abandoned by the defense industry. As  for production, he considers one of his unquestionable services  the output of linoleum at one of the converted enterprises and  the preparation of bus assemblies at another.    Yevtushenko thinks that the results of the elections to the  State Duma, for which he submitted his candidacy, speak in his  favor, although he did not become a deputy. Four-fifths of the  people supported Kondrat Mikhaylovich in three rayons of his  electoral district, and he surpassed his opponent by 13,000  votes in his native Amursk. However, Komsomolsk preferred not a  doctor democrat but a professional entrepreneur.    He started work in his new capacity with an accounting of  state money expended on maintenance of the apparatus. His  predecessor, with two representative offices--in Khabarovsk and  Komsomolsk-na-Amur--worked three days in each. Yevtushenko  immediately eliminated the office in Komsomolsk and also  curtailed the position of deputy.    There are also dangers concealed in the position of  representative of the president. For example, if he defends the  interests of the kray "at the top" too actively, he risks  bringing down on himself the displeasure of the immediate  leadership apparatus and the president himself. If he is too  cautious--the example of his predecessor also rings clear. In  general, as the representative of the president attests, he  clearly recognizes this situation of being between the hammer  and the anvil, and treats it calmly. Yevtushenko is convinced  that there are no poor decisions of the president, inasmuch as  they are based only on the Constitution, but there are poor  local authorities who execute them poorly for various reasons.  Well, it is a novel idea.    However, a certain continuity is still seen. Kondrat  Mikhaylovich began his contact with this journalist with a  request that the article be submitted to him for approval.  Desyatov also always started this way...</p>

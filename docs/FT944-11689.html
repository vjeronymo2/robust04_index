			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: Greyhound faces bankruptcy Greyhound Lines, the struggling US long-distance bus operator, was yesterday facing the threat of financial collapse following a decision by some of its creditors to file an involuntary bankruptcy petition against the company. A group claiming to represent 25 per cent of Greyhound's convertible debenture holders filed the petition in a Dallas federal bankruptcy court on Wednesday, after refusing to accept the terms of an out-of-court restructuring proposed by Greyhound management. Greyhound has 20 days in which to respond to the petition. The court will then weigh up the two parties' representations and decide whether to declare the company bankrupt. Greyhound enjoys near-legendary status as the only nationwide provider of long-distance bus services in the US, but it has been brought to its knees by a combination of low domestic air fares, high levels of car ownership, tough competition from regional bus operators, and internal management errors. Greyhound has missed a Dollars 4.2m debt payment due to the convertible debenture holders on September 30, and the 30-day grace period on the payment expired on October 31, so opening the door to a bankruptcy petition. Yesterday, Mr Wilbur Ross of Rothschild, Greyhound's merchant bank adviser, said that Greyhound regarded the petition as a negotiating tactic on the part of the bondholders and would vigorously oppose it.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Far-reaching changes for land reforms and the  lifting of tax on basic foodstuff are proposed in the ANC's  agricultural policy document released today. The ANC says that  a law on the restoration of land will be tabled in parliament as  soon as possible. A land claims court will soon begin with its  hearing on land claims.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Andre Scheepers] This court  will be managed on the same basis as a supreme court. Claims  being considered include cases where people were forced from  their land or where they lost land according to the old  apartheid laws. Utilization of unused state land will also be  looked at. The court is only seen as an interim measure, and  approximately 1 million people will be involved in this. Claims  that will not be considered are any claims before 19 June 1913  and where land was legally confiscated. Claims not made within  a certain period, to be stipulated by the president, will also  not be considered. The issue of compensation could be a hotly  disputed one.    [ANC spokesperson Aninka Claassens, in English] In  situations  where people bought the land from which people...[pauses] black  people had been removed, they often bought it at subsidized  rates in terms of the Agricultural Credits Act, so they paid  less than market value. Now what the constitution provides is  that compensation will be determined according to various  criteria, including market value, including the history of the  acquisition and including the use to which the land is being  put, so in a situation where farmers may have got land from  which black people were removed, at less than market value, they  won't get market value because if they did what you'd have is a  situation where they profit twice from what happened under  apartheid.    [Scheepers] This agricultural policy is chiefly aimed at  uplifting the approximately 16 million people in rural areas.  The ANC says direct intervention in markets will improve and  stabilize the buying power of South Africans. Among the aims:  To take steps to make food affordable, the lifting of VAT  [Value-Added Tax] on basic foods, increased VAT on luxury goods,  investment in labor-intensive agricultural sectors, as well as  in infrastructural projects such as the building of roads and  irrigation schemes. Credit will be given to black farmers to  enable them to obtain land. In this regard the Land Bank and  other agricultural institutions will be considered. Although  the ANC is in favor of deregulation the state will intervene in  certain cases. Support services, research, and consumer  protection services will be supplied. Environmental protection  is also high on the list. There is also additional food  subsidies, and in this regard the ANC aims at removing the  remaining statutory powers of the agricultural councils. Land  tax is also an issue to be considered.    [ANC spokesman Derek Hanekom, in English] We do believe it  could be a very useful policy instrument to stimulate the land  market. It is used successfully in some countries in the world.  We have discussed this with the South African Agricultural  Union and provided them with several good arguments as to the  desirability of a land tax. We would say that it has the good  effect of bringing land into production. Those people who are  unable to use their land properly, or fully, would be encouraged  to either use it more fully or to sell off or lease off the  parts of their land which they are presently not using. So we  believe that it would have the dual effect of getting land onto  the market as part of the land reform program, as well as  stimulating greater productive use of land. [end recording]</p>

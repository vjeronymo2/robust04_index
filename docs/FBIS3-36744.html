			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallin, Feb 08 (BNS) -- Russian naval ships on Jan.  26 carried 48 seamines of newer types from the island of  Naissaar in the Bay of Tallinn to the Russian navy's Lomonosov  base in the Leningrad region.    According to information obtained by BNS, there are no more  newer-type seamines in the Naissaar base. Russia now continues  destroying its supply of older types of mines by burining them  on the island. The Naissaar base as recently as Dec. 1, 1993  was reported to have a stock of some 1,280 seamines, including  80 of the newer types.    Estonian authorities until now don't know the exact number  of  Russian military staying in the country. Sources in the Central  Staff of the Estonian defense forces said different estimates  put the number at 2,700-3,000.    There has been no remarkable movement of Russian military  from the country in January, neither have any major changes  taken place in the structure of the Russian units still  stationed in Estonia. Some technical equipment, however, has  been taken out, officials said.    Russia's chief negotiator for talks with Estonia, Vasili  Svirin, in early December said his country had about  2,600-strong military presence in Estonia.    Reports by the 2nd department of the Estonian Central Staff  say Russian naval forces account for about 1,100-1,200 of the  remaining troops. About 300-400 are still present in different  kinds of auxiliary units and supply depots. Some 500 Russian  officers and noncommissioned officers whose units have left the  Estonian territory are also staying in the country.    Russian units of any remarkable size are stationed only in  Tallinn and the surrounding Harju region.</p>

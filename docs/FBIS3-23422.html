			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Commissioner of Police M.B. Kaushal chose to  describe the four Pakistanis, charged under TADA [Terrorism and  Disruptive Activites Prevention Act] along with two others, as  highly trained and battle-hardened men who were well-versed in  guerilla warfare and the use of rockets and artillery guns  (courtesy the Afghan war).    Khalid Pahelwan one of the four Pakistanis, is rated high in  the Lahore-based outfit Islami Inquilabi Mahaz (IIM) for  successfully participating in an armed attack on an Indian Army  post at Mendhar in Poonch district early last year.    Three others from IIM are believed to have entered India.  Kaushal named them as Basharat, IIM finance secretary, Nadeem  and Mohammed Farooq. It is believed Basharat and Nadeem are  currently in Nepal. There is no trace of Farooq who was supposed  to enter India from Bangladesh.    IIM is headed by Imtiaz Ahmed Shami, a terrorist who has  also  seen action in Afghanistan and worked with Palestine Liberation  Organisation (PLO). This group was sent to India by retired  Pakistan army major Ehsan-ul-Haq who owns a knitwear company in  Lahore.    Kaushal said incriminating documents, some 16 kg of high  explosives, seven electric detonators, two hand grenades, a  fuse, two Pakistani passports, identification cards of health  clubs in Delhi, diaries containing addresses and telephone  numbers of various people in Pakistan, West Asia and United  Kingdom were recovered from one of the hideouts in Dayalpura in  the Gokulpuri area.    The raid on the second hideout in Khureji -- from where  Taimur Ali and the Bangladeshi Mohammed Raeef were nabbed -- led  to the seizure of eight floppies.    The documents were in compressed mode and had to be inflated  before reading.    The notes appeared to be taken from expert handbooks on  improvised explosive devices and delivered to Pakistan for use  in the Afghanistan war.    The floppies contained material which, when printed, ran  over  200 pages. It was all about the manufacture of disposable  silencers, incendiary brick and torch, auto disablement, delay  mechanism, various types of shaped charges, explosives from  locally available material, the secret science of convert inks  and easy production of poison.    The Khureji hideout, from where a large quantity of  chemicals  was recovered, was being used as a laboratory for manufacturing  explosive devices.    According to Kaushal, the interrogation of the six revealed  they had been told to establish bases in different metropolitan  towns of India and then strike mainly with explosives on railway  tracks, stations, bus stands, telephone lines, government and  commercial buildings.    They even intended to poison wells to create panic and  cripple the economy by damaging the transport and communication  system.    They had been instructed to acquire Indian identities and  merge with locals, Kaushal said.    Diaries recovered from their hideouts revealed they were  learning Hindi.    Kaushal said Pakistan's ISI [Interservices Intelligence] was  using Nepal and Bangladesh to launch subversive activities in  India and was also diverting the help it obtained during the  Afghan war. There had been as many as sixty explosions in the  country after the demolition of the disputed Ayodhya structure,  he said.</p>

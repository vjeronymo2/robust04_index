			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish at 2311 GMT on 26 May </F> transmits a service message killing this item]    [Text] Caracas, 26 May (PL) -- Former Venezuelan President  Carlos Andres Perez was expelled today by the Democratic Action  Party (AD) in what is considered a blow more severe for the  former president than his own incarceration.    The National Directorate Council (CDN) of the social  democratic organization of which Perez is one of the founding  leaders made the decision in a meeting that began with violent  incidents in which one participant was injured.    The party organization, comprised of 289 members and  delegates, thus ratified a statement issued and adopted by the  National Executive Council [CEN] on 19 May, a day after Perez'  incarceration. He is charged with misappropriation and  embezzlement of secret funds in 1989.    In statements to the media prior to the session, the former  president, one of AD's founding leaders, attributed his  expulsion to a minority of party leaders and asserted: "No one  will be able to expel me from AD members' hearts."    When the forum began, a group comprised primarily of young  leaders who support the former president angrily protested the  exclusion of one of their members from the list of CDN  participants. This resulted in a squabble during which chairs  were thrown.    The proposal was presented by Secretary General Luis Alfaro  Ucero, who controls the party machinery, and it was opposed by  the members of the so-called renewal groups within the  organization, led by former presidential candidate Claudio  Fermin.    Spokesmen of that faction insist that the rank and file do  not support the measure, adding that this goes beyond the "Perez  case" because Alfaro Ucero's actions are directed against  Fermin's plans to run for secretary general. This would pave  the way within the organization for leaders shaped by the former  president. These people demand that the party's internal  elections, scheduled for November, be held immediately.</p>

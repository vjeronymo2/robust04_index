			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: Gilts rally sharply on rise in UK base rates Most of the action in the European government bond markets took place in the UK, where gilts were whipped around by political worries and an interest rate increase by the Bank of England. Gilt prices fell  1/2 point at the opening on the government's parliamentary defeat over increasing VAT on domestic fuel. However, they rallied sharply on the Bank of England's unexpectedly early announcement that it was raising its minimum lending rate by  1/2 percentage point to 6 1/4 per cent, nipping rate-rise speculation in the bud. This supported the auction of 10-year gilts, which was in full swing when the rate rise was announced, and dealers reported good retail interest in the issue. Although weakness in the US Treasury market depressed gilts in the afternoon, they ended the day in positive territory, with the March long gilt futures contract on Liffe up  5/16 at 101 25/32 . Before the rate rise, the sharp fall in gilt prices caused their yield spread over German bunds to widen as far as 150 basis points but the rally which followed the tightening pushed it back to 134 basis points at the close. 'The general reaction to the move was favourable, and people were especially impressed with the speed with which it was done,' said Mr Adrian James, bond strategist at NatWest Markets. Some traders complained that the base rate increase - announced only some 20 minutes before the deadline for auction bids - left them little time to formulate their bids. However, 'it was probably the best they could do under the circumstances', said one dealer. 'If the Bank had waited, it would have run the risk of not getting enough bids in.' The bid-to-cover ratio for the Bank's Pounds 2bn of 8.5 per cent gilts due 2005 - next year's 10-year benchmark - was a respectable 1.34. Allotment at the lowest accepted price of 98 13/16 , where the bonds yield 8.66 per cent, was 98 per cent. The average accepted price was 98 15/16 with a yield of 8.64 per cent, giving a tail - the difference between the highest accepted yield and the average accepted yield - of two basis points. German bonds ended slightly lower, in sympathy with the US market. The March bund futures contract on DTB fell by 0.21 to 90.84. Dealers will focus today on third-quarter gross domestic product and November jobs data. The Bundesbank council is expected to leave interest rates unchanged. US Treasury prices fell from Tuesday's highs yesterday after the chairman of the Federal Reserve said he continued to be concerned about inflationary pressures in the economy. Late in the session the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 7/16 at 95 15/32 yielding 7.890 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was up  1/32 at 99 19/32 , yielding 7.456 per cent. In Congressional testimony, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said that he expected producers to begin to try and pass on increased raw material costs to consumers. He also said that the Federal Reserve's six interest rate increases this year were made in an effort 'to forestall a new round of higher inflation and inflation expectations'. Investors appear to have taken the Fed at its word about its promises to hold the line against inflation. This sentiment has caused the market to see-saw this month as investors alternated between optimism that full-scale inflation will not be allowed to occur and pessimism that another rate increase could cause more price instability. Also affecting the market yesterday was the announcement late on Tuesday that Orange County, California, filed for bankruptcy protection after posting a Dollars 1.5bn loss in its investment portfolio. Two-year bonds held relatively strong in spite of Mr Greenspan's comments as investors pulled money from municipal bonds and put it into short-term Treasuries. Early falling prices in the muni bond market pushed yields up about 15 basis points.</p>

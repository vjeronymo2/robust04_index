			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku (April 6) TURAN--"The aim of my visit to Baku  remains unchanged: to work on an agreement proposal concerning  the resolution to the conflict", said Vladimir Kazimirov,  special representative to the Russian President on  Nagorno-Karabakh, during his arrival to the Azerbaijani capital  during an interview with a TURAN correspondent.    According to Kazimirov the peacemaking mission will attempt  to clarify positions regarding the Russian peace plan.  Kazimirov noted that because of poor weather he could not  arrive in Khankendi [Stepanakert] during his past visit. "The  short meeting with several leaders of Nagorno-Karabakh was held  half way between Yerevan and Stepanakert, somewhere on the  border of Azerbaijan", said Kazimirov.    "The peacemaking and mediation missions must be conducted  stage by stage, neither side wants its concessions to be  announced publicly prematurely, and there has been no concession  from the opposite side. That is why we should not hurry," said  Kazimirov.    As has been earlier announced, Kazimirov arrived in Baku a  week ago accompanied by members of the CIS Interparliamentary  delegation in order to introduce the peace plan prepared by  Russia and presented to the Azeri and Armenian sides. The major  points of the plan provide for a cease-fire, the withdrawal from  all occupied territories and a revision of the status of  Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>

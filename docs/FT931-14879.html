			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Pirelli sells property in Milan PIRELLI, the lossmaking Italian tyres and cables group, has taken a further step in its financial recovery with the sale of a large part of its property interests. The company has raised over L190bn (Dollars 138m) by disposing of much of the land in its Tecnocity property development project. The sale should realise an extraordinary gain of around L80bn in the 1992 accounts. Tecnocity, also known as Bicocca, involves derelict land next to one of Pirelli's manufacturing and office complexes on the outskirts of Milan. The plant, still occupied in making cables, used to be one of Pirelli's biggest manufacturing sites before production was shifted to more modern facilities. Pirelli said the extraordinary gain would in part be set off against unspecified extraordinary losses or other negative items in its 1992 accounts. The group has been involved in a big restructuring programme, with substantial job losses and some plant closures. The Tecnocity site, which won outline planning approval late last year after lengthy bureaucratic delays, has been split into 11 lots. Each will be developed by a separate company. Milano Centrale Immobiliare, a property development group associated with Pirelli, will have an average 26 per cent stake in each. Milan Centrale Immobiliare, which recently established a closer relationship with Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, the UK property consulting group, is owned by Pirelli &amp; C, the ultimate holding company for Pirelli. No financial projections have been revealed for the Tecnocity scheme.</p>

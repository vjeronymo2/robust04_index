			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Weak Bone Structure--The Greens Are </F> Planning for Coalition With the SPD"]    [Text] The Greens are preparing for an emergency, i.e.  taking part in the government. As soon as the rank-and-file have  decided Werner Schulz, the leader of the Alliance 90/Greens  Bundestag caucus, would like to invite the most promising of the  Bundestag election candidates to a meeting in Bonn at which a  frank debate will be held on division of labor and personal  ambitions.    Joschka Fischer who by now is the party's undisputed Number  One has also gotten used to the idea that it will share power.  Looking ahead to the 16 October election date, he would like to  have a clear picture of who the members of the Alliance/Greens  new Bundestag caucus are. Quite a few candidates have already  told him they would like to be considered for high offices.    Some minor details are still missing, however: a mandate  from  the voters and a coalition partner. The wished-for partner being  the Social Democratic Party (SPD).    But before that the "realos" of Fischer's ilk must get over  their defeat at the Mannheim party congress week before last  where the left wing of the party came out on top, calling for a  halt to nuclear energy within two years and a world sans NATO  and sans Bundeswehr: a Green antigovernment program, though not  a binding commitment.    The established political parties gratefully picked up on  the  ancient slogans of the Greens, characterizing the utopians as  being incapable of governing or even of taking part in political  life. "People know that our party congresses always are a trifle  gaga," Antje Vollmer says. "But different standards are applied  once you start talking government."    The unhappy losers now fear that events at the party  congress  may present SPD Minister-President Gerhard Schroeder with an  absolute majority at the election in Lower Saxony on 13 March.  Which would spell the end of the red-and-green coalition there  and represent a setback for the party's high hopes [for the  national election later this year].    The entire spectrum of the party, including the left wing,  agrees that the Greens should help remove Helmut Kohl from  office. The left wing, too, is already looking forward to  sharing power. "That is for sure," says Ludger Volmer, the left  wing's spokesman. "Everything is negotiable."    But the doubts about the party's capacity to govern have by  no means been overcome. "catastrophism, actionism and moralism"  still are part and parcel of the Greens' ideological baggage,  Bremen sociologist Claus Offe says. "A weak bone structure" he  calls it.    Fischer is calling for a strong dose of optimism  nonetheless.  He has already collected "a team of 20 people" which is to  safeguard power in Bonn. He is bringing a reliable group of  people from his Hesse Environmental Ministry along, from the  state secretary on down. A reserve contingent stands ready,  drawn from subordinate agencies.    Former GDR civil rights leader Schulz who, as he himself  says, is "slowly getting his feet on the ground in Bonn" is also  making plans "just in case." He is recruiting experts from  eastern Germany and elsewhere. He has also gotten economists  such as Bremen academic Rudolf Hickel who has regularly  published alternative studies on the economic situation "to sign  up."    In the fall, the Greens will no longer be satisfied with the  Environment and Women's Affairs Ministries. Joachim Raschke, a  Hamburg political scientist, has already drawn up bolder  scenarios for expanding power.    New Concept Strategy: A Ministry for Multicultural  Affairs would assume responsibilities presently assigned to the  Federal Government's powerless foreign nationals commissioner.  Additional responsibilities presently vested in the Interior  Ministry would be required to process requests for information,  for a say and overall control in foreigners' affairs.    Extension Strategy: A strong ministry which might  set ecology policy could be established by clustering  responsibilities for the environment and transportation. An  effective Women's Affairs Ministry would have to include  additional responsibilities presently assigned to the Family,  Social and/or Health Ministries.    Me-Too Strategy: Why shouldn't the junior partner  in a coalition with the SPD lay claim to one of the classic  ministries? After all, the Free Democrats (FDP) traditionally  asked for and got the Foreign Ministry as well as either the  Interior or Justice Ministries. The Ministry for Development Aid  could be a "lateral entry" vehicle into the foreign policy field.    The Green chiefs just love visions of this kind: "We don't  intend to sell ourselves at a lower price than the FDP," says  party spokesman Volmer.    Experts from peace research institutes as well as the  Bundeswehr academy have been asked by the Green party leaders to  draft proposals on what a Green foreign policy might look like.  For his part, Fischer is working out proposals on his own.  Though he does not like to fly he does spend every free minute  at his computer to get a book on foreign policy published in  time for the election--as proof of his knowledge and insights.    Big power or peace policy--that is the alternative as  Fischer  sees it. He does not shy away from a comparison with Klaus  Kinkel, the current foreign minister. "What he can do," says  prospective lateral entrant Fischer, "I can do anytime."    Party spokesman Volmer believes that the move into the  foreign policy field is the correct one. In this connection, he  is looking for a "new definition" of development aid. He would  like like to see some of the responsibilities of the Finance and  Economics Ministry transferred [to the Foreign Ministry] to  enhance its status. Volmer says that "the position the FRG takes  on the IMF is more important than a few millions in the budget."    Antje Vollmer's pet project is to have a member of the  Greens  become interior minister. She already made this suggestion  during the red/green coalition negotiations both in Bremen and  in Brandenburg--but without success. She feels that the Greens,  acting as protectors of the constitution, should defend  democratic practices and the rule of law, carry out a  multicultural policy toward foreigners and assume the classical  heritage of the FDP.    Not even adviser Raschke can seriously visualize a Green  assuming any of these posts. The Interior and Foreign Ministries  in particular, he says, are charged "to a great extent with  responsibilities for repression and coercion" and this, in  itself, would result in "sharp intra-party conflicts" with the  rank-and-file.    Rather than the Interior Ministry, the party should take  over  the Justice portfolio, Raschke suggests. The latter post would  enable the party to push for liberal judicial policy as well as  "citizen-sponsored traditions." At this stage, even some former  opponents deplore the fact that Otto Schily left the Green fold  to join the SPD, since they no longer have an ideal candidate  like him.    If and when the Greens make plans to enter the government,  they are thinking almost without exception of a coalition with  the social democrats which is a project promising of success,  according to opinion polls. But if the outcome of the 16 October  [Bundestag] vote only allows for a tripartite coalition which  includes the FDP, the Greens would have to review the bidding.    But Raschke is optimistic even if things turn out worse than  expected. In that case, the FDP would have to get industry and  the business community to guarantee ecological reforms. A  combination which includes the SPD, the Greens, and the FDP  would at least bring about "a liberal tinge in political life,"  he says.    But that would only be a political option, party spokesman  Volmer says, "if the country would otherwise turn into chaos."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Vladimir </F> Taranov and Boris Krivoshey]    [Text] Moscow, 7 Apr -- The Russian State Customs Committee  has exempted from duty deliveries of 2,000 tonnes of seed grain  purchased with U.S. government funds and being sent from Russia  to Armenia. By forgoing customs duties to the value of  $750,000, Russia has thus participated in a joint humanitarian  act with the United States. This was stated at a briefing today  by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the press and information  department of the Russian Foreign Ministry.    The Russian diplomat noted that there is some perplexity  over  claims by some mass media analysts that Russia intends to  prevent the passage to Armenia of humanitarian grain in order to  put political pressure on Yerevan and Washington.</p>

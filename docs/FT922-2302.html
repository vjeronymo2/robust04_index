			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME zinc price fall accelerates THE FALL in zinc prices triggered by the London Metal Exchange's move on Monday to ease a market squeeze accelerated yesterday, and traders and analysts expect further losses in coming weeks, writes Our Commodities Staff. After watching the cash premium over three months metal climb from zero to nearly Dollars 190 a tonne in two-and-a-half months the exchange stepped in to establish maximum daily premiums for the June/July period, ranging from Dollars 15 to Dollars 5 a tonne. A cash premium is normally associated with supply tightness, but the recent widening of the price gap has been coincided with a rapid build up in the exchange's warehouse stocks to a record level. The immediate response to the LME's action on Monday was a Dollars 24 fall in the cash price and a narrowing of the 'backwardation', as the cash premium is known, to Dollars 166 a tonne. Yesterday the cash price lost another Dollars 56 at Dollars 1,367.50 a tonne and the backwardation shrank further to Dollars 136.25. 'We're seeing signs of liquidation - it (the three months price) has gone through the Dollars 1,250 support without too much difficulty,' commented independent metals analyst Mr Robin Bhar. 'When you are a manufacturer it is difficult to appreciate what seems to be a game, and a highly expensive one at that,' one producer said.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (As at Monday's close) tonnes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Aluminium  +8,525 to 1,269,525 Copper       -575 to   262,775 Lead         -200 to   136,675 Nickel       -270 to    29,136 Zinc      +16,625 to   293,925 Tin          +435 to    12,980  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

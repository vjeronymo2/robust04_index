			<p>BFN     [Text] A meeting between officers of Rwandan Patriotic Army  [RPA] and Rwandan Government Forces [RGF] scheduled to take  place today has begun at 1025 in Hotel Amohoro in Kigali. The  Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] [as heard] delegation was headed  by Colonel Frank Mugambage and that of government forces by Col.  Marcel Gatsinzi. The meeting of RPA and RGF will be in camera.    The meeting for today will be a continuation of the Monday  [30 May] meeting which was adjourned to resume today. In the  Monday meeting, the delegation of RPF was also headed by Col.  Frank Mugambage and that of government forces by Col. Gatsinzi.  The purpose of these meetings of RPA soldiers and RGF soldiers  is to negotiate so as to allow humanitarian assistance to reach  civilians.    In the Monday meeting, RPF had presented a document  containing conditions which will act as a prerequisite for any  form of negotiation and, later on, a cease-fire: to stop  massacres in government-controlled zones, that is the first  point; two, the release of hostages trapped and caught up in the  city center under the control of government soldiers; three, to  ban any radio programs that incites execration [as heard] on  Radio-Television Libre des Milles Collines and Radio Kigali.  The Monday meeting ended without agreement on any form of a  peaceful settlement. However, they agreed to meet again today,  Thursday. The first condition given by the RPF to stop the  massacres by the government has not yet been adhered to, the  recent example -- 500 people killed in Kabwai -- going without  saying.</p>

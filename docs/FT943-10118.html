			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Mediterranean Property: a Two-Part Series - The rocky path to your dream villa - Holiday Homes / Gerald Cadogan weighs up the pros and cons Why not turn the Mediterranean holiday into something permanent? It becomes a big temptation when the fifth carafe arrives at four in the afternoon. 'We could buy a place out here.' Think many times before you even decide to look. Do you really want the burden of another home a long way from the UK? How would it affect your life? Can you afford it? Can you find someone to look after it, or to manage the letting, when you are away? If the answers are yes, then review the special difficulties of life in the Med. Can you cope with the toughness which seems to grow out of the rocks, thorny scrub and parching winds? Tourists may not notice it. But if you live there, it is bound to hit you. What sort of trouble arises? A dispute over boundaries, mysterious happenings to the water supply, or nasty rumours in the village; how convenient to blame a foreigner. If you are still game, take lots of holidays to find out where you want to be and in what type of home: a flat in Nice or a luxury villa, a farmhouse to convert, or one already converted? How close must you be to the sea, the motorway or an airport? For how many months are there cheap flights home? And, not least, where is the nearest emergency hospital? (Gashing myself last week in Crete, I visited three casualty units in three days. All were quick and effective, but it may have helped that I spoke Greek.) To enjoy the Mediterranean do not be a chauvinistic expatriate. Make the effort to learn the language and the way of life. The house hunt becomes much easier when you can pick up what is not said as well as what is said. Become friends also with the village mayor, or someone in the mayor's office. He eases hassles, and can put in a word to the right official when you want a building permit. Throughout the Mediterranean knowing the right person is vital. Do not take part in village quarrels or politics. This could rebound on you if the other side wins the next election. The truly fluent may find a house on their own or through friends, but most people need an agency. If it is not a well-known name, ask how long it has been in business, what it has bought or sold and what lawyers it uses. 'How is the water supply?' must be one of the first questions. Water is always chancy in the Mediterranean and, if you are uncertain, it is better not to buy. With a public supply, ask if it has been cut off in recent summers. That will mean buying buckets for the loo. If it is a well, does it run dry? Is there enough water for a swimming pool? That matters most when you are inland. 'You can't let a house without one,' says David Rosslyn-Smith of French property agent Sifex. If you want to put a pool in, check that you will get planning permission before you buy. To avoid trouble, or even litigation, be certain where the property boundaries are and let your potential neighbours see that you know. Inquire about new roads, sewage works and other projects. The EU has been pouring money into Mediterranean infrastructure schemes.</p>

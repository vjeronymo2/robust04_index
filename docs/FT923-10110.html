			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Testimony damages Collor BRAZILIAN President Fernando Collor came closer to impeachment yesterday over charges that he received money obtained illicitly by businessman Paulo Cesar Farias. The claim of Mr Claudio Vieira, a former Collor aide, that the money came from a Dollars 5m loan raised in Uruguay in 1989, was undermined again yesterday by testimony to the Congressional Inquiry (CPI) into Mr Farias. The secretary of a Sao Paulo businessman confirmed in detail that the loan was fabricated and that she had typed the documents last week. Mr Vieira claimed that he had lent 7kg of gold purchased with the loan, to Mr Farias who had then deposited the money into the account of Mr Collor's wife when she needed clothes. He admitted he had no idea how the money had entered the country or how the loan would be paid back. The CPI is due to end next weekwhen an impeachment process is expected to begin.</p>

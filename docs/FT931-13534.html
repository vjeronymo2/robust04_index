			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Contract for Greek power plant DEH, Greece's public power corporation, has awarded a Dr82bn (Pounds 256.5m) contract to build a lignite-fired power plant in northern Greece to an international consortium led by Ansaldo, the Italian engineering company. Ansaldo's bid for the turnkey project was considerably lower than the Dr105bn offer submitted by GEC-Alsthom, the Anglo-French group. It was also below DEH's own estimate of around Dr89bn. The project will be financed through funds from the public investment budget, and some foreign borrowing. It is likely to be the last Greek power station financed by DEH, a state-owned enterprise burdened with some Dollars 2.5bn in foreign currency debts. Other power projects currently being negotiated are to be carried out under a build-own-operate-transfer (Boot) system, which the government is keen to develop. The other members of the Ansaldo consortium are Waagner Biro of Austria and Aegek, a Greek engineering company. A third bid from a Russian-Serbian consortium was not opened because of a United Nations embargo on doing business with Serbia, the official said.</p>

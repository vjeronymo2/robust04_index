Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet was accompanied by Norodum Sirivut,  Cambodian deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs  and international cooperation. Acting King Chea Sim cordially  received Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and his entourage. He  expressed his gratitude to the Vietnamese Government for its  constant efforts to help bring about peace in Cambodia. He was  convinced that this historic visit by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet  will contribute to strengthening the friendship between Vietnam  and Cambodia a step further. He briefed Prime Minister Vo Van  Kiet on the current situation in Cambodia and informed him that  King Norodom Sihanouk's health condition was good and that the  King would return to Cambodia on 8 April.    Speaking on this occasion, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet  thanked  the Cambodian leaders for having accorded the Vietnamese  Government delegation a warm welcome. He assured His Excellency  Chea Sim of the desire and persistent efforts of the Vietnamese  Government and people to do all they can to preserve and promote  friendship, cooperation, and good neighborliness with the  Kingdom of Cambodia. He expressed his belief that with the  goodwill and efforts of both sides, these ties will continue to  be consolidated and developed with each passing day.    Afterward, at 0900, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and First  Prime Minister Ranariddh and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen  signed the Vienamese-Cambodian joint communique on the  conclusion of the visit to the Kingdom of Cambodia by Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet. The signing ceremony was held at Chamka  Mon Palace.    Next, Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and  Norodom  Sirivut, Cambodian deputy prime minister and minister of foreign  affairs and international cooperation, signed the agreements on  cultural, educational, training, and scientific-technological  cooperation as well as on the establishment of a joint economic,  cultural, and scientific-technological cooperation committee.  Vietnamese Trade Minister Le Van Triet and Cambodian Commerce  Minister Va Huot signed the agreements on economic and trade  cooperation and on goods transit between the two countries.    Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and the comrades accompanying him  left Phnom Penh for home this morning. Seeing the Vietnamese  delegation off at Pochentong International Airport were First  Minister Samdech Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, Second Prime  Minister Hun Sen, and many other high-ranking Cambodian  Government officials. Also on hand to bid farewell to Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet and his entourage were members of the  diplomatic corps, representatives of international organizations  in Phnom Penh, and members of the Vietnamese Embassy in Cambodia.    Prime Minister Ranariddh and Prime Minister Hun Sen invited  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet to step on a red-carpeted honorary  stand as a military band played the national anthems of Cambodia  and Vietnam. Next, the two Cambodian prime ministers accompanied  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet as the latter reviewed the guard of  honor and bade farewell to Cambodian and foreign officials. The  special plane carrying Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and the  comrades accompanying him took off at 1000 sharp.    Twenty-four hours is too short for an official friendship  visit. Yet, thanks to the positive efforts of both sides, this  visit brought about fine results and opened a new step in the  development of relations between Vietnam and Cambodia.</p>

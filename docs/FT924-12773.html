			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Letter: Economics not enough - social vision needed Sir, The British economy lies in ruins. Successive governments have served The Market, now revealed as the siren that has lured us on to the rocks. The logic of economics has manifestly failed to meet the needs of British people. Markets destroy what is not immediately profitable and hence offer us no future. An alternative vision would seek to maintain our industrial base irrespective of short-term profit and would serve the people instead of sacrificing them to obsessions. Exploiting our common wealth requires a common purpose. Understanding how society works is outside the province of economics, subservient to market rationality. For this reason economics is unable to offer remedies for the problems we now face. Britain PLC needs a social vision.

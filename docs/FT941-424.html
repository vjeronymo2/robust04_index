			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Arts: Rich with contrasts - Theatre For the first time, I am in love.' Helen Mirren, playing Natalia Petrovna, wife and mother caught between youth and middle age, is alone onstage. She has fallen for Beliaev, her son's tutor, and she speaks these lines in a daze of wondering gratitude, and through a mist of tears. In the next second she turns brisk, her voice hardens, she adds 'He's got to go' - and the whole theatre bursts into laughter. With this split-second change of tone Mirren catches the self-contradictory essence of Natalia Petrovna, the heroine of Turgenev's only play; and in this extended scene alone, full of such sudden contrasts, she shows many more facets of this one woman. Amid a comedy of conflicting desires, Natalia is forever dramatising herself. This makes her both touching and absurd. And yet, like a Marivaux heroine, she also manipulates the lives of people in her power, more or less heartlessly. Mirren shows all this, and with absolutely no grande dame airs or bids for our sympathy. Wonderful to have Mirren in the West End again, and to watch her in a role worthy of her calibre. (Her only serious miscalculation is a dragged-out final exit, and a light dismissal of her long-trusted admirer Rakitin that is even lighter than Turgenev can have intended.) The great risk she takes is to emphasise Natalia's self-dramatising capriciousness even more than her sincerity. We believe that she has fallen for young Beliaev; but not always. When she says 'He's a real man,' we laugh; but we do not believe that she means it so much as the dramatic scene she is acting in her own head. In her big Act IV scene with him, she exposes her heart to him with beautiful simplicity, tells him to go - and then says 'Well, why aren't you going?' so sharply that we wonder how artless the previous speech really was. In short, we never quite know this Natalia; and that is her fascination. It is her fascination in particular for Rakitin, who is splendidly played by John Hurt. His lined face, practising hard to play WH Auden, is too old for the role (30 years of age, says Turgenev) but his spirit is Rakitin's to perfection. He watches Natalia rush off in Act II, and exclaims 'What vivacity]' so coolly that it sums up his impotent, sardonic character in a trice. Finally in Act V he warns Beliaev of the perils of total love, of 'how much torrid hatred lies behind love . . . and what it means to belong to a skirt'. Eighteen years ago in the same theatre, this speech was a high-water mark of Derek Jacobi's art. Jacobi spoke it with scorching bitterness; Hurt brings to it a vehemence that becomes so violent and red-faced that - very strikingly - he has to stop. He is suddenly embarrassed, and shrugs off his tirade as if it had no meaning. For Turgenev, Rakitin was something of a self-portrait for Turgenev; and the character's relationship with Natalia is something of a preparation for Trigorin and Arkadina in Chekhov's The Seagull. The director is Bill Bryden. He shows how Russian A Month in the Country is in the way its wealth of detail brings a whole milieu to life: the mother-in-law's painful feet, the companion who takes snuff, the nonsense words coined by the rich, dull, old neighbour. It is Shpigelsky, the doctor, who epitomises all this darling trivia, and who observes Natalia's household cannily. John Standing brings this role an ideal quality of wry relaxation; then suddenly at the end adds an astonishing dash of bitter Russian ennui. Polly Adams, as his no longer young intended, performs with wit - and with rather more charm than this frowsty spinster warrants. Joseph Fiennes brings the youthful, bashful, handsome Beliaev utterly to life; and as Vera - Natalia's ward, who also falls for him - Anna Livia Ryan catches very keenly the heartbreak and hardness of adolescence, and its rapid fluctuations between childishness and adulthood. As Natalia's husband Gawn Grainger misfires on several counts - too sensitive a type to be so blind to Natalia's real feelings, too urbane to be so thunderstruck. The production does not consistently catch Turgenev's beating heart, but it is fully alive to his endless ironies and touching surprises. At the Albery Theatre, WC2.</p>

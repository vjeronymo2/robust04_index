			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Malaysia backs new national airline MALAYSIA'S cabinet yesterday approved plans for a second national airline which will fly international routes, Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur. A privately owned domestic airline, Pelangi Air, will be restructured with a fresh injection of capital - mostly from state companies - to set up the new airline, Mr Ling was quoted as saying by the official Bernama news agency. Malaysian Airlines System (MAS), the state-owned national airline, will be part of the consortium that will capitalise and operate the new airline, he said. State-owned Hicom, a holding company for several big state manufacturing concerns, will be the biggest investor, with a 40 per cent stake in the airline. Mr Ling did not give details about the equity shares for the other partners in the consortium. Government officials have said previously that the new airline would mostly fly international routes, but would not compete directly with MAS. The Commonwealth Development Corporation, the UK's development finance institution, has obtained a loan of about Ecu200,000 (Pounds 151,500) from the EC as partial funding to enable John Laing International to carry out a feasibility study for the expansion of Noi Bai international airport, near Hanoi, Vietnam. The study is to cover the funding, design, construction and operation of a new terminal with an annual capacity of 5m passengers.</p>

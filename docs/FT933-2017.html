			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Profit rise at Trafford Park Pre-tax profits at Trafford Park Estates rose from Pounds 3.27m to Pounds 4.12m, in the year ended June 30 1993. Turnover however, fell from Pounds 11.7m to Pounds 10.2m mainly through the absence of property sales. Within that, rentals rose to Pounds 8.72m (Pounds 8.51m) despite the increase in vacant available letting space. A number of development opportunities were being pursued, principally using land already owned by the group. Earnings per share worked through at 4.34p (3.8p). The final dividend is 1.95p for a total of 2.8p (2.575p).</p>

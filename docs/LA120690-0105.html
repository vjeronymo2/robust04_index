			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: LA VERNE;  </P> <P> LITTLE SUPPORT FOR RAIL PLAN  </P> <P> The City Council on Monday showed little enthusiasm for building a rail station  in La Verne as part of the planned San Bernardino-to-Los Angeles commuter line.  </P> <P> The council voted 3 to 2 to allow Councilman Craig H. Walters to explore the  possibility if he wished, but it forbade city staff members to spend any time  on the project.  </P> <P> Mayor Jon Harry Blickenstaff and Mayor Pro Tem Thomas R. Harvey said it would  cost the city too much to build and maintain such a station.  </P> <P> However, council members Walters and Patrick J. Gatti stressed the importance  of accessible transportation.  </P> <P> Asst. City Manager Jeffry Allred said a station would not benefit the city's  budget and could hurt it by taking commercial land off the tax rolls. However,  he suggested that if the city decides it wants a station, officials could work  with neighboring San Dimas to find possible sites along Arrow Highway.  </P></p>

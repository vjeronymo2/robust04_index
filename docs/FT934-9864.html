			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Lenders 'must look at debtor problems': Mortgage sector warned on arrears MORTGAGE lenders should be more sensitive to other debt-related problems a borrower may face and should consider paying for advice from external agencies, says a report published today. It argues that a more relaxed approach among borrowers towards falling into arrears means lenders must change their practices to be effective. Interviews with members of 46 households in and around London revealed sharp differences from attitudes expressed in previous research. People in arrears were less likely to blame themselves rather than, for example, the government, and were more likely to become used to living with debts. Many of those questioned also felt that lenders' options were limited because of the state of the housing market and the extent of arrears. The London Research Centre, which carried out the study for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Building Societies' Trust, recommends that lenders should: Ensure that, where possible, borrowers deal with the same member of staff to improve the chances of establishing a good relationship. Assure borrowers that information they provide will not be used against them. Consider funding external advice agencies, which may be better placed to get a full picture of a borrower's circumstances. Involve both partners in a relationship in discussions about repayment. Give advice to young borrowers who have little experience of managing money. Provide more information about options available. Recognise that repaying arrears is not always the borrowers' first priority. Living with Mortgage Arrears. HMSO. Pounds 7.50.</p>

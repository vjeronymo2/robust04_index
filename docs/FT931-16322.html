			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / UK Company News: US buy helps Bespak rise 68% to Pounds 5.01m Expansion in the US reaped rich rewards for Bespak in the half year to October 30 as the specialist medical equipment manufacturer's pre-tax profits jumped by 68 per cent, from Pounds 2.98m to Pounds 5.01m. Turnover rose to Pounds 27.4m (Pounds 16.4m) of which Pounds 10.4m came from Tenax, the US medical components maker, which Bespak bought for Pounds 32.8m last March. The interim dividend is increased from 3.5p to 4p. Earnings per share improved from 11.1p to 13.2p, but were diluted by last year's Pounds 25.5m rights issue. Buying Tenax reduced the group's heavy reliance on its business with Glaxo - Bespak makes the aerosol valves in inhalers used to project anti-asthma drugs such as Ventolin - which accounted for 39 per cent of sales in 1991 but only 25 per cent last year. Mr Alun Wicks, finance director, said the group's absorption of Tenax was nearly complete and its performance was boosted by demand, growing by about 20 per cent a year, for components used in the burgeoning minimal invasive surgery market.</p>

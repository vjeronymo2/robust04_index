			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Technology: Microsoft polishes its 'Windows' A number of enhancements to 'Windows', Microsoft's best-selling PC operating environment, are on the horizon. The next technology will be Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) Version 2 - which will be shipped in the coming months as part of products such as Microsoft Publisher. The idea behind OLE is that all types of information can be treated as 'objects' that can be copied, moved or manipulated within any Windows application program. Object types include text, graphics, animation sequences, short film clips, voice messages and spreadsheet models. OLE will provide flexibility to PC users who are familiar with the options on all of the applications programs at their disposal. Yet it threatens to plunge less-experienced users into unfamiliar territory without obvious means of escape, creating potential support problems. Merging MS-Dos and Windows as a single PC operating system will result in a program called Chicago. It will feature 'pre-emptive multitasking' meaning that several functions can be carried out simultaneously. Microsoft is pinning a great deal of hope on Chicago, which is scheduled for introduction in about 12 months. 'Chicago will be the most popular systems update we have ever put out,' Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman, said. By the time Chicago is shipped, Microsoft expects that there will be 50m copies of Windows sold - and Gates says that if Chicago does not generate at least Dollars 500m (Pounds 338m) in sales during its first year he will be disappointed. Due in about 18 months, Cairo is the ultimate version of Windows. It will 'learn' how each user works, enabling them to customise the way they organise and find information on their computer.</p>

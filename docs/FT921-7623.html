			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / International Company News: Daimler Benz makes steady progress DAIMLER BENZ, Germany's largest industrial company, boosted total sales by 11 per cent to DM94.66bn last year and said net profits for 1991 would be higher than 1990's DM1.79bn (Dollars 1.08bn). The profit increase will be achieved after undisclosed but substantial restructuring costs associated with the company's decision to close down the AEG Olympia typewriter and office equipment market in Wilhelmshaven with the loss of 1,300 jobs. The increase was not unexpected but the announcement yesterday was taken by analysts as confirmation that 1991 will prove to be a turning point for the group and its chairman, Mr Edzard Reuter (pictured above), after four years in which earnings dropped by one-third despite an ambitious acquisitions programme. The impetus for the growth last year came from what the company called an 'extraordinary boom' in its domestic German market, with a 25 per cent rise in new car sales at the Mercedes Benz automobile subsidiary and a 30 per cent increase in commercial vehicle sales, reflecting buoyant demand from the eastern part of Germany. Demand overseas was weak with sales falling 3 per cent in other European Community countries and by 25 per cent in the US. Mercedes Benz reported sales for the whole of 1991 up 12 per cent to DM66.71bn.</p>

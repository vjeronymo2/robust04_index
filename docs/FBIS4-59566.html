			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special to the JORDAN TIMES" by Rana Husayni] </F>   [Text] Amman--Britain did not take part in the U.S.-led  blockade of al-'Aqabah and had always urged its allies to end  the inspection of ships in the Gulf of Aqaba, James Watt, the  charge d'affairs at the British embassy, said Sunday [15 May].    "My country has always been pressing for the ban to be  lifted," Mr. Watt told a business luncheon.    On April 25, the United States said it has accepted a  Jordanian proposal on a new land-based system for verifying  compliance with the international sanctions, and His Majesty  King Husayn said the al-'Aqabah siege was being lifted, after  meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in  London.    Mr. Christopher told reporters at a joint press conference  with King Husayn that the U.S. had accepted the proposal to have  the London-based Lloyds Register verify al-'Aqabah-bound cargo  once it is unloaded in the port instead of the sea-inspections,  which have caused the Kingdom enormous economic losses.    The American decision was followed by a French announcement  it was withdrawing from the international forces inspecting the  al-'Aqabah-bound shipping.    The U.S. confirmation that the siege was being lifted came  on  May 9, when Washington officially informed Jordan of its  acceptance of the Kingdom's proposal.    "We were never part of the inspection groups, and Britain  never supported the inspection from the beginning," Mr. Watt  said.    Addressing a group of business people, Mr. Watt said the new  process was a sign of optimism for the Jordanian economy, adding  that Jordan has become a market which all industries are looking  at.    "We are beginning to see some signs of hope after the peace  process, and people are looking towards a bright future, making  Jordan a very attractive market," he added.    Mr. Watt said Britain's policy was to encourage he Jordanian  market, and to open up other markets in the region, "including  Israel."</p>

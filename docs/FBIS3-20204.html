			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Iran has officially asked Turkey for compensation to  help Tehran redeem the loss that country suffered when Turkish  aircraft attacked the Zalah Camp in northern Iraq some time ago.  The officials have not disclosed the amount of compensation  Tehran has asked for to be able to hold talks on the matter.    It has been reported that Tehran has asked Ankara to pay  separate remunerations for more than 10 people, who were  wounded, and nine others, who were killed. Tehran has also  asked for compensation for the damage that was caused by the  attack.    Turkey will respond to Iran's request after the officials in  Ankara consider the amount of compensation that has been asked  for by Tehran.    Tehran's request probably will be discussed between the two  countries.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Thomas Kroeter: "Three Servants of Their </F> Masters"]    [Text] As national secretary of the Social Democratic Party  of Germany (SPD) in the mid-1980's, Peter Glotz coined the  slogan that politics is "the work of bringing things to a head."  Heiner Geissler, the Social Democrat's adversary in his capacity  as the general secretary of the Christian Democratic Union  (CDU), further refined this work into an art--"seizing" topics,  formulating arguments in such a way that they can serve as  weapons in the political struggle, and creating the capacity to  marshal one's own troops in the proper battle formation and to  produce potential majorities. What Glotz was wont to formulate  in a theoretical manner, was Geissler's practical application.    Guenter Verheugen, who rounded out the Bonn trio for the  Free  Democratic Party (FDP) in those years, remembers that there was  a certain "sense of elitism" on the part of the party managers  back then. Verheugen left the liberals after they switched and  formed a coalition with the CDU and is now doing the job for a  second time--this time as the successor once removed of Peter  Glotz. The days of the "big three" are only nostalgia now.  Verheugen's Bonn colleagues are now called Werner Hoyer (FDP)  and Peter Hintze (CDU).    "The general secretary supports the chairman in the  performance of his duties. In concert with the chairman, he  conducts the party's business." These two sentences from  Paragraph 37 of the CDU's by-laws precisely describe the  functions of the other two party managers as well. All the  strings for the exhausting nonstop 1994 election campaign come  together in their hands. They have to get the machinery running  up to full speed and that means, above all, focusing their  activities on their top candidates--Helmut Kohl, Klaus Kinkel,  and Rudolf Scharping.    Despite the fact that the three party headquarters are close  to each other on or next to Bonn's "diplomats' race track," they  rather seldom see one another. "He treats me with respect,"  observes Verheugen curtly about the liberal Werner  Hoyer--discreetly remaining silent about the fact that many  people in the FDP fondly remember his time in the Thomas Dehler  House. Nonetheless, he recently got a visit from a colleague:  When the dispute was on over nursing care insurance, Peter  Hintze showed up at the head of a small demonstration in front  of the Social Democratic "barracks." After reading a brief  polemic text about the SPD's rejectionist position, he turned  over the megaphone he had brought along and thus the Social  Democrat unexpectedly became the main speaker at a CDU  demonstration. "I had not imagined that it would be that easy,"  Verheugen smirked. The little anecdote illustrates one of his  rules of thumb for the unwritten textbook of political action:  "Politics: It is 90 percent skilled craftsmanship and 10 percent  substance."    A scene from the life of a national secretary: "It is a  decision" says Guenter Verheugen into the mouthpiece of the  telephone. Pause. The interlocutor on the other end of the line  is apparently contradicting--at length. "He does not want it"  says Guenter Verheugen. This time the answer is considerably  briefer. The interlocutor gives in. Not only the success  achieved by the five short words, but even the call is  noteworthy. A little while ago--to be precise, in those nearly  forgotten days when a certain Bjoern Engholm...--a leading  Social Democratic politician would not have so readily called up  the national secretary and coordinated his statements for an  interview with the party line. As if it were the most natural  thing in the world, Verheugen succeeds in pronouncing the "he"  as if it were written in capital letters: HE wants it, HE wants  it this way, HE does not want it. In accordance with these three  principles, this HE has come forward to reshape the SPD for the  upcoming election campaign. There are three problems associated  with this kind of bringing things to a head: Work, work, work.  And the three answers: Scharping, Scharping, Scharping.    It is not without irony that it is, of all things, a former  liberal who is bringing the "SPD tanker" around to the  traditional Social Democratic course of "Strength in Unity."  That, however, is precisely the basic terms of reference for his  being hired by Scharping: The head of the party stands at the  center and must show leadership ability--and he simply can best  demonstrate this to the national public if the party becomes a  political machine for the election of its candidate for  chancellor. If the boss occasionally comes a cropper--such as in  the presentation of his tax policy proposals--then the only role  left to the national secretary is to pick up the pieces--a  vicious circle because the more Verheugen increases the power of  the great chairman, the less amenable the latter becomes to  advice. The results can be seen in the CDU. When CDU boss Helmut  Kohl promoted his long-time political traveling companion Heiner  Geissler out of the office of party manager, he did so with,  among other things, the comment that he had become too much of a  "general" for his liking and not enough of a "secretary." With  this as a starting point, someone other than Hintze would have a  hard time of it as well. Is it cynical to assume that his  appointment is not a mistake--as the nearly unanimous view has  it--but precisely what Helmut Kohl wanted?    He studied to be a pastor and is indeed a clever fellow and  a  stimulating conversation partner in a small circle. His ruthless  analysis of the starting position in this superelection year  even made believers of Christian Social Union (CSU) politicians  who otherwise only make jokes at his expense. At public  appearances, however, Hintze leaves a rather negative impression  and not only when--as was the case at the CDU convention in  Hamburg--there is an opportunity to directly compare his  rhetorical talents with those of Heiner Geissler. Hintze is one  of the few people who are just as nervous at the end of their  speech as they are at the beginning--for good reason, since his  scintillating brilliance in conversation always gets lost  somewhere on the way to the podium.    Guenter Verheugen describes the work of a party manager as  "providing orientation, externally as well as internally."  Internally, many a shortcoming can be made up through  organizational talent, yet when it comes to the public, a  harmonious personality is required. The liberal, who has mutated  into a Social Democrat, does not exemplify the "attack dog" type  either--and he is not even trying to play the role. Hintze has  consistently failed at it, yet instead of giving up, he is  obsessed with trying to shake off the reputation of a political  lightweight--without gaining in stature. He consoles himself by  noting that "being underestimated also offers opportunities" and  he defiantly points to the example of his chairman, who was  similarly undervalued for a long time. Of course, he is too  intelligent to ignore the possibility of failure: "Being a  politician always means being a bit of a kamikaze as well."    Werner Hoyer, whose attempts at polemics seem hardly less  labored, would scarcely disagree on that score, and not only  because a modicum of chaos is part of the folklore of the  liberals who passionately remove themselves from the clutches of  discipline. If Hintze has to deal with a chairman who does not  like to have more than one secretary around him, the FDP boss is  all the more urgently in need of a general. Klaus Kinkel is  experienced in government administration, but he is a newcomer  to partisan politics. He cannot, of course, directly mention his  boss' "need for an education" but Hoyer alludes to it when he  emphasizes how important it is for the star of the party to get  an electoral district and to become a member of the Bundestag  caucus. The minister of foreign affairs also thought that Hoyer,  as its former parliamentary secretary, would have the ideal  qualifications to weld party and caucus together into a potent  entity, yet what is needed for that, as the examples of the CDU  and the SPD show, is a boss who is capable of submitting himself  to advice and a team that is willing to exact such submission.  Since both elements are missing, Hoyer can run up his telephone  bill as much as he likes before the Monday meetings of the  party's top leadership, and a Juergen Moellemann--in contrast to  Scharping's defeated rival Gerhard Schroeder--is not going to  toe the line. And party caucus boss Hermann Otto Solms will  still remain in the "big eavesdropping session" at  cross-currents with Kinkel.    How gladly would Werner Hoyer like to escape from this crude  reality. He thrives when he can swoon about policy perspectives:  Modern liberalism, of course, and a kind that will bring the FDP  recognition of its stature at last--that is his dream. On that  score the otherwise sober author of a textbook on microeconomics  succumbs to the myth of Karl Hermann Flach and the "Freiburg  Theses." Granted, scarcely a nonmember can still remember the  FDP secretary general who died young nor would he know what was  in the legendary policy document, but the man and the paper are  emblematic of the dream of a "liberal identity" beyond the  acquisition of power.    What will they do--will they want to do--after the  elections?  Peter Hintze, Werner Hoyer, and Guenter Verheugen do not fall  into the trap of such inquiry. Somehow they all evade the  question. The Social Democrat, who, the rumor mill has it, is a  potential foreign minister, gives the most nonchalant answer:  "Lie under a baobab tree, drink banana beer, and gaze into the  blue African sky." A meeting of the party managers could be held  there--even if it would likely be a forced vacation for one or  another of them after 16 October.</p>

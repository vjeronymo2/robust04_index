P. </F> Semakin, Applied Mechanics Institute, Russian Academy of  Sciences, Izhevsk; UDC 669.054.8;628.3]    [Abstract] A high content of heavy metals in sewage is  characteristic for all major industrial centers (data for  Moscow, Riga, Ryazan, Izhevsk and Chelyabinsk are given). It is  essential that these be removed and currently employed methods  are inefficient and inadequate. A method is therefore proposed  for the utilization of the sewage sediments with a high content  of heavy metals using acid reagents (sulfuric and nitric acids).  The optimum time and temperature regimes of the process are  determined. The developed method, which was tested in large  samples of sediment from various cities, makes it possible to  eliminate 95-100% of all metals. The purified sediment,  after  the neutralization of residual acidity, is processed into  organomineral fertilizer; a table gives the content of nutrients  in comparison with some other organic fertilizers. Another table  shows that the residual content of heavy metals in the purified  sediment is below the norms stipulated for this type of  fertilizers in other countries (United States, Germany,  Netherlands, Switzerland). The separated metals (such as zinc,  nickel, copper and chromium) are relatively easily reworked into  concentrates and are used in the preparation of construction  materials which are of value in industry. Concentrates of  chromium and nonferrous metals are then suitable as raw material  in manufacturing processes. The resulting products, completely  waste-free, are ecologically safe.

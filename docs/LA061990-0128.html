			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> GRAND JURY URGES MORE HEALTH FUNDS  </P> <P> In its third report this spring on health care, the Orange County Grand Jury  recommended Monday that local officials make public medical services "a higher  priority" and spend more general funds on community clinics, services to  pregnant women and county health clinics.  </P> <P> "We have seen a great need" for perinatal care and expanded county health  services, said Beverly Jacobs, chairwoman of the grand jury's health care  committee.  </P> <P> Grand jurors estimate that 400,000 county residents have little or no insurance  and often turn to community or county clinics.  </P> <P> County officials responded that they would like to provide more money for  health care. But citing a $40-million budget deficit this year, they warned of  cutting services, not expanding them.  </P> <P> "The reality is the state is $60 million short, the county $40 million short,"  said Tom Uram, director of the county Health Care Agency. He said the county is  planning cuts in health care if needed state funds fall through.  </P> <P> Uram added that he has a list of programs he may cut, but that would not  release it now because "I don't want any panic. You destroy morale when you put  out a cutoff list."  </P> <P> Don R. Roth, chairman of the County Board of Supervisors, also said there may  be health-care cuts this year.  </P> <P> According to the grand jury's latest report, as well as an accompanying  analysis by the firm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, three other counties of about  the same size -- San Bernardino, San Diego and Santa Clara -- spend more of  their own money on health care, although another comparable county, Sacramento,  spends less.

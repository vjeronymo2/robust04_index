			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Public Sector Borrowing Requirement </F> Declines in First Quarter"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 9 -- Italy's public sector  borrowing requirement [PSBR] declined by 18 percent in the first  quarter of the year against the same quarter in 1993, the  Treasury reported today and said the figure came to 42.399  trillion lire (26.23 billion dollars), a quarterly PSBR nine  trillion below the 51.657 trillion disclosed at the end of March  last year.    Over the first three months of the year, spending came to  132.032 trillion lire (81.7 billion dollars) against revenues of  101.715 trillion lire leaving a net balance of 30.317 trillion  to finance, plus 12.071 trillion lire generated by Treasury  management operations.    The release of these figures today boosted cautious optimism  on the prospect of lowering the PSBR also over the longer term.  Yesterday, the studies center of the national manufacturers  association, Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian  Industry], estimated PSBR for the first five months of the year  at 75.4 trillion lire (46.66 billion dollars), against 87,800  trillion lire (54.33 billion dollars) for the same period in  1993, but would not dismiss worries about exceeding the PSBR  forecast for the full year.    The forecast deficit for 1994 drafted by the government led  by Premier Carlo Azeglio Ciampi is 159 trillion lire (98.39  billion dollars) and this figure has been spoken of as reliable  by the new economic team installed by Premier Silvio Berlusconi.    If the trend reported for the first quarter continues as is,  the PSBR would come to 169.552 trillion lire by December 31,  more than 10.5 trillion lire over target, but Treasury  technicians said account must be taken of the range of variables  on both the spending and revenues sides which condition budget  management. Among the factors conditioning the figures for the  first quarter were the virtual paralysis of public investments  and the reduction of debt servicing thanks to falling interest  rates.    Even taking these variables into consideration, said the  Confindustria studies center, "rigorous conduct on the side of  the public administration" could lead to a deficit for the full  year of 152 to 154 trillion lire.</p>

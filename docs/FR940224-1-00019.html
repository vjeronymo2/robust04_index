			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public Law 102&hyph;547 generally prohibits financing discount points when interest rates are negotiated between the lender and veteran. However, Public Law 103&hyph;78, approved August 13, 1993, permits veterans to finance discount points on interest rate reduction refinancing loans. Accordingly, the proposed &sect;&sect;36.4212(b) and 36.4311(b) prohibit discount points from being financed, except for interest rate reduction refinancing loans under 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8), 3710(b)(7) and 3712(a)(1)(F).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to enactment of Public Law 102&hyph;547, VA was authorized to guarantee fixed rate mortgages only. Public Law 102&hyph;547 authorizes a demonstration project during fiscal years 1993, 1994, and 1995 whereby VA will guarantee loans with adjustable interest rates. The law provides that the interest rate adjustments on these loans shall: (1) Correspond to a specified national interest rate index approved in regulations by the Secretary, information on which is readily accessible to mortgagors from generally available published sources; (2) be made by adjusting the monthly payment on an annual basis; (3) be limited, with respect to any single annual interest rate adjustment, to a maximum increase or decrease of 1 percentage point; and (4) be limited, over the term of the mortgage, to a maximum increase of 5 percentage points above the initial contract interest rate. VA proposes to amend 38 CFR 36.4311 to provide for an adjustable rate mortgage with these adjustment provisions. The regulations will also provide that the first interest rate adjustment may occur 12 to 18 months from the date of the borrower's first mortgage payment. The VA guaranteed adjustable rate mortgage with the above features will be similar to the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) adjustable rate mortgage. This should facilitate pooling of these mortgages together in Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) mortgage-backed securities pools.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public Law 102&hyph;547 requires the Secretary to carry out a program to demonstrate the feasibility of guaranteeing mortgages for the acquisition of an existing dwelling and the cost of making energy efficiency improvements to the dwelling or for energy efficient improvements to a dwelling owned and occupied by a veteran. The law authorizes an addition to the purchase loan for the cost of energy efficient improvements. It provides that for a mortgage guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3710(d) the cost of the energy efficient improvements may be added to the loan amount provided the cost does not exceed (1) $3,000; or (2) $6,000, if the increase in the monthly payment for principal and interest does not exceed the likely reduction in monthly utility costs resulting from the energy efficiency improvements. VA proposes to amend 38 CFR 36.4336 to provide that a loan for an energy efficient mortgage guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3710(d) may exceed the reasonable value of the property by the cost of the energy efficient improvements as stated above. This demonstration program for financing the cost of energy efficiency improvements will expire on December 31, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The law provides that the amount of the guaranty for an energy efficient mortgage guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3710(d) will be in the same proportion as would have been provided if the energy efficiency improvements were not added to the loan amount. It also provides that there be no additional charge to the veteran's entitlement as a result of the increased loan amount. VA proposes to amend 38 CFR 36.4302 to conform to these changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public Law 102&hyph;547 reduces the funding fee for interest rate reduction refinancing loans guaranteed under sections 3710(a)(8), 3710(a)(9)(B), and 3712(a)(1)(F) to 0.50 percent of the total loan amount. VA proposes to amend 38 CFR 36.4232, 36.4254 and 36.4312 to comply with the law. The law also provides that the guaranty amount for interest rate reduction refinancing loans shall not exceed the greater of the original guaranty amount or 25 percent of the loan amount. VA proposes to amend 38 CFR 36.4223 and 36.4302 to reflect this change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions of Public Law 102&hyph;547 and Public Law 103&hyph;66 included in the appropriate regulations by this amendment have been implemented administratively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary hereby certifies that these proposed regulatory amendments will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. The proposed amendments simply update VA regulations to incorporate the changes which have already been made by Public Law 102&hyph;547 and Public Law 103&hyph;66.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program numbers are 64.114 and 64.119.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 38 CFR Part 36  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Condominiums, Handicapped, Housing Loan programs_housing and community development, Manufactured homes, Veterans. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These amendments are proposed under Public Law 102&hyph;547 and the authority granted the Secretary by section 501(a) of title 38, United States Code. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Approved: September 10, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jesse Brown, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Secretary of Veterans Affairs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

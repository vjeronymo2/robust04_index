			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / US puts increased pressure on Japan over economy plan THE US government has sharply increased pressure on Japan over the contents and the scale of plans to boost its flagging economy with an emergency public spending package to be announced within the next few weeks. The US probing of the Japanese plans suggests the Clinton administration will take an increasingly assertive stance, not just on trade but on macro-economic policy. Senior US officials led by Professor Larry Summers, who has been nominated to oversee the US approach to international economic policies, have sent the Japanese finance ministry a long stream of questions about the details of the Y10,700bn (Pounds 62.5bn) emergency package introduced last year. The questions are thought to reflect scepticism among some of President Bill Clinton's senior economic advisers over the real extent of the stimulus which the special package delivered. While Japan presented the package as worth about 2.3 per cent of gross national product, the US administration estimates it may be worth less than 1 per cent. The US probing comes as Japan is in the delicate process of drawing up plans for a further emergency package, which some politicians have suggested may be worth as much as Y14,000bn. Prof Summers' questioning is complicating the task of drawing up the package, which Japanese leaders want to be ready for Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, to present to Mr Clinton during talks in Washington on April 16. The US has repeatedly called on Japan to stimulate its slowing economy to raise demand for imports, in order to reduce its ballooning trade surplus with the US and help sustain the role of exports in the US economic recovery. Until recently the US pressure was mainly confined to the size of the Japanese fiscal programme. In the past few weeks more attention has focused on its contents as well suggesting that the US administration may not take it at face value. Japanese officials say the US has expressed scepticism about the value of increased spending through the Fiscal Investment and Loan Programme, Japan's so-called second budget, which is largely funded by postal savings. More than Y4,000bn of the Y10,700bn package was funded by drawing funds from the programme. However, the US suggests much of this spending is simply redirected rather than new money. The US and Japan also differ over Japan's room for manoeuvre on fiscal policy. The US believes Japan's public finances allow considerable room for fiscal stimulus through cutting taxes, higher spending and increased borrowing. The Japanese finance ministry insists much of its apparent surplus is already committed to pensions for the country's rapidly ageing population. Tokyo grilled by US, Page 6</p>

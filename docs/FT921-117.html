			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Allianz and Dresdner fall on cartel office decision BOURSES reacted to domestic influences yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT recovered after dipping to a five-week low on news that the cartel office had ordered Allianz to cut its stake in Dresdner Bank. The insurance group denied it had a 47 per cent holding in the bank, putting the stake at 22 per cent. Allianz immediately dropped DM120, closing down DM121 or 5.3 per cent at DM2,154, ex-rights. Dresdner fell DM5.70 to DM349.50. The DAX index fell to 1,700.34 at the start but then closed just 1.14 lower at 1,710.31. The FAZ index, calculated at midsession, eased 0.34 to 695.85. Turnover rose to DM4.5bn from DM4.1bn. The market welcomed Mr Ferdinand Piech's appointment as Volkswagen's chief executive, although the shares initially lost DM2.50 on news of lower parent net profit, but then closed DM5 higher at DM356. Daimler advanced DM1.50 to DM755.80 and Porsche shed DM3 to DM552. Veba's announcement that 1992 earnings would remain static sent the shares down DM2.70 but they recovered to close unchanged at DM381.30. PARIS accelerated towards the close on speculation that Prime Minister Edith Cresson was about to be replaced in a government reshuffle. Firmer bonds and activity linked to futures expiry also boosted share prices. The CAC 40 index ended up 1.05 per cent or 20.21 at 1,943.75. Trading in Perrier resumed after being suspended on March 20, and accounted for FFr1.3bn of the total turnover of FFr3bn. The stock jumped FFr154 or 9.9 per cent to FFr1,700, Nestle's new bid for all the shares in the mineral water company, as shareholders sold into the market rather than waiting to sell directly to Nestle. Dealers said Cheuvreux was on the bid all day, suggesting that it was snapping up Perrier shares for Nestle. Eurotunnel fell FFr3.10 or 7.2 per cent to FFr40.20 after Eurotunnel said it had been ordered to pay an additional FFr750m per month to TML, the tunnel building consortium, from April 30. Saint-Gobain rose FFr22 or 4.1 per cent to FFr562 after a positive analysts' meeting in Paris, which was likely to result in a general upgrading of 1993 earnings forecasts. The company is due to hold an analysts' meeting in London tomorrow. Hachette dropped FFr6.70 or 4.1 per cent to FFr158.30 after it said it would take a FFr1.8bn net charge because of losses linked to the troubled television station, La Cinq. MILAN plumbed a new low for the year in minimal trading. Open outcry trading was over by 12.25pm and only legal requirement kept screen-based trading ticking over until its closing time. Dealers expect trading to remain subdued until the general election at the weekend. The Comit index fell 1.25 to 496.49, its lowest close since December 27 last year, in turnover estimated at not more than L70bn after Friday's L75.8bn. The merchant bank Euromobiliare dropped L350 or 8 per cent to L4,000 in thin volume after reporting a consolidated loss of L976m last Friday. There was some interest in telecoms, in anticipation of good results from Sip. Sip rose L10 to L1,400 in decent volume of 4.1m shares before announcing that it expected net earnings to rise 19.5 per cent to L480bn in 1991. Benetton, which announced a 24 per cent rise in 1991 earnings last Friday, rose L60 to L13,240. ZURICH concentrated on the chemicals sector. The SMI index rose 10.5 to 1,839.2. Roche remained firm ahead of its results which are now expected at the end of the week. Its certificates closed up SFr20 at SFr3,090 while bearers gained SFr70 to SFr4,380. Although there is general agreement that profits will be good analysts are divided about the company's prospects in 1992. AMSTERDAM was barely changed with some activity noted in cyclical stocks. The CBS Tendency Index closed down 0.1 at 124.6 in turnover of Fl 321.6m. Daf fell another Fl 1.20 to Fl 21.20 while ABN Amro, which is to offer ADRs, gained 10 cents to Fl 45.50. BRUSSELS was lifted from the day's lows by the retailer Delhaize, which closed up BFr210 or 2.3 per cent at BFr9,360 after Friday's announcement of an unexpected five-for-one stock split. The Bel-20 index rose 0.79 to 1,187.88, in turnover of BFr1.3bn. MADRID declined with the general index closing 0.6 lower at 256.11. STOCKHOLM was depressed by falls in the US on Friday. The Affarsvarlden General Index fell 4.50 to 1,002.40 in turnover of SKr305m after SKr452m. COPENHAGEN saw Hafnia Holding B lose Dkr3 to Dkr267 after announcing that it had dropped a bid for its domestic rival, Baltica. The CSE index slipped 0.38 to 330.74.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - MAR 30  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Hourly changes  Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1136.64  1137.34  1140.36  1141.49  1142.50  1143.46  1144.83  1145.80  -----------------------------------------------------------------------             Day's High  1145.91       Day's Low  1136.64  -----------------------------------------------------------------------      Mar 27       Mar 26       Mar 25       Mar 24        Mar 23     1140.84      1146.25      1144.53      1142.88       1142.05  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Irish Company News: International competition cuts Telecom Eireann to IPounds 173m Operating profits at Telecom Eireann, the Irish state-owned telecommunications company, fell 12 per cent to IPounds 173m (Pounds 171m) in the year ended March. The company blamed the fall on tighter margins after the introduction of more competitive charges last autumn, following the opening up of its international monopoly to competitors, including British Telecommunications. The board said yesterday it would report to the government in October on its strategic objectives and the possibility of an alliance with an international telecommunications company. Mr Ron Bolger, chairman, refused to confirm whether Cable and Wireless, which is reported to have bid Pounds 460m for a 40 per cent share of Telecom Eireann's main operations, would make the short list. He said the board would draw up the list of possible partners over the next month, but declined to give details of the type of link-ups that were being proposed. There is strong opposition even to partial privatisation from Telecom Eireann unions and parts of the Labour element of Ireland's coalition government. Total turnover was up 7 per cent to IPounds 871m, due mostly to increased contributions from subsidiaries and joint ventures. But telephone revenues were static at IPounds 500m, despite the new tariff structure which has cut costs for business users at the expense of domestic customers. Pre-tax profits were IPounds 81m (IPounds 50m). The previous year Telecom Eireann had to write off IPounds 44m to reflect the impact of the devaluation of the punt on its almost IPounds 1bn of debt. 'Debt reduction is of paramount importance to the company's future,' said Mr Bolger. He said debt would be an issue in any possible alliance and that some may have to be transferred directly to the government's books.</p>

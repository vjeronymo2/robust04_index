			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Money Markets: UK rates steady UK money rates closed unchanged yesterday, with sentiment generally buoyed by the gains of sterling against the D-Mark within the European exchange rate mechanism, writes Simon London. The Bank of England forecast a Pounds 900m liquidity shortage in early morning, later revised to Pounds 1.05bn. In early assistance, the Bank purchased Pounds 100m paper for resale to the market at 10 7/16 per cent in equal amounts on January 27 and 28. Later in the morning this pattern was repeated but on a larger scale, the Bank buying Pounds 700m paper at the same rate, of resale in equal amounts on the same dates. Afternoon assistance comprised the purchase of a modest Pounds 32m band 1 bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. Late assistance totalled Pounds 100m bringing the liquidity injection for the day to Pounds 932m, around Pounds 120m less than the forecast shortage. Rates were steady to softer for most of the day. Having closed on Monday at 10 3/4 -  5/8 per cent, overnight unsecured money traded down to 10 1/2 - 1/4 per cent in late morning before firming to close back at Monday's levels. The March short sterling futures contract on the London International Financial Futures Exchange closed at 89.62, from 89.49 on Monday, implying base lending rates of 10.38 per cent by the spring. Sterling gained ground against the D-Mark in late trading on the foreign exchange markets, having been firm for most of the day, to close at DM2.85. During the morning, the Bank of Spain increased money market interest rates from 12.5 per cent to 12.65 per cent, enough to lift the peseta against other European currencies and lift sterling's floor to around DM2.8355. In Frankfurt, call money rates were squeezed higher for the second day running as financial institutions scrambled for funds ahead of a dealine for taxation payments later this month. Call money traded up to 9.55/60 per cent, from 9.45/55 on Monday and 9.40/9.50 for most of last week. Today, rates could be pushed higher still with DM33.8bn being drained from the market by the expiry of two Bundesbank repurchase pacts. The authorities are expected to replace the lost liquidity with a fresh repurchase agreement, although the Bundesbank may be content to see rates closer to 9.75 per cent, the Lomard emergency funding rate for financial institutions.</p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL;  </P> <P> RENEWING ACQUAINTANCES;  </P> <P> RIVALRY: AFTER COOLING THEIR HEELS FOR TWO YEARS, NOTRE DAME AND CRESPI ARE SET  TO MEET AGAIN.  </P> <P> A statue of Mary, mother of Jesus, was defaced at Notre Dame High. A year  later, some highly unflattering words about Notre Dame were burned into the  school's lawn and caused quite a stir among the school's clergy.  </P> <P> The same year, a pickup truck allegedly occupied by Notre Dame students roared  past the Crespi parking lot and unloaded an arsenal of water balloons onto a  group of previously dry Crespi students.  </P> <P> And very shortly after that, late in 1987, one of the Valley's most intense and  stirring football rivalries came to a sudden halt. A game that annually  attracted as many as 5,000 fans was no more.  </P> <P> "Athletics are not that important that we act toward each other like we're not  even Christians," proclaimed Sister Christopher Miller, a former Notre Dame  vice principal.  </P> <P> Never mind that the fairly regular practice in football of trying to separate a  ballcarrier from his head doesn't seem to be condoned anywhere in the Bible,  either. But Miller had a point to make, a point with which any decent person  would agree.  </P> <P> Defacing a religious statue is an ignorant and hateful act, any time, any  place.  </P> <P> And anyone who chars obscenities into someone's lawn is likely lugging around  the IQ of a pine tree.  </P> <P> As for water balloons . . . well, water balloons are always funny.  </P> <P> No one died because of the rivalry, and no one was injured, either.  </P> <P> But the relationship with Crespi, Notre Dame decided, was a bad one. Notre Dame  called for a two-year "cooling-off" period and jumped from the Del Rey League  to the San Fernando Valley League, apparently to get away from the Celts.  </P> <P> The cooling-off period has ended. Tonight, inside a Pierce College stadium that  is expected to rock with 5,000 or more fans, the two most prominent Catholic  schools in the Valley will bang helmets once again. Crespi leads the series,  11-4, and won the most recent meeting, 54-14, in 1987.  </P> <P> Both schools returned to the Mission League this year and at stake tonight is  the league championship. Notre Dame is 6-2-1 overall, 4-0-1 in league play, and  can clinch at least a tie for the title with a victory. Crespi is 7-2, 4-1 and  has a shot at the crown if it wins and St. Paul is beaten.  </P> <P> But just knocking Notre Dame out of a chance for the title might give the Celts  enough satisfaction.  </P> <P> "I don't know if two years of cooling off was long enough. I don't know if 20  years would be long enough," said Rich Lawson, a former Notre Dame player and  coach who is now the head coach at Chaminade. "I don't know that any  cooling-off period was appropriate. There would seem to be other ways of  handling the extracurricular problems than shelving the whole rivalry. The  administration should be able to deal with those things."  </P> <P> Chaminade Athletic Director Bernie Kyman, a longtime observer of sports in the  Valley, has a similar opinion.  </P> <P> "My feeling is that any games that create large fan support are good," he said.  "The administration then has the responsibility of controlling any problems.  There will be more than 5,000 fans at this game, and that has to be good for  everyone."  </P> <P> At Notre Dame, the principal seemed to be feeling a bit of pressure as the game  approached.  </P> <P> "I was misquoted badly two years ago and am really shy about saying anything,"  Brother Stephen Walsh said. "Let's leave it like this: I would rather make no  comment about any of this.  </P> <P> "However, I feel very comfortable with playing football against Crespi and look  forward to this game and being in the same league again. I have a lot of  respect for Crespi High School, and I am not interested in going over all the  past problems.  </P> <P> "Nobody was fine and pure in all of our past problems. But to go back over the  whole thing, I just won't do that."  </P> <P> Two years ago, Notre Dame athletic director and football Coach Kevin Rooney was  forced to walk an awkward line when his school's administration made its  no-Crespi decree.  </P> <P> "As the football coach, I am disappointed," he said at the time. "We like to  play local teams and it's a rivalry. We compete well with Crespi. This is an  administrative decision."  </P> <P> This week, he is still walking that awkward line.  </P> <P> "I'm glad we have the opportunity to play them again," he said. "It will be  fun. But I don't want to stir up any controversy over the decision to have the  cooling-off period. And I haven't talked to my players about the rivalry aspect  of the game. There is no need. Everybody here knows about the Crespi-Notre Dame  rivalry.  </P> <P> "I think we all understand that the rivalry needs to be kept in perspective.  It's a football game, and we want to make sure it's just that and not anything  more."  </P> <P> At Crespi, there always has been the feeling that the Notre Dame-initiated lull  was a case of blowing things out of proportion.  </P> <P> "I'm still not sure what Notre Dame wanted to accomplish with the two-year  layoff," Crespi Athletic Director Paul Muff said. "We felt that things really  weren't that bad. I felt the rivalry had reached a good point.  </P> <P> "Our coaching staff knows the Notre Dame coaching staff very well and we all  have a tremendous amount of respect for Kevin Rooney, and we always felt we  could work things out. In my 15 years here, I always felt the rivalry brought  out the best in both teams, in all sports."  </P> <P> Muff said the faculty at Crespi has reminded the students this week of the need  for proper behavior at the football game. Just like the school administration  does before every football game.  </P> <P> "We purposely did not want to single this game out as anything different," Muff  said. "There are many students here now who have never been to a Crespi-Notre  Dame game. But it's such a natural rivalry. The kids from the two schools know  each other from grammar school and the faculty and alumni know each other so  well.  </P> <P> "I'm glad to have the rivalry back. I'm just hoping that some semblance of the  rivalry that we used to have comes back."  </P></p>

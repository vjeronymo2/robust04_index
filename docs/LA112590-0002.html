			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEASON'S LISTENING;  </P> <P> 'HIGH SPIRITS: A COLLECTION OF GHOST STORIES'  </P> <P> What could be more appropriate for the holiday season than a collection of  ghost stories? Especially when the ghosts involved are amusing rather than  frightening, far distant cousins, if related at all, to the ogres that  terrified us in our youth. In one sense they are descendants of the ghost of  Marley; for they are all Christmas ghosts, but ghosts of a far more engaging  Christmas Present than anything seen by Scrooge. And Robertson Davies, modern  master of magic and creator of this baker's dozen of stories, acknowledges this  debt in an engrossing tale, "Dickens Digested."  </P> <P> Davies himself reads the introduction to this collection with stylish zest,  explaining how, when he had been appointed to the first Master of Massey  College at the University of Toronto, it became established that at the annual  Christmas party he should tell a ghost story. Few institutions of higher  learning can enjoy a happier tradition. But one does not, fortunately, need to  have been exposed to graduate study to enjoy what Davies calls these  "party-ghosts, emanating from high spirits." On the other hand, if one has  experienced that dubious privilege, some of these ghosts may seem at times far  more real than supernatural, and the hearer may go beyond empathizing with the  central figure of the first story, "The Ghost Who Vanished by Degrees," and  experience complete identification.  </P> <P> The stories themselves are read with obvious enjoyment by Christopher Plummer,  who gives just the right tone to each of the characters, whether in the flesh  or ectoplasm. This is high praise, for the range of Davies' interests is  enormous, and he makes full use of them here. Among his favorite targets are  provincialism, manners, dress, and self-pride. He can be both benign and  biting, sometimes in the same breath. Who else could dream up an encounter  between the ghosts of Albert Einstein and Little Lord Fauntleroy?  </P> <P> That meeting occurs in "Einstein and the Little Lord," and I give the title  simply to indicate one of the difficulties of reviewing a collection of ghost  stories. A recounting of the story itself is out of the question. It could be  nothing but a condensed, pale imitation of the original, spoiling the real  thing for the listener. A listing of some of the titles to be heard here may be  the best solution, especially those titles that give an indication -- even if a  misleading one -- of the delights to follow. So, in addition to those already  named, the listener can look forward to "The Great Queen is Amused," "The Night  of the Three Kings," "When Satan Goes Home for Christmas," and "The Ugly  Spectre of Sexism." Finally, there is "Offer of Immortality." What more could  one ask for?  </P> <P> With his interests in Jungian theory and magic, Davies, not surprisingly, has  himself become a figure of legend and myth. This is a mark of his peculiar  genius, something that anyone who has heard him speak or even simply looked at  his current portraits can understand. One of the most enchanting details  concerning him has been told to me solemnly by more than one admirer, and that  is that his splendidly full beard is the result of his face having never been  touched by a razor.  </P> <P> If Davies himself had invented this fiction I would keep my silence. But  knowing that he has not, I feel free to explode that particular myth. Davies  and I were contemporaries at Oxford in pre-war days. More than that, we were  both members of an exclusive club, its membership limited for life to four  persons. We were all clean shaven when this club was founded, though two of the  members began to sport mustaches before we went down. Davies was not one of  these. I have heard Davies' appearance compared to that of Michelangelo's Moses  and to Freud's. But surely his model in this current role is a seasonal figure.  Clearly he is the latter-day manifestation of Saint Nicholas.  </P> <P> The name of our club, by the way: The Long Christmas Dinner Society.  </P> <P> WHERE TO ORDER TAPES:  </P> <P> The six-cassette set is produced by Listening Library, distributed by G. K.  Hall, 70 Lincoln St., Boston, MA 02111. An abridged set of two cassettes  (offering six stories) is available from The American Audio Prose Library, P.O.  Box 842, Columbia, MO 65205.  </P></p>

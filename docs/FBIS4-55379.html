			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 12/5/1994 -- Romania counts at  present on a 269,500 strong army. The reform will reduce their  number to 230,000 by 1995 and to 200,000 by the end of the year  2000, Lieutenant-General Dumitru Cioflina, defence secretary of  state and chief of the Army's General Staff, told a news  conference today. The reform will also mean a higher level of  professionalisation of its military who by 2000 will be  permanent and highly trained in a proportion of 50 percent.    The chief of the general staff gave a number of details as  to  the reform. This is to be carried out by restructuring its  bodies in two phases: one ended in 1993, the latter will last  until 2000. The reform and restructuring includes the reduction  of armament in compliance with Romania's international  commitments: tanks from 2,850 to 1,375 in 1995, 100 mm and more  artillery pieces from 3,780 to 1,475, armoured cars from 3,100  to 2,100, fighter planes from 505 to 430. Attack helicopters  are planned to grow in number from 13 as of now to 120.    General Cioflina revealed plans to set up a 100,000 strong  protection corps formed of territorial forces (similar to the  former civic guards), which will add up to the national defence  system consisting of regular army, gendarmes, police, frontier  guards and fire fighter corps. According to the Romanian senior  military official, the Army's budget is 75 percent of minimal  requirements, and it covers the purchase of new armament, the  maintenance of the old one, the entire wage and outfit expenses.    General Cioflina mentioned descentralisation as one of the  effects of the reform, with responsibilities relegated from  minister to the staffs of the three armies and to the general  staff. This includes the creation of an intervention force  formed of armoured car brigades, three paratroopers brigades,  tank and artillery divisions.    The reform and the restructuring, Secretary of State General  Cioflina admitted, caused some apprehension among military who  fear that they might be either put on the reserve or reassigned  to other garrisons. Among other tasks devolving upon the Army  General Cioflina mentioned its duty "to defend the democratic  order," a constitutional provision to be found in other  constitutions as well, with the difference that, as concerns the  Romanian Constitution, specifications must be made as to the  moment and mode of intervention. To complement this, two laws  are being drafted at present: the law of the state of siege,  and the law of the state of emergency, meant to clarify an issue  that has caused so much heated debate starting with the  intervention of the Army in December 1989.</p>

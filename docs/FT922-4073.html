			<p>920608 FT  08 JUN 92 / Letter: No security compromise Sir, I would like to correct an impression given by Mr Hanson (Letters, May 22) that the licence condition derogation granted to National Grid for the connection of the Grey-stones Power Station may compromise system security. The derogation will allow output from Greystones to be sold into the electricity pool before associated grid system reinforcements are complete. The station will be able to generate at full output under normal grid system conditions, but with a severely restricted output when transmission outages occur. Arrangements will be made by National Grid for automatic reduction of station output when required. Thus Greystones itself will be connected at a reduced level of security. The remainder of the system, including connections to other power stations and regional electricity companies, will operate to the standards placed on National Grid by its transmission licence. Security of supply to customers will be unchanged by this arrangement, but customers will stand to benefit from the earlier introduction of an efficient power station on to the grid system.

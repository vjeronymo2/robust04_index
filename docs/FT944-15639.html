			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Lisbon looks for rise in revenues Portugal's centre-right government yesterday presented to parliament a moderately restrictive budget for 1995 that allows room for a high level of European Union-financed investment in the approach to a general election next October. Mr Eduardo Catroga, finance minister, said the budget deficit would be cut to 5.8 per cent of gross domestic product from an estimated 6.3 per cent this year. The reduction is to be achieved through increased revenue rather than by spending cuts. Portugal aims to consolidate a downward trend for the budget deficit after a large budget overrun in 1993 when the deficit jumped to 7.1 per cent of GDP. The original target for 1994 was 6.9 per cent but has been lowered as a result of higher than expected tax revenue. Overall revenue next year is forecast to grow by 7 per cent compared with 1994, to Es3,649.2bn (Pounds 14.7bn). The central value added tax rate is to be raised from 16 to 17 per cent. But Mr Catroga said the direct tax burden would not increase as a percentage of GDP. Public spending is to rise 5.2 per cent, above forecast 1995 inflation of 3.5-4.5 per cent, to Es4,380.8bn. But Mr Catroga said the increase in current spending would be lower than the inflation rate. Public investment is to rise by 15 per cent, largely due to national budget contributions to EU-financed projects. The government aims to stimulate economic recovery in the run-up to the election. GDP growth resumed in mid-1994 after two years of recession and is expected to reach 1.1 per cent this year. Mr Catroga forecast the economy would expand by 2.5-3.5 per cent in 1995. But Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister, is also concerned to meet targets for nominal convergence with the EU, particularly now that the possibility of a multi-speed Europe has been raised by politicians in Germany and France. Failure to cut public debt, inflation and interest rates would hinder Portugal's participation in economic and monetary union. The 1995 budget deficit target Mr Catroga announced yesterday is equal to that earlier suggested by the European Commission. 'If we lose the battle to reduce the budget deficit, Portugal will forfeit the political weight required to defend its interests within the European Union,' Mr Cavaco Silva warned at the weekend. He was talking to trade unionists after the collapse of efforts to forge a 1995 wage pact between government, employers and unions.</p>

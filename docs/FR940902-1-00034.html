			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Is offered by an institution of higher learning, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Does not lead to a standard college degree; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The institution of higher learning requires as part of the reservist's program of education one or more unit subjects for which credit is granted toward a standard college degree.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) When measuring a reservist's enrollment during a semester or quarter when he or she is pursuing one or more courses which the educational institution measures on a credit-hour basis, VA will convert the credit to equivalent clock hours as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, and combine them with the clock hours of the other courses measured by the school on that basis, as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) VA shall_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Determine the equivalent clock hour factor by dividing the number of clock hours which constitute full time for the enrollment as stated in paragraph (e) or (f) of this section by the number of credit hours which constitute a full time undergraduate enrollment at the educational institution as stated in paragraph (a) of this section, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(5) and (6) of this section, multiply the number of credit hours in which the reservist is enrolled by the equivalent clock hour factor as determined by paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. This will result in the number of equivalent clock hours in which the reservist is enrolled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) VA will add the number of clock hours in which the reservist is enrolled to the number of equivalent clock hours in which he or she is enrolled. The result will be compared to paragraph (e) or (f) to determine the reservist's training time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) When the number of class sessions per credit hours is so low that &sect;21.4272(f)(2)(ii) or (3) would control the way in which VA would measure those credit hours, VA will make the calculations required by paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section by multiplying the number of class sessions determined by the equivalent clock hour factor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) When the reservist is attending a nonstandard term, VA will make the calculations required by paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section by determining the equivalent credit hours in which the reservist is enrolled as provided in &sect;21.4272(g), and multiplying the equivalent credit hours by the equivalent clock hour factor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) In calculations required by this paragraph, fractions of an equivalent clock hour will be dropped.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3688(e); Pub.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 15. Applicants seek an order of the Commission to allow the Trust to impose a CDSC on any appropriate class of shares subject to the terms and in the circumstances appropriate to that class and to waive such a CDSC in certain circumstances. Under the proposed CDSC arrangement, some or all shares of certain classes of a Fund may be subject to a CDSC if such shares are redeemed or repurchased within a prescribed period of time after their purchase. No CDSC will be imposed with respect to: (a) The portion of redemption or repurchase proceeds attributable to increases in the value of the shares due to capital appreciation; (b) shares acquired through the reinvestment of income dividends or capital gain distributions; or (c) shares held for more than a certain time after their purchase. Any CDSC would be imposed on the lesser of (a) the net asset value of the shares at the time of purchase, and (b) the net asset value of the shares at the time of repurchase or redemption. In determining whether a CDSC will be payable, it will be assumed that shares, or amounts representing shares, that are not subject to a CDSC are redeemed or repurchased first and for other shares it will be assumed that a redemption is made of shares held by the investor for the longest period of time. This will result in any such charge being imposed on the fewest number of shares and at the lowest possible rate. The amount of the CDSC and the circumstances and timing of its imposition may vary among classes and may be changed with respect to any class. Any change in the terms of a CDSC will be reflected in the affected shares' prospectus. In addition, any such change will not affect the shares that have already been issued unless such change would result in terms more favorable to the holders of such shares, in which case the change may, but need not, apply to already-issued shares. No CDSC will be imposed on any shares purchased prior to the effective date of the order requested by this application, except as permitted under the Prior CDSC Orders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. Applicants propose to vary or waive the CDSC in connection with certain categories of transactions. The conditions in paragraphs (a) through (d) of rule 22d&hyph;1 will be satisfied with respect to any category of transaction for which a CDSC is waived. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. If the Funds waive or reduce a CDSC, such waiver or reduction will be applied uniformly to all shares in the specified category. If a Fund which has been waiving or reducing a CDSC determines not to waive or reduce such CDSC any longer, the disclosure in the Fund's prospectus will be appropriately revised. Any such change will not affect shares that have already been issued. A CDSC imposed on any given class of shares may be waived in all or any number of the circumstances listed above and the waivers applicable to the CDSC on one class may differ from the waivers applicable to another class. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicants seek exemption from (a) sections 18(f)(1) and 18(g) of the Act to the extent that the issuance and sales of multiple classes of shares may result in a ``senior security'' prohibited by section 18(f) and (b) section 18(i) of the Act to the extent that the different voting rights associated with such classes may be deemed to result in one or more classes of shares having unequal voting rights with other classes of shares. In addition, applicants request an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c&hyph;1 thererunder to the extent necessary to permit the proposed CDSC arrangement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Applicants believe that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights is equitable and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders. The proposed arrangement will not involve borrowing and will not affect the Funds' existing assets or reserves; it also will not increase the speculative character of the shares in a Fund, since all shares will participate  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in all of the Fund's income and all of the Fund's expenses (with the exception of the Class Expenses). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Under the Alternative Purchase Plan, mutuality of risk will be preserved with respect to all classes of shares in a Fund, as the classes will represent interests in a single pool of assets presenting the same investment risk to all shareholders of the Fund, regardless of class. Further, since all classes of shares will be redeemable at all times, no class of shares will have any preference or priority over the other class of shares of the particular Fund in the usual sense (that is, no class will have a distribution or liquidation preference with respect to particular assets of a Fund and no class will be protected by any reserve or other account). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants agree that the order granting the requested exemptions will be subject to the following conditions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c&hyph;10 under the Act (Investment Company Act Release No. 16619 (Nov. 2, 1988)), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted or amended. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund and be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among the classes of shares of the same Fund will relate solely to: (a) the impact of any rule 12b&hyph;1 plan payments (which may include servicing fees or distribution fees, or both) or Shareholder Servicing Plan payments made by a class and any other expenses that may be imposed upon a particular class of shares and which are limited to (i) transfer agency fees attributable to a specific class of shares, (ii) printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses and proxies to current shareholders of a specific class, (iii) blue sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares, (iv) Commission registration fees incurred by a class of shares, (v) the expenses of administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class, (vi) litigation or other legal expenses relating solely to one class of shares, (vii) Trustees' fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares, and (viii) any other incremental expenses subsequently identified that should be properly allocated to one class which shall be approved by the Commission pursuant to an amended order; (b) the fact that the classes will vote separately with respect to a Fund's rule 12b&hyph;1 plans, except as provided in condition 16 below; (c) the different exchange privileges of the various classes of shares as may be described from time to time in any prospectus of the Trust; (d) the fact that only certain classes will have a conversion feature; and (e) the designation of each class of shares of a Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The Trustees of the Trust, including a majority of the independent Trustees, shall have approved each Alternative Purchase Plan prior to its implementation by any Fund. The minutes of the meetings of the Trustees regarding the deliberations of the Trustees with respect to the approvals necessary to implement each Alternative Purchase Plan will reflect in detail the reasons for determining that the Alternative Purchase Plan is in the best interests of the relevant Fund and its shareholders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

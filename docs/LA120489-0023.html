			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIKINGS GET ON TRACK, BEAT BEARS;  </P> <P> MINNESOTA: WADE WILSON THREWS FOR TWO TOUCHDOWNS IN 27-16 VICTORY.  </P> <P> As Wade Wilson and the Minnesota Vikings ended their offensive suffering, they  may have also ended the Chicago Bears' five-year reign as rulers of the NFC  Central.  </P> <P> "It's nice to dethrone them, as long as we're the ones who replace them on the  throne," Wilson said. "It wouldn't do us any good to beat the Bears and then  watch the Packers win the division."  </P> <P> Wilson threw two scoring passes and keyed the Vikings' first long touchdown  drive in three weeks in leading Minnesota to a 27-16 victory over the Bears  Sunday night.  </P> <P> "We went back to our old philosophy of throwing the ball deep," said Wilson,  who completed 15 of 26 passes for 260 yards. "We came out attacking them with  our passing game, something we hadn't done in a long time."  </P> <P> The loss dropped Chicago (6-7) two games behind Minnesota and Green Bay. Both  are 8-5.  </P> <P> The Bears are below .500 for the first time since the second-to-last week of  1983, the last season in which they missed the playoffs. The Bears, who have  lost three straight and are 2-7 after a 4-0 start, last had a losing season in  1982, when they went 3-6 in Coach Mike Ditka's first year.  </P> <P> As recently as last week, when Ditka said the Bears season was over because  they "stink," the coach has ridden his team hard.  </P> <P> He softened considerably after Sunday's game.  </P> <P> "I just want to correct one thing," he said. "I got on these guys a little last  week. But, I'll tell you, the way they played, good or bad, that's my  responsibility. They're my guys and I love them and I respect them, and we'll  keep trying.  </P> <P> "I wanted it to happen more than anyone else in this room," he said. "I don't  think this team will give up. They tried, they hung in there, they made some  good things happen early."  </P> <P> Chicago's lone highlight came 3:28 into the game, when Kevin Butler broke an  NFL record with his 24th consecutive field goal, a 33-yarder. His next attempt  was blocked.  </P> <P> The Vikings, who snapped a two-game losing streak, led 14-3 at halftime. They  drove 66 yards in seven plays for one score, a one-yard run by Herschel Walker,  and got their second touchdown on a 46-yard hookup, Wilson to Hassan Jones. It  was the Vikings' longest pass play of the season and capped a six-play, 73-yard  drive.  </P> <P> The Vikings are shooting for their first division title since 1980.  </P></p>

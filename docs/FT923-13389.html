			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cornish mine has '20 years of reserves' CORNWALL'S SOLE surviving working tin mine, at South Crofty near Camborne, which was almost killed off last year, should be able to continue well into the next century, according to Mr Kevin Ross, managing director of Carnon Holdings, the mine's owner. 'We currently have 20 years of reserves and I am very confident that we can continue mining well into the future,' he said yesterday. South Crofty was now operating profitably following the recent strong rise in the international tin price, which has been at its highest level for 18 months. he said. The mine was not far off full break-even at present prices. Mr Ross said break-even was at Pounds 3,750 to Pounds 3,800 a tonne. Last night tin for delivery in three months closed on the London Metal Exchange at Dollars 7,052.50 a tonne, equivalent to Pounds 3,715. Mr Ross said South Crofty would produce about 2,000 tonnes of tin in concentrates this year - all of it sent for refining to the DKS smelter in Malaysia. Carnon's Wheal Jane tin mine, near Truro, was killed off by the extraordinary low prices in 1990. In February last year it seemed that South Crofty was also doomed, when the UK government withdrew promised funding without warning and refused to pay the final Pounds 1.7m of a Pounds 24.7m interest-free loan. Carnon had to make all its 415 employees redundant and covered the cost of redundancy payments and other outstanding debts by selling equipment from Wheal Jane, surplus land and processing 40,000 tonnes of stockpiled ore, most of it underground at South Crofty. Some 205 volunteers came back to work on new contracts - everyone, including the managing director, worked for Pounds 4.25 an hour or about 60 per cent of the previous average wage at the mine - which so changed the economics that it became worthwhile mining again. As the tin price has risen, miners' pay has been lifted to 'near the local average', said Mr Ross. Carnon was bought by its managers from the RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining company, in March 1988. Managers shared 80 per cent of the equity and the rest was held in trust for employees. The company had a Pounds 10m interest-free loan from RTZ as well as the government loan. In July last year, Carnon won outline planning permission for a Pounds 35m leisure centre on the Wheal Jane site. Mr Ross said this had been shelved until the property market improved, but Carnon was continuing to go through the planning process.</p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Russian banking reform forum launched in US A HIGH-LEVEL initiative to restructure the Russian banking and financial system and to explore the possible creation of a Russian-American investment bank was announced in New York yesterday. The initiative, to be known as the Russian-American Bankers Forum, comes from the US Federal Reserve, the central banking system, and top advisers to Russian president Boris Yeltsin. The forum, co-chaired by Mr Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Mr Yuli Vorontsov, the Russian representative to the United Nations, will hold its first meeting in Moscow next Thursday. Mr Corrigan said the new group had the full support of Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and Mr Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary. Mr Vorontsov said that restructuring the banking system would be 'the mainstay of a new market economy'. He and Mr Corrigan added that the eventual formation of a new Russian-American Investment Bank could help to channel US private sector capital investments in Russia and to lay the groundwork for the development of US commercial bank operations in Moscow. Mr Corrigan said the initiative was the culmination of a series of informal co-operative ventures over the past 12 months, and was 'based on a precept of private and public sector co-operation'. He said the forum, with secretariats in Moscow and New York, would provide policy and technical support for working groups of US experts who would report to Mr Yeltsin's aides. Among the US members of the forum are Mr David Rockefeller, former chairman of Chase Manhattan; Mr Cyrus Vance, former secretary of state; Mr John Opel, former chairman of IBM; Mr John Whitehead, former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs; and Mr Richard Debs, ex-president of Morgan Stanley. The first working group will give the forum details next Thursday of what is required to develop a Russian retail banking network, a payment system to steer the Russian economy away from its largely cash-based operations, the development of an interbank market and the creation of a market for government securities. Other working groups might be formed to deal with issues such as privatisation, direct foreign investment and the regulation of financial markets. The US partners in the forum will include the financial Services Volunteer Corps, a technical assistance group chaired by Mr Vance . Mr Corrigan said the forum would be financed by the Russian government, the US Federal Reserve system and by US banks and private sector companies. The first working group includes present and former officials from the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, Federal Reserve banks in New York and Boston and US commercial banks.</p>

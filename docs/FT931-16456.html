			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / International Company News: Philips ahead in Europe's semiconductor rankings PHILIPS of the Netherlands fended off Intel of the US in 1992 to maintain its 15-year record as Europe's largest semiconductor supplier, according to figures collated by Dataquest Europe. The Dutch company had sales of Dollars 1.12bn, just Dollars 16m ahead of Intel, the world's largest merchant semiconductor manufacturer with worldwide sales in excess of Dollars 5bn. Intel's success is built on its best-selling microprocessors, including the 386 and 486 chips used in the majority of personal computers of IBM design. In Europe, the company's revenues grew 45 per cent, taking it from fifth to second place. Its US competitor, Motorola, moved to third with sales of Dollars 976m, a 26 per cent advance on the year before. European companies Siemens and SGS-Thomson slipped to fourth and fifth places respectively. INTEL, the US chipmaker, became the world's largest semiconductor supplier in 1992, overtaking NEC and Toshiba of Japan, according to a market survey published yesterday by Dataquest, the US market research group, writes Louise Kehoe. Intel's revenues grew by 26 per cent in the year, a rise of over Dollars 1bn. NEC and Toshiba, ranked two and three, showed a modest 4 per cent growth.</p>

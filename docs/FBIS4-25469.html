			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 9 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- In order  to strengthen price management over import and export trade, the  relevant department of the Chinese Government recently adopted  some new measures.    According to ZHONGGUO XINXI BAO, the new measures mainly  include three points:    First, improving the import agent system. Necessary  production materials and such important livelihood materials as  grain, the prices of which are higher on the international  market than on the domestic, should be imported through  comprehensive regulations. While the import of such goods is  guaranteed, their impact on domestic prices should be reduced.  New management methods should be studies for importing major  commodities. For example, such methods as setting up united  agents and formulating average prices for agents may be adopted.    Second, adopting the policy of encouraging exports and  foreign exchange earning. The principles for export price  management are: Promoting the increase in foreign exchange  earnings through exports and export-oriented production,  improving the export structure, enhancing the economic results  of export trade, putting a stop to the phenomena of dumping at  low prices in the export market and bidding up the prices in the  domestic market. The domestic purchase price ceiling for major  export goods should be based on international market prices, and  the floor-level protective price should be formulated according  to domestic production costs.    Third, the exchange rate adjustment mechanism should be  improved so that the impact of exchange rate changes on domestic  prices can be brought under control. In the future, exchange  rates should be determined not only by the costs of exports;  consideration also should be giving to both imports and exports,  as well as to non-trade projects.</p>

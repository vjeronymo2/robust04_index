			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Wellcome The 35 per cent increase in Wellcome's interim profits seems tailor-made to impress ahead of the looming placement by the Wellcome Trust. Admittedly the profits would have risen only 24 per cent at constant exchange rates, and currency rates will be a drag on results for the balance of the year. But the picture is still robust. The underlying growth of sales in continuing businesses was 21 per cent, of which only 3 per cent came from price increases. That should not only stand Wellcome in good stead as health budgets come under pressure in the industrial world. It also confirms the company's growth credentials ahead of the placement. The risks attached to this enterprise are still considerable, though they are pretty much outside the company's control. US investors could become disenchanted with pharmaceutical stocks as the recovery gathers pace. UK investors could go on a buying strike if they are unhappy with post-election prospects for the equity market. A remaining preoccupation is Wellcome's rating relative to the rest of the sector. To attract sufficient interest, Wellcome will need an edge over the likes of Glaxo. That edge was non-existent when the placement was first announced, because Wellcome's scarcity value put it on a much higher earnings multiple. By yesterday the gap had narrowed. Indeed, looking ahead to 1993, both companies are now on a similar multiple in the low 20s. Arguably Wellcome has somewhat stronger growth potential, not least because there is still room for higher margins. So the rating relationship is probably about right. The rest depends on the popularity of the sector as a whole.</p>

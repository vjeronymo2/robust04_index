			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Books: A chicken and egg situation AFTER APARTHEID by Sebastian Mallaby Faber &amp; Faber Pounds 14.99, 224 pages IT IS a brave journalist who, in his own book about South Africa, draws attention to a classic text by a member of the same profession. Sebastian Mallaby of the Economist, based in southern Africa from 1989-90, acknowledges Move Your Shadow by Joe Lelyveld of the New York Times as one of his 'models of good writing'. After Apartheid has much to recommend it. There are some sharp observations and insights, and revealing anecdotes. It combines detachment with sensitivity. But it does not stand the comparison that has been invited. It may be that it is simply too soon to write a book about South Africa's transition to democracy. Explaining why apartheid failed is one thing. It is very much more difficult to say what will replace it. 'With its communists and neo-Nazis, its Christians, Jews and Muslims, its Afrikaners and English, its Indians and Coloureds, Xhosas and Zulus, Sothos and Vendas - with all its bubbling variety, how could South Africa build the basic consensus that democracy requires?' Quite so. 'South Africa's new constitution would have to cater to diversity of both race and tribe . . . the question was how to do it.' The irritating use of tense implies an historical perspective from which the author can provide the answer. He cannot, though his guess may well turn out to be correct. Neither the African National Congress nor the National Party has an alternative to negotiations, writes Mallaby. The ANC will be an important partner, if not the senior partner, in any future coalition - although it is not clear just where Mangosuthu Buthelezi fits in; and at least one or two white politicians will remain in the cabinet. But too little of the negotiating process has unfolded to allow Mallaby to show us just how South Africa will get from its current state to consensus and coalition; or what lessons other African countries can draw from South Africa's exercise in constitution making when it comes to resolving their own ethnic tensions, and reconciling majority rule with minority rights. Around this unsatisfactory core of the book are excursions into South Africa's familiar past, further predictions, and tenuously linked accounts of the author's experiences in Nigeria, Kenya, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. No new ground is broken in sections dealing with the effect of sanctions on the South African economy, the bloody rivalry between black political parties, or the well known story of Winnie Mandela and her gang of thugs. Fears of a violent backlash from the extreme white right are seen as exaggerated, although several South African cabinet ministers are not so confident. Perhaps Mallaby has fallen between two stools. In presenting South Africa's search for post-apartheid democracy against the wider backdrop of Africa's post-independence disaster, he has been able to do justice to neither. Of course he is right to stress the critical importance of land redistribution in post-apartheid South Africa, and it forms one of the most interesting chapters in the book. But a whistle stop examination of land policies in Tanzania, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe and Kenya, with a few paragraphs on Asia and South America thrown in, is not very helpful. Mallaby is at his best when reporting, rather than speculating or providing potted history. His account of an excursion aboard a South African company jet doing the rounds of its commercial outposts is as revealing as it is entertaining. The run takes in Malawi, which does not hide its trade with Pretoria; Mozambique, where the company managed the state-owned chicken farms; Zambia, where sanctions obliged the company to pose as British and route faxes from Johannesburg via London; and Zaire, where hens and hen-coops were flown in from South Africa in response to President Mobutu sese Seko's demand for a chicken farm. There was one problem. The hens were not laying, and the president was expecting distinguished guests. They would want to see results. So another plane was despatched, loaded with eggs, one to be tucked under each chicken. 'A European company would never have done that', said the shrewd South African chairman.</p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Relief as FDP discovers new crown prince in Kinkel THE great and good of Germany's troubled Free Democratic party descended on Stuttgart for their traditional Epiphany rally yesterday, ostensibly in search of three wise men. They came away with a crown prince, if not two. Mr Klaus Kinkel, top civil servant, one-time boss of the German intelligence service, now transformed into foreign minister, finally let it be known that he was willing to stand as the new party leader this summer. His decision was greeted with obvious relief and prolonged applause in the packed rows of the monumental state opera house, if not quite universal acclamation. He has, after all, been a full member of the party for rather less than two years. Yet he is undoubtedly seen as a great white hope by many members of the FDP, the liberal minority member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling coalition. The party has been battered in a series of local elections, and then rocked by the scandal which forced Mr Jurgen Mollemann - the man who might have been an alternative leader - to hand in his resignation as economics minister at the weekend. It urgently needs new blood to revive its public standing, and it seems to think the refreshingly blunt and often undiplomatic Mr Kinkel is what is needed. The second crown prince, who was not really confirmed, except by the incessant attention of photographers and TV cameras, was Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the man now regarded as most likely to be put forward as the new economics minister. Formerly the senator responsible for finance in the Berlin city council, then chairman of Citibank's subsidiary in Frankfurt, and now a board member of the Treuhand privatisation agency in the former East Germany, Mr Rexrodt was available for pictures (he turned up half an hour early), but not for comments. The party leadership and members of parliament will decide on whom to put forward tomorrow. If Mr Rexrodt was silent, Mr Kinkel was certainly not. He delivered an hour-long address on 'liberalism in the 1990s', to demonstrate to any remaining doubters his command of the full range of party policy. His most thoughtful remarks were on the subject of German identity, and the difference between the dangers of nationalism, and the alternative of 'honest patriotism'. His most passionate words were to condemn all forms of racism and right-wing extremism. He gave a grim warning, that Germany had once again reached a critical point in its history - as critical as in 1945. 'The confidence of our citizens in politics has reached a new low,' he said. 'Abroad, they are asking the question whether we are still reliable democrats ..' 'There is no cause for exaggerated fears, but there is reason for concern and careful thought. What is needed is political, spiritual and moral leadership, which will give our people back a confidence in their future, and will not gamble away Germany's reserves of trust abroad.' As for the ruling coalition, he pledged his firm loyalty to it - no doubt reassuring words for Chancellor Kohl. But he warned that the combination of financing east German recovery, cutting the budget deficit, controlling immigration, fighting extremism and organised crime, meant the government was facing a more complex series of challenges than any since the first governments after the war.</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / The Queens's Awards for Export Achievement 1993: An authority on women's bodies - A E Arthur WHEN Albert Edward Arthur started importing artificial flowers at Covent Garden, London, nearly 100 years ago, he unwittingly laid the foundation of a family company which is one of this year's more unusual award winners. A E Arthur, the family company which still bears his name, is one of only two in the world which supply dressmakers' dummies (the second, Adjustform of Ashford, Kent, is also British). About 20 years ago A E Arthur moved from Lambeth, South London, to Kings Lynn, Norfolk, where it now employs about 60 people. With a turnover of nearly Pounds 1.7m a year, it makes 70,000 lifesize female dummies of which 85 per cent are exported. Mr Eric Arthur, the present managing director and grandson of the founder, explains the evolution from imported artificial flowers to the present business: 'Initially we made wire frames for floral wreaths. In 1919, my grandfather widened the business to include foundations for dressmaking.' The artificial flowers still flourished - at one point the family had 15 shops in London. But the last closed 15 years ago when the Covent Garden fruit and vegetable market moved out of its historic site and dummies became the company's mainstay. They retail at about Pounds 120 and are sold for use in the home rather than in dressmaking salons. The original wire foundation has now been replaced by plastic. Thanks to its worldwide contacts, A E Arthur speaks with authority about global variations in the female form. 'In Australia we cater mainly for slender women', says Mr Arthur. But in Japan, the differences are even more pronounced - Japanese ladies' breasts, he says, 'are smaller, lower and further out'. This judgment is based on fieldwork carried out by A E Arthur's export agent. 'He went out on the streets and persuaded 1,000 women to let him take their measurements. He then sent us a papier mache model, on which we based our Japanese dummy.' For the names of its non-Japanese dummies, (which vary according to their adjustment mechanisms) A E Arthur turned to Greek legend: they are Diana, Venus and Athena. Not all its customers are nimble-fingered housewives, however. The company supplies dummies for exhibitions, such as that staged by the BBC a few years ago to display the spectacular costumes used in its drama series on the wives of King Henry the Eighth. Appropriately, they were all headless.</p>

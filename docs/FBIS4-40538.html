			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "L. Kuchma Uses CIA Forecasts To </F> Scare People"]    [Text] The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency predicts that  Ukraine will disintegrate this year for both ethnic and economic  reasons. This was stated by Ukrainian presidential candidate  Leonid Kuchma at a meeting with Zaporizhzhya residents at the  "Dniprospetsstal" industrial complex. Therefore, the entire  activity of the future president must be directed toward  maintaining peace and quiet. History offers Ukraine its last  chance to build an independent state. The road toward that is  through economic union with CIS countries and adherence to  current legislation.</p>

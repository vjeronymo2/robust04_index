			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ROOKIE MARSTON THE TRIPWIRE IN POLITICAL BATTLE  </P> <P> All rookie Assemblyman Jeff Marston (R-San Diego) ever wanted Friday night was  to stand up, make a short speech and watch as his legislative colleagues passed  the first -- and only -- bill of his three-month career.  </P> <P> But before he knew it, the unassuming Marston found himself as the flash point  in an angry political standoff between fellow Republicans and Assembly Speaker  Willie Brown that was partly responsible for dragging the 1990 session into  dramatic overtime.  </P> <P> Before it was over -- at 5:03 a.m. Saturday -- rebellious Republicans held $23  million in mental health programs hostage in Marston's name, the powerful  Democratic Speaker was forced to beat a procedural retreat, and the lowly San  Diego Republican became an instant figure of sympathy.  </P> <P> "I was the tripwire, that's pretty true," an exhausted and bleary-eyed Marston  said about the night's events.  </P> <P> "All I was trying to do was get the bill out," he said. "The tragedy is that I  think there have been a dozen Democrats that have come up to me and said,  'You're being  </P> <P> screwed. We want to help you out but we don't know what to do.' "  </P> <P> What happened to Marston illustrates that even the most routine item can become  a bizarre exercise in the frantic final days of a legislative session. At 10:15  p.m. Friday, Marston stood up on the Assembly floor to present the only piece  of legislation he had authored since narrowly winning a June special election  to represent the 78th District.  </P> <P> His bill proposed a 20% increase in fines against motorists who park illegally  in handicap zones, and the extra money would be earmarked to replace $2.1  million in budget cuts made to a state referral service for the elderly and  disabled.  </P> <P> Like many measures pulled out of the air in the waning days, Marston created  his proposal by amending its language into a second "spot bill" languishing in  the Assembly. As for all bills drafted this way, he had to make sure that his  new bill would be deemed germane to the measure it replaced -- in this case  another proposal relating to the disabled.  </P> <P> The Senate on Friday approved it before transmitting it to the Assembly for  what looked like a slam-dunk.  </P> <P> Yet when the measure arrived in the lower house Friday evening, Brown (D-San  Francisco) was waiting with a little surprise. The Speaker had set a trap,  quietly obtaining a legal opinion from the Legislature's counsel declaring the  Marston bill nongermane. When Marston tried to present the measure, Brown cut  him off, pointed to the opinion and threw the bill out.  </P> <P> Republicans were stunned. They immediately suspected political motives,  especially since the Speaker is heavily backing Marston's democratic challenger  in November, former San Diego City Councilman Mike Gotch.  </P> <P> "They did it for purely political reasons," said Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-La  Habra), Assembly Republican leader. "That's absolutely the belief."  </P> <P> Three sources close to Assembly Democrats also confirmed early Saturday that  Brown's handling of the Marston bill was politically inspired, an attempt to  deprive the rookie legislator of any bragging rights.  </P> <P> The maneuver, however, was to backfire.  </P> <P> Within minutes, the Assembly took up an unrelated bill to restore a $23 million  cut in mental health programs earlier this year. Under a bipartisan agreement,  the greatest share -- about $6.1 million -- was earmarked for Brown's own San  Francisco County.  </P> <P> The catch: Since the measure contained an appropriation, it required a  two-thirds super-majority for passage -- 54 "aye" votes out of the 80-member  Assembly. And since there are only 45 Democrats, that meant at least nine of  the 32 Republicans would have to go along. There are three vacancies.  </P> <P> "The Democrats, out of pure meanness, killed a program to help senior  citizens," said Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale). "And yet the Speaker, after  doing that blatant political act, wanted us to vote to give most of the mental  health funds to San Francisco."  </P> <P> So when it came time to vote for the Speaker's mental health funds, the  militant Republicans simply folded their arms and stared off into the night.  The slight to Marston prompted them to hold hostage the entire $23 million  mental health package.  </P> <P> And it didn't end there. Seven other measures -- some dear to the hearts of  other Democrats -- required the two-thirds vote as emergency bills. Sensing the  growing crisis, Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) tried to spring the  emergency measures by publicly asking Brown to rescind his germane rulings. The  Speaker summarily refused, thus assuring a deadlock.  </P> <P> At 12:15 a.m., the political grudge match deteriorated even further when one  Republican pointed out that the Assembly couldn't conduct business any longer  without a two-thirds vote. Brown suddenly declared the session over and soberly  walked off the podium, leaving Marston and the other lawmakers milling around  the floor in tired confusion.  </P> <P> "He (Brown) is in a box and he can't get out," Nolan said shortly after the  Speaker disappeared into his office across from the Assembly chambers. "He made  a mistake and he kept compounding it and compounding it. Maxine (Waters)  publicly and his friends privately tried to get him off his petard."  </P> <P> The Marston matter wasn't the only thing holding up the Assembly early  Saturday. Brown was waiting for nearly $3.3 billion in bond proposals to be  sent over from the Senate -- proposals that also required two-thirds votes.  </P> <P> While the fate of the bonds were not directly tied to the Marston stalemate,  Nolan and others indicated they were somehow bound up in the gestalt of the  evening.  </P> <P> Behind the scenes, prominent Democrats approached Brown and gently urged him to  defuse the political hostilities, say the Democratic sources. Among the  visitors was Assemblyman John Burton (D-San Francisco), whose district also  would have lost mental health funds, the sources said.  </P> <P> Eventually, a plan began to take form. Everyone would forget the Marston bill  that was ruled not germane earlier in the evening. Instead, the language would  be crammed into yet another spot bill lingering in the Senate, waiting for a  second chance.  </P> <P> The solution seemed ideal: A proud Brown would save face by not having to back  down publicly. Marston would save his only bill. And the Republicans would stop  the legislative blockade with their abstentions.  </P> <P> "It was obvious we had to find a way for a graceful exit," Assemblyman Tom  Hannigan (D-Fairfield) acknowledged.  </P> <P> Legislative staff members were dispatched to search computer records for a  suitable recipient of the Marston bill, while the rookie legislator walked  around the Assembly floor nervously, largely unaware of the effort to help him  save face.  </P> <P> By 2:20 a.m., a visibly relaxed and jovial Brown once again called the lower  house to order and asked for a two-thirds vote to resume the deadlocked  session. The Republicans delivered as part of a 62-3 vote.  </P> <P> The political logjam had been broken. When the Speaker asked for a  reconsideration of the $23 million mental health package, it passed with a  resounding 72-0 vote. Assembly members also began working on pieces of the bond  package.  </P> <P> By 3:40 a.m., the tenseness in the Capitol seemed to give way to relief. Down  the hall from the Assembly, Sen. Ken Maddy (R-Fresno) stood up before his peers  to present Marston's measure.  </P> <P> "Whatever happened in the Assembly, I have a bill to correct it, or at least  the feelings," he smiled, clutching the revived Marston bill.  </P> <P> Sen. Barry Keene (D-Benicia) jumped up. "Well, let's kill it and see what  happens," he said to peals of laughter.  </P> <P> Maddy continued, "I wish to amend this bill to include the author to be Mr.  Marston, which I think is the most important part." The knowing crowd roared  again.  </P> <P> With minimal debate, the Senate voted 34-2 to pass Marston's measure once more  at 3:50 a.m. Three minutes later, the bill was whisked into the Assembly  chambers and its newest member rose and finally got his chance.  </P> <P> "I want to thank all of my colleagues for their indulgences and respectfully  request an 'aye' vote," Marston said.  </P> <P> Speaker Brown, who had earlier quashed the measure, declared it passed by a  unanimous 77-0 roll call.  </P> <P> The irony: No one even had to push a vote button.  </P> <P> After Brown finally gavelled the 1990 session to a close at 5:03 a.m., he  maintained that his initial ruling on the Marston bill was correct.  </P> <P> "The Marston bill was a pure, unadulterated nongermane measure," he said. "You  have to absolutely respect the rules. You play around with the rules, you  rewrite the rules for your own purposes, and it becomes a process by which the  system totally breaks down.  </P> <P> "Pure and simply, that's all it was," he said.  </P> <P> Even after the vote, Marston admitted he didn't know what bill was plucked from  the Senate to salvage his measure. It was a bill pertaining to sexual battery.  </P> <P> Asked if he thought the new spot bill was germane, Marston managed a grin.  </P> <P> "Doesn't sound like it was," he said.  </P></p>

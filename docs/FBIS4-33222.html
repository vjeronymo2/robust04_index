			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 1 Jun (EFE) -- Israeli Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres emphasized in the Chilean capital today that in a  war there is no other alternative but to win, while in peacetime  there are the alternatives of negotiation and reaching agreement.    During an official visit to Chile, Peres discussed in the  Chilean Chamber of Deputies the Middle East peace process.    In his speech the Israeli minister stressed that his country  has chosen peace, and has engaged in the quest for the required  agreements with the Palestinians. He added that after the  historic agreements that have been achieved, Israel hopes to do  the same with its Arab neighbors.    Shim'on Peres emphasized that it is necessary for all  nations  to support the peace process, which is "the only way to build a  new Middle East."    In his visit to the Chilean Congress, in the port of  Valparaiso 125 km west of Santiago, Peres also met Senate  President Gabriel Valdes and Chamber of Deputies President Jorge  Schaulsohn.    Peres's visit to Chile was the last leg of a Latin American  tour that also included Mexico and Colombia. Peres returned to  his country today. The tour is part of the Israeli authorities'  policy of enhancing ties with Latin America. According to Peres,  the Israeli authorities view Latin America as having great  economic and trade potential.    During his visit Peres engaged in many activities, including  a meeting with President Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle and working  meetings with Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa, Defense Minister  Edmundo Perez Yoma, and Agriculture Ministry officials.    Before visiting Congress, Peres met with Chilean  entrepreneurs, with whom he reviewed the possibilities of  increasing trade and mutual investment.    After his arrival on 31 May, Peres held a news conference in  which he confirmed Israel's decision to pursue the Middle East  peace talks. He announced that after the agreement reached with  the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), these talks would  be pursued with Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon.    The Israeli minister expressed his optimism over the  Palestinian process of autonomy in Gaza and Jericho.  Nevertheless, he described as "painful and old-fashioned" the  language recently used by PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat, and his  hints at a "holy war."    Peres stressed that the PLO is not now carrying out any  terrorist actions. He said he trusts this situation will not be  reversed. Peres emphasized that, in the long agenda that is  still pending, "the wind is blowing favorably."    Shim'on Peres and his Chilean counterpart, Carlos Figueroa,  signed an agreement removing the visa requirement for the two  countries. This agreement will especially facilitate the visits  of entrepreneurs. Visits by entrepreneurs and bilateral trade  have both increased.    According to official figures, in the past two years Chilean  exports to Israel grew from $5.3 million in 1992 to $13.6  million in 1993, a trend that remains unchanged.    Peres offered his country's full cooperation for a program  to  reclaim desert land in northern Chile and for technological and  scientific transfers.</p>

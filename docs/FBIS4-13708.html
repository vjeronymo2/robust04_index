			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 21, IRNA -- A morning English daily  here Thursday [21 April] pointed to the escalated attacks by the  Hamas freedom movement against the Zionists in recent weeks and  said that Israel should face up to the fact that Hamas is a  Palestinian reality which aims to blow up the Gaza-Jericho  "Trojan horse."    The only success of the Gaza-Jericho accord is that it has  changed the nature of the 46 years of anti-Zionist struggle from  demanding total independence to seeking partial autonomy, said  the `TEHRAN TIMES' in its editorial. It noted that the armed  struggle against Israel by Hamas was the result of the world  community's inability and unwillingness to end the illegal  presence of Zionists in Palestine. Armed attacks of Hamas are a  natural and justified reaction to Israel's intransigence, said  the paper, adding that the Zionists had showen repeatedly that  the only language they understand "comes from the barrel of a  gun."    The basic stand of Hamas stemed from religious beliefs, and  war was not considered sacred to Hamas, but was used as a means  to achieve an end, it noted.    The Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) "can give away  the rights of its followers by signing the Gaza-Jericho accord.  But, by the same token, Hamas has as much right to choose the  path of its struggle against the Zionist occupiers," it said.  The daily concluded by saying that Palestinians desired justice  more than they need peace and Hamas held the view that peace  without reinstatement of full Palestinians rights, was not  preferable to war.</p>

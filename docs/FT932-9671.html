			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Clinton seeks to contain Bosnian war PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday promised 'some more' steps to encourage peace in the Bosnian civil war and to help confine the conflict. However, he appears to have gone back to the drawing board in his efforts to find a Bosnian policy, placing much more emphasis on measures to prevent the violence spreading beyond Bosnia. Among the measures Mr Clinton is considering is sending US troops to join United Nations observers in Macedonia, as a safeguard against the conflict spilling over into other areas of the former Yugoslavia. However, White House officials said yesterday that no decision was imminent. The president is also contemplating placing monitors along the border between Bosnia and Serbia to see if the Serbian government fulfils its promise to cut off all but humanitarian supplies to the Bosnian Serbs. Last week, Clinton administration officials were arguing for an end to the UN arms embargo which has hampered the Bosnian Moslems in their efforts to defend themselves against the much better-armed Bosnian Serbs. They were also pressing for the embargo coupled with a short campaign of air strikes to hold the Serbian militias in check until the Moslems could be rearmed. Although US officials deny there has been any change in that policy, there has been a shift of emphasis, in recognition of the reluctance of several European allies to see the arms embargo lifted. At the least, a policy of containment is now twinned with the goal of ending the violence within Bosnia. Those who have criticised the Europeans include Senator Richard Lugar, the senior foreign policy spokesman for the Republican opposition, and, more shrilly, Senator Joseph Biden, the Democratic chairman of a Senate subcommittee on European affairs. Senator Lugar said: 'We really do want the British and the French to be on board. We want support from the Germans and the Russians and other Europeans who really ought to be with us on this situation and are not quite there yet. 'I see the president moving steadily and trying to move our allies steadily, and the people who will need to vote for Security Council authorisation of force steadily,' Mr Lugar added. Others acknowledge, however, that doubts remain within the administration, and still more so within the Congress, over what policy to pursue. While some congressional leaders fiercely advocate military intervention, the rank-and-file of both parties in Congress are still deeply reluctant to become embroiled in a war that could come to resemble Vietnam. Mr Clinton said in a radio interview yesterday morning that he wanted 'to make sure that there is no Vietnam', but said that wanting to avoid the mistakes made in Vietnam did not mean that the US should do nothing. 'The big difference from the point of view of the average American is I have made it very clear that the United States, unlike in Vietnam, is not about to act alone,' Mr Clinton said.</p>

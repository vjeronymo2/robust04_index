			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / UK Company News: Blue Circle falls 51% to Pounds 124m: Sharp drop in demand experienced in main markets BLUE CIRCLE Industries, the cement and building products group, suffered sharp falls in demand in the UK and US, its main markets, and profits dropped from Pounds 195m to Pounds 124.2m before tax in 1991. Mr Jim McColgan, managing director, said that the year had turned out worse than expected and proved one of the most difficult in business history. So far there were few signs of economic improvement in the UK and US. The shares fell 13p to 272p. The 36 per cent profit drop was on sales down 8.3 per cent to Pounds 1.1bn. Operating profits, after an exceptional item of Pounds 16.5m, fell a quarter to Pounds 147m, and there was a rise in interest payable from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 22.8m. The dividend is maintained at 11.25p with a proposed final of 7.5p. The dividend is covered by fully diluted earnings per share of 13.6p (22.9p). However, an extraordinary charge of Pounds 26m covering the losses and costs of disposing of the garden products business, meant there was a retained loss of Pounds 12.2m (profit Pounds 53m). A 17 per cent drop in UK cement volumes caused operating profits in that division to halve to Pounds 32.9m after Pounds 8m of redundancy costs. A full year's contribution from BCI's 50 per cent owned Danish cement company was Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 1.1m). In the US cement operating profits fell 38 per cent to Pounds 11.5m. These difficult markets were partly offset by strong demand in Chile and Malaysia. Chilean profits were up 16 per cent to Pounds 14.8m, of which Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 3.7m) was returned to the UK. Malaysian profits were up a third to Pounds 16m, with Pounds 5.2m (Pounds 7.5m) cash sent to the UK. In Africa, weaker demand in South Africa cut profits from Pounds 19.2m to Pounds 17.7m. The South African associate has been sold since the year end. Cash returned to the UK was Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 5.8m). The home products division, which BCI has been building up through acquisitions, almost maintained profits at Pounds 42.6m (Pounds 42.9m) although this included a Pounds 6.4m pension credit. The Potterton Myson heating side increased profits, but the Armitage Shanks bathrooms business bore a Pounds 7.5m exceptional provision against the costs of closing a factory. A full year from the Italian sanitaryware company bought in July 1990 meant higher profits there. The New World gas cooker subsidiary cut its losses. The property division saw profits fall from Pounds 15.3m to Pounds 11.6m with both commercial and residential property down. There was a Pounds 44.2m increase in borrowings, as cash flow from operations failed to cover capital expenditure and acquisitions. The depreciation charge of Pounds 78m compared with Pounds 74m of capital expenditure. At the year end net borrowings were Pounds 305.7m excluding the Pounds 90m convertible capital bond. See Lex</p>

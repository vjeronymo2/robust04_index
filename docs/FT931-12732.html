			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Record French trade surplus FRANCE produced a record FFr30.55bn (Pounds 3.71bn) trade surplus last year, a sharp turnaround from the FFr29.55bn deficit in 1991, thanks to a gain in market share by industrial exporters and a slowdown in demand for imports. Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, said the result was the fruit of French companies' rigorous control of wages and other costs, which had improved their competitiveness by 10 per cent over the past five years. They would continue to gain market share, up by nearly a percentage point to 7.4 per cent in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development over the past three years, despite the recent declines in some European currencies, he predicted. The result, the biggest reversal of nearly 13 years of French trade deficits, is vital good economic news when the Socialist government is facing electoral defeat partly because of its inability to reduce record unemployment of 10.5 per cent. The news helped strengthen the franc against the D-Mark yesterday, a further sign that it may be recovering from the recent waves of speculative selling of the French currency.</p>

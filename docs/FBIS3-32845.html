Edgar Batres, National Federation of State Workers Unions  leader, told ACAN-EFE following a demonstration attended by  approximately 1,000 employees, that beginning today partial  strikes will take place at 50 percent of government offices and  that by Friday the strike will be total.    Meanwhile, Labor and Social Security Minister Anabella  Morfin  reiterated today that the government has not dismissed the  possibility of filing a lawsuit against the employees who leave  their jobs because the government will not tolerate the  employees adopting illegal measures if they do not first exhaust  the possibilities of dialogue. "If they are to be paid they must  work," said Morfin, who has asked the labor leaders to  reconsider.    Hour-long strikes have been held every day to demand a 40  percent salary increase and they have continued despite De  Leon's threats of punishment. According to Batres, 180,000 state  employees will not show up for work on Friday.    "We are not going to stop," said Bernardino Arriaza, a  Postal  Workers Union leader, who explained that the increase they are  requesting is an adjustment to the inflation accumulated between  1992 and 1994. During the demonstration, labor leaders  criticized President de Leon for his economic policy, which they  described as neoliberal, and they demanded his resignation.</p>

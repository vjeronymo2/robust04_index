Under the new situation of reform and opening up in recent  years, many leading cadres have taken note of going deep into  the realities of life, doing investigations and studies, and  creatively implementing central principles and policies in  connection with practice, and they have scored gratifying  achievements. However, there are also some comrades who have  slackened their efforts to conduct investigation and study.  According to these people, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics has outlined the  blueprint, the party's basic line has illuminated the direction,  and reform and opening up have been practiced for more than a  decade. Hence, no major problems are likely to crop up.  Believing that they are proficient and familiar with their  jobs, they are not willing to go deep into the realities of life  and maintain contacts with the masses. Instead of doing  meticulous investigation and study, they are satisfied with  reading documents and listening to reports. They are used to  sitting in offices, issuing orders, and willfully making policy  decisions. Consequently, this gives rise to subjectivism, or  sticking to old conventions which lag behind the masses and the  situation, or blindly seeking advanced growth which is beyond  one's capacity.    To prevent the occurrence of these problems, it is necessary  to conduct investigation and study in a thorough manner and to  guard against subjectivism. The year 1994 is a very crucial one  for China's reform, opening up, and modernization program. The  pace of reform has been accelerated and its endurance is great.  As the establishment of a socialist market economic system is a  brand new topic, leading cadres are pupils in this issue. We  should correctly understand and handle relations between reform,  development, and stability; correctly understand and handle the  two different types of contradictions; earnestly study the form  of expression and development trend of the contradictions among  the people in the new situation; and particularly take note of  the new problems arising from the adjustment of the relations  and structure of interests in the course of deepened reform.  Hence, it is necessary to go deep into the realities of life,  conduct investigation and study, apply Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to  analyze and resolve problems, overcome difficulties, and forge  ahead.    To do a good job of investigation and study, the most  important thing is to attentively listen to the voice of the  masses and have a comprehensive understanding of the true  situation of the grass-roots levels. It will be impossible for  leaders to have a clear idea of the true situation of the  grass-roots levels by just scratching the surface, doing things  perfunctorily, and making cursory observations. Investigation  and study require a correct guiding ideology and prevention of  subjectivism. Taking several bags with them before conducting  investigation and study, some cadres are good at carefully  watching the situation. They offer whatever the higher  authorities want and regard whatever their superior say as the  truth. Therefore, it is necessary to proceed from objective  reality in conducting investigation. Besides going to the rich  and advanced regions, they should also go to the poor and  backward regions. Besides listening to good-sounding words, they  should also listen to words and advice unpleasant to the ear.  Instead of going to the grass-roots levels with a predetermined  conclusion and framework, they should insist on the practice of  drawing conclusions after conducting investigation and study,  which should be based on scientific representation. It is  necessary to seriously analyze and study the new problems and  experiences occurring in reform and opening up. We should not  hastily negate the newly emerging things which conform to reform  and development or speak highly of and laud erroneous behavior  which goes counter to the socialist market economy. It is  necessary to seriously analyze the root cause of the negative  phenomena cropping in the course of reform and to propose ways  to resolve them. Through investigation, it is necessary to  study how to integrate the line, principles, and policies of the  central authorities with the practice of the local departments  and units and continue to create a new situation.    Comrade Mao Zedong had a motto: "No investigation, no right  to speak." While doing revolution and construction in the past,  we had benefited a lot from seriously conducting investigation  and study, and also suffered from subjectivism. We must firmly  bear in mind both positive and negative experiences. Now the  enthusiasm of all localities is running high and a number of  localities have proposed new ideas for implementing the ideas of  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee.  This is indeed gratifying. However, we must have grounds for  all this as well as resolute measures for implementation. As  the great cause of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics will encounter numerous tasks and changes with  each passing day, leading cadres at all levels shoulder heavy  responsibility. Under such circumstances, it is particularly  necessary to sincerely take practice as the classroom and the  masses as teachers, constantly improve work style and methods,  and remarkably accomplish tasks.</p>

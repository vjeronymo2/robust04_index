TRUD on the Federation Council's first meeting: "The first  meeting of the Federation Council did not at all resemble the  vociferous and ungovernable gatherings of the Congress of  People's deputies, or vice versa, the too 'manageable' meetings  of the dissolved Supreme Soviet."    The newspaper describes the social status of the deputies to  the Federation Council: 152 out of 171 deputies are white-collar  workers. Among them, representatives from regional legislative  and executive power bodies constitute a considerable proportion.  Eight deputies are entrepreneurs, three are farmers. There is  one military officer. Seven are jobless. There are no  industrial workers among the deputies.    TRUD also points to high educational qualifications of the  parliamentarians: there are ten professors, and 19 candidates of  science (12--in the field of economics, 5--technology, and 2--  philosophy)    In ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, Ivan Kivelidi, chairman of the  Entrepreneurship Council to the Russian Government and general  director of the Interagro Foreign Economic Association, reflects  on whether the parliament will manage to undo the `Gordian knot'  of economic problems.    Emphasising the need to draw up a market-oriented liberal  legislation, Kivelidi points out as follows: "There are plenty  of entrepreneurs in the new parliament. In my view, people, who  can find unconventional solutions inn an extreme situation  marking the establishment of market relations, may well  constitute a creative backbone in parliament".    ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA runs an account of the meetings of the  Federal Assembly houses under the headline "Good Luck to You,  the Parliament of Russia".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the U.S. President's upcoming visit  to  Moscow. The newspaper writes that the distinguishing feature of  the forthcoming Moscow summit will be the participation of yet  another leader in it, namely, Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk.    A tri-partite agreement will be a "giant step for global  security", the newspaper quotes Clinton as saying. "Accords  that are expected to be reached during the two leaders' talks  are certain to be of benefit to Russia, particularly considering  the latest actions of the West which conceded to Moscow over the  NATO enlargement issue, which has shown once again which aspect  of U.S. foreign policy is a priority".    PRAVDA views the forthcoming summit in Moscow in a somewhat  different way. "It is the first time that the leader of the only  remaining superpower after the break-up of the Soviet Union  calls on the president of Russia. In this respect, the  forthcoming summit is a historic one.    "The lack of parity in relations with Washington is the main  flaw of the Moscow summit. Without equality, one can hardly  count on stable and long-term results".    ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA on the same subject: "The first meeting  between the Russian and American presidents in Moscow promises  to be rather productive. The American President arrives in  Moscow on Wednesday night with considerable achievements in his  foreign policy activities which will, doubtless, be rather  highly evaluated in Moscow".    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on the arrest and release of two  Russian  generals in Latvia. The newspaper carries an item headlined  "Russian Generals in Latvian Handcuffs", about the unlawful  actions of Latvian authorities against the two Russian military  officers. "Latvia and Russia found themselves on the verge of an  armed conflict after two Russian generals were forcibly driven  into the forest.    "The incident, it seems, has been settled. However, would  the issue end at that? A local newspaper still continues to  publish lists of officers and members of the families of Russian  servicemen, with their residential addresses and places of work  indicated..."</p>

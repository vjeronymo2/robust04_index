			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Chuan Likphai yesterday urged ASEAN  countries to take a unified stand against foreign interference  in the Cambodian civil war.    "ASEAN is in a good position to voice opposition to any  foreign interference in Cambodia's internal affairs and to  oppose foreign (arms) assistance to any of the Cambodian  parties," he said.    King Sihanouk said last week that foreign military  assistance  to the Cambodian government might be the only way to end the war  with the Khmer Rouge.    An Australian government official said in Canberra on Friday  that the Phnom Penh government had approached Australia, the  United States, France and "some ASEAN countries" for weapons.    The six-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations  (ASEAN)  comprises Thailand, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines  and Singapore. Thailand has repeatedly warned against outside  interference in Cambodia's affairs.    Chuan reiterated yesterday that his government preferred a  nonmilitary solution to the conflict. The seemingly endless war  would only be fuelled further by fresh supplies of weapons, and  this would have a direct affect on Thailand, he added. However,  the prime minister opined it was the Cambodian government's  "sovereign right to ask for a foreign arms supply".    Thailand, smarting under allegations it denies that it still  supports the Khmer Rouge, has been unsuccessful in previous  attempts to convince its ASEAN partners of the need for a  unified stand against foreign interference in Cambodia.    Despite well-earned world praise for ASEAN's earlier  cohesiveness in policies towards Cambodia, a meeting of senior  officials from the six nations in Thailand last month could not  reach a consensus on the situation there.    Phnom Penh will be invited as a special guest to the annual  ASEAN meetings to be held in Bangkok in July, when the situation  in Cambodia will be a topic of concern.    Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan yesterday urged  France and Indonesia, as co-chairmen of the Paris Peace  Conference, to call for consultations among all 19 signatories  to the Paris peace agreement on the question of foreign arms  supplies. They include the US, France and Australia.    "The issue now is that even Western arms suppliers have no  consensus on whether to supply arms to Cambodia," Surin told  reporters upon his return from Saudi Arabia.</p>

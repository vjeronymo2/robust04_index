			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Members of the diplomatic mission resident in  Uganda visited Kasensero landing site in Rakai District,  following reports of large numbers of bodies landing there after  being carried to Lake Victoria from the River Kagera. The tour  was organized by urban task force to show the diplomats the  seriousness of the matter. The diplomats, who were led by the  country director of the USAID, Mr. Keith Sharper, were  accompanied by the minister of state for internal affairs, Mr.  Tom Butime, and the chairman of the pan- African congress,  Colonel Kahinda Otafiire.    During the tour, the chairman of the urban task force, Mr.  (Mike Mukula), revealed that, according to an aerial survey  conducted last week, an estimated 40,000 floating bodies are on  Uganda's part of Lake Victoria. He said this is a big threat to  the people who live along the shores, as they directly use lake  water.    At Kasensero landing site, by yesterday, an average of 80  bodies were being reclaimed per hour. Mr. (Mukula) said already  600 hundred bodies had been observed approaching Mpigi, and if  the situation is not contained, the beaches in Gaba and Entebbe  may soon be affected.    After the tour of the landing site, the diplomats attended a  burial mass for the reclaimed bodies at Kitoma Village, seven km  from the landing site. The mass, conducted by Archbishop  Emmanuel Wamalwa of Kampala, attracted hundreds of wananchi  [citizens] in the area, and Rwandese refugees in Uganda. The  archbishop prayed for the return of sanity in Rwanda, and urged  Ugandan Christians to pray for the war-torn country.    The resident director of USAID, Mr. Sharper, termed events  in  Rwanda as a step backwards in the development of human race. He  said such a problem knows no boundaries, and thanked Uganda for  tackling the problem of floating bodies without hesitation.    Speaking on behalf of African diplomats, Ambassador  (Leonidas  Habyarimana) of Burundi urged African countries to cultivate  mature politics, in order to avoid acts similar to the Rwandan  crisis. He regretted that, while Africa has a big potential  wealth, bad politics is tearing the continent. He called for an  immediate end to the situation.    The British high commissioner, Mr. Edward Clay, termed the  situation in Rwanda as a shame to modern society. He said it  was sad that events that characterized Rwanda 30 years ago are  happening again at a time when peace is crucial.    The NRC [National Resistance Council] member for (Kakoto),  Rakai District, Mr. (Manuel Pinto), challenged Kenya and  Tanzania to join Uganda in the efforts of cleaning Lake  Victoria. He urged Ugandans to unite and love one another, as  hatred is the source of problems similar to what is happening in  Rwanda. [passage omitted]</p>

The European regional headquarters of the National Alliance  for the Country's Reunification, in a statement, expressed a  surging indignation at the introduction of patriots and other  sophisticated weapons into South Korea by the United States,  saying it is increasing the war crisis on the Korean peninsula.    Kim Chong-su, chairman of the Association of Koreans in  Japan  for Peaceful Reunification, said in a press statement:    The United States is sending its military intelligence team  and a large quantity of latest-type weapons to South Korea and  scheming large-scale military exercises there. This is an  unpardonable criminal act intended to keep hold on South Korea  as its colony and military base and, furthermore, into its  nuclear forward base, military information-gathering centre and  to lead the situation of the Korean peninsula to the grave brink  of war.    The Federation of South Koreans in Japan for Democracy and  Unification in a statement strongly urged the United States to  withdraw at once the projected Patriots deployment in South  Korea and stop all kinds of war games including the provocative  "Team Spirit" joint military exercises.</p>

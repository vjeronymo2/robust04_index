			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 6 (XINHUA) -- China will map out a  package of social security system and grassroots political power  construction strategy at next week's national conference on  civil affairs.    Yang Jianchang, spokesman of the Ministry of Civil Affairs,  said here today that the government has decided to hold a  national conference next week to work out a social security  system development program, and improve grassroots political  power construction for the next five years.    The meeting, which is scheduled for May 12-16, will also try  to find solutions for outstanding problems on civil affairs,  cropping out as China is moving toward a market economy.    One of the problems is a lack of relief fund to help the  victims of natural calamities, the poor, and childless old  people who cannot support themselves.    Minister of Civil Affairs Doje Cering said that normally the  victims of natural calamities number 200 million in China a year.    During the past five years, China has for the first time  since 1949 encouraged individuals and institutions at home and  abroad to provide donations or aid for the victims, the poor and  other people that need help.    Meanwhile, in addition to local governments' aid, the  central  government has allocated a total amount of 6.4 billion yuan and  8.7 billion kg of grain for victims of serious natural disasters.    Together with 2.35 billion yuan donated by people at home  and  overseas, about 200 million victims received disaster relief,  the spokesman said.    The ministry also has "villagers' autonomy" started in 58  demonstration counties, which was designed to enable the  villagers to enjoy more freedom, such as the right to select  heads of their villages through election, to supervise the  villages' heads and have more say in the villages' affairs.    The minister described the grass-root democracy as important  to the stability of the rural areas, home to about 900 million  farmers, and social development.    Commenting on the reports that China is planning to  introduce  "villagers' autonomy" to all the other villages by the year  2000, the spokesman said it is only a matter under consideration.</p>

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Shell and Esso look at floating platform Shell and Esso are evaluating the use of a floating production and storage platform to develop small oil reserves in the central North Sea. It is the first time the two partners have considered using anything other than conventional fixed platforms in the North Sea. The floating production and storage platforms are likely to be seen more frequently in UK waters in future because of their lower capital costs and greater flexibility. New technology allows them to maintain precise positions - even in bad weather. They figure prominently in plans to exploit smaller reserves which do not justify the expense of building fixed platforms. Shell and Esso say the use of a floating system should also cut lead times in developing the new fields. A Pounds 12m contract to design a prototype platform has been awarded to a Swiss company. The partners will decide later this year whether to go ahead with construction of the vessel. It would cost about Pounds 230m and would initially be used to exploit the Teal discovery, east of Aberdeen.</p>

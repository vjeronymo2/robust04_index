			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Clout of a specialist - The advantages of centralised media buying in a fragmented US market A shake-up in the way television and press advertising is bought and sold across the US is likely following last week's announcement that Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's UK media-buying company Zenith is crossing the Atlantic. From January, Zenith will be trying to persuade US advertisers to act more like Europeans - consolidating their vast advertising budgets and placing responsibility for the purchasing of airtime and press space with media specialists, away from the 'creative' side of the advertising business. Zenith, already well established across Europe, will instantly become the US's single biggest media buyer, with billings of about Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn). This will be achieved by bringing together the media-buying functions of the Saatchi group's three US advertising networks - Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising, Bates USA and Campbell Mithun Esty. Further ahead, Zenith's intention is to attract third-party custom from outside the three networks, as it has done, for example, in the UK - where more than half its business comes from non-Saatchi group advertising agency clients. Until now the US market has largely operated along traditional 'full-service' agency lines. This has been partly because of the fragmentary nature of the US media - it is easier to function as a specialist buyer when there is a single national market, dominated by a handful of media owners, as is the case in most European countries. But John Perriss, Zenith chairman, argues that it is the complexity of the US scene which justifies the media specialist's existence. The primary advantage to advertisers of centralised buying with one specialist agency is the price reduction obtained by making bulk purchases from media owners. Perriss argues that his business is about more than just crude pricing. 'It is about the complex new media environment. The average home in the US now has 38 TV channels.' Zenith's function will be to advise advertisers on the optimum mix of channels to deliver the required audience at the lowest cost, and to guide them on new media opportunities, as well as providing clout in price negotiations with network owners, says Perriss. Zenith is emphasising its investment in state-of-the-art information technology: all 250 employees in its eight offices will be linked by PCs capable of working in multimedia formats, so that advertisements and programme clips can be viewed while negotiations with media owners are taking place. The Saatchi group has not been the only organisation to invest in specialist media buying in the US. Last month, for example, the US advertising group Interpublic announced it was buying Western International Media, the country's largest independent buyer, although it said it had no plans to combine the media operations of its constituent agencies, which include McCann-Erickson, Lintas and Lowe. Other individual agencies have been establishing arm's-length media outfits. Clients have also started 'unbundling' media buying from the creative side of their advertising purchasing, for which two or three agencies could be used. Indeed, it is movement from clients which has finally persuaded the Saatchi group to press ahead with Zenith's entry into the US: Procter &amp; Gamble took its network TV buying away from the US Saatchi agency, while Bates lost TV buying for Mars - in both cases the work went to agency DMB&amp;B. The move to specialist media buying in the US will undoubtedly be good for clients, says Neil Blackley, media analyst with Goldman Sachs. But he wonders whether it will turn out to be the 'start of a slippery slope' for the advertising agencies and their investors. The moment that 'unbundling' begins, agency remuneration comes under intense scrutiny and margins are eroded. If an advertiser is paying the traditional 15 per cent commission to an agency, and can suddenly get media buying for 3-4 per cent as the market becomes more competitive, that leaves the 'creative' side of the job costing 11 per cent. Blackley says the advertiser may decide that looks too steep, and commission may be cut to say 8 per cent. This erosion of margins and cannibalisation of existing business has been the pattern in Europe. The real advantage to Zenith will come when it starts to pull in third-party business and win new clients among those advertisers who are in the process of media consolidation. Blackley says: 'The first person into the market - as we've seen with Murdoch and his price cutting on newspapers in the UK - takes the major benefit. If they can demonstrate they're getting a real advantage for their clients, then they're going to start winning more than their fair share of consolidation business and their third-party billings will go up. It's bound to create a response from other agencies.'</p>

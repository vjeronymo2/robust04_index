			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President's Office chief Andrius Meskauskas </F> by Raimonda Rameliene in Vilnius; date not given: "A Year in  the Life of the President's Office: The Work With the President  Was Free of Reservations and Doubts"]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted]    [Rameliene]Can one say that the president has a good,  powerful, and competent team?    [Meskauskas] The absolute majority of those who work here  have come to work for the president without any reservations and  doubts. Certainly, not all of them understood immediately how  they should work. The president is very tactful, friendly, and  sincere but he is also a demanding person and he does not like  to repeat things twice. All of us try to perform our duties as  honestly as possible.    [Rameliene]The president's staff lead quite a settled  way of life. Only one "ordinary" adviser and the chief one  [Rajeckas was appointed ambassador to Great Britain] left over  the first year. By the way, was it impossible to realize before  the first anniversary that the position of the chief adviser is  unnecessary?    [Meskauskas] The question could be whether the function of  the chief adviser was interpreted correctly. The president, as  well as the majority of our staff, likes to deal with people  directly -- with those who directly analyze some problem, work  on some issue, and so on. Certainly, Mr. R. Rajeckas is a man  with extraordinary skills. However, such were the  circumstances. I do not know whether we will retain this  position in the future or not.    [Rameliene]People say that another adviser will soon  leave for a Lithuanian Embassy abroad.    [Meskauskas]I really do not know and cannot say  anything about this.    [Rameliene] In your opinion, which of the links at the  President's Office is the weakest?    [Meskauskas] I do not even know. Sometimes these links may  lack coordination. We have three structures: Advisers with  their own experts, the economic division, and the chancellery  which engages in certain bureaucratic work. Therefore,  sometimes we really have slight misunderstandings in our  relations. We are trying to overcome them. [passage omitted]    [Rameliene]How would you define relations between the  president and the Seimas [parliament]? Do you not think that  there would be fewer problems if you did not live under the same  roof?    [Meskauskas] To a certain degree, yes. The presidential  institution would be clearly separated from the Seimas.    We have not had any more serious problems in our relations  with the legislature. True, the president rejected a couple of  draft laws and sent them back to the Seimas for repeated  consideration. However, this is normal -- both the parliament  and the president can make mistakes.    Eventually, one of the president's duties is to stabilize  contradictions among different political forces. It is  difficult to achieve this now: Both the community and the  Seimas are very much divided. I think, however, that no one  could reprimand the president for supporting only one force.    [Rameliene] Nevertheless, some members of the  Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party faction say that it is as if  people from the President's Office are trying to raise  themselves above the Seimas....    [Meskauskas] None of us really intends to do so. However,  one of the most important principles for the existence of a  normal state is a clear and strict division of powers. Thus, we  are seeking its implementation. In other words, we want the  Seimas, the government, and the president whose functions are  quite clearly defined in the Constitution to each do their work  and not to interfere with the others.    The president signs draft laws adopted by the Seimas. Thus,  his advisers are primarily interested in the logic of these  documents. As I have mentioned, it is this logic that they  failed to find several times.    [Rameliene]Have you not had any conflicts with the  majority faction because of that?    [Meskauskas] Not any serious ones. [passage omitted]    [Rameliene]You have known A. Brazauskas for many years.  Do you think that he has changed after becoming president?    [Meskauskas] Probably not. I particularly appreciate that  he has remained sincere. He praises us rather seldom, but we  are not small children. If something is wrong, he tells about  this immediately, without beating about the bush. He has always  been exacting and industrious.    In general, his life over the past several years has not  been  easy. While in the opposition, he was spited on and berated by  anyone who would take the trouble. All this left a certain  impression on him as if suppressing his vitality. The president  is indeed a very lively person by nature.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kenneth Gooding in London and John Lloyd in </F> Moscow: "De Beers in Russian Diamond Accord"]    [Text] De Beers of South Africa stepped back from a  potentially serious conflict yesterday by agreeing to consider  changes to its $5bn (3.3bn pound) diamond marketing contract  with Russia.    At the same time the Russian government representatives  agreed "to take necessary steps" to stop rough (uncut) diamonds  leaking from Russia through unofficial channels to the west  where they threatened to destabilise the market.    Trade sources suggested that, after the Russians were  publicly rebuked by De Beers in December for breaking the  contract, the flow of unofficial diamonds eased but recently it  had been increasing again.    There were sighs of relief in the diamond trade yesterday  because Russia supplies about 25 per cent of the diamonds De  Beers sells through its London-based Central Selling  Organisation [CSO]. The CSO controls more than 80 per cent of  the world's trade in rough diamonds.    In 1990 De Beers lent Russia $1bn, shipped some of the  Russian stockpile to London as collateral and signed the  five-year marketing agreement. This permits Russia to sell 5  per cent of its rough diamond output directly to the west for  "market testing".    While there are no indications that Russia wished to end the  contract with the world's most successful cartel, some officials  have been pressing for the federation to keep a bigger share.  Mr Yevgeniy Bychkev, head of Komdragment, the Russian diamond  and precious stones committee, who was in the Russian  negotiating team this week, is demanding that Russia be able to  keep 25 per cent of its rough diamond trade.    The De Beers team was headed by Mr Nicholas Oppenheimer, its  deputy chairman and chairman of the CSO. According to diamond  trade sources he stepped in at the last moment because  relationships had become strained.    Mr Gary Ralfe, who negotiated the Russian contract and  publicly castigated Russia for breaking it, was previously  expected to head the De Beers team. He was in Moscow with Mr  Oppenheimer, however. Mr Richard Wake-Walker, previously De  Beers' representative in Moscow, quit the group recently after  being replaced by Mr Ray Clark. The Diamantaire trade  newsletter suggested Mr Wake-Walker "advocated a flexible  negotiating strategy with Russia while Mr Ralfe and Mr Clark  appear to be taking a tough, no-concessions approach".    The large delegation with which Russia faced Mr Oppenheimer  included representatives from the Sakha diamond-producing  region, as well as the Russian diamond committee and the  Ministries of Finance and Foreign Economic Affairs -- among whom  the right approach is still being debated. Russia's need for  increased income from exports has been aggravated by the recent  fall in the oil price, its main export earner -- and by the  virtual disappearance of its manufactured goods from the world  market.    A joint communique yesterday said "the parties remain  committed to the existing agreement, pending their agreeing on  any modification. They are also committed to the stability of  the international diamond market and to taking the necessary  steps to curtail Russian rough gem diamonds reaching the market  outside the current marketing arrangements."</p>

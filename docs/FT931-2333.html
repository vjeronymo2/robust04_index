			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Molins' shares rise on 29% advance SHARES in Molins out-performed the stock market yesterday with a 19p jump to 479p as the tobacco machinery and packaging group announced a 29 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 14.2m to Pounds 18.3m for 1992. Mr Michael Orr, chairman, said the company had achieved the improved profits through increased penetration of international markets and cost reductions. The company has adopted the FRS 3 accounting standard. The reported pre-tax profits for 1991 were Pounds 15.5m. A 17 per cent rise in sales to Pounds 181m (Pounds 155m) was the result of both volume increases and gains on currency transactions. Mr Orr was bullish about prospects for the current year, saying further progress would be made. 'We like making money as well as machinery,' he said, 'and the outlook for Molins is really quite good.' The total dividend was increased by 10 per cent to 14p (12.75) after a lower proposed final of 9.5p (9.75p). Earnings improved from 33.1p to 41.9p. The tobacco machinery division achieved the best performance. Operating profits rose 28 per cent to Pounds 18.6m due to an improvement in overall margins, substantial cost-cutting and strong advances in China and Brazil. The important US market continued to be depressed, however. Packaging machinery recorded a Pounds 100,000 rise in operating profits to Pounds 3.1m on sales 22 per cent up at Pounds 63.8m. The division, heavily dependent on the US market, suffered a decline in margins from an average 6 per cent to about 5 per cent. The group aimed to improve these margins and, in the longer term, to diversify into packaging for the food and pharmaceuticals industries. The group expects to receive a Pounds 10m repayment from the pension surplus. Agreement had been reached with trustees to share the surplus between the company and the fund's members. The members have to approve the plan.</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of UK Consumer Credit and Asset Finance (1): Reluctant spenders put brake on growth - While future prospects for the industry look good, the pace of recovery in consumer credit and asset finance is still relatively slow Latest figures from the UK credit and asset finance sectors, traditional barometers of the economic climate, suggest consumers and business people are still reluctant to accept that the recession is really over. In August this year members of the Finance and Leasing Association (FLA) were owed Pounds 38.2bn for asset finance while in the year to June they had provided Pounds 15bn of consumer credit. Though the figures are large, the overall picture is described, nevertheless, as subdued by spokesmen for the sector when compared with the rapid expansion in the late 1980s. David Hardisty, chairman of the FLA, admits to a steady rise in consumer credit but points out, 'we are definitely not seeing another credit boom'. Many consumers are repaying existing debts, as well as committing themselves to new credit. On average customers repay the amount owing on a store card within six weeks. Moreover, the latest FLA figures for August show the overall growth in consumer credit slowing up. Borrowing on store cards fell by 9 per cent in July to Pounds 375m. Personal loans, at Pounds 256m, were down by 1 per cent month-on-month, though up by 30 per cent on the same month last year. 'Consumers haven't forgotten the last set of interest rate rises. The government underestimated this fear factor and put up rates when confidence was still too shaky,' says Mr Hardisty. Nor has the situation been helped by the government's tax increases which have further militated against a consumer-led recovery. In asset finance, the situation is broadly similar. The FLA points out that while there was a slight recovery in 1993 the figures for total advances were almost 20 per cent below the peak year of 1990. 'At this stage in the economic cycle, the business finance figures are frankly disappointing. We would expect to see much more investment through hire purchase and leasing,' says Mr Hardisty. The sector is looking to the forthcoming Budget for help in revitalising the sector and, coincidentally, to assist the government to achieve its own aim of promoting an investment-led recovery. The FLA has suggested in its 1994 tax submission that the 40 per cent writing-down allowances on plant and machinery in operation over the 12 months to October 31, 1993, be reintroduced as from budget day. The association, and its members, say this could provide a vital fillip to the industry during an uncertain period. But while overall recovery may be slow, the industry is developing increasingly sophisticated forms of finance to support its customers during the recovery. In asset finance, a small business can lease a production line which can be paid for by instalments out of profits. Such devices are designed to distinguish asset finance from the services offered by banks. Derek Soper, chairman of AT &amp; T Capital, believes that asset finance has reached a 'stage of maturity' and must develop new areas of operation to enable it to grow. It will, he argues, be difficult for the industry to improve upon its current performance of financing 30 per cent of all capital equipment purchases. Growth will come in areas such as operating leases, where the lessor takes a real risk in the equipment provided, in motor car finance through contract hire, and through financing privatised industries, such as the railways. Another growth area is expected to be so-called 'captives' - finance houses owned by manufacturers. While some observers point to the negative impact they can have on the parent balance sheet, because of their higher gearing, their numbers are growing. Forward Asset Finance, of the Forward Trust Group, a subsidiary of Midland Bank, which has provided services to more than 25,000 companies in the past three years, also sees innovation ahead. Hire purchase, it says, is growing in popularity, helped by low and fairly stable interest rates. Improved quality of service is seen as an important development. Forward has developed 'industry specific' packages backed by trained staff in sectors such as printing, construction, engineering, and commercial vehicles, and believes the development of such services to be crucial to retaining existing business and to finding new customers. In the high street and in the motor trade speed and convenience, as well as new approaches are also expected to play an important part in overall growth. Customers can, for example, be offered low and zero interest finance, where a finance house provides a loan, and the manufacturer pays the interest subsidy. One comparatively recent entrant, Marks &amp; Spencer Financial Services, is now among the leading participants under the FLA umbrella. The financial services it now provides have grown from the original charge card base to personal loans, unit trusts, pensions and life assurance. In the motor sector, finance made available through UK dealers rose by 13 per cent year on year to Pounds 725m in August. For used cars it was up 33 per cent. Worldwide, Ford Financial Services, the captive arm of Ford, recorded leasing advances of Dollars 14.5bn - making it the world's top leasing company ahead of GE Capital and GMAC (General Motors), according to a survey by Asset Finance and Leasing Digest. In 1992 and 1993, point-of-sale credit made the arm the most profitable part of Ford. Total advances to customers worldwide exceed Pounds 70bn. In 1993, Ford Credit Europe financed 40 per cent of new Ford vehicles sold in the UK. In the future leasing and contract hire are seen as likely areas of growth. Ford Contract Motoring, for example, administers 32,000 vehicles in the UK. In one recent development, Midland Bank's 3m credit card customers were offered the opportunity to lease a car for up to two years, and either return it at the end of the period or buy it. Finance houses have devised similarly structured deals where customers can pay off the depreciation on cars rather than the capital sum. (See motor finance, page 2) Paul Gee, managing director of Lombard Business Finance, predicts that a highly competitive market will develop in asset finance where the struggle to find a clear image and promote service excellence are important. Growth is expected from projects falling under the government's Private Finance Initiative, which is intended to take private finance into hospitals, utilities, and railways. Management buy-outs have also become a new area of interest to the finance houses. Pascon, the former BTR plant hire and scaffolding company, acquired by its management in a Pounds 33.5m transaction, is one example. (see page 6). In another innovative deal Lombard provided a staged payments plan which, it said, combined the benefits of term funding with the flexibility of clearing bank facilities for JP Fruit Distributors. The company needed a 3.5 acre site at Dartford, south London, for 34 temperature controlled pressure ripening rooms. Barclays Mercantile, another leading participant in the market, is using money from the European Union to promote investment. A European Investment Bank scheme provided a cash rebate of Pounds 2,300 per new job created, if the project cost more than Pounds 20,000 and the jobs last five years. According to Garry Clarke, pricing manager, Barclays used its expertise to get clients through the machinery of the scheme and speedy access to the Pounds 12m aid available. Barclays claims a 90 per cent success rate for clients chasing loans of between Pounds 250 to Pounds 30,000 under an earlier EIB loan subsidy scheme. In consumer credit, the entry of new participants, especially from the US, has created strong new competition in in the European credit card market. Vauxhall Motors, a subsidiary of General Motors, was the first UK car manufacturer to enter the credit-card market, launching a British version of the GM card available in the US. Since the GM card was launched in the US in September 1992, almost 8m people have become card holders. Such developments have also led to expansion in the list of FLA members  - from the Automobile Association to Rank Xerox, and to the growth of niche companies finely attuned to a specific market. Meanwhile, the leading clearing banks, and the building societies, continue to develop their finance arms. For all the participants the future offers an expanding market during recovery in a climate of intense competition and innovation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 16 (YONHAP) -- A 36-year-old North  Korean arrived at Kimpo airport Thursday, months after defecting  to a third country to seek asylum in the South, the Agency for  National Security Planning (NSP) said.    Chin Kwang-ho, born to an ethnic Korean family repatriated  to  the North from Japan, was working as a driver at a supply base  in a North Korean military academy when he defected in early  February, according to the NSP.    Grievances over the severe discrimination against Koreans  repatriated to the North from Japan drove Chin to flee, the  agency said.    The South Korean Government decided to accept him from a  humanitarian point of view.    Chin has a mother and an elder sister still living in North  Korea, the NSP said.</p>

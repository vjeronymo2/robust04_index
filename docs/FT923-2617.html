			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Close Brothers edges ahead to Pounds 12.6m CLOSE BROTHERS, the City merchant bank, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 12.6m in the 12 months to July 31, an advance of 2.4 per cent on the previous year's Pounds 12.3m. Total assets expanded by 5.6 per cent to Pounds 417m (Pounds 395m) and the loan book rose by 15 per cent to Pounds 275m (Pounds 239m). The group maintained a broad spread of lending and at the year end had only 13 loans of more than Pounds 1m. Mr Hugh Ashton, chairman, said that the group had achieved 'another resilient performance in the face of a gruelling year with extraordinarily difficult trading conditions'. He added: 'In recent years we have outperformed others within our sector and we are now intent on building up a major merchant banking group.'. With the exception of Air and General Finance, the light aircraft and helicopter financing company, which incurred losses, most subsidiaries did well. Close Consumer Finance and PROMPT, the commercial insurance premium finance company, both had good years. Deposits were down from Pounds 140m to Pounds 130m. Committed term facilities were Pounds 210m and substantial new funding has been agreed in principle since the year end. The proposed final dividend is 6.5p, bringing the total for the year to 9.5p (8.8p), covered 2.3 times by earnings ahead 8 per cent to 22.7p (21.1p) per share.</p>

Today, Gen. Ortega for the first time presented himself at  the Military Prosecutor's Office to testify on the case of the  young Genie. The Army chief testified for more than five hours  regarding the charges of his alleged responsibility in the Genie  killing. The general said that on the day Genie died, 28  October 1990, he was in his residence. He said the Army has  been supporting the Investigative Commission as a result of  conversations he has had with other high-ranking officers and in  response to a request from former Government Minister Carlos  Hurtado.    During the lengthy questioning, the prosecution asked about  the Army chief's movements and the administrative structure of  the Army. At the end of the interrogation, Prosecutor Lester  Gallo ordered precautionary measures against Gen. Ortega.    [Begin recording] [Ortega] In my case, having assumed my own  defense, the precautionary measure ordered by the Military  Prosecutor's Office is to limit my movements for a lawfully  established period of time in my home town, which is Managua.    [Raymond Genie, father of Jean Paul Genie] As we see it,  house arrest is not important. The magnitude of the sentence  must correspond to the magnitude of the crime. These moves are  aimed at earning much public attention and at producing  international effects to later shun the matter. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / International Company News: Banesto slides as provisions take toll BANESTO, the Spanish commercial bank, is putting aside Pta52.4bn (Dollars 377m) of its 1993 first-half income to provisions, a 218 per cent increase on its allocation for bad loans in the first six months of last year. The dramatic increase brought pre-tax profits down to Pta5.7bn, an 82.6 per cent drop on the 1992 first-half figure of Pta33bn. Banesto did not release a first-half net profit figure. The strict savings policy had been outlined by Mr Mario Conde, chairman, to shareholders in May, when he announced the bank would not be paying its final 1992 dividend and would transfer all its 1993 first-quarter income to bad loan provisions. The move is understood to stem from advice given to Banesto's board by the US investment bank JP Morgan, which is masterminding a rights issue and an international share placement designed to improve the Spanish group's weak capital base. Banesto claims some 75 per cent of the rights issue has been subscribed with a week's trading to go. The demand puts the group on course to raise some Pta52.6bn in what is the first tranche of the three-part capital-raising plan drawn by JP Morgan. In the second tranche, Banesto will place 22.2m shares, priced at Pta1,900 each against a current market price of just over Pta2,000. The placement is with a group of investors including Mr Conde and several US institutions that have joined JP Morgan's Dollars 1bn Corsair fund. The third stage of the capital-raising venture involves a Dollars 400m convertible bond which could be issued this autumn. The high first-half provisioning comes despite improved business in the second quarter of this year. Mr Conde said earlier this month that fee commissions in April-June realised Pta10.5bn, 11.5 per cent up on the first quarter of last year. Average monthly borrowing on the interbank market had been reduced to Pta236.6bn last month from Pta587.9bn in May. Banesto's provisions now cover 56 per cent of bad debts, against 46 per cent at the end of 1992, a ratio which is still low when set against standards in the Spanish banking sector. These come close to 100 per cent coverage of non-performing loans.</p>

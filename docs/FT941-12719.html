The 50:50 joint venture, Sovereign Exploration, is valued initially at Pounds 19m, though the companies estimate that the potential exists to enhance this by Pounds 5m. Northern said the rate of return it expected to receive from the venture would exceed that on its main electricity business. The deal will underpin Northern's ambitions to become an integrated gas supplier. Last autumn it launched its own distribution business.

The deal gives Northern access to long-term gas supplies with an option to buy up to 50m therms of uncommitted gas. For Neste, the deal represents a step in its corporate restructuring and an opportunity to link up with a company in the downstream market. Sovereign Exploration will have interests in the Schooner, Avalon and Victor fields. Mr David Morris, Northern's chairman, said: 'We are looking at further options and opportunities to expand our gas business, following a low risk approach to ensure profitable business development.'</p>

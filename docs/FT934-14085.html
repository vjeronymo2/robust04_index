			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Technology: New office suite Today's introduction of a new version of Microsoft's 'all-in-one' suite of business applications, Microsoft Office, reflects a significant shift in the sale and use of personal computer software. Microsoft Office combines the US company's popular Microsoft Word for Windows word processor, Excel spreadsheet, PowerPoint business presentation graphics system and Mail electronic mail software in one package. The Office package will include improved versions of these applications and offer more 'integration' features that allow information to be moved between applications. Microsoft Office is a new approach to selling PC applications in 'suites'. Similarly, Lotus Development offers SmartSuite - combining its Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet, Ami Pro word-processor, Freelance Graphics business presentation program and cc:Mail electronic mail software. Borland International offers a Borland Office package, including Borland's Quattro Pro spreadsheet and its Paradox database and WordPerfect's WordPerfect for Windows. For users, these 'office' products are a way to buy a set of applications for up to a quarter of the cost of buying individual applications packages. However, there are also other benefits. Microsoft Office users can use a function from one application while working in another. Users can also benefit from the increasingly consistent design of applications incorporated in suites. Menu items are largely common across all the applications in a single office suite. The popularity of these 'suites' of programs is growing. Microsoft makes more than half its US applications sales in the form of Microsoft Office (for the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows). In the UK, Microsoft Office accounts for about 70 per cent of its applications revenues. For manufacturers, office-suite products may mean slower revenue growth but they can boost sales of parts of the suite that might not otherwise be as successful - while tying users to a single software company's vision of how applications should work together.</p>

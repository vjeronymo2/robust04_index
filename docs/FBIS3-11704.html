Each of the  proposals and suggestions made by the workers during the  sessions of the Parliaments in the Workplace will be taken into  account and will receive an appropriate reply by the union  leaders of the various sectors involved in the meetings.    This was confirmed by Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of  the Cuban Workers Federation [CTC], during his address in the  meeting closing the process in Matanzas. Yadira Garcia,  Politburo member and first secretary of the Communist Party of  Cuba in Matanzas, also chaired the meeting.    Ross announced that on 29 March the CTC National Committee  will meet officially to close the nationwide process. Topics  such as profitability, economic efficiency, subsidies, and  possible measures to prevent excess currency were issues  discussed by the 205,000 workers in the province who  participated in the base meetings, where more than 9,400  interventions were recorded. Both figures represent a record for  union meetings in this providence.    Ross added that Cuba is looking for a consensus on,  understanding of, and comprehension of a package of possible  measures to be implemented, some of which are controversial such  as the change of currency, an issue on which there are many  opinions. There are other measures being endorsed by most of the  population, such as the confiscation of ill-gotten money.</p>

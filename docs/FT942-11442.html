			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Survey of International Corporate Finance (3): Dominating 'beauty parades' - US investment banks are seizing the initiative in Europe The power of US investment banks waxed and waned in Europe in the last decade, but their corporate finance business have taken a decisive step forward in the 1990s. Despite the big fees which banks such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Salomon Brothers demand, the US banks have now achieved such influence that they often dominate 'beauty parades' for new business in Europe. The pattern of appointments to originate offerings of stock in newly-privatised European companies illustrates the point. 'A government usually appoints its flagship bank in the lead role, and then to make sure the transaction gets done, almost every time it appoints a US firm second,' says Mr Kevan Watts, head of European investment banking for Merrill Lynch. This means that even European investment banks with pretensions to become world-class players such as S G Warburg and Swiss Bank Corporation find themselves competing hard simply to retain blue chip work in their domestic markets. There are a number of factors why the large US investment banks have become so influential in Europe over the past five years: They have been able to invest both capital and people in expanding European operations because of the strong underlying profitability of US businesses. The large equity underwriting fees still earned by the 'bulge bracket' US firms are largely unchallenged in their home market, despite S G Warburg's success in underwriting an equity offering for Cummins Engine. They dominate access to large US investing institutions which have become increasingly important for European companies seeking capital. European governments have consistently used US firms to gain access to the US to ensure the success of privatisations. 'The US represents 40 per cent of the world's capital markets, and we really control that market,' says Mr Watts. US banks have brought innovations such as book-building in equity offerings. They have also introduced new methods of valuing companies, and an innovative approach to structuring deals. 'We do a lot of financial modelling to give our clients comfort, but some European competitors do not do that,' says Mr John Studzinski, a managing director of Morgan Stanley. European companies have increasingly tended to view the hiring of a US firm alongside their traditional merchant bank as being a means of getting a wider view. 'For a British company, having a banker in the room that does not think about the world simply from the perspective of the south-east of England, can be quite a useful stimulus,' says Mr Watts of Merrill Lynch. US investment banks that were schooled in the era of 'financial engineering' on Wall Street in the 1980s are used to the idea of bringing new ideas to company chairmen. 'We do a lot of initiating of ideas, whereas if a chief executive wants advice from his merchant bank, he often has to ask them to come round,' says Mr Alan Gillespie, a Goldman Sachs partner. Apart from the demand for US firms, the US banks themselves see Europe as fertile territory. Mr Walter Gubert, chairman of J P Morgan's European advisory committee, says that Germany is one country where companies need more advice. 'The country has not had a mergers and acquisitions culture in the past, but companies now have a new set of challenges,' he says. Other firms also view Europe as a set of markets which are increasingly open to a US approach. As institutional investment grows, they believe that European firms will need sophisticated advice. 'Europe companies are entering the world economy having been shielded from it for a long time. They face a different environment,' says Mr Studzinski of Morgan Stanley. The US firms also argue that blue chip European companies which acquire US shareholders will have to take care to manage the relationship rather than assuming goodwill. 'There are more sensitivities now. If you have Fidelity (the large US asset management company) as an investor, it means you have to think a little differently,' says Mr Studzinski. The US firms have benefitted strongly from the wave of cross-border work in Europe, which allows them to bring to bear their strong networks in putting together deals. Mr Gubert of J P Morgan argues that this 'global capability' is an even more important factor in giving the US firms an edge, rather than their innate access to the US capital markets. Yet it has not all been plain sailing for US firms. They have to show European firms that they have a true feel for local markets and ways of doing business in addition to possessing skills. Competitors of J P Morgan in Spain were quick to portray the removal of management at its client Banco Espanol de Credito as an example of a US bank misunderstanding a local market. Mr Gubert says that the bank trains Europeans in US disciplines to achieve a mix of qualities. 'Europe is not the US, and Berlin is not London. The most successful firms will be those that combine Anglo-Saxon coverage of investors with a thorough understanding of the way things are done locally,' he says. For the moment, the US firms have made sound investments. But any flagging of the flow of privatisations could leave them with an excessively high cost base. This might force them to push further into domestic markets. One US banker estimates that his firm currently would not bother to compete for 60 per cent of local firms' business even if it could get it. It would be at this point that the old accusation levelled at US firms - that they only remain as long as the going is good - could re-surface. Yet the gradual move towards global flows of capital may keep US firms in place even in tougher times to ensure their network stays intact. If so, European investment banks may find that the competition is only just starting.</p>

INTERFAX has reported that "Wintershall" and "Verbundnetz  Gaz" reported Thursday [20 January] that they had managed to  reach a last-minute compromise on the price of Russian gas and  thereby avert the termination of deliveries of it to the FRG's  eastern Laender. It was announced that this month the sides  will sign a long-term contract for gas deliveries from Russia.</p>

			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: WILSHIRE CENTER  </P> <P> Before he took up film making in the 1970s, Swiss photographer Robert Frank  toured the States capturing the grittiness of the 1950s blue collar continent.  With an outsider's clarity of vision his stark gray images captured sullen  people and their hard surroundings and told stories of a nation.  </P> <P> Work he did in Europe as well as America is a strong testament to the fact  Frank could make one image speak volumes. And the subject was always  fascinatingly true, whether it was the huddled salesmen in the 1955 "Cadillac  Showroom" that look like Mafia hit men or the couple delightedly steering a  bumper car with their eyes squeezed shut. He caught the ironic beauty of tulips  sold out of a suitcase in Paris and the mentality of segregation on a streetcar  in New Orleans. Frank's subjects are human, always a complex but succinct  composite of ideology and events. At least that's the way the artist made them  appear -- as living symbols of a nation and an age.

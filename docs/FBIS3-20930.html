			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed O.P.: "300-Million-Franc Loss for </F> Eurocopter in 1993"]    [Text] Eurocopter CEO Jean-Francois Bigay is at a  crossroads. The Franco-German company (Aerospatiale: 70 percent;  Deutsche Aerospace: 30 percent) has just been through a 1993  fiscal year which would have been disastrous but for two  last-minute military contracts with Turkey and the Netherlands.  And Mr. Bigay opens the 1994 year with license agreements and  an order for five Dauphin helicopters from Samsung Aerospace,  hoping he will not have to implement a new streamlining plan.    In financial terms the helicopter manufacturer went into the  red last year for the first time ever. The exact amount of the  losses will not be known until April, but it should be close to  300 million French francs [Fr], including Fr250 million in  depreciations and specific risk allowances. In 1992, Eurocopter  earned Fr25 million. Its objective for 1994 is clearly to  restore its financial balance. However, it will not be able to  prevent sales from falling further this year. Sales amounted to  Fr10.2 billion in 1993, a 10.5 percent decline. Another  Fr800-million drop is expected this year, with sales falling  below the Fr9.5 billion mark. Mr. Bigay's explanation is that  "the world market for helicopters last year was the worst in 25  years, with 260 civilian and 285 military machines (not  including two closed markets -- the U.S. and Russian armed  forces). Such a low level of orders had not been witnessed  since the mid-1960s, with the exception -- on the military side  -- of the year 1991, weighted down by the Gulf War.  <H5>  Slight Reprieve </H5>   The Franco-German company did manage to capture 56 percent  of  the civilian market and to regain its average defense share (24  percent). Its order book totaled Fr9.3 billion and 166  helicopters, including 43 large ones. Ninety-five percent of  orders come from abroad, with, among others, 20 Cougars for  Turkey and 17 military Super Pumas for the Netherlands -- a  Fr1.4-billion contract. Thus Bonn and Paris will have only made  a very limited contribution to the company's health.    Still, although the recent contracts will guarantee some  activity for 1994 and part of 1995, Eurocopter badly needs  another large order this year -- about 20 Super Pumas worth  Fr1.5 billion. The company is therefore hoping that France and  Germany will agree to give it a hand should foreign orders fail  to materialize in 1994. Indeed, it was only in the hypothesis  that another large order was on the way that Eurocopter decided  not to suppress more jobs, as it did in 1993 for 1,060  positions, cutting its total workforce down to 10,500. The  Franco-German company would rather resort to short-term measures  only, such as temporary unemployment; a gamble which it may need  to reconsider in the second half of 1994 should market  conditions keep deteriorating.</p>

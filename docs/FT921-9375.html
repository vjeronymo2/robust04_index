			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Oil workers' group wins recognition THE OFFSHORE Industry Liaison Committee, the unofficial grouping of North Sea oil workers, said last night it had been given official recognition as a trade union. The recognition, by the government's trade-union certification officer, will further inflame relations between the committee and other established trade unions, including the AEU engineering union. The OILC, led by Mr Ronnie McDonald, was behind the industrial unrest on oil platforms in the summer of 1990. Mr McDonald described the listing of the OILC as a trade union as a 'watershed'. It would clarify the authority of the body at industrial tribunals, for example. A certificate of independence would be required before the new union could claim back money spent on balloting, however. Mr McDonald said the group hoped for a certificate of independence soon. The OILC hopes to recruit a 'viable operational base' of 3,000 members within its first year. Mr McDonald said the new union wanted to affiliate to the Scottish Trades Union Congress. The long-term aim would be for affiliation to the TUC itself.</p>

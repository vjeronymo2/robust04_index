			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / World Trade News: Honda top importer at home THE title of top-selling maker of imported cars in Japan last month went to Honda Motor, whose increased imports of vehicles from its US factories exceeded the sales of foreign makers such as Volkswagen and BMW for the first time, writes Robert Thomson in Tokyo. Honda's imported car sales tripled from a year earlier to 4,569 units and those of Toyota Motor were almost four times higher at 1,339 units, as consumers wanting an imported car increasingly chose a Japanese-badged vehicle. Total sales of imported vehicles for the month were 32 per cent higher at 22,977 units, the Japan Automobile Importers' Association said. Excluding Japanese-badged vehicles, sales rose by a more modest 8.2 per cent. For the fiscal year ended in March, sales of imported cars slipped 0.5 per cent to 190,977 units, with sales of cars with engines over 2,000cc 1.4 per cent higher, and those of smaller vehicles down 3.9 per cent. The big loser in March was Volkswagen, which saw a 31 per cent fall in sales due to a severing of ties with Yanase, the dominant retailer of imported cars. Volkswagen, previously the market leader, finished behind Honda, BMW and Mercedes-Benz. Yanase has a new relationship with Opel, while Volkswagen has an agreement with Toyota to use its dealer system and the German company is expanding its own sales network.</p>

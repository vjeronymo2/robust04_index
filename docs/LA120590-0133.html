			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EL TORO'S JOHNSON RESIGNS TO FOLLOW HIS SONS' CAREERS  </P> <P> Bob Johnson, one of the most successful football coaches in the Southern  Section the past 13 years, announced his resignation Tuesday at El Toro High  School.  </P> <P> Johnson's teams compiled a 119-45 record and won six league and three Southern  Section titles. El Toro also qualified for the playoffs 13 straight years, the  longest current streak in Orange County.  </P> <P> Johnson said his desire to support and watch his sons, Bret and Rob, throughout  their college careers was the reason for his decision to resign. Bret is a  junior quarterback at Michigan State, having transferred from UCLA after losing  his starting job this season; Rob, a senior at El Toro, is a highly recruited  quarterback who has not yet made a college commitment.  </P> <P> "I'm not burned out, and there's nothing I enjoy more than coaching kids," said  Johnson, 45. "But I've followed both of my sons' athletic careers since they  were youngsters and I want to watch them play college football.  </P> <P> "I don't want to be coaching at Muirlands and La Paz (Mission Viejo High) while  Bret is playing in South Bend, Ind. I've always been there for my kids, so it's  time to put my profession on hold.  </P> <P> "I want to coach again. I'm not done coaching. I'm going to take a back seat  for a while," said Johnson, who said he'll likely consider coaching again once  his sons finish college. "I'm a guy who doesn't look down the road that much,  but maybe in a year or so I'll think I need to get back.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of me that wants to go into college football. We've done quite a  bit in the high school area -- but I wouldn't say I wouldn't go back to that  either."  </P> <P> Johnson was hired at El Toro in 1978 after being an assistant coach at Los  Amigos. He immediately built the program into one of the strongest in the  county. El Toro was the tri-champion of the Sea View League in Johnson's third  season and the school won the league title three straight years from 1980-82.  </P> <P> El Toro won its first postseason championship, defeating Fullerton, 35-19, for  the Central Conference title in 1982.  </P> <P> El Toro's Southern Conference championship team finished 14-0 in 1986 and is  considered one of the best in county history. The team featured Johnson's son,  Bret, who was named the county's back of the year as a junior.  </P> <P> "This team deserves to be ranked with anyone you want to talk about," Bob  Johnson said after the title game.  </P> <P> El Toro repeated as Southern Conference champion in 1987, finishing 12-2.  </P> <P> El Toro's only losses in 1987 came while Bret was recovering from knee surgery.  Despite the injury, Bret repeated as the county's back of the year.  </P> <P> After an off-year in 1988, El Toro returned to a postseason championship game  in 1989 with son Rob playing wide receiver. The Chargers lost to Paramount,  26-20, in the Division III title game.  </P> <P> Rob moved to quarterback this season and led El Toro to a second-place finish  in the South Coast League. But once again, Paramount beat El Toro in the  playoffs, 19-8, in the semifinals of the Division II playoffs.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't trade the last 13 years for anything," Johnson said. "I've enjoyed  the challenge of being the No. 1 team in the county and the relationship I had  with the staff and players at El Toro.  </P> <P> "The staff here was responsible for our success. We always maintained some of  the best high school coaches in the county, and the program's success will  continue long after I'm gone.  </P> <P> "These are important times in my sons' lives, and (Johnson's wife) Debbie and I  made a decision to support our sons. We'll be traveling, tailgating and  enjoying the games as fans for a change."  </P> <P> Johnson will continue to teach physical education at El Toro. Don Martin, El  Toro principal, said he didn't anticipate opening the coaching position until  after the holiday break.  </P> <P> "We have plenty of time until spring ball begins," Martin said.  </P>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [NODONG SINMUN 5 February editorial: "Let All Functionaries </F> Stand at the Van of Every Work"]    [Text] Today our people are vigorously accelerating the  general march to glorify this year as the year of a historic  turning point in our revolution and construction by upholding  the militant slogans of the party and the leader.    The revolutionary zeal of the masses has been  extraordinarily  enhanced and we faced enormous tasks. This reality demands that  the guiding functionaries revolutionize themselves more than  ever before and stand at the van of every work.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated: Whether  success can be attained in the revolutionary struggle and  construction work or not will largely depend on how the  cadres--commanding members of the revolution--will work.    Cadres are the backbone of our party and revolutionary ranks  and are commanding members of the revolution. The firmness and  combat capabilities of the party and revolutionary ranks largely  depend on the cadres and the issue of registering a  revolutionary turn in socialist construction depends on the  cadres.    Only when the functionaries firmly prepare themselves  ideologically by thoroughly revolutionizing themselves and only  when they excellently carry out the role of the vanguard in all  works, can they vigorously push ahead with the revolution and  construction and firmly defend, protect and glorify our-style  socialism.    It is a revolutionary mission for guiding functionaries, who  uphold the party, to stand at the van of all works. Our party is  the party which carries out the revolution and struggle, and is  a motherly party which leads destiny of the people by bearing  the responsibility.    It is a lofty intent of the dear comrade leader to carry out  benevolent politics for the people and to make the cadres  genuine faithful servants of the people who embody the party's  benevolent politics.    Functionaries of our party should more satisfactorily have  lofty traits as commanding members of the revolution and as  faithful servants of the people by constantly revolutionizing  themselves, and should always work devotedly for the party and  the people.    It is an important demand in brilliantly carrying out  gigantic revolutionary tasks facing us this year for leading  functionaries to stand at the van of all works.    The spirit of struggle of the masses, who rose in the  worthwhile struggle to implement our party's revolutionary  economic strategy, is very high. The issue is for leading  functionaries, who command each outpost of general march, to  correctly organize and mobilize the masses by displaying the  revolutionary spirit and combat capability.    The experience in the units, which created miracles and  innovations in the first march of the new year, illustrates that  only when functionaries stand at the van of others with the  initiative, will all works be carried out satisfactorily.    The cadres decide everything in the revolutionary struggle  and construction work. How thoroughly the agriculture-first,  light industry-first, and trade-first policy is implemented  depends on the cadres at last.    When the functionaries organize and command at the van of  the  struggle to implement the party's policy with loyalty to the  party and with the spirit of devoted service for the people, we  can successfully accomplish all tasks, no matter how gigantic  they may be, and can effect a great revolutionary upsurge in  this year's socialist general march.    It is also an important insurance for firmly consolidating  our single-hearted unity with the party and the leader [suryong]  for the leading functionaries to stand at the van of every work.    The single-hearted unity between the party and revolutionary  ranks is a powerful weapon which only our party--the chuche-type  revolutionary party--has.    Because there is such single-hearted unity, we can break  through all trials, no matter how difficult and complex they may  be, and can defend and carry to accomplishment our-style  socialism without wavering even to a slight degree, no matter  how strong the enemy may provoke.    Our functionaries should further consolidate our firm  single-hearted unity, which has been attained the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il as the center.    When the functionaries--the standard-bearer and genuine  educators of the masses--precisely educate and lead the party  members and working people, the people will more firmly trust  and follow the party and our single-hearted unity will be  consolidated in an indomitable unity.    The issue of more highly displaying the superiority of  our-style socialism importantly depends on the role of leading  functionaries.    Today our people, without exception, absolutely support and  endlessly trust our-style socialism. It is important for leading  functionaries to struggle devotedly so that superiority of this  system be more highly demonstrated.    The leading functionaries should devotedly struggle to more  highly display the superiority of this system. Our functionaries  are assigned with the mission to infiltrate warm benevolence of  the party and the leader more thoroughly into the people and to  provide them with happier and richer life.    When the functionaries actively struggle to brilliantly  achieve our party's intent to make the people live more happily,  the imperialists will get week-knees, no matter how frantically  they maneuver to isolate and crush our-style socialism, and the  sound of "Long live socialism!" will continually resound from  among our people.    The party's expectations for leading functionaries in  today's  general march are very great. Our party has not only assigned  important revolutionary outposts to functionaries but also  energetically led functionaries so that they constantly  revolutionize themselves. This reflects our party's lofty intent  to foster all functionaries to be unswerving revolutionaries who  share destiny with the party and the leader to the end, and to  be genuine faithful servants who devotedly serve the people.    The outposts assigned to our functionaries are different  from  each other. However, the position on which they should stand  always is the van of every work. Those who should play the  kernel role in the struggle to uphold our party and to  strengthen the single-hearted unity are our functionaries and  those who should lead at the van the struggle to carry to  accomplishment the party's revolutionary economic strategy by  displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and arduous  struggle are our functionaries. The men who should set an  example in the work to establish law-abiding trait and the  socialist life style are our cadres.    Without the kernel and vanguard role of our functionaries,  they cannot think of any worth and honor as commanding members  of the revolution, no matter what revolutionary outposts they  are in charge of.    All functionaries should keenly realize that the destiny of  the party, of the revolution and of socialism, depends on how  they prepare themselves ideologically and on how they enhance  their role, and should stand at the van of all works. Thus, they  should fulfill the mission as commanding members of the  revolution.    Functionaries should, above all, uphold the party at the van  of others with faithful loyalty. The faithful loyalty is a basic  trait that commanding members of the revolution should cherish.  The revolutionary fighters should fight to the end with faithful  loyalty for the party and the leader [suryong] by sharing  destiny with the leader [yongdoja] by dedicating their lives.  Herein lies their valuable life and honor.    Functionaries should become the standard-bearers and  vanguard  in upholding the party and the leader [suryong]. Functionaries  should entrust the party with their whole destiny and should  loyally uphold the party and the leader to the end with thorough  faith and determination to die at their posts while defending  them.    Just as commanders of anti-Japanese guerrilla units who  fought by willingly dedicating their lives to defending and  protecting the respected comrade commander, our functionaries  should dedicate all of their wisdom and energy to the struggle  to achieve the intent and ideas of the leader [yongdoja] by  sharing destiny with the great leader [yongdoja].    In particular, functionaries should direct essential  interest  to safeguarding and glorifying forever the achievements made by  the party and the leader. Functionaries should precisely inform  the party members and working people of greatness of the  achievements made by the party and the leader and should  consistently carry out the work to glorify such achievements.    Functionaries of the unit who received on-the-spot guidance  must work well to make their unit an example of the whole nation  and must thoroughly implement the tasks presented at the  on-the-spot guidance.    It is important for functionaries to have high party spirit  like Comrade Yi In-mo by loyally upholding the leader [yongdoja]  of the revolution. The words of the poem dedicated to the dear  comrade leader by Comrade Yi In-mo are filled with his attitude,  position, and lucid party spirit toward the party and the leader.    All functionaries must reflect their party spirit to Comrade  Yi In-mo's party spirit and must exert all efforts to train and  self-discipline themselves ideologically. Functionaries must  also have a sacrificial service spirit to the people and must  struggle by devoting everything to the people.    Our functionaries emerge from the working masses, including  workers and farmers, and they are messengers of the people who  are possessed with the mission to serve them loyally. For our  functionaries, serving the people with devotion is the road of  complete loyalty to the party and the leader. There is no  greater happiness and worthiness for the functionaries than  further upholding the party's and leader's plan and intention  and receiving the masses' faith and love by working as the  people's faithful servants.    In our society the party and the regime serve the people,  the  people give orders, and functionaries are entrusted with the  duty of implementing them. All functionaries must faithfully  experience our party's ideology of believing in the people as in  heaven, and carry out all work by always thinking and acting  from the position that they are the messengers of the people.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il taught that for  functionaries to go into the masses and serving the people  devotedly are the same as eating healthy food, and for  functionaries to exercise power and bureaucratism are the same  as eating poisonous food. This is a favorite proverb in the  work and life of our functionaries, which must always be  engraved and embodied in their minds.    Our functionaries must highly uphold the slogan of "Serving  the people," presented by the party, always go deeply into the  masses to listen attentively to their demands and fulfill their  demands at the right time, and must exert themselves to make the  people's living standard more abundant, even though they may  sleep and rest less.    Those who are indifferent about the people's living  conditions cannot be regarded as commanding members of the true  revolution. Like the people's faithful servants, when there are  good things and happy events take place, our functionaries must  think of the people first, affectionately take care of the  people's living conditions -- from the political, labor,  cultural life to the family life -- so they can exert all their  strength in carrying out their revolutionary duties.    There cannot be satisfaction in the work to implement the  party's intention of devotedly serving the people. Our  functionaries must actively learn the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il's endlessly lofty trait of always thinking of the  people first, being thoughtful of working to provide better  things for them, and find utmost delight from the people's  happiness. Therefore, work must be carried out to brilliantly  embody the party's intention of making functionaries work more  and allowing the people receive more benefits.    Our functionaries must also highly manifest the  revolutionary  trait of unconditionally receiving and thoroughly implementing  the party's ideology and plan. Unconditionally receiving and  thoroughly implementing the party's ideology and plan are just  duties of the cadres and a revolutionary attitude.  Functionaries must have the spirit of absoluteness toward the  party policy so the party's ideology and plan can be thoroughly  advocated and fulfill their duty as the commanding members of  the revolution.    Our functionaries must regard the party's ideology and plan  as their faith, accept them as an absolute truth, and must think  and act only in accordance with the party's ideology and  intention in whatever environment.    Today's general march to implement the party's revolutionary  economic strategy is a responsible struggle that inspects the  functionaries' faithfulness and revolutionary spirit.  Functionaries must devote all their energy and wisdom in the  struggle to implement the party's plan and orders, and do a  splendid job of the task that they are entrusted with through  skillful operations and command. In particular, in accordance  with the demand of the Chongsan-ri spirit, Chongsan-ri method,  and the Taean work system, functionaries must always go deeply  into the producer masses and live under the same roof with them  so they can be roused in the new struggle and feat. They must  also sow plants with their own hands and harvest with their own  hands.    Self-reliance and hard struggle, this is the criteria of  functionaries' loyalty to the party and the revolution. Under  the condition in which the imperialists intensify economic  blockade maneuvers to stifle us, our functionaries should stand  at the van to implement thoroughly the party's policy, upholding  the banner of self-reliance and hard struggle to defend and  adhere to the socialism of our own style and bring full its  vitality.    With the firm will that what the party decides, we will do,  functionaries should vigorously strive to carry out the given  revolutionary tasks with their own efforts by seeking out what  is in short supply and producing what is deficient. In  particular, they should learn by Comrade (Chong Chun-sil)'s  example of spirit of devotion, sacrifice, and self-reliance that  was shown in the struggle to realize the party's plan and to  promote the people's standard of living.    Our functionaries, as Comrade (Chong Chun-sil) did, should  open a passage of advancement by pushing hard with their renewed  courage whenever they are faced with difficult tasks. They  should complete their entrusted tasks and should highly display  the ethos of deliberating and running until their tasks are  brilliantly achieved.    In order to stand at the van of every task, it is very  important for the functionaries to possess the revolutionary  work method and popular work style. All functionaries should  positively learn by the revolutionary work method of Comrade Kim  Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and should work  in accordance with it.    Whatever they may do in any position, functionaries should  eliminate their conventional attitude and have plain and easy  characters. They should always be humble before the masses and  be upright, unaware of any recompense or privilege. They should  always be with the masses and share joy and sorrow with them.  By climbing a mountain ridge and carrying burdens before  others, functionaries should stand at the van of the masses if  it is for the people. Functionaries should become accustomed to  living in this way.    If functionaries are to become genuine commanding officers  of  the revolution, who are endlessly loyal to the party and the  leader, they should make steady efforts to carry out the works  to train and discipline themselves in a revolutionary manner.  There is no born revolutionary nor consummated commanding  officers of the revolution. One can become a genuine chuche-type  revolutionary only through steady ideological discipline to  revolutionize themselves and revolutionary practice. As a gem  sparks only when it is constantly cleaned, a revolutionary can  endlessly add luster to its political life by training himself  in a revolutionary manner and putting forth strong demands.    Most of our functionaries are the people who were brought up  after the liberation of the fatherland under the bosom of the  party without any difficulties or worries. Our party's line on  endlessly revolutionizing commanding officials is the most just  line that enables our functionaries to be brought up as genuine  chuche-type revolutionaries. Responsible functionaries should  set examples in standing at the van of revolutionizing.    As the saying goes "When the upper part of water is clean so  is the lower part," when the responsible functionaries  revolutionize themselves and make constant demands, the lower  functionaries will follow them.    The functionaries should always join a grand struggle to  implement the party's policy to revolutionize themselves. In  particular, they should mingle with the working class and  positively learn by their unlimited loyalty to the party and the  leader, and their strong revolutionary spirit and working class  spirit.    Functionaries should sincerely participate in the party  organizational life and endlessly discipline their partisanship  by learning by the noble view of organization shown by the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.    Functionaries should always work and live in conformity with  the party organization from a standpoint of being a  rank-and-file member of the party and consciously strive to  receive the party organization's guidance and control. All of  our functionaries are revolutionary fighters who are fighting  with the promise to be loyal to the party and the leader.    All functionaries should not forget the promises they made  before the party and stand at the van of every task. By doing  so, they should become a staunch chuche-type revolutionary,  sharing life and death with the party, and a faithful servant  devotedly serving the people.</p>

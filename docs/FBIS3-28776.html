The details are not yet known. But Hata later told reporters  he will hold one or two more rounds of talks with Kantor before  Friday's meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton.    "Both Japan and the U.S. hope to bring the trade talks to a  conclusion," said Hata, also deputy prime minister.    The meeting was held as Japan and the United States head  toward a showdown over a plethora of trade issues before the  summit.    Hata arrived in Washington late Wednesday on an emergency  mission seeking U.S. understanding of the Japanese position. He  said he was bringing no new proposals to Washington.    Tokyo has turned down a U.S. demand that numerical targets  be  set to measure the progress in opening Japan's markets, saying  they would result in managed trade.    Hata is also scheduled to hold separate talks with Secretary  of State Warren Christopher and Vice President Albert Gore  before the leaders' meeting.    Under orders from U.S. Trade Representative Kantor, U.S.  negotiators suspended a series of high-level trade negotiations  with their Japanese counterparts scheduled for Wednesday.    The Clinton administration has demanded that Tokyo make a  firm commitment to reduce its massive current account surplus,  which totaled 141 billion dollars last year, including a nearly  60 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S.    In particular, Washington wants the Japanese to buy more  foreign cars and auto parts, medical and telecommunications  equipment, and insurance. U.S. Government sources have said  Washington might impose trade sanctions against Japan if no  agreement is reached.    In Tokyo, a top Foreign Ministry official said Japan will  appeal to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) if  such sanctions are imposed. The official asked not to be  identified.</p>

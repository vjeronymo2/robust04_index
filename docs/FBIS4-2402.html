			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, April 9 (XINHUA) -- Chain stores, a  management method of modern commerce, are now cropping up in  some large and coastal cities in China.    Chains spread into China in the 1980s when the "Kentucky  Fried Chickens" and "California Beef Noodles" were allowed to  set up chains in the country.    As the state-run commercial enterprises could not monopolize  the market any longer, some commercial enterprises started to  adapt themselves to the market economy and learned to establish  their own chain stores at the end of the 80s and beginning of  the 90s.    By now, some 200 enterprises from Shanghai have set up over  800 chain stores in more than 20 provinces and cities; in  Beijing, Xifu chain stores sell grain and local products in  every corner of the city's residential areas; some 200 chain  stores are scattered over the Pearl River Delta, an economically  advanced area in south China.    Most of these chain stores are in fast food.    Some experts say that the development of chain stores in  China is still in the primary stage and needs time to become  fully-fledged. But an official from the Ministry of Internal  Trade said that the government has an encouraging attitude to  the chain stores and will assist their development.</p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Monday Interview: Cause of southern discomfort - Umberto Bossi, leader of Italy's Lombard League, speaks to Robert Graham Punctuality, wrote Oscar Wilde, is the thief of time. Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of Italy's populist Lombard League, seems to have taken this dictum to heart. In a country where punctuality is usually honoured in the breach, Mr Bossi is supremely unpunctual. Does this reflect his belief that he can set his own agenda or does he become so deeply involved in issues and people that he loses track of time? It is probably a mix of both. His aides despair of trying to organise his schedule; but they are fiercely loyal, attracted by his energy and boundless confidence in his self-appointed mission to change Italy. As the interview begins - one and a half hours late - he tosses a police summons contemptuously into the waste paper basket. Hasn't he been warned that he faces prosecution for insulting the head of state, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. 'I don't care,' he says. Mr Bossi can afford to be cavalier. He is the sole genuinely new leader to emerge in Italy at a crucial moment of political transition; and, unlike the discredited political class whose hegemony he is challenging, he owes favours to nobody. The League, founded in 1984 as a regional autonomy movement for Lombardy, is virtually his invention. 'First we set out to conquer the north . . . and look where we are now,' he says in his gravelly voice. 'Then we take over the south, and finally we march on Rome - like Garibaldi. It will be difficult; but we have begun to work on the south.' This may seem wishful thinking. But in the space of three years, the 51-year-old politician from Varese has propelled the League from an obscure regional grouping to a party that controls 40 per cent of the vote in the rich northern industrial belt of Italy. The Lombard League itself has spawned federations in neighbouring Piedmont, the Veneto, Liguria and Emilia Romagna. The League now controls the administrations of a string of northern towns, including Milan, the capital. It has 80 seats in parliament, and Mr Bossi himself at the April 1992 general election received 239,000 votes - more than any other deputy. 'We are not separatists but federalists,' he says. In the past six months, Mr Bossi has toned down his talk of separatism. But when separatist language does slip into public speeches this is Mr Bossi talking from the heart. A hard core of League supporters embraces the idea of separatism. But Mr Bossi knows that the 'honest voters' he needs to swell his ranks want to hear a more sober message touching on practical concerns of the day. 'The north is against centralised control of the state, against statism,' he says. 'We strongly support privatisation. Here in the north people work hard, they produce things; there are thousands of small- and medium-sized industries. This is one of the most advanced regions of Europe. Our development cannot be held back by paying taxes to support the south. 'We are not anti-south; but we are against the way the south has been enslaved by the Christian Democrats and allowed to live off state hand-outs.' In other words, national resources have to be better and more fairly used. At a time of serious recession, the north wants to see more of its tax money ploughed back into job creation and infrastructure in the region. If not, Mr Bossi raises the threat of separatism, but less stridently now than a year ago. Mr Bossi has learned fast to be a national figure and has tempered his crude vocabulary and use of Lumbard dialect. Yet his conversation is still peppered with hyperbole and dogmatic assertion about the inevitable collapse of a corrupt ancien regime. 'The system is imploding under its own weight. . . .The roof of the building has been falling in, the walls are crumbling. We have 4.5m people receiving fake disability pensions. We have allowed the national debt to pile up without cover. It can't go on.' In one of his many brushes with the establishment, Mr Bossi encouraged his supporters not to buy treasury bills. But he now back-tracks, a recognition of the fact that his vote is made up of small traders and businessmen, worried savers and pensioners - just the kind of people who put their savings in low taxed treasury bills. 'I didn't actually tell people not to buy treasury bills. I was saying that people here do not want to see their savings going towards propping up the regime's wasteful spending: public borrowing should go towards supporting productive investment. And if it doesn't do this voters should draw their own conclusions.' The same view applies to his controversial threat to institute a campaign of non-payment of taxes. This touches all the right visceral chords of his League supporters. 'When Rome is run by a bunch of robbers how can you expect people in the north to pay taxes?' Significantly, with Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, former governor of the Bank of Italy, now prime minister and a man long seen as guarantor of the small saver, Mr Bossi is less strident on this issue. However he has not mellowed his tone or changed his stance in his opposition to corrupt local administration and national government. 'Only the League and the magistrates (investigating the corruption scandals of illicit party financing) have responded to the will for change. Together they are filling the political vacuum.' The League has been the main political beneficiary of the magistrates' investigations that are laying bare the depths of the traditional parties' corruption. Not surprisingly Mr Bossi opposes any curb on the magistrates' powers. 'The magistrates cannot be stopped. The revolution must be allowed to go on until it loses its own momentum. 'Fresh elections are the only means of ending Tagentopoli (the corruption scandals). We must go to the polls as soon as possible.' The present legislature, with one in six parliamentarians under investigation, has no legitimacy, he adds. Despite having been vociferous in demanding elections this autumn, he is now less dogmatic. 'The longer we are kept waiting, the more our support grows,' he says. The sooner elections are held, the less time his opponents will have to recover their disarray and form new alliances. Mr Bossi is disdainful of alliances. Most of the time, all the political parties - of every colour - are ranged against the League. 'We don't mind: people can see the rest are intent on holding up change.' Such determination to go it alone is perhaps rooted in his tough origins. League literature describes him as the son of a 'Catholic worker' father and a mother of 'small-holder origins'. His origins are similar to many of his generation: the first to enjoy higher education and benefit from industrial modernisation in the north. Mr Bossi failed to complete his medical degree at Pavia university and League literature draws a discreet veil over his career until entering politics in 1979. 'Over the next decade I drove more than 1.3m kilometres. I never stopped.' It is no wonder that two years ago he had mild heart trouble with doctors ordering him to reduce his heavy smoking. His success has been based on his own political nose and his homegrown way of putting across simple ideas to an electorate used to intrigue and corrupt political masters. 'The League does not believe in ideology as such. We do not say there will be an earthly paradise (like the marxists) or that people are all good (like the Catholic parties). We recognise that people want to see a little more money in their pockets, live in a more modern state: a state that functions better and where the rule of law is observed.'

			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> JUDGE CAN'T BE A JURY  </P> <P> The curious choice of Judge William L. Todd Jr. to preside over the next  hearing in Roger Hedgecock's drawn-out legal battle is unfair to the former  mayor. What's more, the choice promises to cause more wrangling and possibly  delay in this seemingly endless affair.  </P> <P> Todd's own conduct and the behavior of his former bailiff are central issues in  the hearing ordered by the state Supreme Court to determine whether Hedgecock  deserves a new trial. The hearing was ordered after Hedgecock's attorneys  alleged that the bailiff tampered with the jury in the former mayor's second  trial, and was in regular communication with Todd.  </P> <P> Even the most impartial jurist should not be put in the position of having to  review, and possibly condemn, his own conduct. Moreover, Todd, who handled  Hedgecock's first and second trials, has publicly stated his belief in  Hedgecock's guilt on perjury and conspiracy charges. The Supreme Court this  year threw out the 12 perjury convictions and ordered the upcoming hearing on  the conspiracy count.  </P> <P> Knowing all this, we are surprised that San Diego Superior Court Judge Judith  McConnell assigned the case to Todd, and that Todd accepted. Hedgecock's  attorney, Charles Sevilla, has warned that he will appeal the choice if  McConnell doesn't change her mind. Ironically, Todd now sits on the Appeal  Court that would hear Sevilla's complaint.  </P> <P> That won't be necessary if McConnell chooses a new judge for the Nov. 21  hearing, or Todd withdraws, actions that appear appropriate.  </P></p>

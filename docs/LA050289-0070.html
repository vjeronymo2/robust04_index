			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 14 SCHOOLS STUDIED FOR ETHNIC RATIO HIKE  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Board of Education voted 4 to 3 Monday to begin a study on  changing the ethnic ratios at 14 schools.  </P> <P> Over the next several months, the district will conduct surveys of parents and  faculty at each school to determine if they believe that their schools would  become segregated under a formula that would allow the minority enrollment to  reach 70%.  </P> <P> Current district policy allows the 14 schools to have enrollments that are no  more than 60% minority.  </P> <P> The schools that will be studied are Palisades and University High, and  Chapman, Seventh Street, Fullbright Avenue, Reseda, Shirley Avenue, Winnetka  Avenue, Gledhill Street, Herrick Avenue, Mayall Street, Plainview Avenue, Tulsa  Street and Mount Washington elementary schools. District officials say the  ratio change is needed to enable those schools to receive more students from  overcrowded campuses in heavily minority areas of the district.  </P></p>

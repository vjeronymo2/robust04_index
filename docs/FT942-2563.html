			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Dealers reported a dull and uneventful expiry of the June index options and index futures, leaving traders to focus on weaker gilts and early losses on Wall Street, writes Joel Kibazo. The mid-morning expiry in futures saw the June contract finish trading at 3,038 on volume of 6,083 lots. September, the new market leader after June's close, finished at 3,013, at a 5 point discount to cash, on volume of 16,341 lots. Turnover in traded options was 36,942 contracts, of which 19,758 was dealt in the FT-SE 100 option.</p>

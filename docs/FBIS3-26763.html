Entrusted by the regional people's congress, Vice  Chairman Wang Lequan delivered a report to the standing  committee on the current economic situation and major reforms in  1994. He said: In 1993, under the guidance of the 14th CPC  National Congress guidelines, Xinjiang strengthened the  intensity of reform and overcame difficulties in achieving  fairly good results in economic construction and other fields of  endeavor. The regional economy has maintained a strong growth  momentum; the gross regional product is expected to reach 37.7  billion yuan, about 10 percent more than 1992; and agriculture  and animal husbandry have reaped their 16th consecutive year of  harvests, while industrial production has come out of the  predicament of slow growth and poor efficiency and begun to  bounce back. Moreover, revenues have increased, the financial  situation has further improved, progress has been made in  developing foreign economic relations and trade, investment in  fixed assets has increased steadily, and infrastructure  construction has been further strengthened.    He pointed out: Xinjiang's current political situation is  good. The entire region has seen political stability, national  unity, and steady progress in all fields of endeavor. While  Xinjiang has been able to maintain a strong momentum for  economic growth, problems and difficulties continue to exist in  the regional economy. First, in agriculture, the investment in  production growth rate has dropped and precluded long-term  development. Second, in industry, the foundation remains weak:  investment is inadequate for upgrading enterprises' technology,  progress has been slow in readjusting production structure and  product mix, and economic efficiency needs much improvement.  Third, in finance, there is a serious shortage of capital;  funds for capital construction cannot be allocated in time; and,  as a result of debt chains, enterprises are facing a slow  turnover of funds and are in serious shortage of working  capital. Fourth, (?the pressure) on railway transport has  continued. Fifth, irrational export product mix and the lack of  cash in conducting trade have caused a decrease of exports.  Sixth, price rises of commodities cannot be curbed.    Wang Lequan also explained the progress in economic  structural reform and the regional wage, housing, and price  reforms; as well as the current situation in commodity prices  and arrangements for price reform in 1994.    The session heard a report by Su Yongguang, chairman of the  regional planning commission, on drafting the 1994 regional  plans; a report by (Gong Jinyou), director of the regional  finance department, on the drafting of the 1994 regional budget;  and a report by (Xie Haiping), deputy secretary general of the  regional people's government, on handling motions submitted by  the first session of the eighth regional people's congress.    Turbayim, vice chairman of the regional people's congress  standing committee, chaired the session.    Chairman Amudun Niyaz and Vice Chairmen Xie Fuping, (Hujihan  Hakomov), and (Amina Apar), of the regional people's Congress  standing committee, attended the session.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Open to Radicals"] </F>   [Text] The right-wing party Alliance of Free Citizens  founded by former Bavarian Free Democratic Party of Germany  [FDP] Chairman Manfred Brunner wants to open itself up to former  members of "extreme-right parties." This follows from a party  resolution that is attached to the applications for membership.    Former members of extreme-right rival parties who want to  join the Alliance of Free Citizens need only to have left their  previous organization "some time ago." The Alliance of Free  Citizens, which collects an admission fee of 250 German marks,  currently has only 120 members; Chairman Brunner is confronted  with a charge of "sedition" because he is said to have put  Bonn's European policy on a level with racism during the Nazi  era.    Brunner had already invited Manfred Rouhs, 29, spokesman of  the new Right and publisher of the ultraconservative strategy  magazine EUROPA VORN, to his party's federal assembly in Bonn  the Sunday before last. Rouhs and his adherents are already  beating the drum for using the Alliance of Free Citizens, which  does not have many members, for the benefit of their own  political objectives.</p>

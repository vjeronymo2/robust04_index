			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, Jan. 24 (YONHAP) -- Hans Blix,  secretary-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA), said Sunday that the IAEA will reject a meaningless  inspection that cannot confirm if North Korea has transferred  its nuclear materials since the last IAEA inspection in Yongbyon.    The North Korean nuclear problem is not only the most  sensitive issue related to Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)  but the most delicate issue politically also, the French daily  LIBERATION quoted him as saying.    If IAEA inspection is always blocked, like in North Korea,  the problem is very serious, he said.    North Korea allowed the IAEA to inspect its seven declared  nuclear facilities in January last year for the last time before  it announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty in March.    The IAEA is demanding from North Korea the same inspections  of its seven declared nuclear facilities as conducted last year,  and is discussing inspection of two additional nuclear  facilities.    The IAEA is also demanding periodic inspections, Blix said.    It is certain that North Korea did not declare some  plutonium  although it declared that nuclear facilities in Yongbyon  produced a minimal amount of plutonium, he said.    Inspections of the two undeclared nuclear facilities are to  confirm if they produced plutonium, but the IAEA is still not  sure if it can find how much plutonium was produced from the  North Korean nuclear sites.    On the question of whether the IAEA can guarantee that North  Korea is not pushing ahead with military nuclear programs after  the inspection conditions are met, he said that there are always  uncertainties.    Even if the IAEA does inspect the nuclear reactors in  Yongbyon, it cannot rule out the existence of secret nuclear  facilities, he said.    He said that the monitoring equipment in North Korean  nuclear  facilities has not been operating for several months because  film and batteries ran out and did not rule out the possibility  that North Korea extracted nuclear material from the reactors.    North Korea has not allowed the IAEA inspection team to  exchange films and batteries of the monitoring equipment since  last August.</p>

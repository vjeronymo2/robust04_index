			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM MURRAY: THEY FIND BETTER WAY BY THE BAY  </P> <P> Hey! Put away the flowers! Hold the blindfolds! Stop talking in hushed  whispers!  </P> <P> You might have lost your heart in San Francisco, but it hasn't lost its.  </P> <P> The city that the late Doc Kearns would call a "good game town" is getting off  the floor one more time. It is reaching for the bottom rope to pull itself up  for one more go. The city by the bay is like a grizzled old club fighter who  keeps getting to his feet and carrying the fight to his opponent.  </P> <P> As knockdowns go, this one was a nine-count, too, but not nearly the wallop  that the city took in 1906. The magnitude of that one was 100 times harder.  </P> <P> It's small consolation to those who lost loved ones or homes or limbs, but this  one was not the Big One. That is yet to come.  </P> <P> Baseball was reluctant to resume its revels in the midst of the human misery  that was the Bay Area this week. An event caked in human blood is scarcely the  appropriate backdrop for hits, runs, errors and the sacrifice bunt -- how can  you hook up lights for a mere ballgame in a city where some areas will be  without power for 16 weeks.  </P> <P> The first notion was to move the classic as far from the devastation as  possible. Any direction would do.  </P> <P> But a good game town deserves a good game commissioner. "Carmen" was announced,  "Carmen" will be sung -- as the notice on the opera house on the occasion of  the original earthquake in nought-six.  </P> <P> The World Series will be played in its original venue, the Giants' home park,  in that historical edifice, which last seen was swaying in the air like a fat  lady doing a hula.  </P> <P> It's going to be like the boy pilot in "Lafayette Escadrille" going right back  up to duel the Red Baron.  </P> <P> The city that won't quit, the Comeback Kid of American municipalities, is going  to put the gloves back on. No towel comes floating over the ring ropes from San  Francisco's corner.  </P> <P> The realities of the earthquake of naught-six were dearly learned. This time,  the city did not fall down in total ruin. The death toll, in fact, was almost  exclusively restricted to a section of the bridge, and a one-mile stretch of a  double-decked freeway.  </P> <P> In both cases the top section collapsed on the lower like the devil's  compactor. Which would seem to suggest that two-level engineering is  inadvisable on any geography traversed by the San Andreas Fault. But apart from  the catastrophe of split-level engineering, something less than 20 people were  lost to ordinary structural failure.  </P> <P> The earthquake of 1989 was tragic but not cataclysmic. As an engineer at City  Hall was to note, "I do not need to minimize but, coming into the city, you  would be hard put to find the earthquake."  </P> <P> It seemed to be the notion of the rest of the world these past 48 hours,  judging by incoming calls, that San Francisco was a former city, a municipal  relic disappearing under martial law and a toppling skyline desperately holding  on to keep from sliding into the sea.  </P> <P> It has been rocked $2-billion worth, its mayor acknowledged, but that's only  money.  </P> <P> It is not about to see its first World Series in 27 years, and only its second  in history, go by default to some other lesser city that has never had to climb  back into a ring in its life. San Francisco is a resilient city. It doesn't  quit in its corner.  </P> <P> The unpredictability of earthquakes is a major annoyance and source of  embarrassment to American science.  </P> <P> Scientists can chart a hurricane, a flood, or even a tornado. They cannot chart  an earthquake.  </P> <P> Earthquakes are diabolical. They come in their own good time. They come in your  sleep.  </P> <P> The earthquake had seemed to rob San Francisco's Giants of their last real hope  for parity in this World Series.  </P> <P> The Giants had hoped to wheel their real cleanup hitter into place --  Candlestick Park. Candlestick Park wins more games for them than Will Clark and  Kevin Mitchell put together. It is the most valuable Giant since Willie Mays.  </P> <P> The team is 56-28 in games played at the 'Stick. It is their 30-game pitcher,  their .400 hitter, their stopper, their ace in the hole. For the rest of the  league it is Dracula's castle, a scream in the night, a place where the  portrait's eyes seem to move and where fly balls disappear in the dreaded winds  with its banshee howl.  </P> <P> It was supposed that Candlestick was as out of commission as the city in which  it's in.  </P> <P> Not so. They both make their comeback next Tuesday. Open your Golden Gate. The  city of the 49ers' (the miners, not the football team), is not through yet.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 16, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SCIENCE;  </P> <P> FETAL TISSUE STUDY BAN RETAINED  </P> <P> The Bush Administration plans to extend a 19-month-old ban on federal funding  for research using fetal tissue, it was reported today.  </P> <P> James Mason, assistant secretary for health in the Department of Health and  Human Services, has recommended to HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan that the ban  be continued over the objections of two federal panels, the New York Times  said.  </P> <P> Sullivan is expected to act within a week, said the newspaper, which cited no  sources for its information.  </P> <P> Abortion opponents have strongly opposed using fetal tissue for medical  research, although scientists say transplanting fetal tissue into adults may be  effective in treating diabetes and Parkinson's disease.  </P> <P> HHS imposed the ban in March, 1988, while the department reviewed the issue.  </P></p>

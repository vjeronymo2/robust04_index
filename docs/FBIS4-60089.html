			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rafiq Khalil al-Ma'luf, Ibrahim Humaydi, and </F> Salamah Ni'mat: "Damascus: Differences Still Wide; Christopher  To Return at the End of the Month"]    [Excerpt] Washington, Damascus, Amman, Tunis, occupied  Jerusalem, AL-HAYAH -- The Syrian presidential palace stressed  at the end of President Hafiz al-Asad's talks with U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher yesterday that  "differences are still wide" between Syria and Israel over the  peace process.    Christopher departed Damascus for Cairo yesterday afternoon  where he met with President Husni Mubarak and Egyptian Foreign  Minister 'Amr Musa. He briefed them on the results of his talks  with Syrian and Israeli officials.    An Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman told AL-HAYAH that  the  talks focused primarily on the Syrian-Israeli track, which is  receiving the United States' attention to stress that what it is  seeking is indeed a comprehensive peace.    In Damascus, Christopher held a round of talks with  President  al-Asad.    In a statement to AL-HAYAH U.S. sources expected Secretary  Christopher to return to the region at the end of the month to  resume his role in conveying ideas between the two sides and  bring their views on a peace solution closer, as Israel  continues to give precedence to normalization questions,  confidence-building measures, and security arrangements over the  withdrawal question. While Syria stresses that the peace process  begins when Israel is committed to full withdrawal from the  Golan. Then it would discuss with Israel the question of equal  security arrangements, relations, and other questions.    Al-Asad met with Christopher in the presence of Foreign  Minister Faruq al-Shar' and Dennis Ross, U.S. coordinator of the  peace process. Presidential spokesman Jubran Kuriyah announced  after the meeting, which lasted four hours, that al-Asad had  been handed a message from President Bill Clinton, "stressing  the U.S. keenness to continue its efforts to achieve a  fundamental breakthrough in the peace process. While the Syrian  president renewed his demand that Israel withdraw from the  occupied Golan Heights to the 4 June [1967] lines."    Kuriyah pointed out that al-Asad "expressed his appreciation  for U.S. efforts, stressing Syria's keenness to continue the  peace process to achieve a just and comprehensive solution to  the Arab-Israeli dispute in accordance with the resolutions of  international legitimacy and the land for peace principle."    He added that "Christopher briefed al-Asad on the results of  his talks in Israel which demonstrated that the differences are  still wide because the Israeli stand is far from the foundations  and requirements of the peace process launched at the Madrid  conference" in 1991. The presidential spokesman added that the  Syrian president renewed his country's "position on and  commitment to the foundations of the peace process based on the  Security Council resolutions, which commit Israel to full  withdrawal to the 4 June 1967 lines in order to achieve a just  and comprehensive solution in the region." Syrian sources have  said that when Christopher comes to Damascus carrying "Israel's  agreement to full withdrawal to the 4 June borders, he will have  brought a key for the launch of a process" toward achieving  progress in the peace negotiations. While al-Asad stressed the  existence of "wide differences" between Syria and Israel,  Israeli radio yesterday spoke about Syria's "flexibility" in its  peace stands. [passage omitted]</p>

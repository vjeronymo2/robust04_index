			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Brussels payments and welfare to fore in government programme The measure authorising the increase in the UK's payments to the European Union and the normal finance bill implementing the Budget to be introduced on November 29 will dominate the early stages of the new parliamentary session, Ivor Owen writes. Social welfare legislation, including the measure to equalise the state pension age at 65 for men and women by 2020, will also figure prominently in the programme. The jobseekers' allowance bill will replace unemployment benefits and income support. The Crown Agents, a leading international supplier of procurement, financial management and technical services, features in a restricted privatisation programme.  This includes increased competition in the gas industry by allowing domestic customers to choose their supplier, and transferring the commercial activities of the Atomic Energy Authority to the private sector. A hybrid bill will seek authority for the construction and operation by the private sector of a high-speed rail link between London and the Channel tunnel. Other measures include: a bill to save administrative costs in the National Health Service; an agricultural tenancies bill to make tenanted land more readily available; a bill setting up an independent body to investigate alleged miscarriages of justice; and an environment agencies bill to establish environment protection agencies.</p>

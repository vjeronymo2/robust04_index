			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TAKEOVER URGED IF TOLL ROAD AGENCIES RESIST MERGER  </P> <P> Orange County's toll road agencies, under fire for spending nearly $1 million  on legal fees, should be the targets of a hostile takeover unless they agree to  merge with the county's other transportation panels, a key county  transportation official said Monday.  </P> <P> Such questions about the toll road agencies' legal costs and unusual travel  spending could undermine efforts to seek voter approval of a countywide sales  tax for highway and transit projects in November or in June, 1990, said lawyer  Dana W. Reed, who is the at-large public member of the Orange County  Transportation Commission.  </P> <P> The Joaquin Hills and Eastern/Foothill Transportation Corridor agencies are  overseeing design and construction of three toll roads planned in south Orange  County.  </P> <P> "We must seriously consider consolidating the (corridor agencies') activities  with other Orange County transportation providers, regardless of whether or not  (they) are willing to cooperate," Reed told fellow commissioners Monday in  Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Reed's comments reflected the continuing power struggle between the commission  and the corridor agencies over control of decision-making on major  transportation projects, at a time when many such projects are being planned  and funded in Orange County.  </P> <P> The agencies last year rejected a proposed merger with other transportation  organizations.  </P> <P> Questions were raised publicly last week about the agencies having racked up  nearly $1 million in legal fees, which were paid mostly to the politically  influential Los Angeles-based law firm of Nossaman Guthner Knox &amp; Elliott  during the last 2 1/2 years.  </P> <P> Also, several thousand dollars in recent travel expenses have drawn criticism  from Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, who is also chairman of  both the Orange County Transportation Commission and the San Joaquin Hills  agency board.  </P> <P> Those legal and travel expenses have been vigorously defended by John Meyer,  executive director for both toll road agencies, which share the same office and  staff.  </P> <P> Meyer also said Monday that he stands by the agencies' rejection of the  proposed merger on the ground that it could jeopardize financing for the toll  roads, which are expected to open in the mid-1990s.  </P> <P> "We don't want to do anything to create a level of uncertainty about our  finance plan," Meyer said.  </P> <P> The toll road agencies have raised more than $100 million from developer fees.  A countywide super-agency created through a merger would be dominated by cities  in the northern county but would control the developers' funds -- which may be  used legally only for the three toll road corridors in the south county, Meyer  said.  </P> <P> Tustin Mayor pro Tem Richard B. Edgar, who is a member of the Foothill/Eastern  road board, as well as a member of the county transportation commission, took  strong exception to Reed's comments Monday.  </P> <P> During the commission meeting, Edgar said it is "premature" to pressure the  toll road agencies to merge with other boards and commissions, because a study  of the potential economic benefits is incomplete.  </P> <P> "I violently object to what he (Reed) said," Edgar added after the meeting. "I  don't think that consolidation (merger) is going to be advantageous."  </P> <P> The toll road agencies were created by state legislation and by joint-powers  agreements between the county and the cities along each of the toll road  routes. Edgar predicted that any attempt to force a merger would fail legally,  because the cities involved would not approve.  </P> <P> Toll road officials last year rejected merger discussions, saying that  consolidation with other panels and commissions would complicate the agencies'  efforts to sell revenue bonds needed to help pay for building toll roads.  </P> <P> In an interview Friday, attorney Gregory W. Sanders, a member of the Nossaman  law firm, accused Stanley T. Oftelie, executive director of the county  transportation commission, of prompting Riley aide Mark Goodman into  questioning spending by the toll road agencies.  </P> <P> Sanders also said Oftelie has been upset with the toll road agencies since they  pushed through legislation in Sacramento that authorized toll collections in  the county.  </P> <P> According to Sanders, Oftelie opposed the legislation behind the scenes while  supporting it in public statements.  </P> <P> On Monday, Oftelie -- who has been promoting a proposal now under study to  merge all of the county's transportation agencies -- said he briefly discussed  the toll road agencies' legal costs with Goodman and Riley a year ago, but has  not since then.  </P> <P> And Oftelie insisted that he has steadfastly promoted the toll road  legislation.  </P></p>

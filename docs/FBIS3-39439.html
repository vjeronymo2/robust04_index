Malcolm Rifkind, the Secretary of State for Defence,  revealed  yesterday that he was commissioning a two-year study to decide  whether to develop a hi-tech, anti-ballistic missile defence  network as part of a continuing re-evaluation of the country's  defence needs.    Although the Government decided last year to halt plans for  a  1bn pound medium-range missile system for the Royal Air Force,  Mr Rifkind said that "in the face of proliferation round the  world" the Government "was considering whether there might be a  need for a defence system in the future."    Defence experts do not rule out the possibility that, within  the next decade, unpredictable countries like Libya could have a  ballistic missile system that would put Britain within range.    Mr Rifkind told the Centre for Defence Studies in London:  "We are looking with our allies at potential risks both to the  UK and to our forces deployed overseas, and all possible means  of countering them." He added: "Conflict is not always,  perhaps not even often, inspired by cold rational judgement. We  cannot predict the scenarios which may unfold, or who our  opponents might be. But it is clear that we need to maintain a  capability to take military action."    The U.S. is also developing systems with a longer range than  Patriot's, such as Lockheed's Theatre High Altitude Air Defence  (Thaad) systems. Mr Rifkind emphasised that warfare at all  levels was becoming "much more technologically sophisticated."    He also confirmed yesterday that the MoD [Ministry of  Defense] is considering whether to acquire conventionally armed  cruise missiles.    The Royal Navy is known to be keen to have  submarine-launched  cruise missiles.    And in a another move which will be warmly welcomed by the  Royal Navy, Mr Rifkind identified the aircraft carrier,  amphibious forces and equipment, and the nuclear submarine as  central to Britain's maritime strategy.    He also underlined the continuing need for tanks, attack  helicopters, and an advanced fighter, such as the Eurofighter  2OOO.    Mr Rifkind added: "Prudence and caution oblige me to accept  that it is entirely conceivable that, before the end of the  decade, the West will find a number of different circumstances  arising where it must take military action.    "It could also find it necessary to protect and evacuate  civilians caught up in a conflict. And it is more than likely  that we will be asked by the UN or the Conference on Security  and Cooperation in Europe to undertake new peace support  missions."    Mr Rifkind did not suggest that an anti-missile system  might,  in the long term, coincide with a reduction in the UK's  deterrent capability. But he cited "the five principle choices  which bear Britain's defence capabilities" -- the decision to  deploy an independent nuclear deterrent; the choice of  collective security; tbe responsibility for 14 dependent  territories; support for the RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary] in  Northern Ireland; and active commitment to the UN and collective  global security.    The Secretary of State added: "We have to ensure that we  design military units to make a useful contribution to  operations of all kinds. But we have always made clear that we  do not necessarily need to plan to have all capabilities within  our armed forces."</p>

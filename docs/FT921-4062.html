			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Letter: Translation of expenses marks the real life policy progress Sir, It is always a pity to spoil a good story. However, your article on SIB's proposals for disclosing life assurance companies' expenses, ('SIB bows to life companies' lobbying', March 5) is well wide of the mark. Expense figures which enable customers and commentators to make effective comparisons between products and between companies have been available for some time. SIB's proposals involve making these more easily understood and more readily available, and we support these moves. Indeed, we would be delighted if these proposals were also to be applied to the products offered by banks and building societies, so that consumers could make better-informed comparisons across the whole range of products on offer.

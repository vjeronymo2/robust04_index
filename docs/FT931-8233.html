			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / ICI board poised to press ahead with demerger of group THE BOARD of Imperial Chemical Industries, the UK's largest manufacturer, is believed to be almost certain to vote on Wednesday to split the company into two separately-quoted groups. However, a debate is raging within ICI and SG Warburg, its adviser, about how to structure the expected Pounds 1bn fund-raising necessary to carry out the demerger. Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, and Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief operating officer, are determined to complete the move in spite of poor trading conditions, according to non-executive directors. At least one board member has expressed doubts about whether the new ICI will be able stand on its own during the recession without the cash-flow generated by the pharmaceuticals division. One option for financing the move is an immediate rights issue by the pre-demerged ICI. The structure of such a deal would probably be complicated. Another possibility involves an international issue at a later date by Zeneca, ICI's newly created pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and specialty chemicals group. 'It all comes down to John Mayo and what he can persuade the board to do,' said one investment banker. Mr Mayo, Zeneca's finance director and a former Warburg corporate financier, is thought to favour the second solution. However, others feel that the ICI rights issue is preferable, given the stock market's current receptiveness to issues, and with ICI craving certainty in the financing. An issue of this size could only be underwritten in the London market. The rights issue is required to clear some of ICI's debt, estimated by broker BZW at between Pounds 1.7bn and Pounds 2bn. Without the issue, the new ICI, whose cash-flow has suffered from the recession, would find it hard to pay its dividend. Since the demerger was announced in July, trading conditions for ICI's chemicals business have deteriorated. Earlier this week, Rhone-Poulenc, France's largest chemical group, said the European chemicals industry was in a worse state than during the 1973 oil shock. ICI's industrial chemicals business is expected only to have only broken even last year on turnover of about Pounds 1.4bn. Zeneca might have some difficulty completing a rights issue given the poor recent stock market performance of drugs stocks. In addition, when ICI reveals its full-year results on Thursday, the group is expected to show that Zeneca's performance has deteriorated since 1991. Hoare Govett, the UK broker, estimates that Zeneca's operating profits fell from Pounds 917m in 1991 to Pounds 765m last year. Its pharmaceuticals operations are expected to post static results, while those of its agrochemicals business will decline. The speciality chemicals division, which was designed to provide counter-cyclical earnings, is forecast to make operating profits of only about Pounds 26m on turnover of more than Pounds 1bn. On Wednesday, ICI's board, comprising eight executive directors and six non-executive directors, will decide on a straight show of hands whether to split the company. The decision will be revealed the following day after the 1992 full-year results are announced. How to raise money, Page 10</p>

Thus, the item or component must have been constructed or the process practiced. Workability is generally established when the item, component, or process has been analyzed or tested sufficiently to demonstrate to reasonable people skilled in the applicable art that there is a high probability that it will operate as intended. Whether, how much, and what type of analysis or testing is required to establish workability depends on the nature of the item, component, or process, and the state where it could be offered for sale or sold on the commercial market, nor must the item, component or process be actually reduced to practice within the meeting of Title 35 of the United States Code. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) A computer program has been successfully operated in a computer and tested to the extent sufficient to demonstrate to reasonable persons skilled in the art that the program can reasonably be expected to perform its intended purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Computer software, other than computer programs, has been tested or analyzed to the extent sufficient to demonstrate to reasonable persons skilled in the art that the software can reasonably be expected to perform its intended purpose. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Computer software documentation required to be delivered under a contract has been written, in any medium, in sufficient detail to comply with requirements under that contract. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Developed exclusively at private expense  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> means development was accomplished entirely with costs charged to indirect cost pools, costs not allocated to a government contract, or any combination thereof. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Private expense determinations should be made at the lowest practicable level. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Under fixed price contracts, when total costs are greater than the firm fixed price or ceiling price of the contract, the additional development costs necessary to complete development shall not be considered when determining whether development was at Government, private, or mixed expense. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Developed exclusively with Government funds  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> means develop was not accomplished exclusively or partially at private expense. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Developed with mixed funding  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> means development was accomplished partially with costs charged to indirect cost pools and/or costs not allocated to a government contract, and partially with costs charged directly to a government contract. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (11)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Form, fit, and function data  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> means technical data that describe the required overall physical, functional, and performance characteristics, (along with the qualification requirements, if applicable) of an item, component, or process to the extent necessary to permit identification of physically and functionally interchangeable items. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (12)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Generated  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> means technical data or computer software first created in the performance of this contract. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (13)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Government purpose  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> means any activity in which the United States Government is a party, including cooperative agreements with international or multi-national defense organizations or sales or transfers by the United States Government to foreign governments or international organizations.

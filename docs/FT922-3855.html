			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Thai alliance seeks to name PM Thailand's pro-army coalition, which sparked off days of bloody mass protests by putting unelected ex-general Suchinda Kraprayoon into power, insisted yesterday it still had the right to name the next prime minister, Reuter reports from Bangkok. 'As a majority we should have the option to form a government,' Mr Narong Wongwan, leader of the largest parliamentary party, said after a meeting of coalition parties in a Bangkok hotel. 'The coalition parties reiterate our unchanged support for Somboon Rahong as prime minister,' he said. Mr Somboon, a retired air chief marshal, emerged as the coalition's candidate after the resignation of Mr Suchinda on May 24 left the 57m people without a political leader.</p>

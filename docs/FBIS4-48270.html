			<p>BFN     [Text] Libreville, 16 May (AFP) -- The Union for Democracy  and Social Development of Equatorial Guinea [UDDS], a  Libreville-based opposition party which is not recognized by the  government, has urged the Equatorial Guinean Government to hold  roundtable talks with all the opposition parties before new  elections are held.    In a communique sent to AFP in Libreville today, the UDDS  stressed that issues to be discussed at the talks should include  the formulation of laws on the press, unions, associations, the  establishment of a human rights charter, as well as the access  of all parties to state media.    The UDDS says it is "ready to negotiate directly and  unconditionally" with President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo or  his representatives "in order to end the country's  sociopolitical crisis."    Municipal elections are scheduled to be held by the end of  the year. To this end, a delegation led by a senior civil  servant in charge of elections at the Spanish Interior Ministry,  Miguel Angel Abat, recently visited Malabo to assist the  authorities with electoral code reforms and electoral census,  reliable sources in Libreville have disclosed.</p>

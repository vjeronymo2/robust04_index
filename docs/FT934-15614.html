			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Nuclear energy a failed option Sir, Ann Bisconti, employed by the US nuclear industry to paint rosy pictures, makes a valiant, but vain attempt at statistical revisionism in her letter, 'US public backs nuclear energy option' (September 29). All recent independent national opinion surveys not generated by the nuclear industry definitively show that Americans have had enough of the costly, dangerous and unreliable nuclear power 'option'. Since 1982, the Harris polls, Breglio/Lake and Frederick/Schneiders have all found that 60 per cent or more of all Americans 'oppose the building/construction of more nuclear power plants in the US'. In fact, each year since 1975 that this unambiguous question has been asked, the result has always been a steady increase in opposition. In 1992, 65 per cent of those polled were opposed to more nuclear power development. The 1992 poll by Frederick/Schneiders, commissioned by the Safe Energy Communication Council, found that 76 per cent of Americans want the nation to give top priority to renewable resources (like solar, thermal and wind), energy efficiency and conservation, and natural gas (in that order). Nuclear power was placed a distant fourth with only 11 per cent. It is time for Ms Bisconti and other nuclear cheerleaders to face the music of the market place. Despite receiving 65 per cent of all US energy research and development funds since 1948, every US nuclear power plant ordered since 1973 has been subsequently cancelled. From main street to Wall Street, the nuclear 'option' has failed the economic litmus test. The problem of sage, permanent nuclear waste disposal remains intractable and unsolved. Safer, cleaner and cheaper options exist today in the US and abroad.

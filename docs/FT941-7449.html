			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Further cocoa deficits forecast The world cocoa market could see three further years of production deficits, two of surplus and then another two years of shortfalls, according to a paper drawn up by the secretariat of the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO), reports Reuter. The paper was discussed yesterday at the first council session of the new cocoa agreement. Earlier this month, the ICCO projected a production deficit of 110,000 tonnes in 1993-94 (October-September), which would be the third in succession. This deficit could grow to 209,000 tonnes in 1994-95 and then be reduced to 135,000 tonnes in 1995-96 and 31,000 tonnes in 1996-97, the paper suggested. Two years of small production surpluses of 30,000 tonnes and 18,000 tonnes were then likely, followed in 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 by shortfalls of 41,000 tonnes and 95,000 tonnes. 'Cocoa prices. . . are projected to continue to show significant gains over the next two years. A noticeable consequence of the price rises is that growth in the world consumption of cocoa. . . is expected to be arrested and may even suffer a decline after the 1994-95 season,' the paper said.</p>

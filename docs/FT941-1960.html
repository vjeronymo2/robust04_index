			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Euro-fraud To the untutored eye, the effort to combat fraud against the European Union budget can seem an elaborate and unproductive ritual. Every year, the EU Court of Auditors chronicles waste and chicanery in the spending of official funds and urges the European Commission to sharpen its controls. Every year, the Commission promises to crack down and recoup missing money. Meanwhile, large-scale abuse of the budget - especially of farm subsidies - continues unabated. This view may be a caricature, but it is sufficiently well established in the minds of European citizens to have become a blot on the EU's credibility. As pressure on the budget grows and the dismantling of borders within the Union provides increased opportunities for fraud, the problem can only intensify. More clearly needs to be done to tighten monitoring of the effectiveness with which taxpayers' money is spent. Fortunately, there are signs that the Commission and at least some member states are showing greater attentiveness to the issue. This week, Mr Peter Schmidhuber, EU budget commissioner, will unveil plans to step up the fight against fraud, with additional Commission staff devoted to the task, improved procedures for co-operation with national judicial and police authorities, and more extensive sanctions against wrongdoers. Separately, the British government will today put forward its own ideas, including a proposal that fraud against the EU budget be made a criminal offence across the Union, as is fraud against national budgets. These are steps in the right direction, but they do not demonstrate that the Union is treating the issue with quite the seriousness it deserves. It is far from sure that the Council of Ministers will unanimously back the British initiative. Nor can member governments be counted on to give the Commission the assistance it needs, especially when it comes to extending scrutiny from the agricultural budget to structural funds, often, perhaps unfairly, criticised for fostering corruption in the Union's poorer regions. Moreover, the suspicion persists that the Commission is running behind the issue rather than giving a lead. This week it has come in for withering criticism from the EU auditors for restricting their inquiries and behaving as if particular problems were isolated 'accidents'. It should be clear by now that various EU programmes offer opportunities for systematic fraud. The Commission can set an example in combating it by showing more systematic transparency to those with the job of monitoring its activities.</p>

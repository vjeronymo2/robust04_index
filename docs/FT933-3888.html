			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Wholesale prices fall A SHARP drop in US wholesale prices last month provided further confirmation of declining inflationary pressures, the Labour Department reported yesterday, writes Michael Prowse in Washington. The producer price index for finished goods fell 0.6 per cent between July and August, against a consensus forecast on Wall Street of a rise of 0.2 per cent. It was the third consecutive monthly decline. The annual rate of producer price inflation fell to 0.6 per cent against 1.3 per cent in July. Officials said the sharp fall in wholesale prices mainly reflected an erratic 25.6 per cent decline in tobacco prices last month. A 0.5 per cent increase in food prices was more than offset by a 0.8 per cent decline in the cost of energy. The 'core' producer price index, which excludes food and energy, fell 1 per cent. Excluding tobacco, core prices were up 0.2 per cent. The weakness of wholesale prices was consistent with recent reports of sluggish economic growth.</p>

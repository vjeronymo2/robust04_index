			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: US data prompt setback in bonds and shares - Market Report A heavy setback in global bond markets, prompted by unexpectedly strong data on the US economy, sparked off another slide in the London equity market yesterday afternoon. Towards the close of business, when UK government bonds were more than 1 1/2 points down and stock index futures at a substantial discount to the FT-SE 100 Index, share prices virtually collapsed. The FT-SE 100 index ended the day at 3,065.1, a net 47.6 down in its largest daily fall since mid-June. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, less closely linked to futures selling, held its loss to 32.8 for a final reading of 3,616.1. Market strategists were significantly less pessimistic than the fall in the Footsie suggested, and pointed out that liquidity is notoriously thin on Friday afternoons. Mr Ian Harnett of Strauss Turnbull described the outcome of the equity session as 'a great buying opportunity'. The more serious blows fell on the bond markets, where UK gilts began to fall sharply following the announcement at mid-morning of an August Public Sector Borrowing Requirement well outside market estimates. Both short and long-dated gilts were already sharply off when US bonds began to shy away as New York awaited two key sets of economic data. News that in August, US capacity utilisation had jumped to 84.7 per cent and industrial production had gained 0.7 per cent brought a wide-ranging fall in bond markets. The slide in UK gilts quickly gathered pace, with some analysts warning that the Federal Reserve might raise rates very soon. Concern focused around prospects for the auction of a new UK gilt on Wednesday, the Bank of England confirming market expectations by announcing yesterday that it would be a conventional bond maturing in the 2004-2006 range. Some pessimists whispered that the Bank had argued for a full point rise in base rates this week. The FT-SE 100 Index has fallen by nearly 2.4 per cent this week as the first rise in base rates for nearly five years has left the UK bond markets still vulnerable to shocks from overseas. Weakness in German bonds yesterday was seen as a further threat to gilt-edged securities. Early trading saw equities, as expected, driven by pressures from the expiry of the September contract in the stock index futures market - although this passed off without incident. The Footsie was 20 points up at first, and then 7 points down as the futures-related blue chips swayed with the September contract expiry. But these technical factors in equities were quickly forgotten when bond prices began to fall. Few sectors were spared in the general shake-out. Dollar-orientated shares took further presure when the US currency weakened. The blue chip oil shares no longer provided the positive lead of the past few sessions. Retail, consumer and store shares took further punishment from fears that the interest rate cycle was about to turn upwards much sooner than expected. Banks gave back a few early gains as the rout spread across the market. Many analysts remained bullish, maintaining that the US data confirmed that the economy is recovering strongly. By this yardstick, the falls in bond markets were to be expected, but equities should benefit over the medium term. Bond/equity market ratings are believed to be less stretched in London than in the US, and the spread between London and New York equity markets is also regarded as favourable to the UK. However, little genuine and lasting upturn in UK equities is thought likely until the gilt-edged market can at least stabilise and then make some recovery from its losses.</p>

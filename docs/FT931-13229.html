			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Arts: An unembellished voice - William Weaver finds a reliable guide to Italian singers SINGERS OF ITALIAN OPERA by John Rosselli Cambridge Pounds 29.95, 272 pages John Rosselli's 1984 study of the economics of Italian opera, The Opera Industry in Italy from Cimarosa to Verdi, examined the history of Italy's lyric theatre not from the usual point of view of the composer but from the impresario's often muddled and makeshift office. Drawing on the long-neglected Lanari papers in the Biblioteca Nazionale in Florence, Rosselli drew a picture of an exotic world that, while generating a multitude of enduring masterpieces (and an even greater multitude of flashes-in-the-pan), struggled against endless material problems, not to mention social and political obstacles. To that book, Rosselli's new volume, Singers of Italian Opera, is the perfect complement. While few impresarios found biographers and even fewer were literate enough to write their memoirs, singers' careers have hardly gone unrecorded. But in a competition for the highest degree of unreliability, the biographies, autobiographies and hagiographies of Italian opera singers would surely take first prize. Scraping away the encrustations of legend, the inventions of hack journalists, the exaggerations of the singers themselves, Rosselli has arrived, insofar as possible, at the naked truth. Admittedly, by omitting false or suspect information, the book can here and there seem disappointingly bland. Singers' honoraria make less than enthralling reading; but this is the first time that an opera historian has seriously tried to make sense of contracts involving (to mention only a few currencies of the period) Neapolitan ducats, Austrian thalers, Piedmontese lire, gold Napoleons, and finally US dollars. Establishing comparative buying power is even more daunting (and to complicate matters, singers were sometimes paid not in cash but in kind: lodging, firewood, travel expenses). For many years singers were a part of royal retinues, subject to rulers' caprice; their careers were often brief, even more often inglorious. Despite his stern scholarly intentions, Rosselli allows room for a few illustrative anecdotes which hardly inspire nostalgia or, still less, envy. The chapter on castrati makes severe demands on the faint-hearted reader, but never has this delicate subject been expounded with greater clarity and sense. The modern opera fan frequently thinks of singers as superstars, ignorant, greedy, causing hard-up opera houses endless headaches and driving ticket prices through the roof. But, as the reader of this study soon realises, singers themselves have traditionally been exploited: by their families, their teachers, their managers, their employers; and for every millionaire tenor there are dozens of tragic failures. Verdi did not build his Casa di Riposo without reason. Even the great artists of the golden turn-of-the-century had to pay the price of gruelling tours and often rough transatlantic crossings, compared to which jet lag is a trivial irritation. Rosselli's generous notes constitute an invaluable bibliography, which his final 'Note on further reading' admirably completes. This dispassionate, but not detached study of the singer of Italian opera, from the Renaissance to the almost-present, can be read as a corrective antidote to the flood of 'official', usually gossipy and inaccurate lives, which not even this dam of fact will be able to staunch.</p>

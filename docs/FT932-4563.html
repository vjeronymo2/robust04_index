			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Law firm's advice to trustees raises doubt on pension rules PENSION fund trustees defending a High Court action brought by the Securities and Investments Board were advised by a leading law firm that it was 'almost impossible to pursue a trustee for negligence when it comes to investment'. The advice raises questions about the effectiveness of the UK regulatory framework for pensions, as the government-appointed Goode Committee prepares its review of pensions law. The advice, contained in a letter from Mr John Quarrell, a partner in the West End firm of Nabarro Nathanson, to Melton Medes Pension Trustees, related to a transaction that led to large losses for the pension fund. The letter was written in September 1991 after seven employees of Melton Medes, an unquoted Midlands-based conglomerate, had approached a leading QC for advice. The letter said: 'You really have to have your fingers in the till and it must be clearly shown that whilst they are in there they are purloining large amounts of money, before anyone can bring a likely successful action.' Asked to comment on the advice, Melton Medes said questions should be directed to solicitor DJ Freeman. Mr Marcus Rutherford, a partner in the firm, said in the light of legal proceedings over the fund 'it would be inappropriate to comment'. The trustees had approved a loan of Pounds 4m from two pension funds in the Melton Medes group to the parent company at uncommercial interest rates. The loan was repaid in shares in two small quoted companies in which Melton Medes and Mr Nathu Ram Puri, its chairman, had large stakes. The pension funds suffered when both companies' share prices fell. The SIB's High Court writ asks Mr Puri and the trustees for Pounds 691,681, plus interest, to be restored to the pension funds, or such sum as the court sees fit. Mr Puri and the pension fund trustees are also the subject of legal proceedings in the High Court brought by seven employees. They have asked the court to permit the release of funds from the pension scheme to finance an action challenging the validity of the trust deeds. A question of trust, Page 20</p>

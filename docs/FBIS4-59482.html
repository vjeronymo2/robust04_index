			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lamis K. Andoni] </F>   [Text] After a week of difficult negotiations, Palestinian  leader Yasir 'Arafat has successfully talked prominent  personalities from the Israeli occupied territories and the  diaspora into joining a Palestinian authority to run autonomy in  the West Bank and Gaza Strip.    By Friday night, at least 17 personalities accepted to take  part in the 25-member authority. Palestine Liberation  Organisation (PLO) officials expected a complete list to be  ready in the next 24 hours.    In addition to 15 names announced by the PLO, Palestinian  officials said that prominent Palestinian businessman Munib  al-Masri has joined the authority, while Dr. As'ad  'Abd-al-Rahman, the Amman-based head of Shuman Foundation, is  considering the offer.    Initial reluctance by key Palestinian figures was replaced  by  approval, apparently in response to Israeli threats to suspend  the entry of the Palestinian police force into the Gaza Strip  and Jericho and influenced by the wave of popular celebrations  that swept the territories over the transfer of Israeli  responsibilities to the PLO.    At least two PLO executive committee members, Jamal  al-Surani  and Jawid al-Ghusayn, were expected to join the authority, and  even Dr. Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, who has condemned the  economic part of the agreement, might change his mind.    The officials said that Arab -- mostly Egyptian -- and  international personalities involved in the peace process have  been trying to convince the architect of the Israeli-Palestinian  agreement, Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu-Mazin) to join the authority.    The Palestinian authority is expected to include 15  personalities from the occupied territories and 10 from the  diaspora -- including two women from each category.    Three key figures who had initially refused to take part in  the authority either in protest against the terms of the  Israeli-Palestinian agreement reached in Cairo on May 4 or  against Mr. 'Arafat's single-handed leadership style appeared on  top of a list officially delivered by the PLO to the Israeli  government on Thursday night.    Palestinian leader Faysal al-Husayni, head of the  Palestinian  team to the bilateral negotiations with Israel, Dr. Sa'ib  'Urayqat, and former Palestinian spokeswoman Hanan 'Ashrawi,  accepted to join the Palestinian authority after having snubbed  the offer.    Both Mr. al-Husayni and Dr. 'Urayqat have expressed serious  reservations about the autonomy deal and had urged Mr. 'Arafat  not to sign it. But the biggest surprise was Dr. 'Ashrawi, who  has repeatedly declared that she wanted to remain independent to  head a Palestinian human rights commission.    In a lecture at the Shuman Foundation two weeks ago, Dr.  'Ashrawi lambasted the PLO leadership for its handling of the  negotiations with Israel.    By accepting the post, Dr. 'Ashrawi became one of two  prominent Palestinian women on the Palestinian authority. Fatah  Central Committee Member Intisar al-Wazir, widow of PLO military  leader Khalil al-Wazir, who was assassinated by Israeli squads  in 1988, was among the first to accept the appointment to  practically the first Palestinian administration of part of the  occupied Palestinian territories.    There were no statements made by the leaders especially Mr.  al-Husayni, Dr. 'Urayqat and Dr. 'Ashrawi, explaining their  position. But it seemed that they had decided to work from  within the authority in spite of their dissatisfaction with the  agreement itself and Mr. 'Arafat's modus operandi.    Mr. 'Arafat himself was undeterred by the three key leaders'  negative comments about the agreement, and instead had  challenged them to either join him to shoulder the  responsibility or confine themselves to the role of disgruntled  observers.    "'Arafat has been calling each nominee, especially the ones  who oppose the Cairo agreement, and urging them not to abandon  him at this critical stage," one PLO official said.    According to different accounts, the master tactician has  been effectively challenging his critics to join him to face the  task of building a Palestinian state instead of taking, "the  easy way out."    Israeli threats to delay the entry of Palestinian police if  a  Palestinian authority was not declared and the enormous shift of  the mood in the occupied territories in favour of the agreement  have contributed to mellowing the initially vehement opposition  to the provisions of he deal.    Mr. al-Husayni, however, is said to have asked for  assurances  that his authority as leader of Fatah in the West Bank should  not continue to be marginalised and bypassed by Mr. 'Arafat, who  has been using other channels to convey orders and instructions  to the organisation.    Furthermore, the position of Mr. al-Husayni and Dr.  'Urayqat is to a large extent reflective of the stand of the  Fatah organisation in the West Bank, that insists on being  represented in the Palestinian authority.    According to information available from the West Bank, some  influential Fatah rank and file, including young deportees who  were allowed to return last month had urged Mr. al-Husayni and  Dr. 'Urayqat to accept.    Information available from Tunis and the occupied  territories  also suggest that many Fatah leaders feared that by boycotting  the authority, the actual leadership will be confined to  "traditional personalities" that have already accepted Mr.  'Arafat's offer dealing a blow to Fatah.    Faced with reluctance by the historic leaders of the pro-PLO  groups in the occupied territories, Mr. 'Arafat went straight to  more traditional and conservative figures, sending alarms among  the Fatah rank and file.    According to well-placed officials, Fatah officials strongly  protested Mr. 'Arafat's attempt to appoint Jamil al-Tarifi, head  of the Palestinian liaison committee with Israel, but who is not  seen as part of the more militant leadership that secured and  sustained support for the PLO over the years.    As names of members of the Palestinian authorities were  starting to leak, many feared that it will be a weak body that  would further consolidate Mr. 'Arafat's domination and will not  challenge further concession to the Israelis.    Yet, it remains to be seen how Mr. al-Husayni, Dr. 'Urayqat  and Dr. 'Ashrawi will reconcile between their misgivings about  the agreement and being members of the body entrusted with  implementing it. Well-informed Palestinian sources said that  the three feel that they could influence the continuing process  of negotiations, instead of leaving it to Mr. 'Arafat and a  small circle of aides in the hope that future steps will pave  the way for Palestinian sovereignty.    Other PLO officials were very critical of what they viewed  as  the contradictory position of the three leaders, who confined  themselves to verbal protest but "towed the line" in the end.    Opposition officials, however, declined from attacking any  of  the personalities who accepted to join.    It was a sign that even the opposition hopes that the  presence of outspoken critical members in the authority will  pressure Mr. 'Arafat to yield some authority and not to block  elections as many fear he would.    So far the Palestinian authority is basically a coalition of  Fatah and independents. The major other group is the  Palestinian Democratic Union, FIDA, led by Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh.  It was still unclear whether Mr. 'Abd-Rabbuh himself will join  or confine FIDA's representation to personalities from the  occupied territories.    'Azmi al-Shu'aybi, FIDA's leader in the West Bank, was  already included in the authority and FIDA officials Sami  al-Kilani and Zahirah Kamal are strong nominees. If Ms. Kamal  is appointed, the Palestinian authority will include three women.    FIDA has publicly condemned the Cairo agreement but  nevertheless decided to join the authority.    The Palestine People's Party (PPP), which has boycotted the  last rounds of negotiations, has maintained its stand of  refusing to be part of the authority.    Agencies add: PLO difficulties in naming a full slate of 24  member for the Palestinian National Authority has become the  latest snag in the much-delayed self-rule plan agreed last  September.    The list so far includes Mr. 'Arafat, PLO Executive  Committee  members Samir Ghawshah and Yasir 'Amr, chief economist Ahmad  Quray', two deportees and many of the prominent Palestinians who  have taken part in peace talks with Israel since 1991, PLO  negotiator Nabil Sha'th said.    Asked if all the nominees had agreed, he said: "None of  these names is nominated without being fully negotiated first."    The PLO Executive Committee had approved all of them, Dr.  Sha'th added at a news conference in Cairo.    Dr. Sha'th transmitted the list to Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin on Thursday afternoon and Israeli consent to it  was only a formality, he said.    Dr. Sha'th said Mr. 'Arafat would appoint the remaining nine  members within a week.    Asked why the PLO decided to send an incomplete list, he  said: "It's because there was a need by the Israelis to be  assured on our seriousness in starting to conduct the  authority's business."    The PLO has spent much longer than expected making the  nominations, which the Israelis had originally hoped to receive  about the same time as the signing ceremony on May 4.    Other members including Dr. Sha'th himself, Zakariya al-Agha  and Furayh Abu-Middayn from Gaza, Riyad al-Za'nun, Bethlehem  Mayor Ilyas Frayj and deportee 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Hajj Ahmad.    Dr. Sha'th said he expected the Palestinian authority would  be in place in Gaza and Jericho by next Tuesday but it is too  early to say which members would have which responsibilities.    He said he himself had been reluctant to take part but did  not feel he could refuse at this stage in the process.    Dr. Sha'th also said that the signing of agreement in Cairo  has triggered a "faster pace of fund giving" by Western nations.    He disclosed new donations including 14 million francs  ($2.45  million) from France for a police communications system, $2  million from South Korea for computers and other equipment and  58 military vehicles from Greece.    He said that 176 jeeps and trucks donated by the United  States for the police from their European stock would arrive in  Egypt next Sunday. The police have been hampered by a shortage  of vehicles.</p>

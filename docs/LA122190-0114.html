			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> USX to Pay Record Safety Fine: The nation's biggest steel maker agreed to pay  $3.25 million for health and safety violations at two of its mills.  </P> <P> USX's USS division reached the settlement over alleged unsafe conditions at its  Fairless Works plant, outside Philadelphia, and its Clairton Works, near  Pittsburgh. The federal agency had charged that Fairless had unsafe walks,  cranes and electrical equipment and did not do enough to protect workers'  hearing. It will be the largest payment in the history of the Occupational  Safety and Health Administration, eclipsing a fine of $1.5 million paid by  Chrysler Corp. in 1988 over violations at a plant in Newark, Del.  </P></p>

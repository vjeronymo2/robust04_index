			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AND NOW IT'S THE SENATE'S TURN  </P> <P> Next Thursday, the Judiciary Committee of the state Senate will have the  opportunity to demonstrate whether its regard for the public's safety outweighs  its fear of the gun lobby's vindictive bully boys. On that day, the committee  will consider 14 firearms regulation bills already passed by the Assembly.  </P> <P> If the senators can summon up the courage this occasion demands -- and which  the other chamber already has displayed -- California will take another step  toward enacting the United States' first comprehensive system of rational  firearms regulation. As such, it would constitute a national example of how a  legislative body can, in fact, strike an appropriate balance between the  public's right to walk its streets in safety and the legitimate interests of  real sportsmen.  </P> <P> Most of the bills to be heard simply would increase the penalties for various  existing firearms offenses. Like other such measures, they have a certain  cathartic value and make showy citations in their sponsors' campaign  literature. There is, however, little evidence to show they are of much  practical benefit. Four of the proposals, on the other hand, are desperately  needed, and deserve quick and decisive approval.  </P> <P> For example, AB 497, which was introduced by Democrat Lloyd G. Connelly of  Sacramento, would extend the 15-day wait between the purchase of a handgun and  its delivery to all sales of all firearms. That two-week period would allow the  Department of Justice to ensure that the prospective buyer is not a person  prohibited from owning a gun under the bill. These would include individuals  found mentally infirm under law, convicted felons, those found guilty of  certain violent misdemeanors within the previous 10 years and persons  prohibited from possessing a weapon as a condition of probation. AB 497 is  supported by every major law enforcement agency in the state, and Gov. George  Deukmejian has indicated he will sign it. The Judiciary Committee should help  give him the opportunity to do so.  </P> <P> It also should do its part to send him AB 1680, written by Democrat Rusty  Areias of Los Banos. He proposes that anyone purchasing a concealable weapon be  required to complete a simple 2-hour course in basic firearms safety. In a  little more than a decade, the number of California households possessing a  handgun has doubled to 2.5 million. Given this explosive growth, the need to  enact Areias' common sense measure is clear.  </P> <P> Similarly, the dictates of simple reason demand passage of two bills by  Democrat Johan Klehs of Castro Valley. His measures are vital complements to  the ban on military-style assault weapons enacted earlier this year. One would  prohibit the sale of detachable magazines with a capacity of more than 10  rounds. The other would proscribe so-called multiburst trigger activators and  military-style shotguns with rotary or detachable magazines capable of holding  more than five shells.  </P> <P> No serious sportsman has any use for such guns; thugs, lunatics, murderers of  schoolchildren and killers of police officers can't do without them. The issue  is joined. The Senate need only declare whose side it's on.  </P></p>

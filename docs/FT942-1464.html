			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Bolivar suffers steep decline Venezuela's currency, the bolivar, has fallen sharply this week, amid public concern over the government's handling of the country's banking crisis and rising fears of exchange controls or other dramatic government action. Strong purchases of dollars drove the bolivar to 200 per dollar at midday yesterday in Caracas commercial banks, a 10.5 per cent devaluation since the beginning of the week. The bolivar has fallen by 47 per cent since the end of 1993. Demand for dollars has been intensified by delay in the re-opening of seven commercial banks and a commercial finance company closed by the government on June 14. Government officials have made contradictory public statements as to when the affected banks would reopen and how much money each depositor would receive. Three banks in which the government has intervened, Amazonas, Bancor and La Guaira, reopened yesterday, behind schedule, to begin paying depositors up to Dollars 500 (Pounds 325) each. But it is not clear if individual depositors will eventually be paid a maximum of 4m bolivars (about Pounds 14,300) as stipulated by current legislation, or double that, as suggested by one government official. The banks subject to intervention held in all about Dollars 2.6bn in public deposits as of May 30. In May, the government reportedly came close to applying foreign exchange controls amid heavy buying of dollars following the abrupt resignation of Mrs Ruth de Krivoy as central bank president in April. Fears have risen that the government may again be considering this strategy. The central bank has not released figures on its international monetary reserves since April, but the country's reserves fell by 14 per cent, or Dollars 1.7bn, during first quarter of this year.</p>

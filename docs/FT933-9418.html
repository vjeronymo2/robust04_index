			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / International Company News: Petrofina warns of profits tumble PETROFINA, the oil group which is one of Belgium's largest industrial companies, yesterday warned that consolidated profits in the first half were likely to tumble to BFr3.8bn (Dollars 105m) compared with BFr4.16bn last time. The warning came with a forecast that cash-flow for the first six months of 1993 was also likely to be reduced from BFr19bn to BFr15.5bn. Turnover was also down from BFr270bn to BFr265bn. Petrofina blamed the 'persistent depression' in all industrial sectors in Europe and the US, particularly in chemicals. Margins in the first quarter were extremely weak in refining and petrochemicals, while crude oil prices declined progressively, the company said. In chemicals, US profits offset losses in Europe, although profitability remained below the first half of 1992. Although the European refineries enjoyed a recovery in margins, these were reduced by a four-week strike at the company's Antwerp refinery. Results for the first half include BFr2.5bn in gains from sales of gas properties in the US and real estate in Belgium. They also include BFr500m in accelerated depreciation and restructuring costs. By comparison, the 1992 half-yearly results included a write-back on a provision on stock amounting to BFr1.3bn. Petrofina said it hoped the slow reduction in interest rates and the rise in the value of the dollar at the end of the second quarter offered some hope of a recovery. Petrofina was the subject of takeover speculation earlier this year, following a decision to cut its dividend for the first time since 1959, after consolidated profits fell 72 per cent to BFr4.6bn in 1992.</p>

			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 6 ARRESTED IN MELEE AT GAY FESTIVAL IN SANTA ANA  </P> <P> Six people were arrested Sunday after a fist-swinging brawl broke out among  more than 50 militant gays and fundamentalist Christians at Orange County's  first Gay Pride Festival.  </P> <P> About 50 riot-equipped Santa Ana police were called in to Centennial Regional  Park to quell the disturbance, but no serious injuries were reported as the  two-day gay festival concluded Sunday evening.  </P> <P> The six people arrested -- identified by police as militant gay activists as  well as fundamental Christians -- were taken to the Santa Ana police station,  where they were cited for interfering with police and released. The misdemeanor  violation carries a maximum $500 penalty.  </P> <P> The arrested were Jade Stone, 21, of San Francisco; Todd Michael Bales, 24, of  Buena Park; Patrick Kieran Brown, 19, of Placentia; Ruben Mario Chaves, 28, of  Norwalk; Robert Charles Miller, 32, of Corona, and William Randall Chadwick,  35, of Corona.  </P> <P> Wearing riot helmets and swinging batons, police had to keep separating the two  sides, who continued to taunt each other for nearly an hour. Santa Ana Police  Lt. Robert Helton said police were actively involved for about 15 minutes.  </P> <P> Police ordered organizers of the Orange County Cultural Pride Festival to lock  the gates to the festival grounds for half an hour after the brawl and  considered shutting the event down early, but decided to let it continue as  scheduled for the rest of the day.  </P> <P> Festival organizers estimated 10,000 gays attended the festival grounds Sunday  and were watching and applauding a gay pride parade when the violence broke out  along the parade route, near the park entrance on Edinger Avenue at Mohawk  Drive. The parade took place around the park's driving circle but outside the  gated festival grounds, where visitors had to pay a $10 admission fee.  </P> <P> About 75 gay participants of the parade, some of them members of the militant  homosexual groups Act Up of Los Angeles and the Orange County Visibility  League, encircled about 20 to 25 fundamentalists on a grassy knoll near the  corner of Mohawk and Edinger about 1:30 p.m.  </P> <P> The gays began chanting "kiss, kiss, kiss," and several pairs began kissing  each other. Several of the fundamentalists, clearly outnumbered, tried to  retreat as they yelled "Repent! Repent!"  </P> <P> A moment after the kissing started, the two sides started shoving and hitting  each other. Police moved in and wrestled two of the gays to the ground, pinning  them to the asphalt with their batons.  </P> <P> Helton said officers finally intervened in the confrontation after "sporadic  flare-ups" between the pro-gay and anti-gay factions.  </P> <P> But after the initial fights were quelled, other gays standing nearby in a  growing crowd of about 200 people began pushing the fundamentalists out of the  park. The two sides again called each other names and swung with fists,  prompting police to rush back in again.  </P> <P> The fundamentalists, at that point, left the park on their own, regrouping  across Edinger Avenue in a residential neighborhood, witnesses said.  </P> <P> The police -- now numbering about 50 and wearing riot helmets and rubber gloves  -- formed a line along the Edinger Avenue side of the park and began moving in  with clubs, forcing a crowd that had grown to about 500 people back toward the  gay festival entrance in the middle of the park, witnesses said. Police made  four more arrests.  </P> <P> Many of the bystanders ran back inside the festival, some crying. With emotions  running high on the festival grounds and some gays shouting at police "You're  taking away our civil rights," Janet Avery, president of Orange County Cultural  Pride, took the stage and pleaded for calm.  </P> <P> "We came here to celebrate," Avery said, quieting the crowd. "If you have a  friend who is not here to celebrate, please get them in the mood. This is our  day in the sun."  </P> <P> Robert F. Gentry, mayor of Laguna Beach and one of Orange County's most visible  gay politicians, said the clash resulted when "emotions boiled over" on the  part of gays tired of what he called constant verbal harassment. The festival,  Gentry said, marked the "first celebration in Orange County that validates" the  existence of the gay community.  </P> <P> Members of gay and fundamentalist groups alike expressed concern that Santa Ana  police did not intervene quickly enough to prevent the clash and that police  overreacted.  </P> <P> "We took action as soon as it was appropriate for us to take action," Helton  said.  </P> <P> "I think we responded to a potentially very violent situation. We were not  overly aggressive. We were quite the contrary. We acted swiftly."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Jim Carlton and Times photographer Gail Fisher contributed  to this report.  </P></p>

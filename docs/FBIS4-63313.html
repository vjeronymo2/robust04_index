This document was initialled in Brussels on Friday [20  May]. The ITAR-TASS correspondent learned in the Kazakhstan  embassy that the agreement will be signed by President Nursultan  Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan and the European Commission chairman in  the coming months.    The agreement represents a political document encompassing  diverse forms of cooperation. It lays the basis for development  of relations between Kazakhstan and the European Union and is  designed to promote the expansion of bilateral cooperation  between this Central Asian republic and each of the 12 countries  of the European Union. This is essentially the first agreement  between independent Kazakhstan and such a major international  association as the European Union.    Two more joint documents are now being drawn up to regulate  relations between the sides in individual spheres of  cooperation, and in particular, in issues relating to power  engineering and nuclear materials.</p>

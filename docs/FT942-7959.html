			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Company News (This Week): Green watchers predict a solid profit of Pounds 65m - Carlton Communications Wednesday will be a busy day for Mr Michael Green, chairman and chief executive of Carlton Communications, the broadcasting and television services group. At 10am, Carlton will hear whether its little flutter on the National Lottery - it has a stake in one of the eight bidders, The Great British Lottery Company - has hit the jackpot, or not. But even if Carlton's lottery ticket is not a winner, it will have some decent results to announce for the half-year to March. Most Carlton watchers are plumping for pre-tax results in the region of Pounds 65m-Pounds 70m, compared with Pounds 55m last time. If, as seems likely, the analysts are in the correct range it would indicate a solid performance for Carlton, providing evidence that the climate for advertising is improving and that Carlton's main businesses around the world are pulling out of recession. The results will, however, contain only around two months of contributions from Central independent television, the second largest ITV company, which Carlton acquired for about Pounds 750m at the turn of the year. The main financial benefit from the government's generous decision to allow the two largest ITV companies to merge will not be seen until the full year. The period of consolidation following the Central deal is not over. It is considered unlikely that Carlton will unveil anything spectacular on Wednesday. Instead the emphasis will be on steady, solid progress. Further competition for Carlton in its main UK television markets now seems likely. However, the government is likely next month to give the go-ahead for a new Channel 5 despite the efforts of the ITV companies to head off a potential rival by arguing for the merits of digital television.</p>

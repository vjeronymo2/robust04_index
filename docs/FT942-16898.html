			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of International Hotels (3): 'Come back and see us' - Repeat business has become a high priority As competition has intensified in the hotel market, so also have the hoteliers' efforts to retain their existing customers. Loyalty programmes have become an integral part of the international hotel industry's operations. More attention to service, room rate discounts, special packages and subsidised restaurants have always been a part of the industry to a greater or lesser extent. But the ferocity of the recession has focused attention on what may have once been considered marginal extras, and many chains have now attempted to quantify these into a package designed to retain customer loyalty. The basic tenet of all the programmes is that the more frequent the stay, the higher the reward for the customer. Airline flights, car hire, restaurant meals, and sporting facilities were the main benefits originally offered to encourage repeat business. All of these items are now included in the large number of loyalty packages employed by the luxury hotel chains. And in the drive to make the programmes more 'personalised', intrinsic services such as newspapers delivered to rooms, room upgrades, cheque cashing, express reservations and check-in have become prerequisites. Marriott, the big US international hotelier, was a pioneer of loyalty programmes. Its Honored Guest Award scheme - begun in 1983, now with 5m members worldwide - is typical of the genre. Members earn points during each Marriott stay which can be exchanged for travel awards. And in line with recent developments, the hotel has joined with a variety of associated organisations to make the programme more attractive: British Airways, Continental, Delta, Northwest, TWA and USAir are some airlines included. Car rental, cruise ships and associated hotel groups are also involved. It is a similar story at Holiday Inn Worldwide: its Priority Club has a membership of 4m. Mr Ken Pierce, vice-president for Worldwide Frequency Marketing at the company, says that one positive benefit has been the huge amount of information and feedback from their most frequent customers. 'The customers now have a reason for telling us exactly what they want, simply because they now have an incentive for returning.' 'Loyalty programmes work for the very frequent traveller, and for the hotels there is evidence that they do build some degree of loyalty,' says Mr Rik Danielson, managing director, sales and marketing, at Forte. 'But there is no evidence of them stealing market share.' Mr Pierce agrees. 'Marriott's launch in the US did initially give it an advantage, but now everyone's doing it and the advantage has slipped away.' He adds: 'Whether it's a zero sum game is a subject of hot debate in the industry. You can reach a level of parity, but the programmes give an organisation the chance to maximise its strengths. 'In the case of companies such as Holiday Inns, we capitalise on being in a large number of locations, against a smaller or regional operator. And there are other situations where our huge distribution ability gives us the advantage.' Mr Danielson worries that too much time and effort might be put into loyalty programmes at the expense of other services. 'The industry battlefield is loyalty programmes, there's no doubt about that. But the question we must keep asking is: are we spending too much on these at the expense of basic services? Another flaw with these programmes is that they are designed only to keep customers, not to entice new ones.' Despite these misgivings, most industry executives agree that loyalty programmes are here to stay. Mr Pierce believes the future will see competition between programmes intensifying. 'The programmes are likely to become more focused as databases grow in detail. This will lead to a shift in advertising as less expenditure is put into broad advertising coverage and more into individualised schemes.' He also believes that partnerships between hotels and other organisations, to attract and retain customers, will grow and incorporate a whole new range of retail groups. Mr Danielson foresees fewer customers at the top level, but a sector of customers who are more selective. 'What makes today's customers different is that they really expect to receive value for money,' he says.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKET DATA* 1992  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Africa &amp;     Asia                        All      the             North            Latin                              Middle      and                     Hotels     East Austral-  America   Europe America                                         asia                          %        %        %        %        %       %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Domestic              47.0     18.2     33.6     85.3     47.4    53.5 Foreign               53.9     81.8     67.4     14.7     52.6    46.5 TOTAL                100.0    100.0    100.0    100.0    100.0   100.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Repeat Business %     36.7     32.7     32.9     41.0     35.5    47.1 Composition of Market Government Officials   3.9     11.3      4.6      6.5      1.8     4.9 Business Travellers   33.6     38.6     30.7     28.5     37.4    32.6 Tourists (individual) 24.6      9.4     27.4     26.1     22.9    24.8 Tour Groups           17.4     13.6     20.1      7.8     16.6    23.4 Conference   participants        11.3      7.8      7.5     22.9     12.1     8.2 Other                  9.2     19.3      9.7      8.2      9.2     6.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL                100.0    100.0    100.0    100.0    100.0   100.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Arithmetic mean  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Howarth International  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

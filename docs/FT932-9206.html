			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Intel files patent infringement suit INTEL has filed a complaint with the US International Trade Commission against a Taiwanese personal computer manufacturer in a move to try to block imports of computers that contain 'clones' of its microprocessor chips. The action is the latest in a Intel's campaign of litigation against Advanced Micro Devices and Cyrix, two US chip companies that produce their own versions of Intel's top-selling chips. The ITC complaint alleges that Twinhead, a Taiwanese maker of notebook computers, is selling products in the US that infringe an Intel patent. Intel has related patent infringement cases pending in US courts against both AMD and Cyrix. The trade action against a competitors' customer follows a decision in the Cyrix patent case, in which the court refused to grant Cyrix an injunction preventing Intel from filing a suit against Cyrix customers. AMD said it believed its customers were protected from infringing Intel patents by a cross-licensing agreement between the two companies. That agreement is, however, the subject of separate litigation.</p>

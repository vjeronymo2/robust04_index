			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: ABN Amro takes stake in Spanish stockbroker ABN Amro, the largest bank in the Netherlands, has deepened its involvement in Spain's capital markets by taking a 90 per cent direct stake in the Madrid-based stockbroking firm Capital Markets Equities (CME). The Spanish firm, which will be renamed ABN Amro SVB, is to expand the scope of its activities to include investment funds, portfolio management, futures and options, new issues and corporate finance services. Separately, Spanish authorities have given permission for the firm to trade on the country's capital markets on its own account, as well as for clients. The Dutch bank's investment was made by raising its existing stake in CME's parent company, C. M. Capital Markets Holding, to 49 per cent from 20 per cent. This move, plus an equity injection, cost 'several tens of millions of guilders,' ABN Amro said, without giving details. The Spanish firm will continue to be run by local management. ABN Amro, which is steadily building up a network of local investment banking operations in Europe and the Far East, signed a letter of intent in February to buy the European activities of Hoare Govett, the London-based stockbroking arm of Security Pacific of the US. ABN Amro said it expected the deal to be finalised in the second quarter of 1992.</p>

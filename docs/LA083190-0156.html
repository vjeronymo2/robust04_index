			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> NO CANCER SURGE AT 3 MILE ISLAND  </P> <P> There is no evidence that radiation emissions during the 1979 nuclear accident  at Three Mile Island affected the health of area residents, an independent  study released today concludes.  </P> <P> The study by Columbia University scientists said there was no sign that the  radiation caused leukemia or childhood cancer among people living within 10  miles of the plant.  </P> <P> Those illnesses are more sensitive to low-level radiation than other diseases  and are the first to appear after exposure, the scientists said in a briefing  several miles from the nuclear plant near Harrisburg.  </P> <P> The findings were published today in the American Journal of Epidemiology. They  match the conclusions of a 1985 report, released by the state Health  Department, that found no evidence of increased cancer in a 20-mile radius.  </P> <P> In the latest study, Columbia epidemiologists Mervyn Susser and Maureen Hatch  studied the health records of 160,000 residents of 69 areas within the 10-mile  radius. They also compared cancer rates between 1975 and 1985.  </P></p>

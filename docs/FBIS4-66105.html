			<p>BFN     [Text] Mainz -- Rudolf Scharping, chairman of the Social  Democratic Party [SPD] and minister-president of  Rhineland-Palatinate, does not expect his criticism of Monday's  [23 May] presidential election to do his party any harm. He did  not advocate a direct transition to electing the head of state  by popular vote, Scharping told journalists in Mainz on  Wednesday. The implications that such a regulation would have  for the constitution must be carefully examined, he said.    He said he considers the decision made in Berlin to be  legitimate; but he wanted to point out that the decision was  based on 1990 election results. Over 800 delegates to the  Federal Assembly came from parliaments that were elected four  years ago. The SPD chairman wants to see his fierce criticism of  the Free Democratic Party [FDP] put in perspective. The comment  that the FDP is superfluous as a political force of its own only  referred to the presidential election. At the same time  Scharping exempted the Rhineland-Palatinate FDP, and thus the  SPD's coalition partner, from this criticism, saying that they  have proved to be an independent liberal force in the government  alliance.</p>

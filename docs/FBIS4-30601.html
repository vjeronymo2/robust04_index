			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 28 KYODO -- The ruling coalition is  likely to accept an overture from the Social Democratic Party  (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ] and stage a  meeting between Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and SDP Chairman  Tomiichi Murayama to discuss forming a new government, political  sources said Tuesday.    Murayama and Masayoshi Takemura, New Party Sakigake head and  a former chief cabinet secretary, agreed Monday that the next  government should be a "dove," or soft-line government, based on  an agreed policy outline.    Takemura, who is critical of what he views as high-handed  leadership by Shinseito and Komeito within the coalition, made  it clear that his party has no plans to reconcile with the group  and urged Murayama to head the new government.    In a separate meeting, Yohei Kono, president of the main  opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), proposed a trilateral  meeting with Murayama and Takemura for a breakthrough pact.    Takemura said Sakigake wants to serve as bridge between the  LDP and the SDP in forming an alliance between the one-time  archrivals.    Murayama and Kono agreed on the need to elect a new premier  Tuesday. The current regular Diet session expires Wednesday.    Murayama and Kono also concurred in jointly taking "heavy  responsibility" for breaking the current political standoff  following the resignation of Hata and his cabinet on Saturday  prior to an impending no-confidence vote against his minority  cabinet tabled by the LDP in the House of Representatives.    Hata is the sixth prime minister in Japan in five years.  None of the parties has a majority in the lower house.    The ruling coalition had earlier said it will wait for the  SDP's initiative for fresh talks on a policy agreement before  any high- stakes meeting between the party heads.    The SDP's policy-making board, on the other hand, endorsed  the joint policy platform with Sakigake and called on the  coalition to make a formal response to its proposal for the  Murayama-Hata talks by 11 AM [0200 GMT] Tuesday.    Within the LDP, a growing number of party members are  tilting  toward a partnership with the SDP, party sources said.    The LDP had been in power since 1955 until last August when  the then coalition of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, which  included the SDP and Sakigake, took power.    But former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe, an LDP faction  leader, is opposed to an alliance with the SDP and called for a  team up with Hata's Shinseito and Komeito, the key parties in  the coalition.    Within the SDP, a left-wing group led by Murayama is said to  be in favor of a tie-up with the LDP.    However, a right-wing group, including Secretary General  Wataru Kubo, the No. 2 leader in the party, is seeking the  return of the SDP to the coalition, party sources said.    The SDP earlier made a decision at a meeting of its  decision-  making central committee in May that it will not form a  coalition with the LDP.    The SDP walked out from the coalition in April in protest  against the formation of a parliamentary group by other  coalition partners, excluding the SDP, shortly after the  election of Hata as prime minister in the Diet. The SDP's  departure forced Hata to launch the first minority government in  39 years.</p>

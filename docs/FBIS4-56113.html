			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] and the  Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] have concluded a  cooperation agreement for the second round of the elections.  Under the Christian-democratic agreement, they are to back the  candidates of the Independent Smallholders' Party [FKGP] in some  places as well. Agnes Pap reports.    [Pap] [passage omitted] MDF Spokesman Karoly Herenyi said  that not only was joining forces between the parties at issue  but also the necessity to make a broader agreement. The leading  bodies of the KDNP and the MDF want the Christian-democratic  pooling of forces to come about among the voters, including  those who voted for the FKGP.    Herenyi said that the MDF's voters would support the FKGP's  candidates in 42 places where they have a chance to win. Under  agreements concluded with the FKGP county chairmen in Somogy and  Tolna counties [southern Hungary], the FKGP candidates are to  support the MDF candidates in five places.

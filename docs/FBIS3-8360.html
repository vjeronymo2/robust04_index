			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Slovakia Supports the U.S. Presence in </F> Europe"]    [Text] Bratislava--The Slovak Government approved at its  most recent session pioneering material drafted by the Defense  Ministry and submitted by Defense Minister Imrich Andrejcak.  This material contains the Slovak Republic Defense Doctrine,  which incorporates a set of official principles and views on the  Slovak Republic's defense, preventing war, the structure of the  Armed Forces, and the means of conducting an armed struggle in  defense of the state. Asserting Slovakia's national interests,  with the aim of guaranteeing its territorial integrity and the  inviolability or unchangeability of its internationally  recognized state borders, is among the fundamental principles of  the Defense Doctrine.    In its Defense Doctrine, the Slovak Republic avows that,  under no circumstances, will it either precipitate an armed  conflict or initiate one against another state. According to  the doctrine, the Slovak Republic will not condone the  propaganda of war and armed force, terrorism, chauvinism,  fascism, race and class hatred, or national and religious  intolerance. Slovakia will not give up its right to take part  in establishing collective security and therefore will strive to  join NATO and the Western European Union (WEU).    Apart from the Defense Doctrine, the Slovak Government also  approved other important material drafted by the Defense  Ministry--the Principles for the Slovak Republic's National  Security. This document was drafted in cooperation with the  Interior Ministry and the Foreign Ministry.    The principles establish a political, legal, and  methodological basis for the Republic's national defense system.  At the same time, they represent a systematized series of  general objectives in issues such as the sovereignty of the  state, territorial integrity, and Slovakia's equality, and in  guaranteeing the citizen's basic rights and freedoms. Binding  international documents, the Slovak Constitution, and  recommendations and information from analyses of the security  systems of comparable European states were endorsed in the  drafting of the Principles for the Slovak Republic's National  Security.    Slovakia's security is an element of the broader framework  of  European and global security. The Slovak Republic relies on its  own forces. However, at the same time, it places emphasis on  establishing new international relations. In its objectives, it  is counting, first and foremost, on NATO, the WEU, the CSCE, and  the United Nations. Slovakia considers stable, conflict-free,  and correct relations with its immediate neighbors to be an  important aspect of guaranteeing its national security. It is  interested in activity within the Visegrad Group and the Central  European Initiative.    The Slovak Republic is aware of the need for equilibrium in  its relations with all European states. At the moment, it is  achieving this aim by means of bilateral treaties. It is also  aware of the positive role filled by the U.S. presence in Europe  and is in favor of its preservation.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL PREVIEW;  </P> <P> MASTER PLAN ROUNDING INTO SHAPE FOR MASTER'S  </P> <P> All the literature that The Master's College puts out on its basketball team  says that Coach Mel Hankinson is in his second year on the job.  </P> <P> We respectfully point out that they stretch the truth.  </P> <P> Hankinson is in his 21st season as a college coach and his third at Master's.  The fact is, the school has chosen not to tarnish his record by giving him  credit for his first one at the helm of the Mustangs.  </P> <P> In 1987, after witnessing all of three games, Hankinson decided that his first  year would be better spent on the recruiting trail, visiting places his lowly  team would not.  </P> <P> "They were nice fellas," Hankinson said of his '87 Mustangs, "but Adolph Rupp  could not have helped them."  </P> <P> The school's administration agreed. So, while the team he was hired to coach  struggled to an 11-19 record, Hankinson became a frequent flier.  </P> <P> He traveled to Georgia, Tennessee, Florida, Alabama, Oregon and Washington  looking for clean-cut, studious athletes who believed in God and never missed  an open jump shot -- all with the blessing of John MacArthur, The Master's  president.  </P> <P> "Whatever success we enjoy here is the result of the cooperation of everyone at  the school," said Hankinson, whose team opens at home tonight against San Jose  Christian in the first round of the Tip-Off tournament.  </P> <P> By season's end, they may all be celebrating together.  </P> <P> The Master's plan, which envisioned the Mustangs challenging for a National  Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics District 3 championship sometime in the  early 1990s, has been accelerated a bit.  </P> <P> Or, as Hankinson brazenly puts it, "By February, if we stay healthy, anyone who  comes calling on us on a dusty road at high noon had better have all their guns  loaded."  </P> <P> Big talk from a coach whose team was 15-15 last season, 5-9 in District 3  games. But it had best be believed.  </P> <P> Master's top scorers and rebounders from a year ago were both freshman. Tom  Bruner, a 6-foot-6 power forward, averaged 14 points and eight rebounds a game.  Jason Webster, a 6-5 swingman, averaged 12 points and eight rebounds.  </P> <P> "The best way to build a strong program is to build a strong foundation of  freshmen who are solid students, good people and who can play," Hankinson said.  "Then you fill in the cracks, the weak areas, with transfers and junior college  transfers."  </P> <P> The Mustangs' lineup is Hankinson's game plan in action.  </P> <P> At point guard is Larry Lopez, a 5-10 junior transfer from Hesston (Kan.)  Junior College. At shooting guard is Jeff Newton, a 6-4 junior who transferred  from Napa Valley College two years ago. And at center are Dan Jarms, a 6-8  junior transfer from Eastern Washington, and Ted Hahs, a 6-8 sophomore and a  member of the prized recruiting class of '88.  </P> <P> "We have good, young players," Hankinson said. "And we have versatility. We can  put a fast, pressing team out there, or a big, zone team. There are a lot of  ways this group can hurt you."  </P> <P> One weapon will be disarmed as the season opens.  </P> <P> Damon Greer, last seen in these parts helping Cleveland High to two City  championship games, will be eligible Dec. 19 after transferring from San Jose  State.  </P> <P> "He ought to do all right here," Hankinson said, tongue planted firmly in  cheek.  </P> <P> Greer, a sophomore, might be Master's missing link. "We struggled at point  guard last season," Hankinson said. "But Damon moves our game up a whole notch  in tempo. His greatest asset is that he improves everyone else's ability level.  Instead of self glory, he's most interested in team glory."  </P> <P> However, the Mustangs' most glorious days may still be ahead. Don't expect The  Master's to beat out the perennial favorites, Westmont and Biola, in the NAIA  District 3, Hankinson said. At least not yet.  </P> <P> "You don't come in and in two years break up that kind of tradition," Hankinson  said. "We'll be very competitive this year and a top 10 team next year. We're  cautious only because of our youth."  </P></p>

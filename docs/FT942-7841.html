			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Consumer gloom on finances lessens April's tax rises appear to be losing their power to shock, with consumers less pessimistic about their own finances and the nation's economic prospects, a survey from Gallup indicated yesterday. The survey, conducted this month for the European Commission, found a marked decline in the number of people predicting a worsening of their financial situation during the next 12 months compared with April's survey when the assessment of household finances appeared close to historic lows. People were also less worried about the UK's general economic situation. The May results were still negative and pointed to a 'rather bearish view of the economic situation in general', said Gallup. But the findings showed 'a welcome reversal of the very rapid decline in confidence that has been witnessed since the beginning of the year. Confidence may have reached its nadir in April.' Gallup said its poll of 1,991 adults between May 5 and May 17 showed that 17 per cent expected their household finances to improve while 39 per cent predicted a deterioration. The resulting balance of minus 22 was 'a cause for concern' but an improvement on balances of minus 30 per cent in April. The survey found that 27 per cent of people polled thought the economy would improve while 37 per cent took the opposite view. The resulting balance of minus 10 per cent was much smaller than last month's minus 22 per cent balance. Less than half of those surveyed - 45 per cent  - expected unemployment to rise over the next 12 months, although only 19 per cent expected a fall. The resulting balance of 26 per cent expecting higher unemployment was 11 per cent lower than the April outcome. A fifth of those polled expected price rises to accelerate against 19 per cent expecting a slowdown. The small positive balance of 1 per cent expecting higher inflation was the lowest since February last year. Nearly 40 per cent of British businesses polled by Trade Indemnity, the credit insurer, were operating at 75 per cent to 99 per cent of their optimum rate in the first quarter of this year, the company said yesterday. Only 3 per cent were operating at less than 50 per cent of optimum, while 22 per cent were at optimum and 6 per cent said they were 'overstretched'.</p>

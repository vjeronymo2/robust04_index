			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Observer: A tale of two companies What would Sir John Swire, the president of his family's Far Eastern trading house, or Sir Ron Brierley, the corporate predator, make of the Ocean Group today? Both men know the company well. Sir John sat on the board for several years and Sir Ron once made a bid for the company. Ocean used to pride itself on the breadth of its management, picking its chief executive from a band of 'crown princes' groomed for succession. The late Sir John Nicholson was one, as was Sir Lindsay Alexander. However, Ocean is down to its last 'crown prince'. After 30 years with the company, chief executive Nicholas Barber, 53, has handed in his notice and headhunters are trawling for a successor. Warning lights start flashing when a sizeable company cannot find its own chief executive from within. But then Ocean today is a scarcely recognisable descendant of the Liverpool shipping company formed nearly 130 years ago by Alfred Holt with the help of another local merchant, John Swire. There was a time when you could not visit a Far Eastern port without spotting one of Ocean's Blue Funnel liners and Swire's early growth in the Far East owes much to Holt's support. But by the 1960s the two companies, whilst retaining close links, were going their separate ways. Ocean went public and has been struggling to adapt ever since. Its vulnerability was obvious to an outsider like Sir Ron Brierley, who made a Pounds 300m bid in the late 1980s. He lost because City institutions felt Ocean's management should be given more time to transform the business. Meanwhile, Swire has prospered as a very private UK family business, albeit with stakes in two big public companies, Cathay Pacific and Swire Pacific. Its success in the Far East proves that the decline of an old family business need not be inevitable. The next chief executive of Ocean, on the other hand, may have a tough task proving to the institutions that Ocean still deserves their support if another Ron Brierley turns up on its share register.</p>

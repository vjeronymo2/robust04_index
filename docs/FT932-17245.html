			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Nisshin Steel warns of loss after zaiteku setback NISSHIN Steel, a leading Japanese maker of stainless steel, yesterday said it would post net losses for the year to the end of March due to the liquidation of NSK, its financial subsidiary, which has faced mounting losses on its stock portfolio. The company forecast net losses of Y18.5bn (Dollars 152.89m) for the year and a cut in its dividend to Y5 from the previous year's Y7. Nisshin Steel is one of Japan's many industrial groups which indulged in zaiteku, or financial engineering, in the boom days of the late 1980s. It set up NSK in 1987 to invest in the stock market and to extend loans. At its peak, in 1990, NSK managed Y190bn in tokkin, or trust funds. However, the fall in Japanese shares hit NSK, and the parent company decided to dismantle it after attempts at a restructuring last year and cutting interest on loans failed. Nisshin will record a special loss of Y28bn on the liquidation. The decision comes as the company faces a fall in sales and profits due to depressed demand for its steel products from the motor, electronics and construction industries. Pre-tax profits and sales forecasts for the year were unchanged at a 62.4 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y11bn and a 7.3 per cent decline in sales to Y400bn.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Tories press Clarke for rate cut Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, faces mounting pressure from Conservative backbench MPs to order another cut in interest rates to speed economic recovery. Senior figures on the Tory right, led by Mr Kenneth Baker, the former home secretary, are urging Mr Clarke to overrule the Bank of England and order a cut of at least 1 percentage point in base rates from their present level of 5.25 per cent. Many Tories on the centre and left of the party are also beginning to warn that unless there is at least a small further cut, the government faces a rout in the local elections in May and the European elections in June. That view is being echoed privately by a number of government ministers who believe that the chancellor was wrong to allow the Bank to limit the cut in rates earlier this month to only 0.25 of a percentage point. Mr Clarke himself is said to have been frustrated by the Bank's caution. Some of his colleagues believe it will temper his enthusiasm for allowing it a more significant role in monetary policy. The chancellor is also boxed in by his public commitment to aim for a steady sustainable recovery with inflation staying low rather than for a rapid burst of economic growth, risking renewed acceleration in price rises. That broad objective is widely shared across the party at Westminster. It is also clear that Mr Baker's view - that interest rates could comfortably be reduced to 4 per cent - is confined largely to the right of the party. But with the underlying inflation rate still subdued there is a growing consensus that Mr Clarke should move swiftly to reduce rates to 5 per cent and pencil a further reduction to 4.5 per cent in April to coincide with planned tax increases. Some ministers share the view on the back benches that the Treasury has underestimated the damaging impact on confidence of the tax increases, which will add more than Pounds 12 a week to the income tax bill of the average household. In spite of the recent rise in the rate of annual retail prices to 2.5 per cent, many Con-servative MPs appear convinced that the Bank is continuing to exaggerate the inflationary pressures in the economy. But in any event there is an emerging consensus that the risk of an upsurge in inflation is far outweighed by the potential threat to the government - and to Mr John Major's position as prime minister - of heavy defeats in the local and European elections.</p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Management: How to make friends with Lady Luck - Chance plays only a small role on the road to success When asked the secret of success in their companies, managers often say that luck is as important as anything. It is not just an excuse offered by those passed by in the promotion stakes. Even those in executive suites often concede to having been in the right place at the right time. The problem with the concept of luck as an explanation for success is that it is too vague to be of practical use. Luck becomes a catch-all for everything we do not understand about the managerial advancement process. When pushed to explain how luck has impinged on their careers, successful executives point to two factors: recognising it and acting on it. Luck is seen as something that happens to all of us from time to time, but the people who move on are those who can spot the openings and exploit them. This assumes that managers can only influence luck from the time it manifests itself. But can't you make preparations in advance to grasp it? Whether consciously or not, successful managers have ways of thinking and behaving which leave them prone to the intervention of luck. Managers can increase their exposure to luck in a variety of ways. In practical terms, they can establish networks which will help to keep them informed of career threats and opportunities; and by reading the trade press, and visiting customers and suppliers, they can keep abreast of what is going on in and around the industry. Those who consistently seem to benefit from luck, are also able to 'read the game'. They can imagine how a change of circumstances might represent an opportunity. They are good at envisaging future scenarios and are alert to making the most out of a crisis. They also combine directness with flexibility. They show a readiness to improvise, to cut their losses if necessary. There is a random element in all human success. But many of the career breaks ascribed to luck are obliquely attributable to the efforts of the individual. The random shape and timing of the windfall need not mean that it was unplanned. One is reminded of Gary Player's golfing aphorism: 'The more I practise the luckier I get'. The reason we fail to see this is that we do not take the trouble to retrace or reflect upon the circumstances which generated the piece of luck. It is a cliche that 'you make your own luck', but what about engineering your own misfortune? Luck goes unrecorded and undiagnosed, and we fail to learn from it or about it. Retrospective accounts of managerial success are presented as the culmination of a deliberate decision-making process. Certain events are cast in leading parts while the role of luck is edited out. Yet an awareness of luck can inform managerial thinking. Luck represents a force in favour of alertness, imagination, opportunism and action - and these are as vital to the success of individual managers as they are to the success of their companies. Unless we acknowledge the part played by luck, we will never understand it any better and we will have to continue to rely on our intuition and experience to predict when and where it may arise. Luck visits those who court it. The author is a research associate at Templeton College, Oxford.</p>

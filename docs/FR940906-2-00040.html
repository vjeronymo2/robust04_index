In determining whether a proposed activity is closely related to banking for purposes of the BHC Act, the Board considers,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> inter <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> alia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the matters set forth in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Courier Association <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 516 F.2d 1229 (D.C. Cir. 1975). These considerations are (1) whether banks generally have in fact provided the proposed services, (2) whether banks generally provide services that are operationally or functionally so similar to the proposed services as to equip them particularly well to provide the proposed services, and (3) whether banks generally provide services that are so integrally related to the proposed services as to require their provision in a specialized form.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  516 F.2d at 1237. In addition, the Board may consider any other basis that may demonstrate that the activity has a reasonable or close relationship to banking or managing or controlling banks.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Board Statement Regarding Regulation Y <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 49  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  806 (1984).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants maintain that the Board has previously determined that the majority of the proposed activities are closely related to banking within the meaning of the BHC Act. Specifically, Applicants maintain that the proposed ATM services; POS services; gateway services; terminal driving services; card production and issuance services; home banking and bill payment services; group purchasing activities; EBT services; POB services; electronic data capture and interchange services; scrip services; terminal ownership; and terminal sale, rental, and maintenance services are data processing and transmission activities that the Board has determined by regulation to be closely related to banking.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  12 CFR 225.25(b)(7).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See also Banc One Corporation, et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 79 Federal Reserve Bulletin 1158 (1993)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (Banc One) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> BayBanks, Inc., et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 79 Federal Reserve Bulletin 547 (1993);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Banc One Corporation, et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 79 Federal Reserve Bulletin 156-57 (1993);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> BankAmerica Corporation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 78 Federal Reserve Bulletin 299 (1992). Applicants further maintain that the Board also has previously determined by regulation that the issuance and sale of travelers checks, and the proposed check verification services, are closely related to banking.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  12 CFR 225.25(b)(12) and (b)(22). In addition, Applicants maintain that the Board has previously determined by order that the proposed stored value card services are closely related to banking within the meaning of the BHC Act.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Banc One, supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Applicants propose to conduct the foregoing activities in accordance with the limitations set forth in Regulation Y and the Board's prior orders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants also maintain that dispensing stamps and full statement printing are activities closely related to banking because banks conduct these activities. In this regard, Applicants state that national banks may operate postal substations pursuant to rulings issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  12 CFR 7.7482. Applicants further state that banks are required to deliver periodic account statements to customers under regulations issued by the Board.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  12 CFR 205.9 and 230.6. In addition, Applicants maintain that the proposed farecard activities are closely related to banking because farecards are a form of stored value card and serve as a medium of exchange. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Proper Incident to Banking Standard <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to approve the proposal, the Board also must determine that the proposed activities to be conducted by Company ``can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency, that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' 12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants believe that the proposal will produce public benefits that outweigh any potential adverse effects. In particular, Applicants maintain that the proposal will enhance customer convenience and efficiency. In addition, Applicants state that the proposed activities will not result in adverse effects such as an undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices. In publishing the proposal for comment, the Board does not take a position on issues raised by the proposal. Notice of the proposal is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the application, and does not represent a determination by the Board that the proposal meets or is likely to meet the standards of the BHC Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W.

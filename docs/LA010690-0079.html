			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FDA OKS USE OF BOTULISM TOXIN FOR TREATMENT OF EYE DISORDERS  </P> <P> The government on Friday approved a type of food poisoning bacteria for use as  a treatment for crossed eyes and another eye disorder that renders its victims  legally blind.  </P> <P> The Food and Drug Administration said a sterile, purified botulism toxin was  approved as an injection therapy to treat strabismus, or cross-eye, and  blepharospasm, a muscle disorder that makes the eyes close involuntarily.  </P> <P> "This is seen as the first successful treatment for both conditions," said Eva  Kemper, an FDA spokeswoman.  </P> <P> When eaten in improperly handled food, the toxin can cause botulism, or food  poisoning, an ailment that can lead to paralysis or death.  </P> <P> "However, in clinical studies, the injected form was used safely in thousands  of men and women to weaken muscles that pulled an eye in or out, or to reduce  spasms in muscles that pull the eyelid closed," the agency said in a written  statement.  </P> <P> "With the blepharospasm, patients are legally blind because they can't hold  their eyelids open," Kemper said.  </P> <P> Strabismus can be the commonly known cross-eye, in which the eyes look inward  at each other, or wall-eye, in which they look out.  </P> <P> Doctors would inject the drug, botulinum toxin type A, into muscles near the  eye, not the eye itself, to aid in "turning off" the muscle, the FDA said. The  injection would take effect in a day or two and would last for about three  months.  </P> <P> FDA approval requires product labeling that indicates it is not recommended for  use for children under age 12 and an advisory to physicians that sedentary  patients treated with the drug resume activity slowly.  </P> <P> "At least two patients who had been incapacitated and sedentary because of  their previous condition apparently over-exerted too quickly and died of  cardiac collapse," the agency said.  </P> <P> "The most common side effects are that some patients' eyelids may droop or  their eyes may feel irritated," it said.  </P> <P> The product, which will be sold as Oculinum, is expected to be available in  about 30 days.  </P></p>

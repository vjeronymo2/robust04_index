			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Bank issues low-charge credit card MBNA, the US bank which recently set up its UK headquarters in Chester, has launched a credit card which undercuts most of its rivals by at least 4 percentage points. The bank is offering an introductory annualised percentage rate of just 13.9 per cent to those transferring the balance from their existing card to its UK Scenic series Visa cards. The rate is fixed until July 31 next year. The interest rate on new purchases is 17.9 APR and the bank guarantees not to apply the Pounds 10 annual fee to new cardholders in the first two years. APRs on credit cards from established issuers are significantly higher, although some issuers are reviewing their rates in the wake of last week's base rate cut. Barclaycard, the UK's largest issuer with 8.8m cards, lowered its APR by 1 percentage point last week, down to 21.9, and National Westminster bank, the second-largest issuer, also cut its rate from 23.9 to 22.4. The UK credit card market has become increasing competitive. Last month Vauxhall, the subsidiary of General Motors, became the first UK carmaker to enter the credit-card market, launching a British version of the GM card available in the US. The card, issued in association with HFC bank, offered customers a discount of up to Pounds 2,500 towards the cost of a new Vauxhall car and carried an interest rate of 19.9 APR and no annual fee. Save &amp; Prosper, the financial services group, made an aggressive bid to double its small credit-card customer base of 100,000 cards by launching a new Visa card in September carrying an APR of 14.6 per cent. MBNA, which is based in Newark, Delaware, is the second-largest US lender on credit cards after Citibank. Barclaycard said yesterday that MBNA's arrival was another example of increasing competition in the credit-card market but appeared sceptical that MBNA would be able or willing to maintain a low interest rate. It said: 'We have seen many cases where a card is launched with a low interest rate and no fee to obtain customers but after a while the interest rate creeps up and an annual fee is introduced.' Barclaycard intends to maintain its increased share of the market - from 34 per cent of turnover in 1990 to 37 per cent today - which it attributed to the range of perks and benefits available on a Barclaycard. MBNA has also issued a gold card with the same 17.9 APR on purchases.</p>

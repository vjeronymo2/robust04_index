RCCK Central Committee Chairman Li Peiyao proposed a toast,  and said: Promoting the motherland's peaceful reunification is  a major task of the RCCK. In recent years, the RCCK has been  widely supported for its work in this respect. Within this  century, China will resume its sovereignty over Hong Kong and  Macao, and the Taiwan issue will also be placed more urgently in  front of the people. The RCCK is willing to join hands with  various sectors and jointly contribute toward the great cause in  the reversion of Hong Kong and Macao to the motherland as well  as the peaceful reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan  Strait.    At the party, people from Hong Kong and Macao held cordial  conversations as well as renewed their friendships with leading  comrades of the RCCK Central Committee. In addition, they  exchanged views on many issues. In an enthusiastic atmosphere,  the hosts and guests frequently raised their glasses to toast  for the motherland's prosperity and the people's progress.</p>

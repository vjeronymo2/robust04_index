			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPENDING TIME IS THE WAY TO MODEL A ROLE;  </P> <P> TEACHING: PEOPLE CLOSE AT HAND NUDGE A CHILD TO DO BETTER.  </P> <P> An interviewer asked me the other day to list my childhood role models.  </P> <P> I named my father, but then I got stuck. I finally muttered something about not  really having had role models, leaving the interviewer to conclude that I  imagined myself so special that I didn't see the necessity of having anyone to  look up to.  </P> <P> It wasn't so much that I couldn't think of other people whose skills or  erudition or swagger I dreamed of emulating as it was the embarrassing  triviality of my boyish dreams.  </P> <P> I mean, should I have told him about Uncle Ernest, whose amateur singing and  guitar playing I admired? Or Odell Smith, whose wit made him such a success  with the girls? Or Dolan Falconer, basketball star, raconteur and all-around  rascal, who was the envy of so many of us younger boys?  </P> <P> I might have mentioned C. D. Gardner, the math teacher and bandmaster I worked  so hard to please, or Earl Williams, the only teacher who ever talked to us  about sex. But the more I think about it, the more I am convinced that the very  term "role model" is misleading, evidence of nothing so much as our ability to  forget what mattered to us when we were children.  </P> <P> Our schools hold career days in the forlorn hope that 15 minutes with a  successful lawyer or physician will persuade unambitious youngsters to study.  We keep looking for ways to establish links between the people we admire and  the children who we believe need the inspiration of their success. And we are  forever chiding sports heroes for their nonathletic shortcomings, on the ground  that their ethical and moral lapses will lead our children into similar  behavior. It's as though we believe that a kid who admires Dexter Manley's  ability to harass NFL quarterbacks will also admire the illiteracy Manley  tearfully admitted or the drug abuse that threatened his athletic career.  </P> <P> The interesting thing is that the adults who have such faith in role models  seem to have no memory of their own childhoods. I know men who spent their  adolescence mimicking Stan Musial's batting stance or Willie Mays' "basket"  catches. They never wanted to be like Musial or Mays, in part because they knew  nothing of these heroes except for their athletic ability. But they earnestly  believe that hauling Sugar Ray Leonard or Doug Williams in front of an  elementary school class will make a difference in the lives of children.  </P> <P> Talk to them, though, and you get a different picture. Ask them about their  childhood role models. They'll nearly always name a parent or other adult who  spent time with them and paid attention to them and nudged them toward better  behavior. What these fondly remembered adults did for a living, or how much  they made at it, is largely irrelevant.  </P> <P> I don't mean to suggest that children shouldn't have heroes, or that they  cannot benefit from exposure to people who have achieved professional success.  What I am suggesting is that the benefit consists largely of how-to lessons:  how to resist negative peer pressure, how to achieve in the face of economic  difficulty, how to find adults who can help them to fulfill their career  dreams. "Mentoring," as we now call it, can be invaluable. But it has little to  do with "role modeling," as the term is commonly used.  </P> <P> In fact, confusion of the two notions may even be detrimental to real role  modeling. To the extent that we insist that the role models we foist on our  children be economically successful -- particularly the despairing children of  the inner cities -- we undervalue the men and women in the neighborhood whose  attitudes and behavior are so deserving of emulation.  </P> <P> Of course we should introduce children to successful adults, especially those  who grew up in circumstances similar to those in which the children now find  themselves. They need to understand that poverty or race needn't be a bar to  achievement.  </P> <P> Role modeling, as we tend to talk about it, is too much involved with money and  professional status: what a person has accomplished. The role modeling that  matters is involved with standards and behavior: what a person is. We'd do our  children a favor if we learned the difference.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- Compromise proposals were  presented on Thursday [3 February] at a meeting of leaders of  the seven coalition parties over a new tax plan proposed by  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to break a deadlock resulting  from opposition by the largest party in the government,  coalition sources said.    The proposals include nullifying the rate of 7 percent set  by  Hosokawa for the tax to be imposed on sales of most goods and  services, they said.    Instead, the Hosokawa administration should set up a  consultative body to enable the coalition partners to debate a  new rate for the tax, the sources said.    The compromise calls for part of the revenues from the new  tax to be put into a special account, instead of the general  account, they said.    The new proposals emerged after the Social Democratic Party  (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] threatened to withdraw its six  ministers from the cabinet unless the coalition upheld the  demand to legislate a provision that would funnel all the  revenue from the new tax to finance welfare policy measures.    Hosokawa had earlier rejected the SDP's demand to insert  into  the new tax legislation wording that would obligate the  government to spend all the revenue form the tax on welfare.    On Wednesday, the SDP responded sharply to Hosokawa's plan  to  replace the current 3 percent consumption tax with the "national  welfare tax."    Prior to the meeting, SDP Secretary General Wataru Kubo and  his Democratic Socialist Party Counterpart Takashi Yonezawa  agreed that it is the best way to nullify the new 7 percent tax,  coalition officials said. Yonezawa conveyed the accord to  Hosokawa by telephone and urged renewed talks on the tax.</p>

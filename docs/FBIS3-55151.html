The trip is  linked to the very difficult issues of guarding CIS state  borders and of the security of internal borders and those with  non-CIS states.    [Begin recording] [Andrey Nikolayev interviewed aboard  plane,  in flight] For two years there have been no serious, substantial  contacts with Azerbaijan, with our colleagues in Azerbaijan, on  the border issue. Much has been lost, but luckily not  everything and an important result of the meeting in Azerbaijan  was the fact that our colleagues in Azerbaijan and the president  of Azerbaijan showed thorough understanding of the problems  outlined by the Russian side -- Azerbaijan's entry into the CIS  and joining the collective security treaty.

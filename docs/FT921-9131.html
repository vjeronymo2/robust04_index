			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Waiting list 'fiddle' seen - Health THE GOVERNMENT has 'fiddled' the figures on reduced hospital waiting lists, Mr Robin Cook, Labour's health spokesman, said yesterday, Ivo Dawnay writes. In a bid to counter government claims that lists have fallen by record numbers, Mr Cook said that the number of patients removed from lists without treatment had increased by 82 per cent. He said that while those getting operations rose by 6.6 per cent in the 18 months to March 1990, in the period up to September the increase was only 0.2 per cent. Mr Stephen Dorrell, junior health minister, said those removed from lists were among 836,000 patients judged by doctors as no longer requiring treatment.</p>

France, he said after his talks with Andrey Kozyrev,  attaches  great importance to bilateral cooperation with Russia. We are  trying to encourage partnership between the Russian Federation,  on the one hand, and Europe and various European institutions,  on the other. France would like Russia to join the Council of  Europe. "We are also pleased with the fact," the French  minister continued, "that the Atlantic Union is ready to give  special status to Russia that would correspondent to its  specific character."    Juppe said that during the talks in Moscow the situation in  former Yugoslavia was discussed. You know that our countries  have been working a lot together on this problem. A few days  ago Russia, the United States, and the European Union states  succeeded in adopting a joint document. One must not slacken  pressure now--it is necessary to continue together to persuade  the parties in the Bosnian conflict to end hostilities.</p>

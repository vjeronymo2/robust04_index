			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Scorsese Honored: Director Martin Scorsese will be the sixth recipient of the  American Cinematheque Award at the Cinematheque's annual "Moving Picture Ball"  on March 22 in Los Angeles -- three days before the Academy Awards. Reached on  location in Florida where he is shooting "Cape Fear," Scorsese said he is  pleased at the honor, "especially since it is for the benefit of the  Cinematheque," a cause he has long supported. Cinematheque chairman Sydney  Pollack said the organization seeks to build a film complex in Hollywood near  Mann's Chinese Theater as part of a redevelopment program. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

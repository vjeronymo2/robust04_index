			<p>BFN     [Text] In Nanning on the morning of 23 June, a  Guangxi-bound central work team headed by Vice Premier Zou  Jiahua, a State Council joint work team headed by Fan Baojun and  Zhang Chunyuan, as well as persons in charge of the central  departments concerned listened to a flood-resistance work report  by the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.    Regional party committee Secretary Zhao Fulin presided over  the report meeting, at which regional people's government  Chairman Cheng Kejie reported on the region's torrential rain,  typhoon, flood, and waterlogging situation over the past few  months, especially the situation since mid-June this year,  saying: This year, Guangxi has been hit frequently by a series  of natural calamities, including such serious natural calamities  as flooding, waterlogging, and so on, and has suffered enormous  losses. For instance, the region's 30 poor counties, several  industrial bases, and two major grain-production bases have been  hit by flooding and waterlogging. By 21 June, 13 out of 14  prefectures and cities and 67 out of 86 counties and  county-level cities in the region had been hit by flooding and  waterlogging, accounting for 77.9 percent of the region's total.  In consequence, some 13.93 million people had suffered from  flooding and waterlogging, accounting for 31 percent of the  region's total. Preliminary statistics show that the region's  flooding and waterlogging calamities have left some 224 people  dead and have caused economic losses worth some 7.274 billion  yuan.    Cheng Kejie noted: Since being hit by flooding and  waterlogging, the region's troops and people have actively  thrown themselves into the flood-resistance and disaster-relief  struggle. The CPC Central Committee, State Council, and Central  Military Commission have shown great concern for the region's  afflicted areas. General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li  Peng have made personal phone calls to the region to ask about  the situation. Vice Premier Zou Jiahua has led a central work  team to inspect the region's afflicted areas. In additiohn, the  principal regional party and and government leaders have led  cadres to the region's flood-resistance forefront, where they  have dealt with a large number of emergencies. The cadres at  all levels, as well as people in the afflicted areas in the  region have been working hard, day and night, waging a tenacious  struggle against the floods and braving all sorts of  difficulties. Some 24,000 locally stationed People's Liberation  Army [PLA] officers and soldiers have taken part in the region's  flood-resistance struggle, with the result that many heroes and  heroic deeds have emerged in the course of dealing with  emergencies and providing disaster relief.    Cheng Kejie noted: Thanks to the week-long flood-resistance  and disaster-relief work, the situation in the afflicted areas  has stabilized and returned to normal.    After listening to the region's flood-resistance work  report,  Vice Premier Zou Jiahua made an important speech in which he  discussed Guangxi's flood-resistance work.    First and foremost, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee,  State Council, and Central Military Commission, Zou Jiahua  extended cordial greetings to the region's party, government,  and military leaders at all levels; the locally stationed PLA  officers and soldiers taking part in the region's  flood-resistance and disaster-relief work; and the broad masses  of people in the afflicted areas. He said: Guangxi has  successfully waged a struggle against flooding and has scored  excellent results in this regard. While carrying on the  flood-resistance struggle in the future, Guangxi should continue  to carry forward the spirit of working hard and fearing no  hardships; strengthen confidence; brace up; enhance solidarity;  and rely on the party, government, people's troops, and broad  masses of the people in tiding over difficulties and building  the urban and rural areas into better places than before the  flood disaster.    Speaking of specific antiflood measures, Zou Jiahua pointed  out: At most, we should strive, first of all, to protect  people's lives and property, rescue people besieged by the  flood, take precautions against future floods, heighten  vigilance, and never slacken our efforts against natural  calamities. As this year's flood season has just begun, Guangxi  probably will witness more floods over the next two months. In  view of this situation, we should make proper arrangements for  people's livelihood; organize people to resume production by  relying on themselves; mobilize people, households, and villages  to help each other, urban areas to help rural areas, and  unaffected areas to help afflicted areas; and carry out  meticulous and down-to-earth work to this end.    Comrade Zou Jiahua stated: The central work teams are formed  by comrades in charge of various central ministries and  commissions. The central organs concerned should make unreserved  efforts to assist and contribute to Guangxi's flood-resistance  and disaster-relief work. He urged the relevant central organs  to take the initiative to actively and unreservedly support  Guangxi's flood-resistance struggle by enhancing coordination  among themselves.    Vice Premier Zou Jiahua concluded his speech by saying: I am  fully confident that with the concern of the CPC Central  Committee and State Council and the assistance of the locally  stationed PLA troops, and under the direct leadership of the  regional party and government leaders, the Guangxi people of all  nationalities will be able to tide over all sorts of  difficulties and bring their flood-resistance struggle to a  successful end.    Comrades in charge of the relevant State Council departments  also delivered speeches at the report meeting.    It has been learned that on the afternoon of 23 June, Vice  Premier Zou Jiahua and his entourage left Nanning on board a  special plane.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: S Africa in search of direction South African shares resumed their search for market moving factors as mixed signals clouded direction in thin trade, according to dealers. Reuter reports from Johannesburg. Lack of real direction from world equities was depressing sentiment, which was also under pressure from political fears in advance of the multi-racial elections from April 26, they said. The overall index finished nine points lower at 4,858, the gold index shed five to 1,912 and the industrial index fell 17 to 5,617. Shares edged higher in early trade as they reacted belatedly to recent gains on Wall Street and a firmer London market. Golds made early gains on the back of commercial rand weakness and ended largely unchanged as bullion fell. Anglos added 50 cents to R196.50, De Beers rose R1.25 to R102.75 and Richemont collected 75 cents to R43.</p>

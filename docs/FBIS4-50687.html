			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Yuan Wenzhong (5913 2429 1813) and Huang </F> Qiusheng (7806 4428 3932)]    [Text] Jinan, 5 Apr (XINHUA) -- With the approval of the  State Council and the Central Military Commission, the 1994  National Work Meeting on the Placement of Demobilized Army  Officers was held in Jinan today. It was put forward at the  meeting that the work of placing demobilized Army officers  should be carried out as a political task and that great efforts  should be made to improve such work under the conditions of the  market economy.    President Jiang Zemin, who is also general secretary of the  CPC Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military  Commission, and State Council Premier Li Peng sent  congratulatory messages (the full texts of which will be  transmitted separately) to the meeting. State Councillor Li  Guixian; Song Defu, head of the Work Group for the Placement of  Demobilized Army Officers and minister of the Ministry of  Personnel; Yu Yongbo, member of the Central Military Commission  and director of the General Political Department; and others  attended and spoke at the meeting.    In his work report, Song Defu said: We achieved new progress  in the work of placing demobilized Army officers in 1993 because  we paid attention to the study of the new situation in this  aspect. A total of 58,000 demobilized Army officers and 25,000  dependents of these officers were properly placed in 1993. This  is an achievement which has played an active role in reducing  the Army, strengthening the building up of the contingent of  cadres, and promoting the modernization drive. In this year,  nearly 50,000 Army (including armed police) cadres will be  placed at work in localities. The State Council and the Central  Military Commission urged governments and military leaders at  all levels to pay great attention to this work. In light of the  overall interest of reform, development, and stability, they  should persist in carrying out the placement work as an  important political task. They should work hard to implement  the current placement policy, which is supposed to be stable and  continuous. Meanwhile, the placement work should gradually be  integrated with the establishment of a socialist market economy  as well as the reform of a personnel system and Army cadre  system. As for this year's placement work, we should continue  to carry out the policy of placing demobilized Army officers in  their home towns or the places where they were originally  conscripted. In addition, we can place needed personnel in the  state's key construction projects and new industries. We should  focus on the placement of demobilized cadres at the division and  regimental levels. It is necessary to try every way to solve  problems concerning placing these cadres and their families.    In his speech, Yu Yongbo said: The congratulatory messages  sent by General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng not  only point out the right way for this year's work of placing  demobilized Army officers but also show that the CPC Central  Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military  Commission pay great attention to Army building and their great  concerns about the work of placing demobilized cadres. He  mentioned three points for carrying out this year's work:  First, it is necessary to conscientiously be subject to and  serve the overall interest of this year's work put forward by  the party and the state and further enhance the sense of  responsibility in carrying out this work. Second, the key to  placing demobilized Army officers lies in carrying out relevant  policies and regulations. Third, it is necessary to do  intensive ideological and political work to encourage  demobilized cadres to make contributions in their new jobs.    Li Guixian spoke at the meeting on how to carry out this  year's work of placing demobilized Army officers. He said: The  work of placing demobilized Army officers is an important matter  which has a great bearing on the state's reform, development,  and stability as well as on Army building. Demobilized Army  officers are the precious property of the party and the state  because they are an importance force in the socialist  modernization drive. He urged party committees and governments  at all levels to unify their thinking, take the overall interest  into consideration, and conscientiously carry out the principle  of serving the cause of military and economic construction. He  said that they should give demobilized Army officers a warm  welcome, properly arrange a job for them, train them earnestly,  and use them reasonably.    Also attending the meeting were leaders of Shandong Province  and the Jinan Military Region, as well as responsible persons of  all provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, cities with  provincial-level decision-making authority, central state  organs, the People's Liberation Army, and the armed police.</p>

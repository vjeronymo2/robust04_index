Marshall was declared the winner by  a panel that included Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Judith Chirlin and Vance  Raye, a legal adviser to Gov. George Deukmejian.  </P> <P> "I feel wonderful. I was pretty confident we were going to win," said Ana Liza  Fulay, 17, who played a defense attorney. "I think I got all the experience I  need to study law."  </P> <P> Fulay and teammates Carlo Brooks, Arisa Mattson and Lola Moon Glaudini also won  individual awards.  </P> <P> Marshall has won the city championship the last two years and came in second in  the state competition last year.

			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> NEIGHBORS LEAD 3 LANCASTER BOYS TO SAFETY FROM BURNING APARTMENT  </P> <P> Neighbors led three young Lancaster boys to safety this morning after a candle  being used for light because electricity had been turned off touched off a  blaze in their apartment, the Los Angeles County Fire Department said.  </P> <P> The fire broke out at 12:15 a.m. in the two-bedroom apartment in the 45400  block of Cedar Avenue, Capt. Rory Rehbeck said.  </P> <P> Authorities said Donna Jean Halstead, 34, had lit a candle in her bedroom  because the electrical power had been turned off, apparently for non-payment of  a bill. Later, while she was outside talking with neighbors, the candle  apparently fell over or burned down and ignited a fire, Rehbeck said.  </P> <P> Halstead's three sons, James, 11, Josiah, 7, and Phillip Aaron, 5, were  sleeping in the second bedroom. When Halstead noticed flames coming from her  bedroom, she screamed for help. Authorities said neighbors Chris Willis and  Wesley White ran inside, grabbed the children out of bed and led them out of  the apartment, which was filling with smoke.  </P> <P> There were no injuries, and firefighters extinguished the blaze in 10 minutes.  Damages were estimated at $20,000.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA cautions users to carefully evaluate the performance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a method when using it for samples other than compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring samples or for contaminants not regulated under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SDWA. For example, EDB and DBCP appear in the scope of EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Methods 504.1, 502.2, 524.2 and 551. However, Methods 502.2 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 524.2 are not approved for compliance analyses, because they do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not have the sensitivity to measure compliance with the EDB and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DBCP MCLs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Methods Approval Process_Several commenters believe that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the process of proposing and approving methods or method  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modifications will always be too slow to accommodate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technical and certification needs of the laboratory community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To solve this problem, commenters asked EPA to specify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance criteria in drinking water rules, or in the approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods. The purpose of this would be to allow laboratories to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use any analytical method, provided it met the mandatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria. EPA agrees that the present methods approval system is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> slow. To solve this problem, EPA and other organizations are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seeking to consolidate methods across regulatory programs and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> media, and to write generic method performance criteria (EPA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994g). A performance-based method system, as suggested by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters, might be part of the final solution. There are two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> groups working on this problem. The groups are the Intergovernmental Task Force on Monitoring, and EPA's Environmental Monitoring Management Council. A recommendation of these groups may be for EPA to propose a new method approval and method-writing protocol. The protocol would be designed to expedite approval of drinking water method modifications while maintaining the degree of control needed to ensure effective enforcement of drinking water regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Field and Test Kits_Two commenters noted an omission in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule text in the 1993 proposal that appears to eliminate an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important option. This option allows States to approve use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DPD colorimetric test kits for measurement of chlorine residuals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA did not intend to eliminate this option, and agrees the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wording in the 1993 proposal (58 FR 65631) may be misleading.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's rule clearly allows use of the DPD kits, provided the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State also approves use of the kits. This option is specified at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR 141.74(a)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter asked EPA to approve field kits for pH, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods for continuous monitoring of pH and residual chlorine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA does not need to approve field methods for pH because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently, analysis with an approved pH method may be conducted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the field or in the laboratory. Regarding continuous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring methods, in today's rule, EPA provides criteria for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuous monitoring of chlorine residuals (40 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 141.74(a)(2)). Since EPA does not require continuous pH  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring, EPA does not approve or disapprove methods for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuous measurement of pH.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Turbidity_A commenter asked that turbidity measurements,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which are specified in the drinking water regulations, be waived  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if no particulate or cloudiness is visible to the analyst. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present requirement is that turbidity be measured in all samples,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that digestion be performed if the turbidity is one NTU or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater. EPA cannot waive turbidity measurements on samples that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appear to be clear, because samples with turbidity of up to three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NTU can appear clear to the unaided eye.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corrosivity_One commenter noted the proposed rule made no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference to updating the methods for corrosivity in 40 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 141.42(c). These methods were published in 1980 and 1982 (45 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 57346, August 27, 1980 and 47 FR 10999, March 12, 1982). In the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lead and Copper Rule (56 FR 26460, June 7, 1991), EPA agreed that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrosion control strategies could be developed or evaluated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measuring alkalinity and other parameters (56 FR 26489 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 26496). However, the Lead and Copper Rule did not update or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specify use of the methods in 40 CFR 141.42(c). Instead, more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current methods were specified in 40 CFR 141.89(a) (56 FR 26509&hyph;26510). In today's rule, EPA eliminates possible confusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the requirements in 40 CFR 141.89 and 141.42 by removing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subparagraphs 40 CFR 141.42(a)&hyph;(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

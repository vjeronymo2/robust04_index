			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Brazzaville, 15 Feb (AFP) -- The deployment of  the intervention force set up to monitor the cease-fire in the  southern districts of Brazzaville is facing "logistic and  financial difficulties," military sources said here today. The  force was initially scheduled to have been deployed in the  southern districts yesterday, but the exercise was postponed for  24 hours "on technical grounds."    The High Command of the Congolese Armed Forces and the  command of the intervention force met again today to examine  "the logistic and financial difficulties" which are hindering  the deployment of the 400-man-strong force. By late this  afternoon, no new date had been announced for the operation.    According to a reliable source, differences surfaced over  the  selection and distribution of members of the force, which should  include 200 pro-opposition and 200 pro-Lissouba men. This  report was, however, not confirmed by military sources.  [passage omitted]</p>

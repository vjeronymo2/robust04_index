			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> IRISH WOMAN PRESIDENT SWORN IN  </P> <P> The nation's first female president, Mary Robinson, was inaugurated today at  Dublin Castle, and she extended a hand of friendship to both Protestants and  Catholics in strife-ridden Northern Ireland.  </P> <P> "I will seek to encourage mutual understanding and tolerance between all the  different communities sharing this island," Robinson said in her acceptance  speech, delivered in English and Gaelic.  </P> <P> A 21-gun salute echoed across the Irish capital as Robinson was sworn in by  Chief Justice Thomas Finlay at the medieval, turreted castle after an  interdenominational service. About 500 church and state dignitaries and  Dublin-based foreign diplomats attended.  </P> <P> The president, a 46-year-old feminist lawyer, campaigned for the largely  ceremonial post on a liberal platform of change and a more involved presidency.  She won the Nov. 9 election with 52.8% of the vote.  </P></p>

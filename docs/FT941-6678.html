			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Move on disabled at work dropped The government has backed down on controversial plans to make employers contribute up to 50 per cent of the cost of special measures for disabled employees. The proposal, by Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, has been deferred for one year following representations from bodies including the Royal National Institute for the Blind. Such charities had warned that the measures would discourage the employment of disabled people. The revised scheme, called Access to Work, was formally launched yesterday by Mr Hunt. It will fund such measures as adaptations to premises, fares to work and the reader service for blind people. The announcement coincided with the publication of a study by the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux which said that tougher measures were needed to protect the growing numbers of people who face discrimination at work and when looking for jobs. The bureaux said inadequate legislation, coupled with diminishing job security and a steady stripping away of workers' rights, had given employers increased freedom to act on prejudice making it harder for groups including disabled people and ethnic minorities to get work. The new help for disabled people, announced by Mr Hunt, includes communication support for deaf people and adaptation of vehicles to get individuals to work. A cap of Pounds 21,000 has been put on the amount of help any individual can be given over five years. Mr Hunt said he was challenging the Employment Service to place more unemployed disabled people into work this year than last. His original plan had been for employers to make a 50 per cent contribution towards assistance for disabled employ-ees who had worked for them for six months or more. Ms Ann Clwyd, shadow employment minister, welcomed the government's decision not to introduce what she called a levy on employers.</p>

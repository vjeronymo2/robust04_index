			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Printing industry recovery 'erratic' Most of Britain's printing industry accepts that there is an economic recovery but is disappointed that it has not been stronger, says the latest survey from the British Printing Industries Federation. The majority of companies accept that 'the general state of trade is easier than three months ago', according to the survey. They believe 'conditions will improve or remain at least as favourable during the months to September'. However, the survey found that 'few regard the market as wholly satisfactory, let alone buoyant, and some consider the general situation has deteriorated'. It adds: 'The industry had hoped for more.' The survey points to 'the erratic nature of the recovery'. It is also worried about the rising cost of printing papers and about price increases for board and plastic films used by printers. The survey says that a significant number of larger companies have been forced to cut their prices because of intensive competition while exporters are finding it difficult to hold their position though they are maintaining their markets. Only half the smaller companies and a quarter of larger ones had been able to pass on recent price rises for materials and labour. Only 52 per cent had spare capacity but 30 per cent said their order books were better than normal for the time of year while a further 57 per cent said they were normal. But the survey said that margins had been protected by a higher volume of work and improvements in productivity helped by the job flexibility clauses in this year's national industry agreement. Most companies were confident that they could negotiate flexible working arrangements with employees to offset this year's national basic pay increases of about 3 per cent.</p>

			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / UK Company News: British Assets revamp approved - Trust's relationship with fund manager questioned at EGM Shareholders in British Assets Trust yesterday approved a capital reorganisation following an occasionally acrimonious meeting which raised questions about the trust's relationship with Ivory &amp; Sime, its fund manager. The debate about the restructuring has focused attention on broader questions about the corporate governance of investment trusts and the accountability of their directors to shareholders. The trust's directors are not directly employed by Ivory &amp; Sime, in accordance with corporate governance guidelines issued by the Association of Investment Trust Companies. However, most of the directors also serve on several other Ivory &amp; Sime trusts from which they earn income. British Assets's restructuring is required because poor performance by Ivory &amp; Sime has meant it has not earned sufficient income from investments to cover its annual dividend increases, causing it to eat into reserves. To preserve dividend levels for the majority of its shareholders, the plan requires 16 per cent of shareholders to forgo dividends for seven years. In exchange, they will receive 61.2m additional shares to be issued in seven years' time. These will increase in value if the net asset value of the trust rises over the next seven years. The proposals required approval of 75 per cent of voting shareholders. At an extraordinary meeting in Edinburgh, 78 per cent of the shares - roughly 160m - were voted in favour of the proposal, with 22 per cent - about 45m - against. Mr Roger Inglis, British Assets chairman who will retire next June, said afterwards that he was delighted with the outcome. 'The size of the vote in favour speaks for itself,' he said. However, as it had earlier indicated, Sun Life, the trust's largest institutional shareholder, voted its 11.06 per cent stake against the proposal and insisted that all proxy votes also be counted. Sun Life had argued that the effect of issuing the new shares would be to dilute the net asset value for all shareholders, and that it was not clear that earnings would be sufficient seven years from now to continue to pay inflation-linked dividends as it has promised. Also, some analysts had questioned the Pounds 2.7m cost of the restructuring, which includes a payment of Pounds 610,000 to the big institutional shareholders who have agreed to forgo a portion of their dividends for seven years. It had privately argued that the trust's poor performance in recent years raised questions about whether Ivory &amp; Sime ought to be reappointed as fund manager. In a prepared statement, Sun Life said yesterday: 'It is now up to the directors of British Assets, together with Ivory &amp; Sime, to deliver improved performance.' Sun Life could sell its stake in the market or it could use its muscle as the leading shareholder to force the directors to drop Ivory &amp; Sime if the trust's performance does not show suitable improvement. Two small shareholders at the meeting attacked the mechanism used by the trust to secure the backing of institutions, and charged that the directors of the trust were not sufficiently independent of Ivory &amp; Sime. Mr Martin Harper, a retired merchant banker, called the scheme 'unsatisfactory, unsound, costly and harmful'. It provided only a 'temporary, cosmetic palliative to the problem' of the trust. He had earlier attacked British Assets' promised Pounds 1.3m investment in Ivory &amp; Sime Trustlink, a marketing company for investment trusts. 'Trustlink may well be of benefit to the managers. But it is a basic principle of marketing that you do not push a product until it performs satisfactorily. This large investment cannot be appropriate to the company at this time.'</p>

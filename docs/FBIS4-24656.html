			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ian Robson] </F>   [Text] The People's Bank of China will continue to  intervene in the foreign-exchange markets to support the  renminbi at current levels, a senior Chinese official said  yesterday. "We believe that 8.7 renminbi to one US dollar is a  reasonable rate under present circumstances," Hu Xiaolian,  deputy director of the State Administration of Exchange Control  Policy and Regulation Department, said. "And the People's Bank  will, like central banks in other countries, stabilise the  renminbi at what it believes to be the beneficial rate." Hu  said that although the bank would look to keep the renminbi at  8.7 to the dollar, this was not cast in iron. "The rate is not a  fixed one," she said. "It will have to adjust to the economic  situation in China and, more specifically, the austerity  programme and the need to rein in inflation."    Hu said the conditions were not yet right for foreign banks  to be allowed to undertake renminbi business. She did not put a  timetable on the opening of the sector. Chinese officials are  understood to be reluctant to allow foreign banks to compete  with domestic banks until the main land banking system is put on  a sound footing. China has just launched an ambitious reform  programme aimed at turning its former state-owned banks into  commercial banks.    Hu said the inter-bank foreign-exchange trading network  would  be expanded to 18 cities this year from 12, but there were no  plans at present to expand it further. "Its further development  will depend on demand," she said.</p>

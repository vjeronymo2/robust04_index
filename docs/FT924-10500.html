			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Money Markets: European rates firm CASH rates in European money markets were slightly firmer yesterday after the Bundesbank decided to leave rates unchanged and official figures showed that inflationary pressures in Germany remained high, writes James Blitz. Rates in the sterling money markets also firmed yesterday afternoon as dealers took the view that there would be no cut in UK base rates to accompany the chancellor's Mansion House speech. Money market dealers had come to believe that there would be no cut in German rates earlier in the week, but the final decision still triggered some bearishness. Compounding this was news that the cost of living in western Germany had risen by 0.4 per cent in October from September, and was 3.8 per cent up on the year. The news swamped any bullishness that might have accompanied the Bank of France's decision to cut the rate at which it lends for 5-10 days from 13 per cent to 10.5 per cent. This reversed the move made five weeks ago to defend the franc in the face of huge currency speculation, but yesterday's reversal was seen as mostly technical. In the face of all this, German call money firmed to 9 per cent yesterday morning, although it later fell back to 8.8 per cent. The December Euromark futures contract dropped 18 basis points from its previous close, to finish at 91.55. The December French franc contract rose 20 basis points in the wake of the French rate cut, but later closed unchanged at 90.78. In the sterling cash markets, 3-month money dipped to 7 5/16 per cent in the morning, its lowest level since the last base rate change. The fall was triggered by hopes of another base rate cut. However, the Bank again dealt at the established rates in the early round, and the cost of cash rose sharply in the afternoon. Three-month money closed at around 7 5/8 per cent from a previous close of 7 1/2 per cent, although 1-month money closed at an offered rate of 8 1/2 per cent. The December short sterling contract fell very heavily, closing 20 basis points down on the day at 93.47. However, that closing price still assumes that there will be a 1 1/2 percentage point cut in rates before the year's end.</p>

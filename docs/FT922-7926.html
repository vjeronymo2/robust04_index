			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Insurance directive approved THE WAY was cleared yesterday for European Community composite insurers  - which combine life and non-life insurance operations - to open branches throughout the EC after July 1994. EC ministers agreed the third life assurance directive, although formal approval will have to wait until it has been passed by the European parliament. Earlier EC legislation restricted the rights of composite insurers - mainly British, Italian and Belgian - to establish themselves in other states. Member states such as Spain, Ireland and the Netherlands, which had wanted to maintain restrictions, yesterday dropped their objections. Restrictions on new composite insurers will remain, subject to a later review of the legislation: new composites wanting to open branches in third countries will only be able to sell life and health insurance. Insurance networks will be controlled by supervisory authorities in the companies' home states. However, until the end of 1995 in Spain and Portugal, and the end of 1998 in Greece, those national authorities will continue to exercise local control over foreign insurers' subsidiaries, according to the directive's rules.</p>

Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule would affect those HMOs and CMPs (90 as of January 1993) that contract with HCFA to furnish health care services to Medicare enrollees that are paid on a risk basis. Four demonstration projects are also subject to the risk contract rules. As of January 1993, there were 21,908 Medicare enrollees in the four demonstration projects. As a result of the OBRA '90 amendments discussed under section II of this preamble, for NCD services that the risk HMO or CMP is not required to furnish (because the cost of furnishing the service is significant and was not taken into account in determining the per capita rate that HCFA pays the HMO or CMP), additional payments may be made as explained in section III.D. of the preamble. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is clear that these additional payments constitute additional program expenditures. However, estimation of the amount is difficult because we cannot accurately predict_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;How many of the services added or expanded through NCDs in any year will be of ``significant cost''; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;How many of the Medicare enrollees of risk HMOs and CMPs (approximately 1.5 million as of January 1993) will need a ``significant cost'' NCD service. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We do know that only six NCD services were added by HCFA during 1991 and 1992, and that only one of those six services (liver transplants for adults) would have met a ``significant cost'' criterion (average cost in excess of $100,000). We do not anticipate a significant increase in the number of liver transplants performed on Medicare beneficiaries because livers for transplantation purposes are not readily available. We believe this surgery will continue to be performed relatively infrequently. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this proposed rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA, 5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all HMOs and CMPs that have entered into risk contracts with HCFA are considered to be small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a proposed rule would have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted earlier in this preamble, we believe that, by ensuring that the cost of furnishing required Medicare services would not increase substantially during a contract period, the new rules might encourage HMOs and CMPs to contract on a risk basis. We anticipate an increase in the number of risk-contracting organizations, but recognize that this proposed rule would not constitute a significant economic impact on a substantial number of HMOs and CMPs. These rules would not affect the operations of small rural hospitals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are not preparing analyses under either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act because we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed rule would not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities or a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 42 CFR Part 417 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Grant programs_health, Health care, Health facilities, Health insurance, Health maintenance organizations (HMO), Loan programs_health, Medicare, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

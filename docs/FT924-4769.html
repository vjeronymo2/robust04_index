			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Decision over risk weightings THE Bank of England yesterday disclosed that banks would not be forced to increase the risk weightings of most forms of mortgage-backed securities. Risk weighting is used in calculating the capital to be held against an asset. The Bank said the weighting for mortgage-backed securities would remain at 50 per cent rather than rising to 100 per cent. Uncertainty over the level of risk weighting for the Pounds 8bn of mortgage-backed securities in Britain was created by the EC solvency ratio directive, which was published in 1990 and comes into force in January.</p>

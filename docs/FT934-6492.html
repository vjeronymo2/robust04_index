			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Markets Report: Lira dives, pound firms Europe once again captured the currency market's limelight, with the Italian lira plunging to a new historical low against the D-Mark while sterling rallied on the Bank of England's surprise rate cut, writes Conner Middelmann. Early in the day, the Bank of England surprised markets by announcing that it was setting its minimum lending rate at 5.5 per cent, signalling a half-point cut in British base lending rates from 6.0 per cent. While the size of the reduction had been largely discounted, the timing came as a surprise, with most expecting a rate cut along with or just after the November 30 Budget. After the announcement, sterling jumped to a high of DM2.5285 on relief that the cut did not exceed the widely discounted 50 basis points and on hopes that the move would help boost the country's economic recovery. Sterling closed at DM2.5275, up from DM2.5125 on Tuesday. Few traders expect another reduction around Budget Day, especially since the Treasury press release accompanying the move stated that the cut had taken full account of Chancellor Kenneth Clarke's budgetary measures. However, many market participants still expect another  1/2 percentage point base rate cut in the next few months in view of encouraging inflation developments and sterling strength following continental European easing. 'Continental European interest rates have substantially further to fall than rates here, and that will continue to lend support to sterling,' said Mr Brian Martin, senior economist at Citibank in London. He is calling for another half-point cut in the base rate in December or early January, and expects sterling to trade in a DM2.50 to DM2.55 range over the next few weeks, 'with a bias to the upside'. The short sterling December futures contract rose 0.04 point to 94.60. The Italian lira put on a dramatic performance, slumping to a new record low against the D-Mark on heavy selling at the opening and clawing back some of its losses during the afternoon session. It hit a low of L1,005 early in the day but recovered in the course of the session on short-covering to finish at L994.5, down from Monday's close of L987.7. Sunday's municipal elections, where the ruling Christian Democratic party suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of right and left-wing parties, fuelled investor fears over the passage of Italy's 1994 budget and the political outlook ahead of next year's national elections. That prompted a rash of foreign selling, sending bonds, stocks and the currency into a downward spiral. But some observers said the sell-off has been overdone and should be used as a buying opportunity. 'The markets have lost sight of the structural improvements in the economy, and with Italian assets now cheap, positions should be established in anticipation of outperformance in coming months,' said Mr Keith Edmonds, chief analyst at IBJ International. Around L1,000, the currency is 'clearly undervalued', he added. Mr Edmonds expects the currency to recover on the back of economic growth against the background of recession-bound Europe and said further gains are likely as investors adjust to the new political groupings. The D-Mark remained relatively well supported by tightness in the money market and Monday's higher than expected M3 money supply numbers which dampened some traders' hopes for near-term German rate cuts. In the domestic money market, the rate for overnight interbank funds firmed further as monthly tax outflows continued to drain liquidity and banks' reserves at the Bundesbank dropped again. Some traders also pointed out that continued buying of D-Marks by the Bank of France to shore up its foreign currency reserves was keeping the German money market tight. By midday, the call rate had firmed to around 6.45 per cent, up from Monday's 6.40 per cent, although the Bundesbank rolled over the Paragraph 17 funds that it had injected on Monday. The funds - government monies on deposit with the Bundesbank that it can lend to the market to ease liquidity bottlenecks - were offered at a rate of 6.40 per cent, and traders estimated some DM8bn to DM10bn of the funds to be in the system. Dealers hope that today's allocation of 14-day securities repurchase agreements at a fixed 6.25 per cent will alleviate the shortage, though they caution that large liquidity inflows next week - including public sector salaries bloated by Christmas bonus payments - may mean the Bundesbank will err on the tight side, preferring to rely on Paragraph 17 injections where necessary. Meanwhile, the dollar drifted lower, testing the downside of its recent range against the D-Mark. Trade is expected to remain thin and erratic ahead of tomorrow's Thanksgiving holiday, with most US traders expected to leave their offices around Wednesday's European close. The dollar closed at DM1.7010, down from DM1.7035 on Monday, and at Y108.50 against the yen, up from Y108.25. In New York it ended at DM1.7010 and Y108.67. The Finnish central bank lowered its tender rate to 6.88 per cent from 7.09 per cent. The rate, which governs commercial banks' borrowing with the central bank, was last changed on November 16.  -------------------------------------------------                 POUND IN NEW YORK  ------------------------------------------------- Nov 22                 Close      Prev. close  ------------------------------------------------- Pounds spot           1.4855         1.4755 1 mth                 1.4823         1.4722 3 mth                 1.4780         1.4678 1 yr                  1.4636         1.4536  -------------------------------------------------</p>

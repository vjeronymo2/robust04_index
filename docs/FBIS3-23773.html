			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Goncharik, chairman of the </F> Belarusian Trade Union Federation, by Galina Nikolaychik; place  and date not given: "Strong Power Always Needs Strong Trade  Unions"]    [Excerpts]    [Nikolaychik] Trade unions believe that it is their  obligation to respond to every harsh measure taken by the  government by way of declarations, protests, and strikes.  However, one gets the impression that this is like tilting at  windmills: The government pays little attention to the reaction  of the most numerous public organization in terms of membership.  How do you assess relations between trade unions and the  government? Are you satisfied with them?    [Goncharik] I am dissatisfied because I believe that the  results of our dialogue could have been weightier. This will be  possible only when the government reviews its economic and  social policies, and introduces serious corrections to the  latter in accordance with our postulates. We have certain  accomplishments, but soaring prices and inflation only nullify  them. For example, on New Year's eve, we were informed of the  planned threefold increase in prices for dairy products and  municipal services. This is being done when enterprises face  work stoppages and workers are not being paid. The Trade Union  Federation Presidium called a session and adopted an appeal in  protest against these measures. The government backed out and  the price increase was postponed. We understand that the  postponement is temporary, but given the fact that the Supreme  Soviet has rejected our proposal to establish the minimum wage  of 35,000 rubles as of 1 December, our fight was not futile.    [Nikolaychik] Do you correct your strategy and slogans  taking into account the experience of your struggle?    [Goncharik] You might have noticed that the federation has  altered its position -- while maintaining our economic claims we  have decided to concentrate our efforts on resolving more global  issues. Some branch trade unions are demanding wage increases.  However, without making our production more efficient, this  measure will only fuel inflation and become a heavy burden on  all of society. Competent legislation is one of the factors  that can facilitate the development of production. In light of  this, we are actively working at Supreme Soviet sessions along  with industrialists and entrepreneurs drafting documents  regulating taxation and favorable credits. Discussions are  under way regarding the adoption of a general agreement between  the government, trade unions, and employees. In particular, we  have agreed to include in this document the share of wages in  the gross domestic product (it was decreased from 26 to 19  percent).    Another thing that I would like to point out is that  disregarding reproaches voiced by many parties, we have put  forward political claims. This does not contradict our charter  which says that we can participate in elections.    [Nikolaychik] Opinion polls conducted by trade unions have  demonstrated that more than 700,000 voters advocate early  elections. It is strange that this figure made no impression on  the deputies who behaved as though nothing really happened.    [Goncharik] These 700,000 voices will sound again when the  session resumes its discussion of elections. The more so that  Lukashenko's anticorruption report did not contribute to the  prestige of power. We are receiving letters from enterprises  and very often only 10 people out of 2,000 oppose early  elections.    Only a blind man fails to see the abnormality of relations  between the Supreme Soviet and the government. It is really  unnatural that the parliament and the government have  diametrically opposing viewpoints regarding many issues of vital  importance, including relations with Russia.    The new legislature will form a new government, but this  does  not mean that everybody will be discharged. People able to work  and think will confirm their right to be deputies, ministers,  and the like. Many deputies support the idea of early elections  and suggest a mechanism for holding them. However, when these  people gather in the session hall, the instinct of  self-preservation prevails. I think there are two reasons for  this: Many deputies simply fail to comprehend the danger of the  current situation in the Republic, while others are trying to  keep their cushy jobs.    [Nikolaychik] Suppose early elections are called. What  stance will trade unions take; what political parties will they  stake? You, for one, are known to support the Social-Democratic  Assembly....    [Goncharik] We support this party's socioeconomic platform.  The Trade Union Federation is now drafting its election  platform. The system of elections is also relevant. Most  likely, the elections will be held in districts with candidates  being nominated by parties. This is why we are considering the  possibility of electing people with similar standpoints to the  new legislature. Our goal is to have a group of workers in the  Supreme Soviet.    We will seek support from centrist parties -- the Party of  People's Accord and its social-democratic wing, the Scientific-  Industrial Congress, and the Labor Party. The formation of a  trade union party -- the Democratic Labor Party -- is currently  under way. We will support this bloc. Our platform stipulates a  socially oriented market economy with active protection of  workers' rights and guarantees of their well-being. We want  Belarus to be a flourishing state; that is why we have suggested  that aside from the definitions "unitarian" and "democratic,"  our constitution includes formulas such as "social" and  "sovereign".    [Nikolaychik] Judging by our conversation, there is no  incongruity between trade unions and politics. Could trade  unions assume responsibility for the state of things in Belarus?    [Goncharik] I do not think such a situation is possible in  immediate future.    [Nikolaychik] Even theoretically?    [Goncharik] I am not an advocate of such a solution.  Everybody should perform his functions. Our political  activities are limited to participation in elections and  electing politicians able to meet working people's demands. The  experience of Poland demonstrates that under certain  circumstances, trade unions can come to power. However later,  they begin to fight trade unions. I also know this from the  Israeli experience. The Israeli Trade Union, Gistradut, and the  Labor Party are in fact one body. They have come to power and  are facing problems. The state has specific restrictive  functions that do not coincide with interests of groups and  organizations. Clashes are inevitable. [passage omitted)    [Nikolaychik] How do you assess prospects for the  development of the ruble zone?    [Goncharik] There are no doubts that today we should follow  this path. We can waste no more time. For a certain period,  people will feel an improvement; products will become cheaper  and mutual payments will be simplified. However, what will  happen then? We should make good use of the breather we will  get. If we want Belarus to become a sovereign state, the  Republic should adopt a national currency sooner or later. If  we follow the path of simple integration in Russia's economy, we  must accept political integration as well. Our sovereignty will  be very feeble; we will become Russia's appendix and autonomous  part. In my opinion, this would be a very dangerous scenario.  We need political wisdom to walk this slippery path and not  fall into an abyss. The Belarusian people are historically  oriented toward Russia. Enterprise managers unilaterally  support a union with Russia. However, we must pursue our  national interests and sovereignty must be the cornerstone of  our policy.</p>

			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Management: No more jobs please - William Bridges believes current work patterns are going out of date The first thing you need to know about William Bridges is that he is forecasting the end of the job as we know it. The second is that he earns money telling us what he means by this. He seems to have his work cut out. His message is simple - the job as a way of compartmentalising work is going to disappear. To those who ask whether this is really going to happen, he replies that it already is. Pursuing the concept of 'job creation' is a waste of time and effort, he argues. He has predicted that by 2020, 'our job chase will look like fighting over the deck chairs on the Titanic'. How and why the job is disappearing - and the consequences - are the practical and social questions that are challenging governments, companies, managers and employees to establish new ways of organising work, says Bridges, whose latest book, Jobshift, will be published in the UK in March. He ended his own job - his conventional one - about 20 years ago. He was a professor of American literature in California, aged 40. Mid-life crisis or simply a yearning to do something different drove him to search for something new. 'In my parents' generation people would hold on to what they were doing for the next 20 years. They weren't very happy but they held on for security,' he says. Giving up a regular job forced some self-examination of Bridges' abilities. 'I was faced with a dilemma: what do I want to do? I want to stop teaching. What do I know how to do? Teach. That's a vicious circle in which you can run around for a long time. 'The only way around that is to find all the factors that have gone into the success of what you have done before and then reassemble or recycle them into some new undertaking. I became very interested in why it was hard to make a career change, so I started teaching a seminar at a local college called 'being in transition'.' The thinking and teaching developed into a book - Transitions, Making Sense of Life's Changes, published in 1980. Fourteen years on it has sold 250,000 copies and is into its 29th print run. His ideas attracted the interest of companies, many of which in the early 1980s were merging, restructuring or acquiring new businesses. Managements were recognising that many of their staff were therefore undergoing a period of transition themselves. Bridges began to receive requests to go into companies and run seminars for managers learning to manage transition. It was his experiences in some of these companies, particularly electronics and computer organisations, that inspired some of his latest theories about the limitations of the job. 'Many of the people in these companies did not have anything like what I would call a job. They were on a payroll and had a series of assignments, reporting to different people for different projects,' he says. He also saw companies using temporary staff and contracting out some of their functions to other companies or individuals. 'I decided there was an economic movement going on that people were not talking about,' he says. Bridges noticed that in areas of a quickly changing economy the traditional job had been transformed from something that proved the best way to get things done to an inefficient way of accomplishing work. Wherever the job dominated people's thinking, they were not working on what needed to be done, and developed the response 'that isn't my job'. He began to see the job as a 'historical artefact' well adjusted to the forms of production that developed in the 18th and 19th centuries. Until about 1800, says Bridges, 'people did jobs but didn't have jobs'. He goes back to the derivation of the word 'job'. Before the industrial revolution, he says, its primary meaning was that of a task. The carriage driver's job was a particular hiring to take someone from one place to another, not the carriage driving itself. Suppose he is right about the death of the job. How do we confront this social revolution? People, he says, will need four 'qualifications' for work. Formal attributes and previous experience are not among them. He identifies them as: Desire: that you really want to do the work. Ability: that you are good at what the work requires. Temperament: you are emotionally suited to the work. Assets: individual advantages or resources, such as languages or personal equity, that the work may require. Organisations, he says, are beginning to recruit people on the basis of Data, the acronym he adopts to describe these attributes. New recruitment methods are being developed. For example, if a company wants to test candidates for a customer service job, it is possible to simulate a situation where a customer screams at the candidate for some imagined slight. The way people handle such problems is more revealing than years of experience or impressive CVs, says Bridges. One of the most basic changes in this post-job society, he believes, will be to the role of the manager. Most middle managers will go, but what about at the top? At Ideo, the US's largest industrial design company, in Palo Alto, California, no one has a title or a boss. People are recruited for 'the right fit'. Hierarchies, Bridges observes, are disappearing in those companies that have pioneered the use of project teams. If we are seeing the end of the job as we know it, could we be also approaching the end of the boss? Bridges is still mulling that one over. Today, says Bridges, we are returning to self-management, but not in the old way where you took care of your job while you followed the leader. The new self-management is to approach the business as if you had an ownership stake in it. One of the challenges facing de-jobbed workers will be pacing themselves - a familiar problem of the self-employed. The end of the job has proved quite timely for Bridges who at 61 is close to the age when someone in a conventional job would be retiring. He says: 'Should companies be able to force out people no longer doing adequate work? Yes. Do I want anyone to press a retirement age on me? No, I certainly don't. So it's a dilemma, a paradox.' He adds: 'One of the reasons I like working for myself is that nobody is going to retire me.'</p>

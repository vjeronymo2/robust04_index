			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: SEC and regulators deadlocked over capital requirements THE controversy over international capital requirements for securities firms, which has dogged this year's meeting of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (Iosco) in London, persisted as the conference drew to a close yesterday. The gap between the US Securities &amp; Exchange Commission and most other regulators appears wider than ever, following the failure of Iosco's technical committee to reach agreement on this crucial issue. Firing a last shot in this week's exchange, Mr Richard Breeden, the SEC chairman, who heads Iosco's technical committee, described comments by Sir Leon Brittan, vice-president of the European Commission, earlier this week as 'ill-informed'. In a veiled attack on the SEC on Wednesday, Sir Leon had said 'no single national regulator . . . can expect to impose their system on everyone else.' Speaking at the end of the conference yesterday, Mr Breeden said: 'It is totally inaccurate to characterise (our position) as imposing our will on anyone else.' He added: 'Politicians need to stay out of it and leave it to the professionals.' But Mr Breeden raised the temperature of the debate by describing the capital requirements enshrined in the European Community's capital adequacy directive as 'the lowest common denominator'. He pointed out, however, that while there was deadlock on standards for equities, Iosco had made considerable progress on standards for the much larger market in debt securities. Mr Andrew Large, chairman of the UK's Securities and Investments Board (SIB), said Iosco intends to resume discussions with the Basle Committee on banking supervision, chaired by Mr Gerald Corrigan, on capital requirements for debt, and will continue work on the equities side within the technical committee. The row over capital requirements obscured some of the other issues raised during the conference, where agreement was reached. Among the decisions of the conference, Mr Large noted: A resolution on money laundering, recommending measures to combat the practice in the securities industry. A set of principles for the supervision of financial conglomerates. A blueprint for effective clearing and settlement systems in emerging markets. Endorsement of the use of international auditing standards, to facilitate orderly cross-border offerings. Work continues in several other areas, such as international accounting standards and transparency. Two committee chairmen were elected during the conference. Mr Jean Saint-Geours, who heads France's Commission des Operations de Bourse, will head the technical committee, in place of Mr Breeden, and Mr Martin Redrado, president of Argentina's Comision Nacional de Valores, will chair the development committee, both for two years. In addition, the UK signed memoranda of understanding on regulatory co-operation with Australia and Hong Kong.</p>

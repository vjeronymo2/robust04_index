			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NO SURPRISE: TITANS NAME SNEED COACH  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton, which ended its basketball season Friday night with a loss  to Nevada Las Vegas, put the finishing touch on the year Saturday by naming  John Sneed as its basketball coach. He was given a three-year contract.  </P> <P> "I hope this job is a little bit easier to keep than it was to get," Sneed  said.  </P> <P> Sneed, who was named acting coach when George McQuarn resigned Nov. 3, guided  the Titans to a 16-13 season that included an upset of UNLV.  </P> <P> But as Sneed guided the team through the final weeks of the season, Fullerton  interviewed two other coaches, fulfilling an announced commitment to an open  search. Texas San Antonio Coach Ken Burmeister and UCLA assistant Paul  Landreaux withdrew their applications after being interviewed.  </P> <P> "I aggressively recruited the best possible applicants," Athletic Director Ed  Carroll said. "(Sneed) has met all comers. It was not an inside job. He has met  the best and come out on top. . . . It became clear that John was the best  choice. Certainly his ability to coach, the Xs and Os, you've seen that game  after game. His ability to pull the players together under adverse situations  is a real tribute to his ability as a head coach."  </P> <P> With the process complete, Sneed said he had no complaint with the search.  </P> <P> "Sometimes it doesn't matter how long it takes you to run a race as long as you  finish first," Sneed said. "I don't have a problem with the process. . . . I'd  rather be first and take a lot of time in the race than run a real quick race  and finish second. . . . The goal I've had for a number of years is to be a  Division I head coach. Sometimes you don't get that opportunity, because it's  not like a player. See, a player can walk on to show his ability. A coach never  has an opportunity to walk on and show his ability."  </P> <P> Although Sneed guided the Titans into a fourth-place tie in the Big West  Conference despite being picked to finish ninth, his handicap in seeking the  job was considered to be the team's poor graduation rate during his eight years  as an assistant to McQuarn.  </P> <P> "The effort John has made already on academics is very encouraging," Carroll  said.  </P> <P> "I have a lot of priorities, and one undoubtedly is to improve the academic  situation at the university," Sneed said. "We have been working very hard at  that, to bring about a change in attitude in our athletes and to raise our  graduation rate. We're not going to complete that in a few months. That will be  over a longer period of time."  </P> <P> Fullerton finished the season with 16 victories, despite having a team with no  returning starters from the previous season when the Titans were 12-17.  </P> <P> After the season-ending loss Friday, Fullerton is considered to have an outside  shot at a bid to the National Invitation Tournament.  </P> <P> "I thought we would have still been on the bubble if we'd gotten our 17th win,"  Sneed said. "But if there is a bid, we'll take it."  </P> <P> Fullerton will have four starters back next season.  </P> <P> But Sneed's immediate priority is recruiting.  </P> <P> "We're a little bit behind here (in recruiting), but we've been behind all year  and several times we've come out on top," Sneed said.  </P> <P> He also will hire a second assistant. He announced Saturday that assistant  Donny Daniels will stay on.  </P> <P> "That -- along with business cards -- is a priority," Sneed said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE ORDERS REFORMS AT O.C. JUVENILE HALL;  </P> <P> LAWSUIT: SHE SAYS A PSYCHIATRIST MUST APPROVE USE OF PADDED ROOMS OR THE  CUFFING OF TEEN-AGERS TO THEIR BEDS.  </P> <P> Calling for better treatment of youngsters confined at Orange County Juvenile  Hall, a judge ordered the county Wednesday to obey strict new rules before  throwing adolescent detainees into padded rooms or cuffing them to their beds.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Linda H. McLaughlin concluded that such disciplinary  methods -- when imposed by unqualified people and conducted without proper  supervision -- violates the teen-agers' constitutional right to be free from  bodily restraint.  </P> <P> Civil rights lawyers, who challenged the practices as cruel and "medieval,"  praised the ruling.  </P> <P> McLaughlin ordered county officials to get approval from a psychiatrist before  restraining minors in such ways and to closely monitor any such restriction.  </P> <P> But lawyers for the county-run facility claimed victory because the judge  stopped short of outlawing use of the leather cuff restraints and rubber rooms,  which they said are necessary to corral dangerous teen-agers.  </P> <P> "The judge's ruling is a vindication of our staff, who are firm but caring and  concerned for the youngsters in their charge," said chief probation officer  Michael Schumacher, who is in charge of all juvenile detention facilities in  the county.  </P> <P> In a 49-page decision issued after a five-week civil rights trial, McLaughlin  said that during 1989, only one out of every 200 youths confined in the hall  were put into rubber rooms or tied to their beds. She acknowledged that such  measures were generally used only when minors posed a danger to themselves or  those around them by doing such things as threatening suicide, screaming and  pounding the walls, smashing their fists through windows and putting their  heads in toilets.  </P> <P> But the judge also said that tying youths down or putting them in padded rooms  also subjects them to potential psychological and physical injury. Testimony  showed that teen-agers tied to their beds suffered numbness and swelling in  their hands and feet, as well as cuts and nosebleeds. They also risk  dehydration, nerve damage, circulatory problems and the possibility of choking  on their own vomit, she said. The hard padding in rubber rooms will not protect  a teen-ager from concussions and other injuries resulting from violent  behavior, McLaughlin said.  </P> <P> Such risks call for the intervention of a psychiatrist, the judge said.  </P> <P> "The court is compelled to conclude that the (Juvenile Hall) staff is not  trained or qualified to make the decision to tie down a minor or confine a  minor to the rubber/safety room," McLaughlin wrote. "The only single individual  who is adequately trained and qualified to exercise judgment which insures both  the physical and psychological safety of the minor is a psychiatrist."  </P> <P> She noted that in 1989, the California Youth Authority changed its policy and  gave doctors, psychiatrists or psychologists sole decision-making power over  when youths are tied down. The change resulted in far fewer restraint episodes,  McLaughlin said.  </P> <P> In her order, McLaughlin said that if a psychiatrist's approval cannot be  obtained and it is a "clear emergency," the decision to restrain a youth may be  made by Juvenile Hall staff members, but only those who have been certified by  a psychiatrist as trained and qualified to make such a call.  </P> <P> Once an adolescent is in cuffs or a rubber room, a nurse must supervise and  keep records of the incident, McLaughlin ordered. Within five days of the  youth's release from restraints, a psychiatrist must review all records of the  incident and submit a written assessment of the way it was handled, McLaughlin  said.  </P> <P> Although McLaughlin noted that past procedures permitted restraint decisions to  be made by inexperienced staffers only a few years older than the detainees,  Kenneth S. Kasdan, a lawyer who represented the county, said that in reality  only qualified supervisors make such decisions.  </P> <P> "We won on all the things that were most important," he said. "We need the use  of rubber rooms and tie-downs to control a small number of minors who are out  of control and dangerous."  </P> <P> Schumacher called the decision "a tremendous victory" that "reaffirms our  longstanding belief that the policies and procedures (of Juvenile Hall) are  appropriate."  </P> <P> Mark I. Soler, a lawyer with San Francisco's Youth Law Center, which  represented the detainees in the class-action suit, said that he had hoped to  eliminate use of tie-down restraints and rubber rooms but that the imposition  of strict rules on their use is a "significant improvement" that protects the  minors and sends an important message.  </P> <P> "These procedures are demeaning and humiliating, and you can't have 20-year-old  staffers with high school educations imposing them on kids," he said. "I think  you'll see fewer kids being put in tie-downs willy-nilly at the unfettered  discretion of the custodial staff.  </P> <P> "Also, this decision is important because maybe now these kids will realize  they do have some rights and that they can't be mistreated by the staff with  impunity."  </P> <P> Soler and the American Civil Liberties Union contended that Orange County is  unusually harsh on its juvenile detainees and that most other counties use less  severe forms of discipline and control.  </P> <P> At a July 20 hearing, the judge will listen to the lawyers' objections to her  decision. Changes in the ruling are possible but viewed as unlikely.  </P> <P> McLaughlin's decision gave the civil rights lawyers one other victory: She  agreed that Juvenile Hall's procedure restricting attorneys' access to  detainees is unconstitutionally vague and must be rewritten. That procedure  requires a lawyer who wishes to see a detainee to get permission from the  youth's Juvenile Court-appointed attorney.  </P> <P> But McLaughlin handed the plaintiffs a string of defeats on a host of more  minor challenges to other Juvenile Hall practices. She said there was nothing  unconstitutional about the way youths were sent to their rooms when they  misbehaved or the kind of access they were given to legal materials on request.  She also saw no problem with the reading and censoring of the youths' mail, the  monitoring of their visits and phone calls, or the restrictions on the kinds of  reading materials they were permitted to have.  </P> <P> McLaughlin agreed that Juvenile Hall frequently exceeded its rated 314-person  capacity, but she said that overcrowding did not rise to the level of a  constitutional violation because the basic needs of the minors are still being  met. The judge noted that an addition now under construction will add 60 beds  in about a year.  </P> <P> The plaintiffs had also complained that youths are disciplined without adequate  grievance or due-process procedures and that they are given insufficient access  to toilets or outdoor exercise, but McLaughlin disagreed.  </P> <P> The judge did, however, set a separate hearing to look into allegations that  staff members harassed and intimidated youths who contested violations of their  rights by participating in the lawsuit.  </P> <P> Several of the issues in the case were revised or abandoned in mid-trial. When  proceedings began in April, the county had been using 10-foot strips of soft  cloth to bind teen-agers to their bed frames. In response to criticism that the  cloth ties cut off the youths' circulation, the county agreed to switch to  fleece-lined leather restraints.  </P></p>

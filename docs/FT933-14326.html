			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Japanese Elections: Japanese 'madonnas' sing rival tunes - Robert Thomson watches the top two female candidates square off in the election campaign In the cloying drizzle of a Japanese wet season, a white plastic grocery bag tied around the cast on a broken foot, Ms Yuriko Koike, star of television and the Japan New party, hobbled forth to deliver one more speech in praise of a JNP-backed candidate. 'If I was paid by the hour for this sort of stuff, I'd be a very rich woman,' said Ms Koike, confident enough of voter support in her home prefecture of Hyogo to give time to other candidates hopeful that a bit of Koike charisma will rub off on their campaigns. But, before next Sunday's general election, Ms Koike cannot afford to venture too far from Hyogo, in western Japan, where she is engaged in symbolic battle with Ms Takako Doi, the 'iron butterfly' and former head of the Japan Socialist party, now known as the Social Democratic party. The local media have dubbed the Koike-Doi bout the 'madonna showdown'. Ms Doi was supposed to lead Japanese politics and women into a new era, but the expectations have shifted to Ms Koike, whose past life as a television commentator has given her the off-camera confidence to keep a political gathering amused. There are 70 women candidates, up from 66 in the 1990 poll and 35 in 1986, and it is pure coincidence that Hyogo is home to the two best known. The 'madonna boom' was an important theme during the last campaign, although only 12 of the 512 members elected in 1990 were women, and the Japanese media have moved on to other subjects. Hyogo has another symbol of the need for change: Mr Kenzaburo Hara, 86, running for the Liberal Democratic party for the nineteenth time, and the country's oldest candidate. He was politely advised by the party to make way for a younger candidate, but insisted that 'this is the most important campaign of my life'. The congenial Mr Hara, who sees himself as a crusader against 'confusion', is bewildered by more than just the plethora of new parties. Arriving for a speech at the Matozaki Gumi construction company, he was carefully guided into the building where construction workers, the LDP faithful, were to hear his faltering speech. Matozaki has Mr Hara's posters plastered on the office walls and presumes another win will be good for business. The campaign posters show a strong-boned man, apparently in his late 50s, but the reality is that Mr Hara, hands and forehead freckled with age, has been unable to defy nature. Some LDP candidates are wary of being seen as too close to the construction industry, accused of illegal funding of politicians and bid-rigging. But Mr Hara is comfortable in the company of his friends at Matozaki, where the corporate slogan is 'More, most'. 'What will happen to Japan if the LDP does not win? If opposition parties form a coalition government, they will not be able to agree with each other because their policies are so different. It will be chaotic for the country,' said Mr Hara, who still has a sense of the issues and a politician's handshake. If an opposition coalition is formed, much will depend on Ms Doi and Ms Koike, who is second-in-command at the JNP. In Hyogo No. 2 constituency, where they are competing, there are seven candidates and five seats. It appears that both will be elected, while Mr Hara may be defeated, though 35 per cent of Japanese voters are still 'don't knows'. For Ms Doi, winning more votes than Ms Koike is a matter of honour, as is rousing support for the SDP, which is expected to have its tally of seats cut from 140 to less than 100. Voters are unhappy with the LDP but now have a wider choice in casting a protest vote, which has generally gone to the SDP in the past. After arriving in the 'Takako-mobile', a van festooned with slogans and high-decibel loudspeakers, Ms Doi attempted to inspire shoppers in a mall at Takarazuka, a Hyogo city famed for an all-women theatre company which performs 'Gone with the Wind' and 'Grand Hotel' to permanently sold-out houses. Introduced as the woman who can save Japan from the LDP, she told 200 people the SDP would not fail at the polls 'in spite of the predictions of the media'. Like Mr Hara, she is contemptuous of the newly-emerged parties and their 'lack of beliefs and ideas'. But Ms Doi is one of her party's greatest contradictions. An impressive speaker who seems to want the SDP to be a genuine alternative to the LDP, she remains an unrepentant ideologue. As leader, Ms Doi maintained the traditional support for totalitarian North Korea, and was unable to draft a coherent economic policy. 'I don't vote for the Socialist party, but I do vote for Doi san,' explained a 34-year-old woman standing in the Takarazuka mall. 'I think she is a wonderful person. I trust her and, for me, that is the most important thing. I believe that she will try to do the right thing, even if her party does the wrong thing.'  ------------------------------------ WOMEN CANDIDATES AND ELECTED MEMBERS  ------------------------------------         Candidates     Elected  ------------------------------------ 1972         20            7 1976         25            6 1979         23           11 1980         28            9 1983         28            8 1986         35            7 1990         66           12 1993         70          -  ------------------------------------</p>

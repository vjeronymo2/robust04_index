			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Major to ride out Euro-storm - How the government is facing the renewed debate VICTORY does not carry with it the assurance of tranquillity. His success on April 9 left Mr John Major as strong a prime minister as any in recent history. But the mild hysteria which gripped some Conservative MPs this week over the Queen's comments to the European parliament was a timely reminder that he will not be immune from occasional squalls. There was nothing remarkable in the sovereign's speech, though the very fact of its delivery marked again the prime minister's break with his predecessor. The balance she struck between the role of the European Community in securing permanent peace in western Europe and the need for national diversity was entirely consistent with her government's stance. Even the garbled precis of her remarks released by Downing Street on Monday went little further than to recognise the enhanced authority which the Community and the European parliament secured at the Maastricht summit. In politics, however, language, perceptions and timing are often more important than substance. Tensions building in a small but vocal section of the Conservative party over the Maastricht legislation always threatened dissent if there was any suggestion that the Queen was siding with the Euro-enthusiasts. The idea in Downing Street's briefing that she would downplay the significance of national parliaments guaranteed a row. If there is a single thread linking the Euro-sceptics within the Conservative party, it is their jealousy of the prerogatives of Westminster and their disdain for Strasbourg. The timing of her visit - linked to Britain's forthcoming presidency of the Community - was also unfortunate. The Maastricht treaty legislation is due to be debated in the Commons next week so the Euro-sceptics had anyway been marshalling their forces. Mrs Margaret Thatcher had let it be known at the start of the week that a speech she plans to deliver in The Hague on Friday will include as scathing an assault on the federalist cause as in her Bruges speech four years ago. The former prime minister's fellow travellers in the House of Commons - who met last night at the Carlton Club to refine their tactics - have been seeking to muster support among Conservative MPs in the lobbies and bars of Westminster. So the Queen's appearance on the Strasbourg stage - Mrs Thatcher refused to contemplate a visit by the sovereign to an institution she holds in scarcely concealed contempt - was a catalyst needed to push those tensions into the public domain. Despite Mr Major's assurances that Maastricht would not allow the Community to usurp the authority of British MPs, there are more un-welcome headlines to come. Mrs Thatcher's influence has been diminished by her departure from the Commons, but her speeches on Europe play still to receptive media. There will also be not insignificant rebellion when the Maastricht legislation is voted on. The best estimate at present is that about a dozen Conservative MPs will oppose it and perhaps half that number will abstain. The figures could rise. In theory that could comfortably rob Mr Major of his majority of 21. In practice the present disarray in the Labour party - it has not yet decided on its stance and may well abstain on the substantive vote - and likely support for the treaty from the Liberal Democrats appear set to guarantee the prime minister a comfortable majority. Yet even for a prime minister who has proved himself supremely adept at filling the philosophical divides in his own party, there is no such thing as a quiet life.</p>

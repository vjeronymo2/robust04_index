According to him, the resignation was due to the fact that a  foreign ministry's official laid off because he had worked for  seven years for the KGB had been reinstated by Chechen President  Johar Dudayev.    However, observers said the real reason for the resignation  was the government's resolution on significant reduction in the  number of the foreign ministry's personnel (up to 14 people).</p>

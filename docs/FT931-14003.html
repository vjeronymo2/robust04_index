			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / NHS told to seek links with private sector NATIONAL Health Service managers should work more closely with the private sector, a government circular says. In a letter today to hospital and health authority finance managers, Mr Gordon Greenshields, NHS director of finance, calls for more joint ventures with the private sector. He also wants leasing arrangements and market-testing of the possibilities of contracting out patient and support services. The letter, which tells managers to be 'innovative and receptive' to new ideas for increasing the use of private finance, is the department's response to the announcement in the 1992 Autumn Statement of arrangements to ease the use of private capital in the public sector. It also reflects the view of Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, that the government has taken the sting from the controversy over NHS reforms and can promote private investment without reviving allegations that it wants to privatise the service. Mrs Bottomley said yesterday: 'The old apartheid between the public and private sectors should be buried. The NHS is not for privatisation and it is not for sale. Where there are opportunities for the NHS to involve the private sector in cost-effective initiatives that benefit patients, they should be taken.' Mr Greenshields' letter says the greater scope for using private capital in the NHS will mean 'additional resources for health care'. Managers will be told to consider joint ventures in areas such as waste incineration and energy conservation. Leasing will not count against hospitals' external financing limits or cash allocations, provided it gives better value. Computers and transport are among areas the department considers suitable for leasing. The guidance follows talks between Mr Tom Sackville, junior health minister, and representatives of potential private-sector partners.</p>

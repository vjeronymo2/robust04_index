			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["U.S. Hostile Policy of Stifling DPRK Will Surely End in </F> Failure, DPRK FM Spokesman" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the  Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  released a statement Monday regarding a "presidential statement"  the United Nations Security Council [UNSC] had adopted raising  an unreasonable demand with the DPRK.    Following is the full text of the statement:    The United Nations Security Council called upon the DPRK to  accept an unreasonable additional inspection by the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] in a "presidential  statement" on March 31 imposing an unjustifiable demand upon the  DPRK.    Our "nuclear issue" is, by nature, not a topic for  discussion  at the UN Security Council.    We have already undergone inspection of our nuclear  facilities, which was enough for the continuity of safeguards,  as agreed with the United States and the IAEA.    There is no room for doubt in this regard.    Conflicting views, if any, in the course of the inspection,  should have been solved on all accounts between the IAEA which  was the actual inspector for the inspection and the country  which was the object of inspection.    Nevertheless, the UN Security Council actually put on the  agenda and discussed the inspection of the DPRK and adopted a  "presidential statement". Why query clear is the essence of the  matter. [sentence as received]    Out of its hostile policy of stifling the DPRK, the United  States needed a forum of political debate, that is, the UN  Security Council, and had to secure an expedient of pressure in  the form of "presidential statement".    It is obviously contrary to the purpose and principle of the  UN Charter that the UN Security Council whose mission it is to  guarantee world peace and security discussed the issue of the  DPRK on the basis of the unreasonable and prejudiced  "conclusion" of the Board of Governors of the IAEA that the  "scope of noncompliance with the safeguards agreement has  expanded".    It is the present-day reality that the United States and  some  Western forces which hate our socialist system as a thorn in  their flesh can freely manipulate international organisations,  if necessary, in order to do harm to small countries like ours.    No one can deny this.    If the UN Security Council is truly to discharge its  mission,  it should take issue with the United States which is gravely  threatening peace and security of the Korean peninsula with a  huge amount of nuclear weapons, laying obstacles to the solution  of the nuclear issue, and the South Korean authorities, its  henchmen.    It must not go unnoticed that the UN Security Council  unreasonably took issue with the DPRK over its peaceful nuclear  activities, while turning a blind eye to the countries which are  engaged in a dangerous nuclear gambling under the patronage of  the United States.    This shows that the UN Security Council is playing into the  hands of the United States in the latter's hostile policy of  stifling the DPRK, applying double standards.    This time the UN Security Council took sides with the United  States in its hostile policy against the DPRK by including the  question of compliance with the safeguards agreement in the  "presidential statement", disregarding the essence of our  "nuclear issue" on purpose.    The safeguards agreement virtually ceased to be effective  from the moment when the DPRK temporarilly suspended the  effectuation of its withdrawal from the Nuclear  Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) for the sake of its talks with  the United States.    Out of the desire to prove the transparency of our nuclear  activities, we have so far accepted only inspection for the  continuity of safeguards as a well-intentioned, voluntary step.    This was an inspection conforming to our special status.    As they could not deny this fact, the United States and the  IAEA agreed to the DPRK-proposed inspection limited to one for  the continuity of safeguards, not routine and ad hoc inspections  of us pursuant to the safeguards agreement.    The call for compliance with the safeguards agreement and  additional inspection, therefore, does not make sense at all for  the DPRK which is now in a publicly recognized special status.    We do mean what we say.    We have consistently maintained a steadfast policy of  independence and a correct line in external relations and never  changed our once clarified position.    The UNSC should first take a measure to set right the  unreasonable act of the IAEA Secretariat in expanding the scope  of partiality against the DPRK, flattering big countries, before  demanding an additional inspection of it.    The IAEA Secretariat must make a due apology for its acts in  further widening the scope of partiality, openly joining the  United States in its intrigues against the DPRK.    We will surely call the IAEA Secretariat to account for  expanding partiality against us stage by stage, instead of  making an apology.    Now, the United States is becoming all the more undisguised  in stepping up the campaign for international pressure on our  Republic by setting in-motion the Board of Governors of the IAEA  and the UNSC.    It is carrying into extremes its military pressure,  threatening to resume "Team Spirit" joint military exercises and  "make no scruple of a second Korean war".    Facts patently prove that the United States has no intention  to solve the nuclear issue at all but chiefly seeks the aim of  executing its hostile policy of stifling the DPRK by  deliberately straining the situation on the Korean peninsula.    The South Korean authorities, following it, are trying to  resume nuclear war exercises in league with the nuclear state  against us at any cost, while continually shipping in nuclear  weapons and putting spurs to their own nuclear development.    This virtually shows that the South Korean authorities have  no regard for the "joint declaration on the denuclearization of  the Korean peninsula" but are taking the criminal road of  nullifying it.    Since the United States resorts entirely to pressure,  reversing all its commitments with us, we have no alternative  but to put on the normal track our peaceful nuclear activities  which have been unilaterally frozen for the DPRK-USA talks.    The United States and the South Korean authorities are  intending to escalate the campaign for pressure on us with the  UNSC "presidential statement" as the starting-point, but it can  never work with us.    The more desperately the United States and its followers try  to stifle the socialist system of our own style, the more  immensely the might of the singlehearted unity of our party,  people and People's Army will increase.    It is our unshakable will and policy to answer strength with  strength, and dialogue with dialogue.    The United States' hostile policy of stifling the DPRK is  fated to be frustrated.    Consistent is our stand to seek a peaceful solution of the  nuclear issue.</p>

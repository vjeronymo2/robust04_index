			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / International Company News: Court protection sought by Royal Construction ROYAL CONSTRUCTION, a Japanese contractor with interests in resort development, is to seek court protection. Royal Construction said that its outstanding debts totalled Y19bn (Dollars 152m), and blamed the difficulties on an unidentified condominium operator which failed to pay debts, leaving Royal unable to honour payment deadlines and in need of protection from creditors. Yesterday's announcement shook investor confidence in other Japanese property companies, whose share prices fell sharply on the Tokyo stock exchange. Trading in Royal shares on the over-the-counter market was suspended yesterday afternoon and the company later said it sought protection because the damage to its credit reputation had left it unlikely to win new government contracts. The company had been a specialist in public works projects before entering the crowded resort market. The Tokyo stock market has been haunted by fears of property company collapses, and reports of Royal's predicament led to a sharp fall in the share price of Daikyo (down Y47 to Y733), a condominium and resort builder which last month publicly denied press reports that it was close to collapse. Share prices of leading contractors fell, including Sumitomo Construction (down Y26 to Y419) and Tobishima (down Y22 to Y423), which is already being restructured by its main bank, Fuji. Misawa Homes, another house builder, was down Y48 to Y951. Japanese contractors have been confronted by a sharp increase in debt defaults by developers, who have been unable to find tenants for new office or apartment complexes, or who have invested wrongly in leisure projects. Builders argue that the condominium market, in decline for the past two years, has begun to recover. The Real Estate Economic Institute said yesterday the number of unsold units in Tokyo last month was 9,953, the first month it has been below 10,000 since September 1991. But the institute said the number of new condominiums offered for sale in June was down 34.3 per cent from the same month last year, while the average sale price of those apartments was 26.9 per cent lower than in June of last year.</p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / LDP considers income tax cut JAPAN'S governing Liberal Democratic party yesterday yielded to opposition demands that it consider an income tax cut as a condition for support on the 1993 budget. The LDP and the three main opposition parties have been at loggerheads for almost a week over opposition demands for a Y4,260bn (Pounds 25bn) tax cut to stimulate the flagging economy. LDP leaders last night agreed to study opposition proposals while drawing up plans for a special package to stimulate the economy. The government is coming under mounting pressure from business to take further measures to provide an economic boost.</p>

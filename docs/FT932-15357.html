			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Survey of Leicestershire 1: County of contrasts - The distribution industry and a dynamic Asian business sector have helped to cushion the county from decline in textiles, shoes and engineering. Business parks able to attract high technology are now being promoted LEICESTERSHIRE is contradictory. It has the external sheen of prosperity but the internal fear of poverty. It is like the business in a mature market which sees the future sliding away as newer products seduce regular customers. On one hand, there is the quintessential shire county, with its picture postcard villages and dreamy countryside, the old England which never dies, with three district council areas said to be among the 20 most affluent in the UK. and whose come-hither literature asserts the status of 'one of the UK's most enterprising and consistently successful locations.' On the other, there is the county with the full range of urban problems, which has joined the rush to London and Brussels pleading access to subsidies. 'Leicestershire's economy is in decline and showing weakness from heavy dependence on traditional and declining manufacturing industries.' Certainly recession sapped confidence in established business. Although county unemployment at 8.5 per cent has been lower than both the East Midlands and the national level, the average disguised pockets of high male unemployment in the inner urban wards of Leicester, Loughborough, Hinckley, Melton Mowbray and Market Harborough. Unemployment rose harshly around the traditional poles of the county economy  -textiles, footwear and engineering. By the end of the decade, a further 25,000 manufacturing jobs are expected to disappear - in perspective, more than the total for all mechanical engineering employment calculated in the 1989 employment census. For all that, economic pain has been less acute in Leicestershire than in, say, the industrial areas of the West Midlands. 'Over the last few years it was not so much desperate recession as gentle decline,' said Mr Richard Brucciani, chairman of Pal International, the hygiene and protective clothing manufacturer in Oadby and chairman of the smaller firms council of the Confederation of British Industry. 'We've got a little dowdy.' Now evidence is accumulating that recession is ending. Higher levels of orders across most sectors in the county economy has brought a return of confidence. 'People have stopped scowling and started smiling,' says Mr John Wareing, managing director of Jones &amp; Shipman, the Leicester machine tools group. Of course, an upturn in orders will bring relief. But sustained growth in the national economy, at a rate faster than most observers believe possible, will be necessary if Leicestershire is to approach an answer to the fundamental question it has been posed: how can enough jobs be provided for a labour force which is not only increasing but which will be weighted towards the over-35 age group? There is a secular decline in the number of engineering jobs. The footwear industry has been successful in establishing niche markets for high quality products, but unsuccessful in protecting its domestic base for mass products. The textile industry has changed its shape into a congeries of smaller companies, able to react quickly to changing market conditions but always prey to imports. The deep coal mining industry has ceased to exist; surface mining is both limited in scale and, not unnaturally, subject to environmental constraints. There is then little prospect that the fundamental question can be answered through the traditional industrial base. As the county council complained to the European Commission: 'Earnings for both men and women are well below the national average and the gap is getting larger. Investment in the county's manufacturing sector is well below the growth in manufacturing investment generally.' Nor can the county expect any immediate fillip from relocation of government departments or agencies from London. The first phase has bypassed Leicester; if an East Midlands city has been favoured, it is Nottingham. To be sure, in recent years both city and county have sought to argue their case more forcefully: there has been more enthusiasm than in most parts of the East Midlands for a regional development organisation and there is widespread disappointment that the headquarters of this putative body will be in Nottingham. The most obvious immediate source of growth from inward investment is through the distribution industry. There is some pride that about Pounds 60m has already been invested along the M42/A42 corridor. It is not surprising that the industry should be attracted to Leicestershire; if any county can claim to be at the hub of the national motorway network Leicestershire can. But there are problems in this popularity. Distribution parks take up large amounts of space but they offer employment in relatively small numbers. Planners argue that it is better to have business parks; not only are there more jobs there, but also, if high technology industry can be attracted, there is the hope of future economic growth. Such an approach is essentially long term. New manufacturing and the provision of high value-added services do not appear in a day. But in taking this approach to the question of finding jobs for the growing labour force, the county has a number of advantages. Not the least is the trio of universities - Leicester, Loughborough and de Montfort (formerly Leicester Polytechnic). Arguably the academic-industrial nexus is stronger in the county than in most other parts of the UK. Mr Alan Green, chief executive of the Leicestershire Chamber of Commerce, cites the growth of the design industry: 'More design studios here than in London,' he claims. 'You can thank the universities for it. Out of them sprang this industry which gets ignored. They're designing everything from Channel Tunnel trains to footwear and textiles. They're significant players in engineering design.' There will be opportunities further to exploit the marriage of academic and industrial expertise at Loughborough, where British Gas is building its research and development centre in what should be the first phase of a new science park, and in Leicester where a new park close to both Leicester and de Montfort universities is on the drawing board. At the same time there is scope for parks, with a bias towards the aerospace industry, at East Midlands International Airport. A second advantage the county has is the presence, in Leicester especially, of an entrepreneurially vigorous Asian community whose tentacles are likely to spread out beyond the retail economy of the corner shop and the clothing industry. Indeed, its presence is already marked. Leicester officials contend that the Asian presence gave the local economy a resilience, during the recession, which otherwise it would not have had. A third advantage is the corporate structure: the dependence of the economy on the proliferation of small and medium sized companies. Historically and in wider economies, they have provided both the employment growth and the energy for innovation - precisely the characteristics the county economy requires. But the disadvantage for the county is lack of time. Longer term growth of higher technology industry, accompanied by energetic training programmes, may well be the answer to the economic future, but the social and economic problems of, notably, the inner city and old coal mining areas, pour in with pressing urgency. Hence the local importance attached to Leicester's City Challenge regeneration programme and to the County Council pleas to the government and the European Community for funds to assist redevelopment of the north west of the county.</p>

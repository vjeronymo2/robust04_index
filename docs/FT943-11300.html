			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Travel: Charm amid the Algarve frenzy - In spite of British incursions, Albufeira retains its character We lingered at the shoe stall for a moment too long. 'You, my friend. What size? What size you?' barked a burly woman as she marched up to us. She gripped my wife's arm tightly. '3,500 escudos . . . 3,000 . . . 2,500,' the woman growled, thinking our attempts to walk away were merely a ploy. 'Good shoe. This very good leather', she said through her moustache, and bent a moccasin back and forth in powerful hands. Her stand was the nearest to the road at the edge of the gypsy market, sited in a field just outside Albufeira, on Portugal's Algarve coast. We later saw the woman and a male accomplice selling loafers to an elderly, gangling American, whom they hauled in and out of a chair like a puppet while he tried the shoes on. In all, there were around 100 stalls at the market, offering shoes, shirts, pottery, rabbits, leather bags, underwear, salted codfish, dried beans and three-piece suites. There was plenty of flotsam and jetsam: Portuguese-made shoes, blouses, rugs from India, and towels decorated with the Manchester United crest. Most of the traders had dark curly hair and swarthy skin. It was not difficult to imagine in them the blood of the Moors who once dominated the region, and gave the Algarve its name (their term al gharb meaning the western land). Behind the gypsies' vans, women washed clothes, and cooked food on primus stoves. Children ran around. Scrawny dogs, chained to the vans, lay quiet in the dust. We found three stalls run by expatriate British. There was a couple selling T-shirts from a red van, a woman selling miniature paintings, and a man making jewellery from old coins. In the end we bought some ceramics, a bag of monkey-nuts, and two T-shirts from the British couple - but no shoes. Until a few years ago, Albufeira was a fishing village. Now it is a growing town. Shops, bars, supermarkets, hotels and 'aparthotels' are stacked on top of each other, scrambling up the hill away from the sea. In spite of this frenzy of development, the narrow lanes in the town centre retain their charm. Small terraces of white-walled cottages suddenly open out to a magnificent view of the Atlantic. The smell of wood-smoke mingles with the warm sea breeze. You get to the beach via a tunnel which has been cut through the cliffs. There were about a dozen fishing-boats beached on the sand. During the day, the fishermen mended and baited their nets. At night they went out into the bay, their lights twinkling on the horizon under the bright stars. One morning we went down to the harbour to watch the boats return. The men piloted their craft through the surf and into the sand at the sea's edge. A tractor hauled the boats up the shore. A few locals, along with a knot of tourists and stray dogs, gathered around a boat that had come to rest on the beach. Two fishermen, stocky and stubby-fingered, with hands and faces like dark leather, squatted in the hull, sorting through their catch. They took sole and sea bream up to the fish market, leaving the onlookers to take their pick of the rest. Eels and sardines - still wriggling and twitching - were stuffed into carrier bags. No-one was interested, though, in the two squid that lay in the bottom of the boat, puffing flabbily, slowly dying without water. When the fishermen returned, those who had helped themselves to the catch paid up. The small crowd then drifted across the sand to another crew that had just come ashore. At Albufeira, the distance fish travel from the net to the table is short. There is a restaurant right above the fish market, and the attractive, compact quayside is crammed with outdoor tables. The long, sandy beaches of the Algarve are excellent for a day's walking. One morning we set off to walk along the coastal footpath from Albufeira east towards Vilamoura. The air was fresh, and the slight chill was slowly giving way to spring warmth. Once we had left the main beach at Albufeira there were very few people around. We walked barefoot through the surf. From the beach, the sharp outlines of white-washed walls dazzled against the deep blue sky. Crumbling ochre cliffs rose from the long stretches of sand. The cliffs were thickly covered with a succulent plant with fleshy, wedge-like leaves. Its flowers, shaped like sea anemones, slowly opened to the sun. Trees stuck out from the cliff-tops at bizarre angles; at their feet were spiky plants with curling blade-shaped leaves, standing sentry. Everywhere, the sea was eating into the coastline, turning it into a honeycomb of crumbling caves and overhanging ledges. Along the beach there were large and newly arrived-looking boulders. Where the beach became impassable, the path went up over the cliffs. We came across three men in waders dredging for shellfish. They were slowly dragging box-shaped nets through the sand. The waves washed away the sand, leaving the shellfish at the bottom of the net. It looked hot, grinding work. By the middle of the day, each had harvested less than a bucketful. The furthest point east on our walk was the village of Olhos d'Agua. Its seaside stalls were opening for the summer season. There was also a bar, run by British expatriates, offering pale ale and strawberries with cream. We sat at a shaded table outside, and ordered sardines with salad. We should have known better. When the sardines arrived, they had not been grilled in the local style. They were done in batter, and served with sliced white bread. The only thing missing was the chips.</p>

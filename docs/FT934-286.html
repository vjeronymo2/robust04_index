			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong surges 4.8% in record setting region Roundup Pacific Rim markets remained in buoyant mood after Monday's sparkling performances which brought records in Bankok, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Singapore, and Taiwan. A further clutch of records were set yesterday as bull runs were extended in some markets and others returned after an extended weekend holiday, determined to catch up. Australia and New Zealand were closed. HONG KONG surged 4.8 per cent to a record close, the Hang Seng index making its biggest one-day jump ever as foreign funds poured into the market after the holiday. The index finished 530.38 higher at 11,570.22. The previous largest single day rise was the 394.40 advance seen on December 16. Preliminary turnover was a robust HKDollars 9.61bn against the final HKDollars 4.75bn for Friday's half-day session. Gains were across the board but property counters led on hopes of strong profits due to a relaxation of building controls in the Kowloon district and record land prices. SINGAPORE's bull run continued, pushing the Straits Times Industrials index to up 13.94 to a new closing high of 2,392.37, in spite of profit-taking after Monday's trade, which also set a record. Intra-day losses were erased when selling was well absorbed by investors still hopeful of making gains ahead of the new year, brokers said. BANGKOK extended its record breaking rally in very heavy turnover, closing sharply higher for the sixth straight session. The SET Index added 44.57 or 2.8 per cent to 1,652.69, taking the cumulative advance to 10.4 per cent over the past week. KARACHI broke into record territory at the close amid a sense of optimism on strong buying from overseas. The KSE 100-share price index rose 33.88 to 2,100.60. TAIWAN closed at a 29-month high as financials surged, although most other sectors fell on profit-taking after the recent bull run. The weighted index, which rose 85 points at one stage, finished 10.07 higher at 5,501.75, in heavy turnover of TDollars 85.2bn. KUALA LUMPUR closed higher but off the day's best after late profit-taking trimmed a strong early advance. Active institutional and foreign buying pushed the composite index to a record intra-day high of 1,225.25 before closing at 1,223.05, up 17.77. MANILA took a rollercoaster ride, with prices surging at the opening and falling sharply on profit-taking before bouncing back at the close. The composite index fell 4.97 from Monday's record, to 3,165.65. SEOUL ended easier on the last day of 1993 trading after heavy selling by the Korea Securities Market Stabilisation Fund in an attempt to cool the market. The composite index fell 7.70 to 866.18. Tokyo After an aggregate loss of 3.6 per cent on Friday and Monday, Japanese equities recovered half of those losses yesterday, writes Wayne Lionel Aponte in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 index rose 311.33 to 17,131.21 in light trading, but on on steady buying from investment trusts and bargain hunters. On Monday, the 225-average declined by 321.23 to 16,819.88, after shedding 304.63 to 17,141.11 on Friday; it fluctuated between 16,853.99 and 17,147.61 yesterday. The Topix Index of all first section issues ended 19.81, or 1.4 per cent higher at 1,427.19. Turnover was estimated at 200m shares compared with 190m on Monday and 206m on Friday. Advances led declines by 658 to 292 with 172 unchanged. Japanese brokers said that market sentiment remains bearish in spite of the session's gains, due to uncertainty about the timing of an economic stimulus package and any political reform by the administration of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister. Government officials agreed that an income tax cut is of primary importance, but the announcement was already factored into the market. According to Mr Yuichi Matsushita, senior market strategist at Nikko Securities, hopes of an year-end rally during the next two trading sessions are likely to be disappointed. Investors are now cautious about the first quarter of 1994, in the absence of any fresh incentives  - and with the weakness in the overall economy illustrated by the recent 6.9 per cent year-to-year decline in the nation's retail sales for a 18th consecutive monthly drop. Chart analysts expect the Nikkei average to rise above last year's close of 16,924.95, but to stay within a narrow range between 17,000 to 17,300 with foreign investors on holiday and most domestic market participants on the sidelines. Small-lot buys from investment trusts lifted major steelmakers. Nippon Steel gained Y6 at Y303, Kawasaki Steel Y8 at Y309, NKK Y7 at Y237 and Sumitomo Metal Industries Y10 at Y260. The heavy electronic sector benefited from the day's rally. Toshiba advanced Y18 at Y685, while Hitachi moved Y17 higher at Y810. Profit-taking cut the gains of Mazda Motors. Investors dumped shares after buying on Monday, on the news that the Japanese carmaker and the US-based Ford Motor will strengthen their ties. Mazda fell Y15 to Y383. In Osaka, the OSE average ended 220.05 higher at 18,964.39, in volume of 31m shares.</p>

			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Rise in bank loans to small business seen BANKS have doubled the amount of money they lend to small businesses since the mid-1980s, a survey published today shows. The survey, conducted for National Westminster Bank by Graham Bannock and Partners, a consultancy, says more than Pounds 40bn is being lent to small businesses by banks. The banks are anxious to defend their commitment to small businesses after a year of intense criticism in which part of the blame for the financial problems of small companies was laid at their door. Critics complained that instead of passing on interest rate cuts the banks were increasing the cost of loans and other bank charges. Many small businesses believed banks were increasing profit margins at their expense. The survey suggests that the growth in bank lending has reduced problems in raising relatively small sums for long-term investment. Banks are now more willing to provide funds at fixed rates and terms, making it less necessary for small businesses to turn to other funding sources. Ms Jane Bradford, head of Small Business Services at NatWest, said: 'Much of the rapid growth among small firms over the last decade has been financed by banks.' The report also says, however, that small businesses are often unwilling to bring in outside investors, who might wish to influence the way a company is run, and venture-capital groups and other potential investors are not keen on small investments which could prove expensive to monitor. Banks lend Pounds 1 for every Pounds 2 invested in small businesses by their owners, the survey found. Venture Capital and the Equity Gap.

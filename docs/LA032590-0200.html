			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN THE GARDEN: GARDENING;  </P> <P> PACIFIC COAST IRIS HIDES ITS BEAUTY UNTIL SPRING  </P> <P> One of the nicer, and most unappreciated, native California plants is the  Pacific Coast iris.  </P> <P> Quite unlike the stiff, bearded iris of gardens, the Pacific Coast iris looks  more like a grass and can be hard to spot among native grasses, at least until  it comes into flower.  </P> <P> The Pacific Coast iris flowers in early spring, usually in March. The flowers  are flat and open and easy to see in the garden and they can be so numerous as  to nearly hide the plant beneath. They come on the end of slim, delicate stems  and as one finishes up, it is replaced by another, so the show runs for about a  month.  </P> <P> The iris only bloom once a year, but the flowers are replaced by rusty-brown  seed pods that are nearly as ornamental.  </P> <P> The Pacific Coast iris (Iris douglasiana and several other species) have leaves  that are narrow and arching, just over a foot tall, and a dark grass-green,  though the tips are often colored brown, a natural phenomenon.  </P> <P> It forms spreading clumps that can grow 3 to 4 feet across in a few years,  though the center of the clump becomes open as the plants' spread.  </P> <P> Beth Chatto, a renowned English gardener and author, describes them in her new  book "Plant Portraits" (David R. Godine, Boston; $25):  </P> <P> "In the garden, they make low tussocky clumps of evergreen leaves which  themselves provide useful ground cover along the edge of a border. In May (in  chilly England), long, slender flower stems appear from among the rose-tinted  leaf bases, carrying flights of flowers like butterflies. Long, furled and  pointed buds open silk-textured petals, frilled and ruffled in every pastel  shade imaginable.  </P> <P> "Not until autumn do you pay much attention to their dark arching foliage. Then  suddenly among the leaves you notice seed pods splitting open to form a shape  as attractive as flowers, crinkled brown outside, pale cream within. On dried  and curving stems they make something special for winter arrangements."  </P> <P> As prophets are without honor in their own land, so seems to be the case with  native plants. California natives, in particular, are unappreciated here,  although English and European (as well as Australian and New Zealand) gardeners  adore them.  </P> <P> No California gardener would wax as enthusiastic as Chatto over our native  iris; most don't know we have a native iris. But they should, for Pacific Coast  iris are special and they can be easy to grow in the garden, taking water with  the rest of the garden, or doing without.  </P> <P> Pacific Coast iris are not as drought-resistant -- or as fussy -- as a  ceanothus or coyote brush, and need supplemental water between winter rains and  a tad in spring and summer, but compared to other garden plants they are not at  all thirsty.  </P> <P> They could be the beginnings of a garden that needs less water, because they  are easy to tuck into little spots here and there.  </P> <P> In my own garden, I found a spot for them beside a quiet container of water  where water lilies bloom in summer. And I have them beside the back steps where  their grassy foliage helps hide that awkward transition between house and  garden.  </P> <P> My favorite is a cream-colored hybrid named 'Chimes,' developed by McCaskill  Gardens.  </P> <P> Most of the available Pacific Coast iris, including 'Chimes,' are hybrids of  several different native species, and the colors run the gamut from truly  lovely blues, through lavender, into soft yellow and gold, and even a shade of  brown that takes a little getting used to.  </P> <P> There are no true pinks though that shade can be found on some of the lavender  or lilac-colored flowers.  </P> <P> Being unappreciated by most, they are unavailable at most nurseries, and  specialists must be sought out. McCaskill gardens is one, at 25 S. Michillinda  Ave. in Pasadena, near the Los Angeles County Arboretum.  </P> <P> They are having a special sale of about 300 native iris and will be open today  through next Sunday, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. every day. Otherwise they are only  open Saturdays, from 9 to 11:30 a.m. and then from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Other sources include the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden plant shop, 1212 Mission  Canyon Road, Santa Barbara, (805) 682-4726; the Theodore Payne Foundation  nursery, 10459 Tuxford St., Sun Valley (in the San Fernando Valley), (818)  768-1802; Tree of Life Nursery, which only sells retail on Fridays, from 9 a.m.  to 4 p.m., 33201 Ortega Highway, San Juan Capistrano, (714) 728-0685.  </P> <P> Because the flowers can be so distinctly colored, it is best to buy these  plants in bloom, though fall is the better time to plant. You can plant now and  carefully water through spring, summer and fall, or keep the plants in their  containers until fall and then plant.  </P> <P> When shopping, look for strong, vigorous plants because some of the hybrids are  much tougher than other. A few are downright difficult to keep alive.  </P> <P> Most authorities say these plants need a rich, woodsy soil, so in a level  garden with a heavy clay soil, you may want to mix in organic amendments (sold  by the bag at nurseries).  </P> <P> But if you don't want to water much, you may prefer to simply plant them in  unamended soil and then be careful not to overwater once they become  established.  </P> <P> On sloping ground, no amending of the soil is necessary. They are good soil  holders and grow well on hillsides, even in fairly heavy soil like that found  on the Pacific Palisades bluffs or in Palos Verdes.  </P> <P> Near the beach they grow in full sun, although they will grow in some shade. In  Brentwood, Ruth Borun grows a meadow of Pacific Coast hybrids under a huge  camphor tree. The camphor lets through spots of sunlight and the plants get  regular water.  </P> <P> At Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden in Claremont, they are grown in full sun and  are not watered between July and September, so they clearly tolerate extremes.  </P> <P> Ruth Borun points out that fall is the time to tidy up the clumps -- to cut off  the dead leaves and the seed stalks. Otherwise, the plants become choked with  old leaves.  </P> <P> Pacific Coast iris are difficult to divide or move about, but it can be done in  November or December, just as the plants are making new roots. Be careful not  to break these fat white roots as you dig the clumps from the ground. Cut off  the old rhizomes that are no longer flowering and replant.  </P> <P> GARDENER'S CHECKLIST  </P> <P>  For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions on what to do in the garden this  week from the California Assn. of Nurserymen:  </P> <P> Whether planting vegetables or flowers, be sure to dig down deeply and add  organic matter to improve soil.  </P> <P> The color impact of your garden can be increased by planting containers with  seasonal annuals as a finishing touch.  </P> <P> Sow vegetables such as lettuce, radishes, corn and carrots in successive  intervals to lengthen your harvest.  </P> <P> Check out the day lily because it comes in many colors, heights and blooming  seasons -- making it a versatile plant to use in your landscaping plans.  </P></p>

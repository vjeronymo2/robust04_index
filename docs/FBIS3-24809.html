In the discussions, Prof. (Sory)  commended the British Government for the positive steps taken in  resuming aid to Sierra Leone. Baroness Chalker informed the  high commissioner that the British Government will release 2  million pounds to the Sierra Leone Government to offset and  cushion the effects of the structural adjustment program. Prof.  (Sory) referred to releases made by the World Bank and the IMF,  which, he said, clearly suggests that the NPRC [National  Provisional Ruling Council] Government has been able to effect  conditionalities imposed by the two international organizations  who are, by all indications, quite happy with the economic  performance of the NPRC Government.    Prof. (Sory), however, noted that the rebel incursion has  been concentrated in the economically important and viable areas  of Sierra Leone and, to a greater extent, has dealt a severe  blow in the strife toward the country's economic emancipation.  High Commissioner (Sory) said that with the arrival of  OAU-sponsored troops in Liberia, there is a possibility for  faction leader Charles Taylor to disarm, a move which will  increase the chances of peace returning to Sierra Leone, and a  more greater possibility for a revival of the country's economy.  On returning Sierra Leone to civilian rule, Prof. (Sory)  pointed out that the NPRC will do everything possible to adhere  to the transition program. Baroness Lynda Chalker in her reply  expressed delight that the NPRC Government has produced a  detailed transition program and expressed the wish to be kept  informed about the work of the National Commission for Democracy.    Touching on the issue of the four Vietnamese holding British  passports now facing prison charges in Freetown, Mrs. Chalker  hoped the matter would be resolved quickly in the courts through  proper and acceptable legal procedures. Both Prof. (Sory) and  Baroness Chalker discussed plans for the inauguration of the  Sierra Leone- United Kingdom Chamber of Commerce due to take  place on 4 February.</p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Delfont in a positive light Sir, I was interested to see Antony Thorncroft's comment in his obituary of Lord Delfont (July 29): 'Sometimes his judgment wavered . . . and he rejected an investment in Monty Python's Life of Brian because he thought it was blasphemous.' To me, this decision, far from indicating poor judgment, says more about Lord Delfont - and puts him in a more positive light - than all the other glowing comments in the rest of the obituary put together.

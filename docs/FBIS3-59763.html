Now do the same thing with a sheet formed  from a shape-memory alloy. The crumpled mass unfolds into a  sheet again.    Shape-memory alloys are among the most fascinating of new  materials for this unique ability to return to their original  shape when heated, no matter how badly they have been distorted  at a lower temperature.    Until recently, speculation on their potential raced far  ahead of actual applications. But the alloys are now finding  widening use in a broad range of fields, from consumer  electronics to women's clothing to dental prosthetics.    Shape-memory alloys are one class of intermetallic  compounds,  a special group of two-metal alloys. What makes them unique is  their molecular structure. When a typical metal is heated or  cooled, bonding between atoms changes. But in a shape-memory  alloy, the bonds between adjacent atoms remain very strong.    As a result, the material is very elastic and although it  can  be deformed below a certain temperature, it returns to its  original shape when reheated.    These two unique properties of shape-memory alloys are being  utilized in a variety of applications. In England, a  shape-memory alloy has been used as the hinges for greenhouse  windows. When the outdoor air reaches a certain temperature, the  hinges change shape, opening the window in the process.  <H5>  Storage Applications </H5>   In Japan, shape-memory alloys are being used to help keep  the  air dry inside storage units holding chemicals, camera lenses  and other moisture-sensitive products. A shape-memory alloy is  used for the spring which controls a door separating the storage  room from the unit containing the moisture-absorbing desiccant.  When the desiccant can no longer absorb moisture, a heater  kicks, triggering the spring to shut the door. With the storage  area thus protected from exposure to moisture, the desiccant can  be reconditioned.    Consumer-electronics manufacturers are using shape-memory  alloys to give air conditioners added value. When the air  conditioner is used to heat the room, a spring made from  shape-memory alloy contracts, pulling the flaps down so the hot  air is blown toward the floor.    The tremendous elasticity of shape-memory alloys has been  used to make eyeglass frames and women's brassieres.    In the dental field, the alloys are being used for  artificial-tooth roots. The branches of a tooth root made from a  shape-memory alloy are straight when the dentist implants the  root in the jaw bone, but bend when warmed by body temperature.  As a result, the root becomes firmly secured and more difficult  to dislodge. Shape-memory alloys are also being used for  orthodontic braces.    The medical field is the site of much applications research.  One day, shape-memory alloys may be employed to help mend broken  bones by keeping the fractured parts firmly together.    Two types of shape-memory alloys are now in use: a  nickel-titanium alloy, which accounts for 90&percnt; of all  present  applications, and a series of copper-based alloys, such as  copper-zinc-aluminum.    Copper-based alloys are comparatively easy to process and  therefore cheaper than nickel-titanium alloys, but they loose  their ``memory'' after around 1,000 heating and cooling cycles.  In contrast, a nickel-titanium alloy can last for as many as 1  million cycles.    Moreover, this type of alloy does not corrode and is  biocompatible, so it can be used inside the human body. The job  now is to simplify the processing steps and to reduce production  costs.</p>

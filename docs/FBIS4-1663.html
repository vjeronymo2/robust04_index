			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Provincial Government Makes </F> Public Anhui's Economic Situation in 1993, Marked by Rapid  Growth, Great Vitality, and Sound Development"]    [Text]  <H5>  Gross National Product Up 22 Percent Over 1992; Ranked Among </H5> Provinces With Relatively Rapid Economic Development in China    On 7 February, the Information Office of the provincial  government held a news briefing. Entrusted by the provincial  government, Cui Zhikang, director of the provincial statistics  bureau, made public economic development in Anhui Province:    Last year, in the course of establishing a socialist market  economy in Anhui, while further emancipating our mind and  deepening opening up, we witnessed rapid growth in the national  economy; the overall economy showed the most rapid growth,  greatest vitality, and most sound development since reform and  opening to the outside world. According to preliminary  estimates, the gross national product for the whole year topped  94 billion yuan, an increase of 22 percent over 1992, and higher  than the national growth by about 9 percentage points. Anhui  has already been ranked among provinces with relatively rapid  economic growth.    In 1993, there were three salient features in the economic  operations of the province:  <H5>  By Seizing Opportunities, our Economy Shows Rapid Growth </H5>   -- Industrial production saw the most rapid annual growth  since 1978. In 1993, the total industrial output value of the  province reached 140.2 billion yuan, up 44.6 percent over the  previous year; of which industrial output value at and above  township level reached 94.9 billion yuan, up 26 percent over the  previous year, bringing our national ranking from the 14th place  in 1992 to the 12th place in 1993. Along with industrial  growth, economic efficiency improved markedly. Total sales of  industrial products reached 95.5 percent, up 0.8 percentage  points over last year. Income and profits, and taxes from sales  of industrial products are estimated to have grown by 42.1  percent and 90 percent respectively.    -- Agricultural production reaped an all-around bumper  harvest. Since last year, the central government has issued a  series of measures in a bid to improve agricultural production  and develop the rural economy. These, along with various other  factors such as favorable climatic conditions, price hikes for  grain and other farm and sideline products, reduction of  peasants' burdens, and cash terms for purchases of farm and  sideline products, have provided a favorable environment and  external conditions for enhancing agricultural production.  Initial estimates indicate the total agricultural output value  for the year will reach 41.7 billion yuan, an increase of 8.5  percent over the previous year, which would be far higher than  the average yearly growth of 2.8 percent achieved during the  Seventh "Five-Year Plan." Total production of grains, edible  oil products, and silkworm cocoons all registered their highest  levels of growth, while cotton and aquatic products neared their  highest levels in history.    -- Investments showed robust growth. Investment in fixed  assets by state-owned units totaled 17.17 billion yuan, up 42.6  percent over last year. Of this, investment in infrastructure  realized 10.03 billion yuan, up 40.3 percent; and investment in  renovations and transformation accounted for 6.26 billion yuan,  up 42.6 percent. A large number of infrastructure projects in  communications and transportation, as well as on key raw  materials were completed and put into operation. Construction  of a large number of infrastructural projects, including the  Chang Jiang Bridge in Tongling and the Hefei-Jiujiang railway,  which have a bearing on the overall situation, made good  progress. Construction of a number of raw and semi-finished  materials projects, including the Anqing acrylic nitrile and  Tongling cement plants, were quickened to further build up  Anhui's strength for further economic development.    -- Steady increase of market sales. The total volume of  retail sales reached 39.17 billion yuan, up 15.9 percent from  1992.    -- Rapid rise in the income of urban and rural residents.  Per capita income of urban residents was 2,025.7 yuan, up 24.8  percent, or 9.1 percent after deducting price rises; that of  peasants was 724.5 yuan, a net increase of 151 yuan and the  biggest since the introduction of reform and opening up, or an  increase of 9.4 percent after deducting price rises; and the  average wage of workers of state-owned units reached 3,095 yuan,  up 20.8 percent from 1992, or 5.6 percent after deducting price  rises. Residents' savings deposits have increased markedly. At  yearend, the balance of savings deposits by urban and rural  residents throughout Anhui was 34.181 billion yuan, or 8.518  billion yuan more than at the beginning of the year.  <H5>  Vitality for Economic Growth Increases Continually </H5>   -- Gradual invigoration of the internal mechanisms of state  enterprises. In 1993, we conducted active and fruitful  experiments on transforming the operating mechanisms of state  enterprises, strengthening property rights, and establishing a  modern enterprise system. For example, we achieved notable  results in introducing the share-holding system to large and  medium state-owned enterprises, in instituting the contracting  and management of deficit-ridden state enterprises by  nongovernment sectors, in allowing superior enterprises to  absorb inferior ones, in inducing foreign capital to upgrade  domestic industries, and in auctioning small state enterprises.  So far, 377 enterprises have implemented the standardized  share-holding system. The successful issuing and listing of  stocks of the Meiling Enterprise, Anhui Energy Corporation, and  Maanshan Iron and Steel Company has not only helped these  enterprises expedite the pace of transforming operating  mechanisms and become better known, but also raised over 7  billion yuan to accelerate the development of enterprises.    -- Versatile ideas for developing the rural economy. Guided  by market-oriented agriculture, we have made headway in  readjusting the agricultural structure while the principle of  stressing "high yields, high quality, and high efficiency" has  brought about sweeping changes in traditional agriculture.  Noteworthy is the new road of transferring surplus rural labor,  pioneered by 4 to 5 million peasants from Anhui at the beginning  of the year. Judging from actual results, the exodus of  peasants did not have an adverse effect on agriculture but  slightly increased the province's revenue. Moreover, some  peasant laborers, who acquired new knowledge and learned  technical skills while working in the coastal regions, have  played an active role in local economic development.    -- Vigorous development of non-state economic sectors. In  1993, non-state economic sectors, with village and town  enterprises as the mainstay, have expanded rapidly. The annual  total output value of village and town enterprises is expected  to set a record 110 billion yuan. In terms of growth rate,  while it took Anhui only two years to increase the total output  value of village and town enterprises from 30 billion to 110  billion yuan, it took such coastal provinces as Jiangsu and  Zhejiang from three to five years.    -- Flourishing export-oriented economy. The total volume of  foreign trade exports was $960 million, up 16 percent from 1992.  The total supply of foreign trade goods increased 43.6 percent  over the previous year. A total of 1,040 new Sino-foreign  ventures, cooperative ventures, and solely-foreign funded  enterprises were approved, the largest number since the  introduction of reform and opening up. The actual amount of  foreign capital utilized was $370 million, up 160 percent from  the previous year.    -- Flexible macroeconomic regulation and control. Since last  June, we have conscientiously implemented the central  authorities' Document No. 6 in a timely manner, and carried out  macroeconomic regulation and control in the light of realities  in Anhui. We have refrained from demanding uniformity in  implementation, adopted realistic measures to curb the  overheated economy in localities as deemed necessary, and  conducted structural readjustment while keeping the same scale  of currency issuance, loans, and investment, thereby maintaining  a good momentum for economic growth and warding off economic  upheaval.  <H5>  Macroeconomic Regulation and Control Yields Positive Results </H5>   -- Noticeable alleviation of "bottleneck" constraints. The  production of major energy, and raw and semi-finished material  products has increased. The output of raw coal was up 6.6  percent, while that of electricity generated, rolled steel, and  cement were all up by more than 10 percent. Raw coal, rolled  steel, cement, and timber in stock were basically able to meet  demand. Meanwhile, prices of capital goods began to drop  sharply. In the second half of 1993, the index of purchasing  prices of major capital goods registered an average increase of  23.8 percent [sentence as published], or 10 percentage points  lower than the margin of increase in the first half of the year.    -- Fairly rational investment structure. In 1993 investment  in the tertiary industry province-wide rose 61.5 percent,  increasing its ratio to the total investment in capital  construction to 42.8 percent from 37.1 percent of the same  period of 1992. Investment in such basic industries as energy,  raw and semi-finished materials, transportation, and posts and  telecommunications accounted for 68.2 percent of the total  investment in capital construction, or 70 percent if allocations  for improving investment environment were included. The rate of  allocating funds for key state construction projects also rose  sharply.    -- Conspicuous increase in financial revenue. The annual  financial revenue totaled 7.32 billion yuan, up 32.8 percent  from 1992, thus ending the stagnant situation, in which the  revenue amounted to some 5 billion yuan for four successive  years since 1989. All 16 prefectures and cities overfulfilled  the annual budgeted revenue, with most of the prefectures and  cities registering an increase of more than 20 percent.    -- Improved financial order. Anhui's efforts to rectify  financial order brought about a turn for the better in the  banking situation. Savings deposits have increased by a wide  margin. As of the end of 1993, the balance of savings deposits  throughout the province was 49.4 billion yuan, or 8.2 billion  yuan more than the figure at the end of June. Currency supply  has gradually returned to normal. The total volume of currency  supply in 1993 rose 45 percent over the previous year, while  currency withdrawn from circulation was up 47.1 percent. The  rate of reserve funds has also returned to standard.    Cui Zhikang also discussed a number of contradictions and  problems in Anhui's economic life. They are mainly high price  rises, poor economic efficiency, and a shortage of funds.</p>

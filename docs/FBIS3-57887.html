The General Directorate of Police has compiled a file on  "PKK  activities in Armenia." A document in the file notes that the  PKK established its camps around villages close to Turkey's  border, villages that are mostly inhabited by Kurdish citizens  and Armenians who are hostile to the Turkish people.    The file indicates that the PKK members are training with  the  ASALA militants in al-Biqa' valley in Lebanon and the Zeli camp  in northern Iraq. Regarding PKK's links with the Armenians, it  said:    1. The terrorist ASALA militants have trained the PKK  members in the PKK camps in Jordan [as published] and Syria,  recruited new members for that organization, and supplied arms  and other required material to them. ASALA continues to support  the PKK.    2. PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan is supported by Armenia and  ASALA. He personally supervises PKK's links with Armenia.  Ocalan has established training camps near Armenian villages  close to Turkey's border. His militants train in those camps at  the present time. The Armenian Government is aware of PKK  activities and supports them. PKK training camps are located  around villages close to Turkey's border, which are mostly  inhabited by Kurdish citizens and Armenians who are hostile to  the Turkish people.    3. It is believed that the PKK members and ASALA militants,  who train in those camps, will attack Turkey through Armenia's  border in the near future (beginning in spring 1994).    The file noted that the Armenian Government is aware of the  support given to the PKK in Armenia. The following Armenian  villages are listed as having helped the PKK: Mirek, Ria Taza,  Elegis, Shengavit, Derek, Afsin, Suphan, Chumyshvan, and Senger  in Aragats district; Baradzh, Hakko, Gelto, Sorik, Kabaktapa,  Tellik, and Sechanly in Amri Taze, Talin district; Ferik in  Baysyz Echmiadzin district, and Samiran in Ashtarak district.</p>

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Small-business report slams big banks The four largest clearing banks are generally seen by small businesses as providing worse services than those offered by the smaller banks, according to a survey published yesterday by the Forum of Private Business. The findings, produced by the University of Nottingham on the basis of 5,500 responses to questionnaires, showed Allied Irish Banks with the highest score at 57.1 and TSB with the lowest at 44.2. Two years ago, a similar survey showed that the highest score was 52.2 (Bank of Scotland) and the lowest, 43.8 (Lloyds Bank). Lloyds is now equal second with Yorkshire Bank on 57.1, while Barclays Bank is at 48.5 and National Westminster Bank, 50. Mr Stan Mendham, chief executive of the FPB, said the survey showed that small businesses were deterred from changing bank because they saw few differences and were concerned about the difficulties of switching accounts. It also suggested that the larger the business, the better the relationship it tended to have with its bank. Mr Stuart White, head of small business at Midland Bank, said the message for the clearing banks was that they needed to concentrate continually on their relationships with small businesses. Mr White, who chairs the small-firms subcommittee of the British Bankers' Association, said it was encouraging that banks in general had scored higher than they had done two years ago. He acknowledged, however, that this might be partly due to a more favourable economic climate, rather than because of rising service standards in banks. Yesterday's report uses the same data as the FPB's report last month, which indicated that small businesses believe banks are providing worse value for money now than they were four years ago.</p>

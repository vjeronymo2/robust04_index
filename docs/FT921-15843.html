			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Letter: Investment in industry Sir, Your leading article, 'Dividends in recession' (January 4), highlighted one of the most worrying features of British industry - the low level of investment in new plant and technology. You showed that a large proportion of my shareholders, the pension funds, only pay an effective rate of 13 1/3 per cent tax on the dividends we distribute. If we choose to retain some of this money in order to invest in plant and equipment, the same shareholders would effectively pay tax on those funds at a rate of 35 per cent, less the capital allowances - say a net 25 per cent. Institutions have been pressing companies to maintain dividends, even if profits are reducing. There is an obvious tax reason for this. Some rights issue proceeds may even have been used to maintain dividend payments. Meanwhile, our German competitors, under no such pressures, retain far more of their profits within their businesses, creating new technology and manufacturing capacity to enable them to increase their share of the British consumer markets. Should not Mr Lamont, the chancellor, and Mr Smith, the shadow chancellor, be addressing this absurd situation? Christopher Haskins, chairman, Northern Foods, Beverley House, Hull, E Yorkshire HU1 3XG</p>

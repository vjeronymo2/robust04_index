			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGHER RENTS, HOME PRICES PREDICTED;  </P> <P> S&amp;L BAILOUT BILL IS THE CULPRIT, LOAN OFFICIALS SAY  </P> <P> A sharp reduction in the development of new apartments will probably be the  most immediate effect of the savings-and-loan bailout bill approaching passage  in Congress. But the more lasting and broadly felt result could be to make  mortgage loans and single-family houses more expensive.  </P> <P> So say executives at Home Federal Savings and Great American Bank, two San  Diego-based S&amp;Ls that are heavily involved in real estate development as  well as lending, principally in San Diego County. The executives praised the  $166-billion S&amp;L rescue bill as long overdue but warned that its  consequences would generally not be happy ones for housing consumers.  </P> <P> Both Roger Lindland, president of Great American Bank, and Jack Roach, chief  operating officer of Home Federal's development arm, said they will cut their  apartment lending activities because new risk-based capital requirements in the  bailout bill will make the loans less profitable. And they expect others in the  industry to follow suit.  </P> <P> Fewer new apartment projects, in a market such as San Diego where an  ever-increasing population is finding housing increasingly unaffordable,  translates into a higher demand-supply imbalance and therefore higher rents  "down the road," Roach said.  </P> <P> Moreover, both executives predicted in interviews that the bill's disincentives  for S&amp;L development activities will eventually cut the supply of housing  and mortgage money, reductions that will increase housing costs.  </P> <P> Generally speaking, housing finance will become more scarce once the S&amp;L  shakeout is complete, simply because the consolidation of the S&amp;L industry  will leave fewer loan sources for consumers and less competition, Lindland  said.  </P> <P> Although the $166-billion bailout bill has not yet been passed into law,  observers expect the version hammered out by House and Senate negotiators last  week to stay largely intact. That version imposes strict new capital  requirements that force S&amp;Ls to have much more cash equity on hand to  cushion the government from liability for riskier loans.  </P> <P> The new bill also assigns tougher capital requirements for certain kinds of  loans. For example, the new bill classifies apartment loans in the riskier  commercial loan category, which means lenders will have to keep as much cash  equity set aside -- up to $8 for each $100 loaned -- as it would for an office  or retail building.  </P> <P> The new provision dims the appeal of apartment lending considerably, Roach  said, because the higher capital requirement will reduce the S&amp;L's rate of  return. In the past, S&amp;Ls could make apartment loans as long as the S&amp;L  had the regulatory minimum of 3% equity as a percentage of assets.  </P> <P> Even if the S&amp;Ls choose to set aside the added capital for apartment loans,  they will be more restricted in how much of their loan portfolios are devoted  to apartment loans. In the past, apartment loans were lumped together in the  home mortgage loan category, which under old rules could constitute up to 60%  of an S&amp;L's loan portfolio.  </P> <P> In effect, S&amp;Ls could make up to 60% of their loans to apartment developers  as long they met the 3% minimum regulatory capital requirement.  </P> <P> Now, with apartments reclassified as commercial loans, S&amp;Ls will be  permitted to have only 30% of their loans in commercial projects including  apartments, with 70% in single-family residential loans or residential mortgage  securities. The lower apartment loan ratio, coupled with higher capital  requirements, will translate into higher apartment development costs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Will Force Change  </P> <P> Roach said the bill is designed to either force S&amp;Ls out of real estate  development altogether or to force them to set up stand-alone subsidiaries over  a five-year period. The subsidiaries will constitute a "fire wall" between  development activities and government liability for insured S&amp;L deposits  that in the past were used to finance development, Roach said.  </P> <P> Most S&amp;Ls are expected to get out of real estate development altogether  because they will need all the cash capital they can muster to meet new and  tougher equity standards by 1994. Most S&amp;Ls will have little money left  over with which to capitalize the new development subsidiaries, Roach said.  </P> <P> Furthermore, the new rules will prohibit the development operations from  borrowing low-cost loans from the sister S&amp;Ls, forcing the S&amp;L  development arm to compete on an "even playing field" with other developers for  outside debt capital, said Stan Ross, co-managing partner of Kenneth Leventhal  &amp; Co., a Los Angeles-based accountancy and consulting firm.  </P> <P> Despite the disincentives, both Great American and Home Federal say they expect  to remain active in real estate development, probably through subsidiaries.  Home Federal in fact expects to form a new subsidiary within the next 30 days,  perhaps using $50 million available in its HomeFed Corp. parent company for the  initial capitalization.  </P> <P> Home Fed is an acknowledged leader among S&amp;Ls in real estate development,  according to analyst Gary Gordon of PaineWebber in New York. Home Fed's net  real estate development profit of $31 million in 1988 represented 28% of its  net income last year. Home Fed now has about $200 million in equity invested in  lots, apartments and houses.  </P> <P> Home Fed is confident it can attract equity partners and borrow sufficient  funds to keep its real estate development activities profitable under the new  rules, although probably not as profitable as in the past, Roach said.  </P> <P> Home Fed also has the luxury of having a surplus of capital relative to most  other S&amp;Ls, a surplus that it will be able to allocate to the new real  estate development entity if it so chooses. For example, Home Fed's tangible  net worth, or shareholder equity minus good will, is now 4.9% of assets, far  above the 3% minimum it will be required to have on hand by 1994.  </P> <P> Great American's tangible net worth, by comparison, is now 2.6% of assets,  meaning it will have to have to devote more resources to meeting minimum  capital requirements than Home Fed over the next five years. Lindland said  Monday that Great American is in no hurry to set up its development entity,  adding that it will be accomplished over the next three years.  </P> <P> Great American's profit from real estate development activities last year was  $26.1 million, more than half of its $49.4-million net income.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION GIRLS' SOCCER PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> CANYON FENDS OFF WOODBRIDGE IN OVERTIME, 1-0  </P> <P> Kim Campbell scored the only goal in Canyon High School's 1-0 overtime victory  overWoodbridge in the second round of the Southern Section 3-A girls' soccer  playoffs Wednesday.  </P> <P> By the time the second 10-minute overtime period began, Canyon had taken 15  shots on goal, and Woodbridge three.  </P> <P> Then, with only a few minutes left, Warrior goalie Michelle Helring slid out in  front of the ball, which bounced off of her and away. Fullback Deanna Doolittle  ran in to cover and struck the ball with an arm.  </P> <P> The sideline referee called a hand ball, and Campbell was awarded a penalty  kick. The freshman forward shot a perfect arc over Helring for the game's only  goal, and her 34th of the season.  </P> <P> Canyon (15-0-4) almost scored again a minute later, but forward Mary Wilson's  shot hit the top of the goal, and Kim Studley's shot off the rebound went way  over.  </P> <P> After the match, Woodbridge Coach William Bell was distraught about the call  that led to the winning goal, saying the call was too close to allow it to  decide a playoff game.  </P> <P> Asked if he had seen the touch, Bell said, "I saw touches and pushes the whole  game. Look, that's my opinion, and you know what everyone says about opinions.  They're an outstanding team. Our job was to shut them out until overtime, and  take it to a shoot out."  </P> <P> In other 3-A matches:  </P> <P> Mater Dei 4, Long Beach Poly 0 -- Mater Dei (22-2) held Long Beach Poly to five  shots and goalie Julie Tarney got her 19th shutout of the season. Katie Ward,  Robyn Camarillo, Kim Conter and Amber Escobedo scored for Mater Dei, which led,  2-0, at halftime.  </P> <P> Troy 3, Buena 1 -- Jenny Scanlon scored all three goals to lead visiting Troy  (15-3-3). It was the seventh time this season that Scanlon has scored three or  more goals in a game.  </P></p>

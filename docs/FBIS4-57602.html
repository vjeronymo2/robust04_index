			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 20 May (DPA) -- Today, Manuel Garcia  Lizardo, president of the Central Electoral Board (JCE) warned  the board has not yet officially announced any of the candidates  as the winner of the recent election. He explained that they  must wait for the computer technicians to complete their work.  The specialists are evaluating a claim made by the Dominican  Revolutionary Party (PRD) regarding differences between official  JCE reports and the results offered to the parties on diskette.  The investigation reportedly began yesterday following a  resolution issued by the JCE itself.    Garcia Lizardo said he was unable to give a specific date  for  the announcement of the winner, but stressed that he would try  to make it as soon as possible. Last night, the JCE issued the  last official bulletin detailing the presidential vote tallying  process. There are still 233 voting tables yet to be tallied,  and it was reported that it will still be a while before those  results are in.    The JCE president announced that next week, the board would  decide on the many claims presented at the JCE "so everything is  out in the open." He said the members of the JCE would soon be  meeting to decide on all of these petitions.    The Board is currently considering a request by the PRD for  copies of the lists used at the voting tables on election day to  compare the lists with each of the tally sheets and then the  official results issued by the JCE. The board also must review  the charges filed against two of the board's magistrates, who  the PRD has accused of having acted in favor of the ruling  Social Christian Reformist Party (PRSC). The magistrates are  Leonardo Matos Berrido and Jose Henriquez Almanzar.    There is a petition outstanding with the board filed by the  "Committee of Witnesses of the Civil Pact" for a review of each  of the individual voting table tally sheets filed during the  election. The committee, known also as the "civil pact follow up  committee," is made up of renowned Dominican figures, among whom  are German Ornes and Rafael Herrera, the directors of the EL  CARIBE and LISTIN DIARIO newspapers; Bishops Agripino Nunez  Collado and Jose Arnaiz; and Former Chief Justice Manuel Berges  Chuppani of the Supreme Court of Justice.</p>

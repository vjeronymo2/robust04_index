			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Arts (Openings): London, Frankfurt, Paris 'The Ring' dominates the opera programme in three major European cities this week, and the wonder is that there are enough Wagner singers to go round. Frankfurt begins the first of three complete cycles tomorrow, in the staging by Herbert Wernicke first seen in 1991 in Brussels. The conductor is Sylvain Cambreling. London and Paris are tackling the tetralogy in two instalments. The Royal Opera's production, conducted by Bernard Haitink and staged by Richard Jones, starts with 'Das Rheingold' on Thursday and 'Die Walkure' on Friday. The Chatelet in Paris completes its 'Ring' with 'Siegfried' on Friday and 'Gotterdammerung' on Sunday, in the Jeffrey Tate-Pierre Strosser production which opened in June.</p>

			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Hong Kong Invest doubles asset value Net asset value of the Hong Kong Investment Trust doubled to 44.41p per ordinary share at the half year to December 31 from 22.4p a year earlier, making HKI the top performing ordinary share in the investment trust sector in terms of net asset value. At the June year end the asset value was 36.1p. The board said that the increase in total assets reflected investment manager's outperformance of the Hang Seng Index as well as sterling's devaluation. Dividend and interest income rose from Pounds 95,254 to Pounds 298,582 and net revenue after tax came to Pounds 179,406 (Pounds 31,925 losses) in the period. Earnings per share were 0.9p (0.16p losses). An interim dividend of 0.75p has been declared which, the board said is not comparable to the previous year as the scheme of reorganisation changed the revenue profile of the company and no interim dividend was paid.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Nikica Valentic, the prime minister of the Croatian  Government, had talks with Edib Bukvic, deputy prime minister of  the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government. Following their talks behind  closed doors they talked to our reporter Maja Sever.    [Begin recording] [Sever] Mr Bukvic, I ask for a brief  statement for Croatian TV. What is the reason behind your visit  and the issues raised at your meeting?    [Bukvic] Well, the reason is clearly the implementation of  the agreement on the federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the  resolving of the problems accumulated in the period of blockade  between the two republics -- the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina  and the Republic of Croatia. Mr Valentic and I discussed how to  solve some economic problems regarding ownership rights,  communications, traffic, deposits, visas etc. I believe we are  on the right path to solve these problems and there is a high  degree of desire to solve the problems to mutual satisfaction.    [Sever] Mr Valentic, has any agreement been reached?    [Valentic] Mr Bukvic said we are dealing with the  implementation of the economic aspect of the Washington  agreement. Normalization has already started. It is of  particular importance to have roads opened and to restart the  flow of goods and people. I believe, in this respect, we have  already taken the first steps.    It is a very important fact that we have agreed that we are  going to speed up the work of the mixed economic commission,  comprising representatives of Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and  Iran -- something that was agreed in Teheran. Hence, firms from  Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina will be able to jointly approach  third countries, particularly Islamic countries where  large-scale investment projects are about to take place. Here  we see a great chance for our firms, something that will, on the  one hand, consolidate our relations and, on the other,  consolidate the standing of both Croatian and Bosnia-  Herzegovina firms.

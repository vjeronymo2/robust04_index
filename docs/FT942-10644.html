			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Jobs warning in Whitehall reorganisation Several thousand civil service jobs could be lost as part of a shake-up of the Department of Transport, a leading civil service union said yesterday. A plan announced yesterday to make 20 per cent efficiency savings at the department, which employs 15,500 people centrally and in executive agencies, 'could not be carried out without chopping significant numbers of staff,' said Mr John Higgins of the IPMS civil service union. Several thousand jobs could be at risk in departments such as the coastguard agency and the vehicles inspectorate, leading to a threat to public safety, he added. The department said that job losses would be necessary, although it declined to specify how many. Efficiencies are to be achieved by a combination of job losses, office closures and a streamlining of the department's activities. Reductions at a senior level will include abolition of one of the department's four posts of deputy secretary and four of its 17 undersecretaries. Two new groups will be established in August with responsibility for transport infrastructure and urban transport and for transport operations. They will replace three groups which concentrate on public transport, roads and aviation, and shipping and international matters. A third new group will have responsibility for questions which cut across different issues such as the environment and safety. Mr MacGregor said the changes would allow the department to take a more strategic approach to transport issues and enhance its case for remaining a separate department. He added: 'We are at the forefront of very big policies and carry through massive infrastructure programmes.' The streamlining of the department has been brought about by hiving off many of its activities into independent agencies and by the privatisation of British Rail. Motorway service areas will have to provide picnic sites and free access for mechanics and motoring organisations to repair vehicles, according to new Department of Transport guidance to planning authorities.</p>

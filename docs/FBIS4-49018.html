			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Li Niangui (2621 1628 6311) and Chu Baoping </F> (2806 0202 1627)]    [Text] Beijing, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- Today, Li Ruihuan,  member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing  Committee, cordially met with 95 representatives of national  model workers who had arrived in Beijing for "May 1st"  celebrations, and had a group photo taken with them to mark the  occasion.    Li Ruihuan delivered an important speech during the meeting.  First of all, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the  State Council, he paid high tribute to the model workers at the  meeting, and extended season's greetings to workers, peasants,  intellectuals, and the working masses of all nationalities on  all fronts across the country!    Li Ruihuan said: Marxism's maintaining labor is of the  utmost importance. Labor creates the world, social wealth, and  a happy life, and promotes the progress of the civilization of  mankind. Fundamentally speaking, all advanced systems and  policies are formulated for the purpose of encouraging and  protecting people's honest, vigorous, and creative labor. Model  workers are outstanding representatives of laborers. The model  workers' advanced thinking and splendid deeds carry forward the  traditional virtues of the Chinese nation, make clear to all the  course for the era to forge ahead on, should be commended by the  party and government and respected by all walks of life, and  should become examples for all the people across the country to  learn.    Li Ruihuan pointed out: China's reform, opening up, and  modernization have entered a new phase. "Seizing the  opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting  development, and maintaining stability" constitute the overall  situation of our work in the country. The destiny of China's  working class has always been closely interrelated to that of  the party and state. The party and government believe the broad  masses of staff and workers will conscientiously subordinate  themselves to and serve [the needs of] this overall situation,  properly do their duties in a down-to-earth manner, and give  full play to their role as the main force.    He said: No doubt, reform can benefit the overwhelming  majority of people, but it cannot benefit all the people at the  same time or to the same extent. At present, the improvement of  the living standards of some staff and workers and some of the  masses has been achieved at a slow pace and they have even  encountered some temporary difficulties due to various reasons.  Naturally, the party and government should be concerned with  them. As a mass organization of the working class and as a  bridge and link between the party and staff, workers, and the  masses, trade unions should treat representing and protecting  the interests of staff, workers, and the masses and helping them  solve problems encountered in their livelihood as their basic  responsibilities. Trade unions at all levels must carry forward  their fine traditions, frequently go deep into the realities of  life, maintain close links with the masses, pay more visits to  localities that encounter difficulties to appreciate their  situation, and call on more comrades who hold different opinion  to have a heart-to-heart talk with them and to offer them  services; they must enthusiastically and attentively listen to  the voice of the masses, understand their wishes, and report  problems accurately to the party and government departments in  good time; they must do solid work with all their heart and all  their might, continue to successfully carry out the project of  sending warmth to the masses, and help them solve difficulties;  and they must painstakingly do a good job of conducting  ideological work with patience, eliminate contradictions, boost  the morale of the masses, and win their understanding and  support.    Finally, Li Ruihuan said: Our great motherland has an  immeasurably bright future and we are full of confidence in our  future. Let us unite, work hard, surmount difficulties, and  continuously promote the great undertaking of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics under the leadership of the CPC  Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core.    Among the leading comrades participating in the meeting were  Li Lanqing, Wei Jianxing, Ni Zhifu, Chen Muhua, Lei Jieqiong,  Cheng Siyuan, Buhe, Peng Peiyun, Luo Gan, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme,  and Wan Guoquan.</p>

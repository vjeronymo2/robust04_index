			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Hurd to make statement on Pergau aid Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, will make a parliamentary announcement tomorrow on the recent High Court judgment outlawing aid for Malaysia's Pergau dam, amid indications that he will not appeal against the decision. Mr Hurd, due to make an announcement in a written or oral statement to the Commons, is thought unlikely to appeal because the judgment does not affect other development projects financed by the UK government. An application to the Court of Appeal for permission to change the ruling would have to be lodged by tomorrow at the latest. Whitehall officials have privately conceded in recent weeks, however, that such a move would be unlikely to succeed. An official said last week: 'The basis on which we would be likely to win the appeal would be that it was right to give aid to unsound projects. Politically, that is a very hard case to push for.' It has also become clear that dozens of projects in other countries financed by the Pounds 100m a year provided under the government's aid and trade provision scheme will not be deemed illegal under the High Court ruling. Labour MPs will this week press Mr Hurd to give an assurance that Pounds 35m of overseas aid money that has already been granted for the Pergau dam will be restored to the Overseas Development Administration's budget. They will also seek a guarantee that the remaining Pounds 170m, which Britain is contractually bound to give Malaysia over the next nine years, will come from other sources. Last month the High Court ruled that grants for the Pergau project were 'fatally flawed' because the project was 'economically unsound' and did not promote the development of a country's economy as required by trade laws. The High Court has amplified its ruling in a full written judgment which was delivered last week to the government and the World Development Movement, the aid pressure group which brought the action. According to Mr Ben Jackson, WDM's director, the full judgment specifies that the government must find the funds for the Pergau project from other sources. On the financial relief given to Malaysia, the court says that 'unravelling of some sort will be necessary, but the precise from of that unravelling is not a matter for the court'. The judgment also contains a statement from the Treasury solicitor, representing the government, that 'measures will have to be taken to deal with the unravelling of the consequences of the unlawfulness of the decision'.</p>

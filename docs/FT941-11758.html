			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Italian left clears first hurdle: Poll alliance formed but tough deal on candidates lies ahead Selecting candidates to contest Italy's general election next month is the main issue outstanding following agreement between eight left-wing groupings in forming a Progressive Alliance. The agreement, reached late on Tuesday, lays down the broad principles of an electoral programme. . As such it has become the first formal alliance for the elections on March 27. However, it will be severely tested as the members, dominated by the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), attempt to hammer out a deal on candidates. Under the country's new electoral laws, 75 per cent of the seats in both houses of parliament will be elected using a first-past-the-post system. Proportional representation is retained for the rest. The majority voting system has put a premium on forming alliances, but these will come to nothing if there is no prior agreement on supporting individual candidates. The Progressive Alliance is discussing a formula whereby each party or group will be allocated a quota of candidates entitled to the support of the alliance as a whole. These would be based on the performance of the party or group in the 1992 general elections, last year's municipal elections and opinion polls. However, the principle of quotas cannot be reconciled easily with the need to find the best local candidates. The alliance also has to resolve how its members will vote for the seats awarded by proportional representation. Apart from the PDS, Tuesday's agreement was signed by the Greens, Reconstructed Communism (the rump of the Italian Communist party who refused to renounce Marxist ideals), the Sicily-based clean government movement La Rete (The Network), the revamped Socialist party under Mr Ottaviano Del Turco, the Democratic Alliance that includes members of the reformist referendum movement, the Christian Socialists and a small left independent grouping. The document agreed is a five-page summary of policy guidelines for a future government which are deliberately vague but promise to retain the broad lines of the outgoing government's economic policy. Privatisation will continue 'where necessary'. Italy's inflation in January was running at 4.2 per cent on an annualised basis, a marginal rise on the December rate and against the declining trend projected by the government for 1994. The rise was attributed to petrol and electricity price increases.</p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Lord Rothschild links up with Wolfensohn MR JAMES Wolfensohn and Lord Rothschild, two of the world's best known financiers, are forming a European-based business to advise international companies on mergers and acquisitions. The new business, to be called J. Rothschild, Wolfensohn &amp; Co, will be owned in equal portions by James D Wolfensohn Incorporated, the New York-based corporate adviser, and J. Rothschild &amp; Co. The creation of the business, whose capital will be in 'the low few millions of dollars' according to Mr Wolfensohn, marks a return for Lord Rothschild to the business of advising companies on transactions. He has not been actively involved in corporate finance since he fell out with his cousin, Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, 12 years ago, and left his family's merchant bank, NM Rothschild. Mr Wolfensohn, who was born in Australia, controls one of New York's most profitable corporate advisory firms. Over the past couple of years, he has come to the view that his firm needed to 'expand its practice into Europe', he said. He has known Lord Rothschild for 25 years and mentioned his plan to him over dinner six months ago. Mr Wolfensohn said the venture had 'captured the imagination' of Lord Rothschild. He did not regard it as a drawback that none of Lord Rothschild's existing businesses are involved in giving advice on mergers and acquisitions to companies. Mr Wolfensohn said that there could have been problems in linking with a London-based merchant bank, because the interests of his clients and those of the merchant bank could have conflicted. Lord Rothschild said he was delighted Mr Wolfensohn had chosen London as the base for the new venture. 'It was touch and go whether it was set up in Frankfurt or London', he said. In the past two years, Wolfensohn Inc, whose chairman is Mr Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, has advised on corporate transactions with a value of Dollars 15bn. Mr Volcker will be chairman of the London-based venture. Lord Rothschild and Mr Wolfensohn will be vice-chairmen. About 10 executives will be recruited. In January, Lord Rothschild's new life assurance business, formed with Sir Mark Weinberg, began trading. Observer, Page 22</p>

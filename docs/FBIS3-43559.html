About 500 AZAPO central Wits  [Witwatersrand] region members also decided at a meeting in  Dobsonville, Soweto, that "hostile media" would be targeted and  that an anti-election drive would soon be started.    The meeting vowed to remove any NP or DP poster found in  black townships, saying that it was "undemocratic and  opportunistic for oppressors to organise among the oppressed  people of Azania". The DP and NP should put up their posters in  white areas, the meeting resolved. It was further decided that  the newly formed campaign committee would conduct  "house-to-house voter education" in Alexandra and Bekkersdal.    From next week the committee will also be visiting Lenasia,  Eldorado Park, greater Soweto, Mohlakeng, Kagiso to introduce  AZAPO's anti-election campaign. The region further resolved to  take "immediate action against hostile media... by all means  necessary". No specific newspaper or news organisation was  mentioned.    The meeting also called for the immediate release of all  detained Azanian Liberation Army cadres.</p>

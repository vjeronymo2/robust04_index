			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Clinton urges Congress to protect Moscow aid President Bill Clinton yesterday urged senior members of Congress not to cut off all aid to Russia, in response to the arrest in the US of a senior Central Intelligence Agency officer on charges of spying for the Russian intelligence service. Seeking to fend off calls for an immediate freeze of US assistance, Mr Clinton called Republican and Democratic leaders to the White House to persuade them that aid to Russia, for such as reducing nuclear weapons and promoting economic reform, remained in the US national interest. 'US support for reform in Russia does not flow from a sense of charity or blind faith. Our policy is based on our clear American interests, clearly pursued,' Mr Clinton said after the meeting. Although he won support for the argument that the US should not overreact to the spy incident, it was clear that the request for more Russian aid, in the US budget next year, is in trouble. 'Aid is largely symbolism, and cutting it off may well be the best symbolic message we could send,' a Congressional official said. Senior members of Congress are increasingly questioning not only the overall amount of aid to the states of the former Soviet Union but also the proportion that goes to Russia. 'While we all agreed that the spy incident would not, in and of itself, warrant reconsideration of aid, there are a lot of other things that do. The Russia-first policy, I think, is increasingly in disfavour in the Congress,' warned Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, senior Republican on the Senate committee controlling foreign aid spending. He had insisted, in the US budget negotiations last year, on a portion of the aid package going to Ukraine. That portion is expected to increase this year beacause of Ukraine's trilateral agreement, with the US and Russia, to give up the nuclear weapons on its territory.</p>

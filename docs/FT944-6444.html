			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Survey of Global Custody (4): Small investors offer big business potential - Retail financial products Looking after the funds of small investors is becoming increasingly big business for custodians as well as for organisations more directly involved in retail financial services. In the US, for example, the mutual fund industry had about Dollars 2,000bn in assets in 1993, compared with just over Dollars 1,000bn in 1990. More than one quarter of US households own a mutual fund. Within the UK market, sales of unit trusts were the striking feature of retail savings and investments last year. The unit trust industry attracted a record Pounds 9.14bn of net investment in 1993, and net sales of unit trusts for the first nine months of this year are higher - at Pounds 7.15bn  -than for the same period last year. Many UK investment managers say there is little difference between the services they require of a custodian for retail financial products compared with the characteristics they are looking for in a custodian for wholesale funds. 'There's no difference in pure custody terms,' says Anthony Myers, managing director of Gartmore's custody subsidiary. The factors he cites as important include the extent of the network run by the custodian; the way in which it runs settlement; its general efficiency and electronic capability; and how good it is at providing reliable intelligence on corporate action. The differences are, instead, in the additional services provided alongside custody. In the UK, financial regulation requires every unit trust to appoint an independent trustee to look after the interests of unit-holders. This function - which has no direct equivalent in other forms of investment - must be fulfilled by an organisation separate from the investment manager, and it is common for the role to be carried out by the custodian. So, in appointing a custodian, a UK unit trust manager will look also at the trustee services available. Recent changes in unit trust regulation, increasing the responsibilities of trustees could lead to some changes in trusteeship. At the beginning of November, the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator, replaced its list of approved securities and derivatives markets for unit trust purposes with a duty on managers to ensure that the markets where they invest meet certain criteria. The change allows unit trusts to invest in a much wider range of emerging markets, but puts a greater onus on the trustee - which some are reluctant to accept - as well as the manager. It could see trustee services move either in favour of the more broadly-based custodians, which can offer expertise on any given market. Alternatively, it could lead to fragmentation, so that a manager wanting to operate a fund in a particular market would go to a trustee with specialist knowledge of that area. In America, while no trustee function exists in respect of mutual funds, the additional services are similarly important in differentiating custodians. 'In the US market, what is most difficult and time-consuming is the daily pricing of the portfolio: not that many agents can do that as well as the auxiliary services, and by the time you include fund accounting as well, there are just a handful of custodian banks,' says Wendy LaBonte, director of mutual fund marketing for State Street Bank in the US. The US market is much more highly developed than the UK market in terms of the auxiliary services offered by custodians, but the UK market is moving in the same direction. Last year, SG Warburg set up a new service offering unit trust managers a combination of trusteeship and administrative services using a single database. It has been appointed to handle the administration of the new unit trust subsidiary to be launched in January by Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest; and also acts for the newly-created retail financial products subsidiaries of Leeds Permanent Building Society and for the retail products business of Invesco, the fund management group. Though that trend is growing, the impression is still that the banks are keener to provide the services than many UK investment institutions are to receive them. One senior figure in the UK market believes that the reason the market has not changed more quickly is that UK banks are 'probably a bit behind in technological development', and US banks do not have a large existing client base where they can sell the additional services. The argument for placing administration and custody functions with a third-party provider is that it reduces costs. Efficient management of custody and administration increasingly requires significant investment in technology which is much too large for all but the largest groups, and expensive even for them. But the dilemma for the investment institution is whether the third-party is really going to manage the task better, and how far the task lies within or beyond its core competences. 'It is hard to see a big insurance company not regarding information technology and relations with policy holders as a core part of its role,' one significant investment manager says. 'But a fund management organisation moving into retail services might take a different view.' Barry Beale, relationships director of Warburg's custody and investor services division, draws a distinction between Warburg's services which are related to the underlying assets and rely on the same database - such as portfolio administration - and those which are more outward-looking such as dealing and registration. It is up to the client institution to decide which facilities it wants, he emphasises. While the provision of extra services poses a question which will have different answers for investment institutions, for custodians the picture is more clearly positive: it is a way of getting further value out of information which they almost certainly have to have anyway, to carry out their basic functions. The extra services, then, are 'added value' both because they can provide added value to the client, and because they provide a further source of income in an aggressive market. 'Plain vanilla custody is very, very competitive,' says Mr Beale. 'It's very difficult to make a serious living out of it. You have always to be looking to add value.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SETTLEMENT INDEX Emerging markets  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Country     Volume (% of     Settling            Benchmark            total trades)     (% on SD)     Q2 94     Q3 94    % change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Argentina           5.58         68.57     75.77     74.45       -1.74 Brazil              9.83         94.23     89.66     92.16        2.79 Chile               0.08        100.00     95.07    100.00        5.16 Greece              2.63         44.30      4.31     19.85      360.56 India               2.98         24.23      6.04      1.03      -82.95 Indonesia           9.56         61.96     65.09     69.27        6.42 Korea               3.69         86.95     89.50     89.12       -0.42 Malaysia           29.06         69.93     71.67     77.17        7.67 Mexico             13.88         85.13     71.56     78.53        9.74 Portugal            3.00         97.09     94.37     97.57        3.39 Thailand           15.38         70.87     85.29     81.00       -5.03 Turkey              4.32         80.71     93.29     89.63       -3.92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * The purpose of the settlement benchmark is to provide a means of comparing the settlement efficiency of different markets and to track the evolution of settlement performance in individual markets over time. The benchmark incorporates the four components which, combined together, reflect the overall cost to market patricipants of failed trades. These include average trade size, local market interest rates, the proportion of trades that fail, and the length of time for which they fail. By converting information back into a base currency, comparisons between markets become possible. The benchmarks are expressed as a score out of a maximum 100. The lower the score the higher the effective operational costs of failed transactions in any given market.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: GSCS Benchmark  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

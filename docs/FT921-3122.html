			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / National Savings up Pounds 393m last month THE ROLE of National Savings as a source of government funding for the budget deficit doubled in the past year according to figures published yesterday. National Savings contributed Pounds 2.64bn in the first 11 months of the financial year, up from Pounds 1.24bn in the same period a year ago. There was a substantial increase last month, with National Savings contributing Pounds 393.2m to government funding, up from Pounds 334.7m in January. The best-selling product was, as in previous months, fixed-interest savings certificates, which contributed Pounds 198m net, but there was also a net addition of Pounds 82.4m from index-linked savings certificates. Four products - investment and ordinary accounts, and yearly and save-as-you-earn plans - reported a net withdrawal during the month. The rise in savings follows an advertising and marketing campaign by National Savings. Sales through the two main agents of National Savings, the Post Office and Girobank, increased in the wake of the campaign. The chancellor drew attention in the Budget last week to the important role that National Savings would play in helping fund the Pounds 28bn public sector borrowing requirement next year. He said he would launch a new National Savings product, a guaranteed growth bond, in the summer.</p>

CORFO [Production Development Corporation] Chairman Rene  Aveliuk said the issue took place in 1973, when the Arauco  Fishing Company, a CORFO branch which no longer exists, rented  Russian ships.    He said that the Chilean Government knows what to do over a  Russian Government demand for compensation.    [Begin Aveliuk recording, in progress] ... CORFO believes it  has absolutely nothing to do with them. This is obvious because  it was an associated enterprise, which is very different from  CORFO. Everything is over, concluded, and closed. This is what  we have said and this is what we will continue to say. [end  recording]</p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PLAY OF SPECIAL TEAMS COSTS VALLEY DEARLY IN 20-16 LOSS TO MT. SAC  </P> <P> One thing is for sure: The Valley College football team will be spending extra  practice time this week on kickoff returns.  </P> <P> Two crucial plays in a 20-16 loss to Mt. San Antonio College on Saturday night  made that much a certainty. They were two plays that might have been the  difference between losing and winning the nonconference opener.  </P> <P> Valley led, 10-6, at halftime but on the kickoff to begin the third quarter,  Eric Barber was stripped of the ball by Mt. SAC's Tahrell Miles at the Valley  28.  </P> <P> Four plays later, Ron Robins scored his second touchdown of the game on a  one-yard run to give Mt. SAC a lead it never relinquished.  </P> <P> The Mounties' lead appeared to last all of 15 seconds on the game clock, but  Lamark Allen's ensuing 96-yard kickoff return for a touchdown was nullified by  a clipping penalty.  </P> <P> Allen, a former Saugus High standout, took the ball at the four, broke several  tackles at the Valley 30, then sprinted down the left sideline for the apparent  go-ahead touchdown.  </P> <P> "That fumble and that penalty. Those two things killed us," Valley Coach Chuck  Ferrero said. "If we eliminate those, we win the game. It's a sick loss because  we lost on the kicking game.  </P> <P> "But I'm proud of this team. They played their hearts out."  </P> <P> Valley (6-4 last season) still had a chance to win in the final seconds, but a  last-ditch bomb by Trendell Williams (12 of 28 for 239 yards, one touchdown,  three interceptions) was intercepted by Leroy Johnson in the Mt. SAC end zone  with 17 seconds left.  </P> <P> Trailing, 20-10, Valley narrowed the deficit to four points when Williams  hooked up with Rodney Guy on an 86-yard touchdown play with 1:42 left.  </P> <P> Guy caught the pass at midfield, cut inside defensive back Charlie Hudson and  raced untouched into the end zone. The two-point conversion run failed.  </P> <P> The Mt. SAC defense accounted for the Mounties' final touchdown.  </P> <P> Linebacker Derek Dewitt batted a Williams pass, intercepted it, then rumbled 19  yards into the end zone with 13:18 to play.  </P> <P> Leonard Russell put in a stellar performance for Mt. SAC, rushing for 140 yards  in 26 carries, but his fumble led to Valley's first score, a 23-yard Jim Harper  field goal.  </P></p>

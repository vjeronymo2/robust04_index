			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Urban Development (9): Coventry infers political bias TALKS ON how to keep together the partnerships forged to support Coventry's City Challenge bid started within days of the government's notifying the city council in July that the bid had failed. Failure left council and community leaders angry. Mr Brian Clack, the council leader, wrote to Mr Robin Squire, a junior environment minister: 'Coventry is left to pull itself up by its bootstraps. It's done this before in a climate of hostility, now equalled by your government's attitude towards this city.' The bid had concentrated on the Foleshill and Hillfields districts on the northern side of the city centre, where male unemployment is over 30 per cent and the industrial base has steadily eroded. Housing conditions are the worst in Coventry, although most is in private hands. Over 40 per cent of the population is black, with Afro-Caribbeans concentrated in Hillfields and Asians in Foleshill. In addition to environmental and social improvements, the City Challenge plan explained how inward investment could be drawn in by the creation of new premises and rehabilitation of old, while training programmes would be mounted so that residents would be able to obtain the new jobs created. Four flagship developments would, as the City Challenge document put it, 'spearhead the regeneration strategy'. While the government liked the linking of inward investment to job opportunities, it felt, Mr Squire told the council, that 'some other aspects fell short of the very high standards of the winning bids'. In particular, his letter went on, 'there were still uncertainties over one of the flagship projects; and the management and delivery system needed further work.' The city council dismissed those criticisms as 'spurious', and claimed that the government was 'seeking to justify what is clearly a decision to favour other authorities on party political grounds to Coventry's detriment'. This was a reference to Walsall's success in City Challenge  - Walsall had turned Conservative at the last local government elections. Coventry council members fear that the funding options for urban regeneration are becoming more limited. Community leaders fear that the impetus towards a collective approach to, for example, improvement of poor housing areas may peter out. The first financial concern is the continued squeeze on local authority spending. For fiscal 1992-93, the city council cut Pounds 6.9m from its budget, to avoid poll-tax capping. It expects to cut probably a further Pounds 3m from the 1993-94 budget. Its capital spending is cash-limited by government restraint measures. During the current year, Coventry is receiving Pounds 4.65m from the government's urban programme. But next year it expects less, though it is not certain how much less. There are two points here. First: the overall size of the urban programme will not increase. Second: because the funds allotted to City Challenge come out of the urban programme budget, the more that is spent on City Challenge, the less there is for the authorities whose bids fail. The city council is also troubled by the fact that the task-force which has been operating in Foleshill and Hillfields is being withdrawn, and with it the funds which it has brought in: Pounds 6.4m since 1987. This money has levered in a further Pounds 6.7m from the private sector in a variety of schemes, ranging from training to the encouragement of new businesses. Yet Coventry is not without hope of government funding from outside the City Challenge scheme. At least two of the flagship projects would, in any case, have required City Grant and this may still be forthcoming.</p>

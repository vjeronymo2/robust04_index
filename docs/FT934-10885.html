			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Amber Day reduces deficit to Pounds 2.09m MR PETER CARR, chairman of Amber Day Holdings for just seven weeks, said he believed that the decks had been cleared in the results for the year to July 31. Pre-tax losses were reduced to Pounds 2.09m (Pounds 7.75m), despite exceptional costs totalling Pounds 8.99m. The exceptionals represented the costs of the withdrawal from non-core businesses and the settlement of contractual obligations to Mr Philip Green, the ex-chairman and chief executive who resigned in September 1992, and Mr Stacey Ellis, who resigned as non-executive chairman this August. The discount retailer has been dogged, Mr Carr said, by its past reputation, and the job of the new management team - which includes Mr Keith Paskins, finance director - was to 'change shareholders' fortunes'. However, there has been a 'significant' cut in the final dividend from 2p to 0.25p making a total of 1.35p (3.1p) for the year. The group has now stripped down to the What Everyone Wants retail chain which at July 31 was 52-strong but now numbers 56. Two more will open this month and a further six are planned for spring 1994. Mr Carr said the business plan he and Mr Paskins had drawn up showed that discount stores were the fastest growing retailing sector - at about 10 per cent a year. WEW's market share had been broadened by the recession as consumers had been forced to hunt for bargains. Its operating profits in the year rose from Pounds 10.1m (expanded by a Pounds 1m one-off profit) to Pounds 10.3m. Group turnover grew to Pounds 106.1m (Pounds 96.5m) with Pounds 1.53m from discontinued operations - the imports and distribution division and the mens wear side. The former accounted for trading losses of Pounds 2.37m and closure costs of Pounds 3.21m. The latter, sold in 1991, accounted for a further Pounds 3.32m of exceptional costs, and Mr Green and Mr Ellis were paid Pounds 1.13m and Pounds 500,000 respectively. Group operating losses before interest shrank to Pounds 1.35m (Pounds 6.91m) and the retained loss for the period came to Pounds 4.74m (Pounds 13m). Losses per share emerged at 2.72p (7.61p), though on continuing operations earnings would have risen to 3.89p (3.86p).</p>

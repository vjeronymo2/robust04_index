			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRUMP AND L.A. SCHOOL BOARD BATTLE OVER AMBASSADOR SITE  </P> <P> Lo and behold -- The Times' editorial ("The $64-Million Trump Question," May  26) certainly gave old Donald Trump a big hefty boost. Just think of the  prestige for Los Angeles if the tallest building in the world is built here.  </P> <P> The needs of a few families, their modest homes, low-rent apartments and small  businesses simply can't compare with the need for one of Donald's phallic  edifices.  </P> <P> Our youngsters deserve and need a new school. The Ambassador Hotel is the  perfect site to build for the future of our beleaguered children, who are tired  of riding long distances on buses to school every day. Marla Maples is not the  only one to get into bed with Trump. Shame, shame, Los Angeles Times!  </P> <P> AILEEN B. IANNUCCI  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

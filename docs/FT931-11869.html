			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Rastafarians not an ethnic group RASTAFARIANS do not constitute a separate ethnic group for the purposes of the Race Relations Act, the Court of Appeal has ruled. In a test case backed by the Commission for Racial Equality, the court ruled that a Rastafarian who was refused a van driver's job because he would not cut off his dreadlocks had not been discriminated against under the Race Relations Act. The CRE is considering an appeal to the House of Lords.</p>

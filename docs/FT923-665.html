			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Argentina to sell oil giant ARGENTINA'S Congress has approved the privatisation of the national oil company Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales (YPF) ending one of the most acrid political disputes since the adoption in 1989 of radical free market policies, John Barham writes from Buenos Aires. After more than a year of wrangling, the government won the vote only by distributing patronage and political favours in grand style. YPF is the largest company in Argentina - reporting 1991 sales of about Dollars 5bn - its oldest state company and the centre-piece of the state-controlled economy that the government of President Carlos Menem began dismantling after coming to office in 1989. Argentina will now become the first Latin country to sell its oil company, a move still resisted even by the free-market trailblazers, Chile and Mexico. Provincial governments will receive 39 per cent of YPF equity to cancel debts owed by the federal government and 10 per cent will be held in trust for the employees. Then, the government will begin selling off its 51 per cent stake in tranches on the local and international financial markets.</p>

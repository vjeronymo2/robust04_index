			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / TV soccer deal fails to trigger sales surge: FT Satellite Monitor SATELLITE dish installations rose by 58,000 in July, almost identical to the June figure, according to the latest FT satellite monitor. The figure represents modest underlying growth because sales usually drop in July compared with June. So far, however, the forthcoming exclusive satellite television coverage of Premier League football has not translated into a surge in dish sales. Although intentions by consumers to install a dish initially rose after the Premier League deal with the Sky Sports channel, 'the small rate of change in new installations does not, as yet, show any great conversion of this interest into sales,' said Mr John Clemens, chairman of Continental Research, which produces the FT monitor. A big promotional campaign, however, is due to begin later this week. The 58,000 increase in July takes the total of installations, including BSB and community aerials but excluding cable networks, to slightly more than 2.6m homes. In July there was a drop in the size of the potential market. The number of households saying they are in the market for a dish - definitely or probably - was 2.37m, compared with 2.53m in June and 2.26m in May. July's monitor also shows that the interest of the ABC1 social group in satellite TV at its highest level so far. The core market is still the C2s - skilled workers with children. The monitor is based on monthly interviews with more than 4,000 adults. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake in BSkyB, which broadcasts Sky Sports.</p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan holds up as returning bourses decline THE Whitsun holiday brought little vigour into returning bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. MILAN, open for the holiday weekend, took comfort from the Fiat results which were released after Monday's close, noting particularly that the cut in the dividend, to L100 for the ordinaries, was much in line with expectations. The shares rose L60 to L5,940 at the fix, before slipping further to L5,850 on the kerb. The Comit index rose 6.22 to 545.21. Many analysts see signs of recovery in Fiat, although not before 1994 when a new model line up is expected to come on stream. However, as NatWest Securities in London notes, with forecast annual spending of some L10,000bn on various projects the balance sheet will soon begin to look quite stretched: 'there are consequently rumours of an imminent sale of La Rinascente and/or other assets'. The day's other major development also had its origins after Monday's close: the surprise announcement that Mr Michele Tedeschi, managing director of IRI, the state holding company, was to be transfered to a similar position at Stet, the telecommunications subsidiary of IRI. The news was greeted positively as indicating that Stet will be restructured ahead of the privatisation of the sector. The shares fixed up L98 at L3,190 and at L3,210 on the kerb. PARIS saw a choppy day as the CAC-40 index moved between a day's low of 1,859 and a high of 1,876, before closing 15.90 lower at 1,872.80. There appeared to be no discernible reason for the trading pattern aside from technical factors on the futures exchange. Turnover was low at FFr1.5bn. Euro Disney fell FFr2.45 to FFr67.50, one explanation being that profits were being taken after recent gains. Eurotunnel went against the trend with a rise of 50 centimes to FFr25.70. FRANKFURT looked depressed as the DAX index dropped 11.96 to 1,619.89 in turnover of only DM3.5bn. The Bundesbank is not expected to cut key interest rates this week, and weekend comment pointed to the adverse reaction in the bond market. Saturday's arson attack on a Turkish home in Solingen was cited as another reason for the market's mood. A number of market leaders fell by 1 per cent or more including Mannesmann, which reported 1992 earnings down from DM14 to DM8 per share, and a dividend cut from DM9 to DM6. Balance sheet conferences are expected this week at Kaufhof, the retailer, and Philipp Holzmann, the construction group. Kaufhof, due today, fell DM11 to DM463. Holzmann, Germany's largest construction company, set its rights issue price at DM650 a share yesterday and, itself DM2 higher at DM975, figures in a bearish review of the industry's share price prospects from Merck Finck in Dusseldorf. Mr Horst-Kaspar Greven of Merck Finck acknowledges that the industry is booming. But, he says, share price valuations are 'exotic', prospects are likely to deteriorate, and share prices in the sector are likely to underperform in the coming months. ZURICH dipped on profit-taking in light volume, the SMI index closing 17.8 lower at 2,252.9. There were signs that the recent interest rate falls had come to a standstill. Among speculative stocks, Oerlikon-Buhrle bearers rose SFr12 to SFr535 after the Swiss government said that the company could go ahead with its planned sale of 60 PC-7 training aircraft to South Africa. AMSTERDAM was easier with Fokker providing the exception to the downward trend after announcing an order for five of its aircraft. Its shares gained 80 cents to Fl 14.80 on the news. The CBS Tendency index slipped 0.8 to 104.4. MADRID regained virtually all of the ground it lost on Monday, dealers noting that prices recovered late in the day after the US equity market made a good start. The general index rose 1.37 to 258.56. In a mixed banking sector, Argentaria fell Pta75 to Pta4,650 on rumours that its entry into the Ibex index might be delayed until December. BRUSSELS fell back slightly although activity was reported to have been low. The Bel-20 index lost 4.12 to 1,192.79 in low turnover of BFr590m. Solvay, the chemicals group, was one of the day's few gainers, rising BFr100 to BFr11,200 while most of the financial stocks eased. STOCKHOLM declined on profit-taking with the exception of Astra which saw a gain in the B shares of SKr1 to SKr751, helped by news over the weekend that its anti-ulcer drug may also be used successfully for the treatment of cancer. The Affarsvarlden general index fell 14.5 or 1.3 per cent to 1,082.5. Turnover declined to SKr752m from SKr1.06bn. Trelleborg, the mining group, continued to weaken, the B's down SKr5.00 to SKr46.50 after its announcement on Friday of severe losses for the first four months of 1993. COPENHAGEN slipped as the June future expired, the KFX index falling 1.13 to 83.87 in desultory turnover of DKr451m. Traders were hoping that tax reform negotiations, due to resume on Thursday, might breathe new life into the market. HELSINKI fell by some 2 per cent with the bulk of the declines coming in the industrial sector. The HEX index lost 25.4 to 1186.9 in thin turnover of just FM56.4m.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- June 1                                              THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                 Open       10.30      11.00      12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1157.12     1153.89    1153.33    1153.11 FT-SE Eurotrack 100         1152.20     1151.60    1153.10    1153.22  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                13.00       14.00      15.00      Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1218.32     1216.71    1215.53    1216.13 FT-SE Eurotrack 200         1214.96     1214.07    1215.04    1215.43  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        May 28    May 27    May 26    May 25    May 24  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1161.58   1165.01   1162.51   1164.13   1156.98 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1224.85   1231.31   1226.76   1224.18   1217.42  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1157.21; 200 - 1218.71 Low/day: 100 - 1151.34 200 - 1213.14.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

Shortly after President de Klerk and his press and party  entourage left the township, the men were stoned and security  sources said they had been removed to safety while negotiations  through the peace committee attempted to defuse the situation.    One of the victims was Mr Simon Maseko. All three men,  wearing NP paper caps, were waiting for President de Klerk's  arrival, and later spent some time talking to him before the NP  leader addressed a gathering crowd, mostly hostile ANC [African  National Congress] supporters. "They die tonight," one ANC  supporter was heard to say.</p>

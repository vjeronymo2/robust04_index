			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["The World Today" column by Ali Sirmen: "Righting a Wrong"] </F>   [Excerpts] It appears as though Foreign Ministry Under  Secretary Ozdem Sanberk's visit to Baghdad will constitute the  beginning of a process that will yield beneficial and  significant results for both countries. [passage omitted]    During the talks to be conducted with the Iraqi delegation  that will arrive in Ankara in the coming weeks, ways will be  sought to develop new relations between Turkey and Iraq,  beginning with the repair of the oil pipeline and the pumping of  the 12 million barrels of oil that are currently trapped in the  pipeline. This will not be in violation of the embargo but will  be pushing it to its limits.    There is no doubt that the UN embargo and the unchanged  attitude of the United States with regard to Saddam constitute  an obstacle to the development of these relations. To tell the  truth, however, Turkey's current economic situation does not  allow it to heed these objections. In any case, Ankara will not  violate the embargo but merely bend the rules to revive the  relations.    No one should be surprised if these initiatives meet with  objections. Given the events in Bosnia, it is also wrong to  think that the United Nations and Washington will not have the  boldness to oppose the development of our relations with Iraq.  Have there not been sufficient examples of double standards on  the part of the United Nations and the United States until now?    Turkey should now try to bring the miscalculation to the  attention of the whole world and explain to the Western  countries that Saddam is a reality that is here to stay, that  totally isolating Iraq and pushing it into a difficult situation  will not contribute to regional peace, and that fundamentalism  could spread into this region to fill any vacuum caused by  Saddam's overthrow.    Even if it does not solve Turkey's economic problems  entirely, the development of relations with Iraq could  contribute positively to overcoming the economic crisis.  [passage omitted]    In brief, the process started with Sanberk's visit is  important enough to constitute the first steps of righting a  wrong, as long as it is well appraised and the necessary  determination is demonstrated.</p>

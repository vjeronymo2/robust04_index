			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / High political price of partnership: Scandinavian divisions over EU entry Swedes are not given to hyperbole, least of all Swedish diplomats. But no one in Stockholm thought it was out of place on Sunday night when Ms Anita Gradin, ambassador to Austria and soon to be the country's first European commissioner, declared: 'Sweden is writing history tonight. This is the most important decision we in Sweden have taken in the post-war period.' By voting to join the European Union, Sweden and Finland (which held its referendum last month) have cemented a profound change of direction that will affect their strategic allegiances, political alliances and economic development. However, the subdued countenance on Sunday evening of Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the Swedish prime minister who battled hard to achieve the 52.2 per cent to 46.9 per cent Yes victory, reflected the defensive mood in which both Sweden and Finland (which voted 56.9-43.1) have embraced EU membership. A similar mood can be detected in Norway, where uncertainty surrounds the outcome of its referendum on EU entry in 13 days. The Nordic countries may be on their way into the heart of Europe, but a large proportion of their people remain hostile to - or at least sceptical about - EU membership. The move to join the EU came relatively recently. As late as 1990, Mr Carlsson continued to hold his Social Democratic party back from abandoning its traditional opposition to membership. A year later, with recession looming and the end of the cold war removing a vital obstacle to neutral Sweden's participation in the EU's political structures, Mr Carlsson abruptly swung the party in favour of joining. The application for membership lodged by Sweden prompted a similar move by Finland which was afraid of being left behind on the fringes of Europe. It also saw an historic opportunity to cement its position in the west while Russia was in disarray following the collapse of the Soviet Union. In Norway, Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Labour prime minister, also judged that the applications by Sweden and Finland gave the political impetus needed for an attempt to overturn the Norwegian rejection of membership in 1972. In Sweden and Finland, a majority of voters has now accepted the case for membership made by the mainstream political, business and labour establishments - accepting the move from neutrality towards European security structures, from small-nation independence to political co-operation, and from self-sufficiency to economic integration. But the pattern of voting showed the divisions created by the referenda in Sweden and Finland. Most striking was the way southern, urban areas voted Yes and the less-populated rural and northern areas voted firmly No. In Sweden, most regions voted No. Majorities for entry came only in the heavily populated areas around the three main cities - Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmo. For Mr Carlsson, there were other worrying features. Opposition to change among first-time voters was higher than might have been expected from young people. There was also strong opposition from women, who are heavily employed in Sweden's generous welfare system which they fear is under threat from EU membership. And some 45 per cent of those supporting Mr Carlsson's Social Democratic party voted against membership. Those who voted Yes were mainly higher-income supporters of right-of-centre political parties, such as the conservative Moderate party led by Mr Carl Bildt, the former prime minister. It is the better-off who expect to gain most from EU membership. In other words, what might be described as the most characteristically 'Nordic' part of the electorate - those dependent on the welfare state and those outside the big cities - rejected membership. They rallied instead to the No campaign led by a minority of the Social Democratic party leadership and two small parties, the Left party and the Environmental party. Mr Carlsson's pro-EU campaign argued mmbership would give Sweden the economic stability needed to correct the huge imbalance in public finances and help the battle against unemployment - now 13 per cent of the workforce. He rejected the No campaign argument that EU membership would erode the welfare state. But if the economic fruits of membership do not come through quickly, the split in the Social Democratic party over the EU could widen and become a long-term problem - not unlike the difficulties over Europe Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, has experienced in his Conservative party. A similar pattern can be seen in Finland's vote for EU membership. Mr Esko Aho, the prime minister who led the successful campaign to join the Union, has had to deal with a bitter internal battle in his rurally-based Centre party, split by fierce opposition to EU membership from farmers. The party, suffering also the political consequences of having led the government through a deep recession, is now expected to lose power to the opposition Social Democrats in next March's general election. Norway's Mrs Brundtland also presides over a party that is split on the EU issue. She knows that if she wins a Yes in Norway, the country will, like Sweden and Finland, be divided geographically and politically. If Norway votes No, however, a wider divide will open between Scandinavian neighbours that have long sought to stay in step with one another. The Nordic move into the EU is, indeed, a historic move. But forging a new relationship with Europe looks likely to impose a steep price on the politicians who have led the campaign for EU membership.</p>

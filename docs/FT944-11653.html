			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Milk board spins off cattle breeding division Genus, the cattle breeding, farm management and animal health division of Britain's Milk Marketing Board was spun off as a separate company this week following the de-regulation of the milk market. The company's Pounds 23m in net assets has been distributed to dairy farmers who sold milk to the board between 1992 and 1993. Mr John Craven, chief executive, said the company was facing tougher competition in its core market of providing artificial insemination for beef and dairy herds following the relaxation of Ministry of Agriculture rules. This has allowed smaller operators to undercut prices. 'We clearly have to concentrate on being more efficient and giving better value for money,' Mr Craven stressed. Genus had a turnover of Pounds 51.6m with profits of Pounds 4.8m last year. Mr Craven said that the next couple of years would see the completion of the company's six-year breeding programme, which is aimed at providing high quality semen to farmers as a replacement for imported material. The company currently imports two-thirds of the semen used for inseminating cattle, but Mr Craven said he hoped to halve this over the next two years. In its breeding programme, to improve the genetic bank on offer, Genus concentrates on animals that yield a higher proportion of protein to fat in their milk as well as strong cows with good legs and feet. The company expects its new commercial status will see growth in its farm management business, animal health services and the sale of branded products.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, chief of the </F> Palestinian negotiating delegation to the Cairo talks, in Cairo,  by Sa'id Mu'addi, in the studio; date not given; from the "With  the Events" program--live or recorded]    [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, good evening.    [Sha'th] Good evening, Sa'id.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, has the Palestinian side received an  Israeli reply to the Palestinian proposals on the number of  Palestinian policemen and international observers who will enter  Hebron?    [Sha'th] We have not yet received any replies on these  figures. All that we have received is the telephone  conversation which Major General Shahaq held with me. He told  me that he will lead the Israeli delegation that will come to  Cairo tomorrow in order to complete the talks on Hebron  security. Shahaq said: It is better for us to bring our  information to Cairo in order to complete this instead of  conveying it via telephone or fax.    Naturally, we understand this, but we hope that the Israeli  delegation will bring something that will enable us to achieve  security in Hebron as a prelude to achieving security for all  Palestinian citizens in the occupied Palestinian territory.  This is the path that will allow the completion of negotiations  on Gaza and Jericho. If this does not happen, we will not have  learned anything from the hard lesson represented by the Hebron  massacre. This lesson requires us to emphasize measures that  will prevent the recurrence of such massacres.    As you know, the situation in Hebron has been extremely  tense  since the massacre. Thus, we cannot delay the implementation of  the Palestinian measures represented by the Palestinian police  force, and the UN measures, represented by the international  observers, as well as the Israeli measures, whose implementation  is urged, in order to provide security for the Palestinians in  Hebron and other territories. This is an important and vital  issue, and I hope the Israeli delegation will bring a reply on  this issue.    [Mu'addi] In your conversation with Maj. Gen. Shahaq, did  you feel that there were positive signs and that it is possible  to achieve an agreement tomorrow on the security arrangements in  Hebron?    [Sha'th] I have not received any clear information, apart  from what I have said. It all depends on what the Israeli  delegation brings tomorrow, which, I hope, will be positive. I  also hope that the Israeli cabinet has decided on something that  will respond to the Palestinians' security needs, particularly  in Hebron. This will open the way for the completion of  negotiations. Without this, we will spend the whole time in  Cairo on Hebron security.    [Mu'addi] The PLO has demanded the deployment of Norwegian,  Egyptian, Russian, and U.S. observers. Has Israel agreed on  this demand?    [Sha'th] As was published and said, Israel is now supportive  of deploying international observers in Hebron in implementation  of Security Council Resolution 904, which provides for deploying  these observers in all occupied Palestinian territories in order  to provide security for the Palestinians in these territories.    Naturally, we agree on the Norwegian observers without  reservations; they sponsored the peace process, and they are  still making great efforts to maintain this process. We,  however, want the important states--which are participating in  the peace process and supporting both the Palestinian police and  the coming Palestinian authority; namely, the donors [preceding  word in English], including, of course, the cosponsors of the  peace process, Russia and the United States, and also Egypt,  which is playing an important role in the peace process, as well  as Norway and other European states--to support both security  and peace, and this is the reason why we proposed these  particular states.    [Mu'addi] When will the vanguards of the Palestinian  policemen arrive in Hebron, Jericho, and Gaza?    [Sha'th] Once there is agreement on the measures on Hebron  security, the Palestinian police and the international observers  will immediately move to Hebron. A few days after we begin the  Gaza-Jericho negotiations, the vanguards of the Palestinian  police will head for Gaza and Jericho.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, the last question is: Has the  Palestinian side received a reply on your proposal to the  Israeli side on repatriating Mustafa al-Natshah, the former  mayor of Hebron?    [Sha'th] This issue has not yet been discussed, and no  specific names have been proposed. Mustafa al-Natshah, also  known as Abu-'Umar, is necessarily the elected mayor of Hebron,  and thus he carries popular and electoral weight. This issue,  however, has not yet been discussed on the negotiating table.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, in Cairo, thank you very much.    [Sha'th] Thank you.</p>

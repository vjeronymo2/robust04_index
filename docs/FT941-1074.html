			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / FT Fashion Guide (8): How to avoid being a fashion victim - Avril Groom chooses four catwalk themes that are wearable and that will not look out of place in the average wardrobe / This spring's winners If you are a late and disorganised shopper, relax. The next time a smug assistant tells you that the best styles have already sold out, have pity for the early birds who bought them. They will have perused the trend reports and made their decisions on immediate reactions to the clutter of ideas thrown up by the catwalk shows. You, by contrast, can sit back and see which ideas work in real life. These are not necessarily the ones which cause the initial fuss. Choose from the ideas that really sell and you will stay the right side of the fine line that divides the fashionably smart from the fashion victim. Only some ideas cross the divide between catwalk and closet. Each season only a few themes influence the market and it can take the more conservative outlets a year to join the bandwagon. Here are this spring's winners, the four looks that update the wardrobe without taking it to extremes, and which are wearable enough for the commercial version to be very close to the catwalk one. Fashion has rarely been so pared-down, simple and uncompromisingly modern. Corresponding to this lack of detail, cut has never been so important. At whichever price level you look, shape and fabric are overriding priorities. THE SOFT SUIT If you own a jacket with shoulderpads get them removed. Designers showed the soft jacket with the short A-line skirt but it works equally well with wide trousers or a long bias-cut skirt. With a short skirt, a long jacket gives a graceful, flared silhouette; a short jacket cuts the outline in half. Look for silk, floppy viscose, double chiffon, mixes with linen that maximise softness and minimise creasing. THE SLIP DRESS A cheap slip dress risks looking like the nightie that some of them are. So choose one with a structured bodice and, if in the lightest fabric, double layers. Designers showed these tiny dresses one over the other, or over a plain white vest. Come summer, it stands alone as a fetching evening or sundress. Avoid grunge or schoolgirl caricatures. NEUTRAL LAYERS The look which Giorgio Armani has been promoting for years finally takes off. This casual style is a new take on deconstructionism, in soft but coarse-woven beige, cream or white, mixing textures, stripes and checks. The ethnic mood means anything goes on lengths - tunics, jackets and waistcoats hang one below the other, over baggy trousers or long sarong skirts. Jewellery - big and ethnic this summer - will look right with these styles. METALLICS Space Age silver, which made catwalk headlines, has been embraced by the young and can work, in small doses, for anyone. It provides a touch of the unexpected - a counterpoint to tweed or pinstripe or, a la Chanel, shrouded under chiffon. In the more obvious context of evening wear, metallics work best as simple shapes and soft fabrics - pale gold or dulled silver chiffon, organza or satin.</p>

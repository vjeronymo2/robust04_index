			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MEETING IN SEASON BASEBALL OPENER TAKES EDGE OFF USD-SDSU RIVALRY  </P> <P> Tonight's 60th game between the San Diego State and University of San Diego  baseball teams will be more like a spring training affair than a long-standing  rivalry.  </P> <P> When the teams play at 5 p.m. at San Diego State's Smith Field, it will be the  first time either has opened its season with the other. And at this stage,  players are still working into shape.  </P> <P> "We've played one scrimmage and the alumni game, and that's not really enough  to get a handle on it," USD Coach John Cunningham said. "You like to play a few  practice games in January before you get into the regular season. The guys are  anxious to get out to see what we can do against other people."  </P> <P> San Diego State, ranked 15th nationally by Baseball America, leads the series  35-23-1. But a rivalry that has been spirited over the years is diluted because  of the opening-season date and the importance of conference play later.  </P> <P> "You approach it like your season opener whether it's San Diego State or a  Division III opponent or an NAIA school, it doesn't make any difference,"  Cunningham said. "The first game, you don't know how anybody is going to react.  It's opening day jitters whether you're a senior or a freshman.  </P> <P> "I don't know if you can say the rivalry is as intense as when we were  independent, and they were Division I and we were Division II. We both have our  own conferences, and that's what we're getting ready for. But I'm sure we both  would like to win, that's why we play."  </P> <P> Cunningham, in his 26th year at USD, has 18 lettermen back from a 28-28 team  that finished fourth (9-14) in the West Coast Athletic Conference and has a  solid infield returning.  </P> <P> The real story for Cunningham is finding replacements for three departed 4-year  starters. Lost are catcher Dave Rolls, last year's WCAC co-player of the year,  first baseman Sean Baron and outfielder Mark Trafton. They combined to hit .358  with 146 runs, 164 runs batted in, 41 doubles, 9 triples and 32 home runs.  </P> <P> "Those three hold virtually every offensive record we have," Cunningham said.  "They are probably three of the finest players we've ever had at one time for a  4-year period. That's what is kind of exciting about this club. We have six  3-year starters . . . they've been playing second fiddle to those three guys  who graduated."  </P> <P> Among those are team captain Andy Roberts at third, Chris Bwy at second and  Chuck Graham. Graham, scheduled to catch this season, injured his knee and will  be the designated hitter. Sean Gousha, a freshman from Orange Glen High School,  will catch.  </P> <P> Across town, San Diego State Coach Jim Dietz, in his 17th year, returns a  veteran team after gong 47-18-1 to win the Western Athletic Conference regular  season championship (21-6) but failing to be recognized for an NCAA tournament  spot.  </P> <P> The NCAA said the Aztecs had a weak schedule, so Dietz went out and beefed it  up to include games against three teams that played in last spring's College  World Series (Fresno State, Fullerton State and Florida) and just one Division  II opponent (UC Riverside).  </P> <P> The biggest loss was shortstop Steve Montejano, a 4-year letterman who was a  first-team all-WAC selection.  </P> <P> Offensive returners include batting leader Harry Henderson (.391 average),  outfielder Jeff Barry (.316, 35 stolen bases in 39 attempts) and third baseman  Lance Pinnell (.323, 46 RBI, 11 doubles).  </P> <P> Eight returning pitchers accounted for 45 of the Aztecs' victories and all 12  of the team's saves last year, posting an era of 3.95.  </P></p>

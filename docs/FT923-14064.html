			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Sunday trading The stock market has never been sure whether to take the Sunday trading issue seriously. One day there may be an argument for doing so, but yesterday's non-binding opinion from the advocate-general of the European Court should be treated strictly as a non-event. What matters is what the European judges decide in the autumn, and that for now is anybody's guess. Most of the time they follow the advocate-general's lead - but in the three previous cases on Sunday trading, they have perversely gone the other way. The indications anyway are that the government has virtually made up its mind and will table some sort of compromise legislation once the European judgment is out of the way, but before the second reading of a Keep Sunday Special-inspired private member's bill in January. On past parliamentary experience, the outcome is uncertain - but investors should hardly be holding their breath. In the present uncertain situation there is doubtless some advantage for Tesco opening its doors if Marks and Spencer stays shut. Come the day the law is clear, the advantage of using assets more intensively is likely to be offset by higher costs. The out-of-town DIY merchants possibly apart, it looks at best like a zero sum game.</p>

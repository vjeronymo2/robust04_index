			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Business and the Environment: How green is my superstore? - Shopping can be a waste of energy The concept of 'environmental architecture' has invaded architectural and development offices around the US, although developers, architects and environmentalists disagree over what the term really means. To some, the concept involves buildings which use recycled materials and contain energy-saving features. To others, it has far more to do with a building's location. Wal-Mart, one of the largest retail groups in the US, has somehow landed at the centre of the debate. A few months ago, the successful discount chain opened a new store, dubbed the Eco-Mart, in Lawrence, Kansas. The store incorporated a number of innovative ideas, including an air-conditioning system which uses no CFC-based refrigerants, a solar-lit sign at the entrance, an environmental education centre and a community recycling centre. Even the car-park was paved with recycled asphalt. Not all environmentalists are convinced that the Eco-Mart is a positive trend. Activists in the state of Vermont, for example, are opposing the construction of Wal-Marts on the outskirts of two communities on the grounds that their very presence is anti-environmental. At the heart of the controversy is environmentalists' fear that the new stores will add to city sprawl and increase Vermonters' dependence on their cars. 'It does no good to call a building 'energy-efficient' if people have to expend a lot of energy to get there,' says Gerald Tarrant, the lawyer for the citizens group opposing the construction of the Wal-Mart in the town of Williston. Some ecologists, however, laud Wal-Mart's decision to build an environmentally sensitive prototype. 'We would prefer to see the Wal-Marts located on other sites, but you can't just throw up your hands and say you don't want to work with any groups which locate outside city centres,' says Meredith Miller, senior programme manager at the Center for Resource Management, an environmental group which advised Wal-Mart on the project. 'At least it's a step in the right direction. They set an example for other retailers to follow.' The Wal-Mart chain is bearing the brunt of growing frustration at the rapid multiplication of shopping malls in the US. 'Environmentalists have been slow to pick up on the issue of sprawl, but they are beginning to realise this is fundamental to the preservation of natural areas,' says Stephen Young, Vermont state representative for the National Audubon Society, the environmental advocacy group. 'The best friend to the countryside is a strong, dense city or village centre.' The debate is especially acrimonious because it calls into question the suburban way of life in America. Suburb-to-suburb commuting and shopping is a growing phenomenon. Since most public transport has been planned solely to move people to and from town centres, rather than between suburbs, these commuters are forced to rely on automobiles. Some architects are seeking to change these patterns with new 'village-style' designs, which aim to cut down on automobile use. The architectural firm Duany &amp; Plater-Zyberk, for instance, has gained fame for the Florida community of Seaside. The place follows the pattern of a European-style village, where people live, work and shop, with houses fitting tightly around a strong retail centre. Seaside has proved so popular that the firm has designed 70 similar communities around the country. Duany &amp; Plater-Zyberk says the Seaside model does not intend to solve all the problems of city and suburban sprawl. However, its popularity highlights the growing concern about excessive car use. With environmentalists stressing the issue, developers, architects, retailers and restaurant chains may all be forced to pay more attention to location when they consider ecologically sensitive constructions.</p>

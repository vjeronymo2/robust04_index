			<p>BFN     [Text] The organization of Korean residents in Russia sent  a letter of protest to the Japanese Consulate General and the  puppet Consulate General in Russia condemning the maneuvers of  the nation-selling, treacherous clique and the Japanese  reactionaries to lure Korean compatriots residing in Sakhalin  Oblast into South Korea.    The letter of protest revealed and denounced the fact that  in  mid-January, the South Korean puppet authorities waged a  negotiation commotion with the Japanese Government in a bid to  lure Korean compatriots in Sakhalin into South Korea and kicked  up a commotion of grasping those who have submitted an  application for their repatriation to South Korea for permanent  residence under the name of an on-the-spot, fact-finding team.    The letter indicated: The South Korean authorities's attempt  to settle the issue on the Korean compatriots residing in  Sakhalin in return for receiving small monetary compensation  from the criminals in disregard of its political nature is a  criminal act which cannot be tolerated in light of our nation's  dignity and interests. This is not only an insult to the 70  million fellow countrymen and a mockery to the nation, but is  also a vicious, brigandish act of alienating overseas  compatriots from the government of the Republic and,  furthermore, of completely trampling the lofty ideal and dream  of people who aspire a reunified fatherland and are devoting  themselves to it.    In the name of Korean residents in Russia, the organization  of Korean compatriots residing in Russia bitterly condemns the  South Korean authorities' act of attempting to replace the  nation's dignity and interests with small monetary compensation,  and brands the act as a shameless political swindle and  fraudulence to cheat and mock at our compatriots.    Noting that, under the mask of humanitarianism, the South  Korean puppet authorities are hellbent on conducting propaganda  to cheat the Korean compatriots in Sakhalin because they aim  heinously to lure them into building an anti-Republic lot in the  Far East region, and to perpetuate the country's division in  order to block the struggle of compatriots for national  reunification by inspiring the consciousness of discord and  confrontation within the nation, the letter of protest  continued: The Korean compatriots residing in Russia sternly  declare its opposition to and rejection of the heinous and  cunning maneuvers of the South Korean authorities and the  Japanese authorities to calculate, to the end, all crimes  committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past, and not to  tolerate the South Korean authorities' maneuvers to sell out the  nation's interests and dignity by fluttering and submitting to  Japan.    The South Korean authorities should immediately renounce the  antinational and antireunification maneuvers of settling the  issue of Korean compatriots residing in the former Soviet Union  region and the Sakhalin Oblast with mere monetary compensation  in collusion with the Japanese Government.    The Japanese authorities should apologize before all of the  Korean people for all the criminal acts that they committed  against our people in the past, and fully compensate for them  and should no longer commit acts hindering the independent  reunification of Korea.    The South Korean authorities and the Japanese authorities  should know that if they continue to commit a rash and reckless  act without giving heed to the serious warning of the Government  of the Republic and the 70 millions of fellow countrymen to  cling to the base plot to move Korean compatriots in Sakhalin to  South Korea they will not be able to escape the responsibility  for the crime of having insulted and abused the lofty ideal of  humanitarianism, will suffer greater disgrace and defeat before  the world, and will receive the justice of history.</p>

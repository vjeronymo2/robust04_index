			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Government faces new row in bid to save pits THE GOVERNMENT'S problems over the future of Britain's coal industry deepened last night as it emerged that a five-month review had failed to provide a guaranteed future for any of the 31 threatened pits. The Department of Trade and Industry is preparing to publish a white paper on coal by April 2 even though its concedes it is not possible to secure deals by then with generators to take additional coal supplies. Its decision will increase fears that only a handful of the 31 pits have a long-term future. It also means that thousands of miners' jobs will remain under threat for several months longer. A white paper without guarantees will also lay the government open to potential further rebellion by dissident Tory MPs. Labour will charge that the all-party trade and industry select committee was able to produce a formula for saving at least half the 31 pits by the end of January. The white paper will stress limitations on expanding the market for coal but is unlikely to say how many tonnes extra can be created in the market for coal, or how many pits can be saved. The publication date will depend on when, and if, the negotiations for the base contracts between British Coal and the electricity companies can be concluded. Officials in the Department of Trade and Industry are expected to work over the weekend to resolve remaining issues through binding arbitration. Although considerable progress was made in negotiations in the last two days, some regional electricity companies are still saying they do not want to sign anything before the white paper is published. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has said the contracts must be signed before the white paper. A compromise is likely. Even if the problems over base tonnages can be resolved, talks with the generators for additional contracts are some way off conclusion. It is these negotiations which will determine how many of the 31 pits can remain open. The white paper will stress that the future of mines should be determined by the market. It is likely to offer the prospect of providing subsidies to keep open some of the threatened pits but will leave the detail of how many to negotiations between British Coal and the generators. This is likely to take several months. Meanwhile, as a prelude to privatisation of the coal industry, the government will arrange for private mining companies to lease pits which are not wanted by British Coal. Leasing talks cannot begin before the white paper is published and are likely to be lengthy. The government is likely to signal the first stage in the privatisation of British Coal in the white paper, but will need to pass legislation before any pits are sold off. It is thought that the earliest date of publication for the white paper would be Thursday next week.</p>

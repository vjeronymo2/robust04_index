The informer arranged to buy four ounces of cocaine from  Guthrie June 15 on a St. Louis street corner.  </P> <P> According to the affidavit, police staked out the intersection and converged on  Guthrie after he arrived. After the boxer ran toward a telephone and dropped a  carrying case onto a parking lot, officers spotted a bag containing four ounces  of cocaine. Police also said they found two packets of cocaine in the boxer's  underwear.  </P> <P> Court documents didn't explain why Guthrie was able to box Wednesday.  </P></p>

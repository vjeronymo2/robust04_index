			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Rybkin, chairman of the Russian </F> Federation State Duma, by ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI chief editor Valeriy  Kucher; date and place not given: "Fifth Attempt To Establish  Russian Parliamentarianism"]    [Text] People of a pragmatic disposition sometimes feel  uncomfortable in Russian political circles even though they hold  key posts. Maybe the urge to engage in exciting politics is so  strong in our consciousness, after the years oppressed by  stagnation, that we are inclined to deify the destroyers and the  romantics rather than giving due credit to cautious and  responsible politicians.    In the ruling strata they are, so to speak, in the dugout,  although they are on the team. It is not surprising that  pragmatists are required to make considerably more sacrifices  and produce more proofs of loyalty to democracy than are  indulged in by their suspicious colleagues who are also their  opponents.    It is probably for this reason that State Duma Chairman Ivan  Petrovich Rybkin has not yet established his image. Maybe this  is partly his personal "fault" too -- as a man who does not go  in for showy moves, although on occasion, maybe, this is a  mistake: Populism, as a temporary measure, is sometimes  necessary.    The feigned refusal to recognize Ivan Rybkin as an  independent political figure, the emphasis on the bare facts of  his resume, and also the deliberate cultivation of the image of  a "turncoat" and "traitor" and the underestimation of his  strategic potential, are damaging not so much to his personal  authority and the prestige of the legislators, as to the  prestige of state power in general. It is time people realized  this! If all this is true, what kind of Duma have we elected,  if that is the kind of speaker it has? Are we capable of  electing worthy rulers at all?    A study of the logic of the establishment of the new power  in  Russia (and that is ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI's main topic) requires us  to look frankly at the political figures of today -- without  party blinders, myths and gossip, or dogmas, and especially  without devising cages of official powers for them. Asking  questions does not mean eulogizing, and doubting does not mean  rejecting.    I feel that Rybkin's "novelty" as a politician is more or  less unique. He differs from previous figures who have declared  centrist positions but have soon drifted to right or left, in  that one camp has not accepted him, and the other has rejected  him. The way to the right and to the left is now closed for  him, he is objectively obliged to remain in the center, and he  has a unique opportunity to construct a centrist stance.    Rybkin also differs from other politicians in that he does  not repudiate his own past. He is moving toward the supporters  of the new Constitution, becoming a kind of bridge between those  in power and the opposition. You can reject that. You can  assess it however you like. But you have to reckon with it.    Ivan Petrovich Rybkin is on his way. What lies in store for  him and how he will then behave, nobody can know. Although the  experience of his 100 days as speaker reveals much about the  personality of this politician. Read our interview with him on  page 2:    [Interview begins] [Kucher] The State Duma's two-year term  could be a crucial period for the future of Russian  parliamentarianism. I am not talking about the quantitative  parameters of its work. Let us leave aside, for the moment, the  number of laws adopted and to be adopted. I am talking about  the fact that there is a historic opportunity, in these two  years, to lay the foundations of a real parliamentarianism for  our country, provided, of course, that we can shake off the  spirit and traditions of the Supreme Soviet, which unfortunately  are transferred from one Duma building to another along with the  deputies.... Is it possible that ridding parliament of features  that are alien to it could help it to move from the flanks  toward the center?    [Rybkin] I agree with you that Russia has long needed a  proper lawmaking process. There are many gaps in this. At  times, everything hangs by a mere thread. But I would not  repudiate a single day of the history of Russian  parliamentarianism. When people say that our parliament does  not have much history, I do not accept that conclusion. What  about the people's assembly in ancient Novgorod -- is that not  part of our heritage? Or take the Zemskiy Sobor [assembly]  which elected the czar in the terrible Time of Troubles. Then  there was the State Council and the senate. There have been  four State Dumas in Russia. I have carefully studied their  history, and I am familiar with both the happy and the tragic  chapters. And I have arrived at the firm conviction that the  idea of centrism is the dominant idea.    When this center was found, and there was support from the  left and right wings, Russia lived peacefully and pursued the  reforms it had undertaken. But when people leaned toward one  wing, they suffered very serious upheavals. Therefore the  people who championed the idea of the center are very dear to me  as historical figures.    [Kucher] You left the leadership component of the CPRF  [Communist Party of the Russian Federation] on your own  initiative, giving preference to the Agrarian Party of Russia.  Does this step on your part confirm that you pin your hopes of  creating a center party on the "agrarians"?    [Rybkin] People tell me: The Agrarian Party is a  conservative party. To some extent that is true, because it  conserves the attitudes that form the genetic basis of the  people. This is a weakness, but also a great strength. Every  society must understand that it will have prosperity when the  peasants enjoy success. Some 40 percent of the national product  is created in the agro-industrial complex. That is the reality.  And it is so not because some people support or do not support  the Agrarian Party, although I myself am an agrarian -- I have  had links with the peasants for the greater part of my life. If  the peasants start to live prosperously, the Agrarian Party  itself will be a party of the middle stratum, which is to say,  the center. Those industrial workers who are able to live as  well as the peasants will join the party. And I very much want  the stratum of those who are prosperous to be a big one, and the  center to be big. The country will thereby be strong.    [Kucher] What do we want, in the last analysis? What are we  building? Should we give all this some kind of name, define  it?...    [Rybkin] We should stop trying to delude people with all  kinds of definitions. We have gone through the whole range of  concepts. Let us turn our gaze to the north. There, life is  more difficult, it is more difficult to build, to organize life.  The ruling Social Democrats in Sweden, for instance, do not  give any name to the society they live in. But the gulf between  those who are very rich and those of average prosperity is  three-, four-, or fivefold. In our country we never had this  normal kind of inequality, it was abnormal, and now it is even  more so. The gulf is enormous. So all the levers of influence  must be used to prevent society from becoming so sharply  stratified: through tax inspection, self-restraint, and  properly perceived state interest, and by appealing to  entrepreneurs' patriotic feelings.    We have seen all this before in Russia's history, when  businesspeople respected its laws and understood their role in  the country's prosperity. I am not calling for a return to the  past. But I know that many of the present representatives of  national capital are well disposed toward cooperation with the  state as partners. The $1.5-2 billion that goes abroad every  year could and should be brought back home. Not directly, of  course, not by way of administrative pressure, but with the help  of economic measures, that is, voluntarily. The law must be  applied to those who steal. But for those who cannot yet find  scope in Russia for their minds and talents and who have to  invest the capital they have earned at 5 percent in a foreign  bank rather than receiving an income of 500 percent in their  native state -- for those people it is simply essential that we  find guarantees for their work. Maybe through the creation of  transnational corporations or by other means.    I have always believed that our people have fine qualities  which you cannot buy for any money. Saint-Exupery called this  the luxury of human contact. In Russia there has always been  plenty of this. It must be valued. Handed down from generation  to generation.    [Kucher] You touched on the subject of the people's  historical memory. I would like to ask you a question directly  concerning recent political history. You once stressed in an  interview that you attach particular value to the Lenin of the  times of the NEP [new economic policy]. Does that mean that you  advocate some kind of new approach to assessing the activity of  the Bolsheviks in Russia?    [Rybkin] I feel profoundly Russian by my origin and by my  roots. At the same time I feel I am an inhabitant of Russia who  grew up in a multinational environment. Therefore nothing in  Russia's history is alien to me. Everything that happened  belongs to me.    I am a pragmatist. Therefore I am convinced that from all  our hard-earned experience we should adopt what is most  necessary and important. Our pride in our compatriots'  greatness of spirit and mind should not be based on short-term  considerations whereby one person is trampled underfoot in order  to elevate another. All historical figures have been focal  points for great good and great evil. The bigger the figure,  the more significant the manifestation of both of these.    Everything that was done by Peter I, by Alexander I or  Alexander the Liberator -- all this passed through my family's  history in one way or another. After the 1861 reform and the  abolition of serfdom my forebears, who had fought, received  parcels of land. They received this gift as a great benefit and  clung to that land. The time of great upheavals came: the  Japanese and First World Wars, the revolution. It was a peasant  country. Something had to be done. But not the way they did  it! And by 1920 this had become clear. My forefathers were  freedom-lovers and refused to be brought to their knees, as many  other citizens of Russia are refusing now. Because you can  injure a person, and eventually he will understand and forgive.  But you cannot humiliate him -- he will never forgive that.  Every ruler who has real power must understand that.    So then the NEP came along -- the wise new economic policy.  The peasant finds himself in his accustomed market, he has room  to maneuver. The peasants always lived in market conditions,  albeit restricted or specific. Without the market of those  days, I and my two brothers and two sisters would never have  received higher education. The ruble, which was in the same  state of upheaval as now, became gold.    All these are elementary facts. I am repeating them in order  to emphasize a simple thought: that if you are the leader, that  is to say you are in the lead, in front of the others, it is  incumbent on you to look ahead a pace or two, and not lead the  others while walking backwards yourself.    [Kucher] Could you name the strong and weak aspects of our  government?    [Rybkin] You mean, starting in 1991?    [Kucher] For the sake of argument.    [Rybkin] My sympathies are with the government headed by  Yegor Timurovich Gaydar for their efforts, vigor, and desire to  reform the economy. But I am frankly convinced that a  thoroughly monopoly-based economy cannot be taken by a cavalry  attack without injuries and errors. If we are thinking in terms  of a system, we must understand that the reforms should involve  dismantling, not destruction. An explosion is always a  revolution. Bang -- then dust. But by dismantling a component  and putting a new one in its place, we can change the system as  a whole. The peasant who has rotting beams in his house knows  how to do this without destroying the whole structure.    Some of the people from that government still remain, and  they are working with Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin. For the  most part they are well-trained people with a good knowledge of  theory. They have gained substantial experience over these  years. Unfortunately, this has affected Russia painfully. It is  distressing to see this. I do not want to engage in "if  only's." Indeed, when they took on the job, there were not many  volunteers. Now they are living through a difficult time.    But the government operates as it deems necessary. It is  inclined to heed parliament's opinion. Relations between us are  equal, although we are rather critical about some of the  government's steps. But we do not bear a grudge. In the  committees there is the opportunity to discuss things with the  vice premiers. In parliament's "Government Hour" (on Fridays)  it is no problem for the ministers to justify or adjust their  own viewpoint. There was admittedly a time when some of the  young deputies raised the question of no confidence in the  government. Not more than 16 percent of those present voted to  put this question on the agenda.    [Kucher] A situation very often arises in the government  when it is necessary to act quickly, but an appropriate law does  not yet exist. What is your attitude to the idea that the  federal executive power could make broader use, in economic  practice, of its own decrees and other normative acts?    [Rybkin] The formula that forms the basis of the  government's activity permits it to draw up practical,  well-thought-out documents and adopt laws in a transparent form,  with all interested parties playing an active part in this  process. The federal budget was submitted to parliament 23  March, and was adopted on 25 March.    We must not drift into an "emergency" attitude, although  where it is necessary, in the interests of the cause, to  regulate something by means of a government decree, this must be  done, and likewise where a presidential edict is needed. But we  must create a sound legislative basis, among other things as  regards formulating the budget. There are those who assert that  the Duma will not be able to adopt more than 30 laws in the  remaining time, but that statement is unfounded.    [Kucher] What does the concept of "an independent political  figure" mean for you personally?    [Rybkin] Everything relating to my duties. What you call  independence is prescribed in the Russian Federation  Constitution. It clearly states what I can and what I am not  entitled to do. Some people believe that these aren't sufficient  rights for the State Duma. I don't think so. The entire  lawmaking process passes through the State Duma -- this imposes  a tremendous obligation and a tremendous responsibility.  Coordinating this work, organizing internal procedures -- all  this complex process falls on my shoulders. But I believe that  I am truly independent if I can heed the opinion of deputies and  rely on it. The State Duma Standing Orders and other documents  empower me to represent the Duma's interests in all  organizations and power structures inside and outside the  country. This represents a pretty broad range of questions and  powers. But I repeat yet again that I constantly measure my  actions against the sentiments of State Duma deputies and the  State Duma Council and try never to take any step without them.  Furthermore, there are always deputies around me and I have the  chance to consult with them. When I was young and less  experienced and was chairing faculty meetings I would listen to  people and think: I was about to make such-and-such a decision  but, having listened to them, I have fundamentally altered it.  Thank God I listened, and thank God I altered that decision. It  is important not only to listen but also to hear what people are  saying -- this is also a sign of independence.    [Kucher] You are sometimes accused of having betrayed your  ideals, some people regard you as a defector...    [Rybkin] On the subject of political retreats and  defections. It seems to me that people who talk like that are  maybe the ones who have lost contact with the world, whereas I  move in the same direction as the world.... I live a real life,  while they have their heads in the clouds.    [Kucher] Historians and analysts are attempting to predict  Russia's future, arguing among themselves. What do you think  about its future?    [Rybkin] There is a great deal that is artificial and  divorced from real life in the arguments about whether Russia  will become great power or not. I simply say that Russia has  never ceased to be a great power. And never will.    [Kucher] What is your view of how Russia will build its  relations with the republics which have made the break and gone  their own way, as they say?    [Rybkin] I simply say that Russia is self-sufficient enough  to weather any crisis. And we are weathering it.    Those who have made a wrong move will probably soon realize.  We learn by comparing. We all have to seek our own solution.  But I am convinced that many will try to get closer to Russia.  How this will be formalized -- by a Treaty of Georgiyevsk or of  some other kind -- I don't know. But I do believe, for example,  that the Russian-Belorussian [Belarusian] treaty and the things  it offers is the correct path, particularly for fraternal  peoples.    I see a mixed economy for Russia. It is hard to say what the  balance between private and state ownership will be. State  ownership accounts for 22 percent in the United States, for  example, 33 percent in Germany, 40 percent in Austria, and 10  percent in Japan. The current figure in our country is 70  percent. But even that figure is wrong. State enterprises are  no longer what they used to be. We have not thought through the  flotation process. And the people who work there have not gone  into this in depth. Grabbing a controlling block of shares for  itself, an enterprise follows the old tradition of begging the  government for additional subsidies. We have instituted many  different "levels," whereas the fact is that everything that's  nonstate is private.    A mixed economy is a strength. Admittedly many of our  industrialists have forgotten that the word industry is related  to the concept of being industrious and doing something, not  just sitting back and waiting for some kind of economic  pluralism to appear.    As for the political aspect, a multiparty system is  developing in the country. But this does not mean things will  be as they are now, when it is very easy to register a party  with neither a program nor social support. By tradition Russia  will evidently have a center party, a left-wing party, and -- on  the right -- a liberal democratic party. But I don't think that  the right-wing party will be identical to the one that is  currently active.    [Kucher] It would be interesting to hear your assessment of  the State Duma's first four months of work....    [Rybkin] I would like to talk not some much about lawmaking  as about the fact that we have managed in a short space of time  to find mutual understanding and cooperation between the  president and the State Duma, the State Duma and the government,  the State Duma and the Federation Council, the State Duma and  the judiciary. This is a very, very important factor.    It can be said that a hundred days is not a very long period  to draw such a conclusion. We live in times when one day counts  as two or even three. Because the State Duma has been granted  only 24 months of activity. Four months have already gone. And  we are very aware of this.    A detailed plan of law-drafting activity has been adopted.  It identifies priority legislative acts which are extremely  necessary to back up economic reform in Russia. I would say,  however, that we are not talking so much of even backup for  immediate needs as of the longer term. And this is very  important. In addition, the plan for law-drafting activity  incorporates the wishes of all those with legislative initiative  rights.    What parts of this plan are already being implemented? First  and foremost laws forming the legal framework of the new state:  civil and land codes and water and air laws, which establish and  consolidate the new ownership relationships in Russia. New  criminal, criminal-procedure, and administrative-law codes are  currently being elaborated.    I regard it as a big plus for the State Duma that when we  were shaping the administrative structures (the chairman of the  State Duma and his four deputies, committees, and commissions)  we followed not the path of enshrining the advantages which the  party majority achieved during the elections but the path of  proportional representation for all the factions and deputies'  groups. Which was a considerable surprise to Russia and the  rest of the world. This meant the main objective was achieved --  what emerged was not a list-driven majority based on the number  of supporters of a given faction or group, but a real, sensible  majority. Without which fruitful activity by the State Duma  would be inconceivable.    It is virtually impossible to get all deputies without  exception to agree in the course of Duma plenary sessions. We  had to consider the experience of the United States, France,  Germany, Austria, and a number of other countries where work on  a draft law starts in committee and is conducted on a multiparty  basis there.    Thus our chamber of the Federal Assembly -- to the surprise  of many opponents -- very quickly structured itself, determined  its forms and methods of work, and started operating -- getting  down, that is, to its main job of lawmaking.    In my view the existence of a strong "common sense" bloc in  the Duma was evidenced by the amnesty decree. I am deeply  convinced that without the decision adopted by the Duma it would  be impossible, first, to get Russia out of crisis; second, to  avoid suspicion, hoping for the worst, and the possibility of  settling scores; third, to amnesty -- literally forgive -- not  only the "Lefortovo inmates" but every last one of the political  participants, on both sides, in the 21 September-4 October  events, thereby halting the wave of hatred and vengefulness; and  fourth, to give thousands of Russians with their new-found  freedom the chance to join in constructive work for the benefit  of the fatherland.    The "common-sense bloc" made its weighty voice heard when  working on the agreement on achieving social accord in Russia.    In my view, that document is an important step strengthening  Russian statehood. It is an original Russian version of the  Moncloa Pact, which saved Spain from a rerun of the Civil War  after Franco died. [interview ends]    The old Supreme Soviet's departure from the political scene  also brought in its wake the disappearance of one its invariable  attributes -- the "video" record documenting deputies at work.  We can no longer see how Ivan Rybkin chairs sessions or what  he talks to deputies about and how. In fact he rarely appears  on television. Instead we are starting to get more frequent  assessments of his activity in the newspapers, and the  dissatisfied voice of the opposition is growing stronger. But  why? It has become demonstrably clear to me, for example, that  you can only call Ivan Rybkin a communist or a liberal by  stretching the truth an awful long way. He is neither. Because  he is a legislator in the post of chairman of the State Duma.  His predecessors, Lukyanov and Khasbulatov, were nothing but  Supreme Soviet manipulators. Men with different styles and from  different schools, but still typical party tyrants.    Rybkin is a professional administrator, a statesman. No way  has he sold out to Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin, as some of his  dogmatic colleagues believe; it is just that, on becoming Duma  chairman, he acquired a new status obliging him to leave his  political views outside the Federal Assembly door. It cannot be  ruled out that he has learned lessons from the recent past. But  he was most likely pushed in this direction by his own  experience as an engineer, political scientist, and diplomat.    Deputies are difficult customers. They have their own views  of life, but they have a good sense of what a statesman is.    What awaits Ivan Rybkin in the future?    In answering this question I am not even attempting a  prediction, merely citing facts. He is an outsider among his  own people but not at home among those on the other side. His  own people evidently cannot forgive him his "treachery":  Baburin has already suggested that Rybkin be moved from the  speaker's chair to a deputy's seat. They are hardly likely to  back off, and a threat to Rybkin from that quarter is always a  possibility.    The other side, the democrats, who initially had a sharply  negative attitude to Ivan Petrovich, are gradually coming to  recognize his worth and will evidently forge closer contacts  with him unless they frighten themselves and, by proxy, their  colleagues, and start squabbling among themselves again.    I wish to reiterate that Ivan Petrovich Rybkin is doomed to  be in the center. He is able and, it seems to be, ready to  reshape an assembly with Supreme Soviet morals into a real  Russian parliament.    Possibly he will persist for a long time yet in linking the  idea of creating a center to the spirit of the Agrarian Party.  Unless life thrusts a new kind of middle-class person into the  arena.    But let's not try to guess.    Time will tell.</p>

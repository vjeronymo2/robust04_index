			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / DK launches five new titles: Big batch of CD-Roms represents a several million pound investment Dorling Kindersley, the UK publisher which has assembled one of the largest multimedia teams in the world, is about to introduce its first big batch of CD-Rom titles. The company which won awards for its first title, Musical Instruments, is publishing five titles on September 29. These include The Ultimate Human Body, The Eyewitness Encyclopedia of Science and My First Incredible, Amazing Dictionary. The launch of so many ambitious 'edutainment' titles simultaneously, combining words, pictures, sound, animation and video on a compact disc, represents the fruit of a several million pound investment by DK. The company, which has built up a 130-strong multimedia team, plans to launch another six CD-Rom titles in the spring and a further six next autumn. 'We are certainly the largest (of this type of company) in Europe,' says Alan Buckingham, managing director of DK Multimedia, set up in 1991 to address the emerging market. Buckingham concedes that this was, to some extent, an act of faith. But he says he never doubted the importance of multimedia - only the timing of its commercial success. The Musical Instruments CD-Rom has already sold between 60,000 and 70,000 copies, with special editions being created for the French and German markets. One of the new titles takes David Macaulay's best-selling book, The Way Things Work, which has sold more than 2.5m copies, and crams on a single disc more than 1,000 illustrations and 300 animations to explain more than 150 inventions. At the click of a mouse, everything from lightbulbs to lasers come alive on screen. The program has a suggested retail price of Pounds 79, although CD-Roms are often discounted. A user simply clicks on any words in the text in red to open more than 1,500 screens and pop-ups, and move instantly from an explanation of a machine to a biography of its inventor. CD-Roms can actually show the inside of a four-stroke engine working. The Encyclopedia of Science (recommended retail price Pounds 99) has more than 170 main subjects organised into four major categories - chemistry, mathematics, physics and life sciences - with a Who's Who of science and how they made their discoveries. Forthcoming topics will range from nature and world history to electronic atlases and travel guides. Buckingham, who used to be a DK book editor, set out in 1991 with a team of five 'to teach ourselves how to make this stuff'. He believes books have to be 'reconceived' for multimedia, rather than simply turned into electronic form. The big question for DK, a quoted company capitalised at around Pounds 200m and in which US software giant Microsoft has a 20 per cent stake, is how quickly the consumer market for CD-Roms will grow. The company estimates there are about 80,000 to 100,000 CD-Rom machines in domestic use in the UK but that number could quickly double or even triple. The market is much larger in the US, and Buckingham believes that, by the end of this year, 10m homes could have a personal computer which can play CD-Roms. There are even strong signs that from next year most personal computers in the US may be shipped with CD-Rom capacity as standard. If so that could provide a growing market for titles such as The Way Things Work, Encyclopedia of Science or Stephen Biesty's Incredible Cross Sections Stowaway - 'an amazing quest through an authentic 18th century warship]'</p>

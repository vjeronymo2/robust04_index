			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of State Submittal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State of Louisiana has ten parishes designated as nonclassifiable ozone nonattainment areas. Nonclassifiable ozone nonattainment areas had air quality data which demonstrated attainment of the ozone standard, but had not petitioned the EPA for redesignation to attainment before the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) were passed. These parishes were nonattainment prior to the 1990 CAAA, and retained their ozone nonattainment designations with the passage of the CAAA. Transitional areas possessed the required three years of air quality data, while incomplete data areas had less than the required three years of data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Beauregard, Grant, Lafourche, St. James and St. Mary Parishes were classified as incomplete data areas for ozone on November 6, 1991 (56 FR 56694). The New Orleans Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area contained four parishes which were designated as transitional ozone nonattainment areas on November 6, 1991: Jefferson, Orleans, St. Bernard and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> St. Charles. Lafayette Parish was also classified as a transitional ozone nonattainment area on November 6, 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 5, 1994, the State of Louisiana submitted a petition to the EPA requesting that the ten parishes listed above be exempted from the requirement to perform the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  portion of the build/no-build test required by the new transportation conformity rule. This exemption request is pursuant to the recently published General Preamble for transportation conformity NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  exemptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The exemption request was based on air monitoring data which demonstrated that the NAAQS for ozone was attained in each of these nonclassifiable ozone nonattainment areas for the three years prior to the petition. The Air quality data was verified as quality assured in accordance with monitoring requirements specified in 40 CFR part 58, and demonstrates that the ozone standard has been maintained in these areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Rulemaking Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA has evaluated the State's exemption request for consistency with the CAA, EPA regulations, and EPA policy. The EPA believes that the exemption request and monitoring data qualifies the parishes of Beauregard, Grant, Lafayette, Lafourche, Jefferson, Orleans, St. Bernard, St. Charles,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> St. James, and St. Mary as ``clean data areas''. In addition, the EPA has determined that the exemption request meets the requirements and policy set forth in the General Preamble for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  exemptions from the build/no-build test for transportation conformity, and today is proposing approval of Louisiana's request for exemption from the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  build/no-build test of transportation conformity for these parishes. The section 182(f) exemption will be conditioned upon the area's monitoring data continuing to demonstrate attainment after the exemption has been granted. If the EPA later determines that any of these parishes has violated the ozone standard, the section 182(f) exemption will be rescinded for that parish. Past conformity determinations and transportation plans would not be affected, but new conformity determinations would then be subject to the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  provisions of the conformity rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA has reviewed this request for exemption from the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  provisions of the Federal transportation conformity rule for conformance with the provisions of the 1990 CAAA enacted on November 15, 1990. The EPA has determined that this action conforms with those requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities (see 46 FR 8709). Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and governmental entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because an exemption from the Federal transportation conformity rule does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAA forbids the EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds (Union Electric Co. v. U.S.E.P.A., 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S. Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410 (a)(2)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

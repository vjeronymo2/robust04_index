			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Central Committee of the Democratic Front for  the Reunification of the Fatherland [DFRF] issued the following  letter of appeal [hosomun] to the compatriots in South Korea and  overseas in connection with the grave situation [omjunghan  chongse] created on the Korean peninsula because of the war  maneuvers of the United States and the South Korean authorities.    The letter of appeal to the compatriots in South Korea and  overseas:    The compatriot brethren in South Korea and overseas: An  unpredictable extremely grave war phase [yechukhalsu omnun kukhi  omjunghan chonjaeng kungmyon] is created on the Korean Peninsula  now. The danger of war on the Korean Peninsula is approaching  the nation nearer and nearer as a reality rather than an  assumption [kajong]. In connection with this grave situation,  we send this letter of appeal to you, the South Korean people of  various strata and the compatriots overseas.    The urgent situation on the Korean peninsula, which the  world's good people are watching with deep worries, is not  caused because our people in the North and the South wanted it  nor because our fellow countrymen themselves caused it. It is  forced upon intentionally by the flunkyist nation-selling forces  in South Korea which turned away from the nation, and by outside  forces.    Our people in the North and the South want independent and  peaceful reunification of the country, but the flunkeyist  nation-selling forces in South Korea are scheming for  reunification by northward invasion. Our compatriots at home  and abroad look forward to peace in the country, but the  bellicose forces in South Korea seek confrontation and war.    For the denuclearization on the Korean peninsula, national  alliance [minjok kongjo cheje] is necessary, but the South  Korean authorities attempt international alliance [kukje kongjo  cheje]. For peace in the country, there should not be the danger  of war, but the South Korean authorities attempt to resume the  Team Spirit nuclear war exercise. For the reunification of the  country, national unity is essential, but they are begging for  sanctions [chejae] against fellow countrymen.    The South Korean authorities not only unilaterally broke  down  the hard-won working delegates' contact by abusing the issue of  the North-South exchange of special envoys to obstruct the  DPRK-U.S. talks, which can fundamentally resolve the nuclear  issue on the Korean peninsula, but are openly agitating war,  bringing Patriot missiles into South Korea under this pretext,  and even disclosing a new plan for war of northward invasion  called New Operations Plan 5027 which they have already worked  out. They even issued a special alert order to the South Korean  Army. With such violent war remarks as punishment and an  opportunity for reunification, they are massively assembling  troops and equipment along the Military Demarcation Line, thus  not hesitating military provocation against us.    These ominous military moves [simsangchiannun kunsajok  umjigimun] are now bringing the situation in our country to the  very dangerous brink of war. It is clear to anyone that in our  country, where the two sides are acutely [paengpaenghage]  confronting each other along the Military Demarcation Line, any  accidental event can cause full-scale military conflicts  [kuoddon ubalchogin sagoeuihaesodo chonmyonjogin kunsajok  chungdori ironalsuitta]. If a fuse to nuclear war is ignited on  the Korean peninsula, our fatherland will be turned into a  wasteland, and our nation, which has a 5,000-year history, will  suffer an irrevocable catastrophe. How can any patriotic Korean  turn a blind eye to a reality in which such a national tragedy  is enforced?    Genuine patriotism for our nation is manifested in  preventing  the incoming danger of war and defending peace in the country.  It is time all Korean people who love the country, irrespective  of whether they live in the North, the South, or abroad, join  hands and rise up to remove the danger of war, which is caused  by the toadyist and treacherous forces in South Korea, and open  a blue sky of peace on the Korean peninsula.    Brothers and sisters in the North and South and abroad: War  is not a fate that our nation has no choice but to suffer. The  danger of war which looms now on the Korean peninsula is a  byproduct of the policy of relying on outside forces, a policy  espoused by the South Korean authorities who cannot defend  independence, the nation's lifeline.    Our national history has given us a lesson that whenever  power is made sport of [nongnak] by men of noble birth who lack  independence, the territory will turn into an arena of  competition among outside forces, and the fellow countrymen will  suffer the tragic fate of national ruin.    The current authorities in South Korea are dishonest  political dealers [chongchi kansangbae] who most heavily rely on  outside forces and are the most toadyist and treacherous, among  all rulers in South Korea. How can we come to terms with  [tahyop] toadyist and treacherous forces, who follow outside  forces, even when we know relying on outside forces would bring  war? And, how can we turn a blind eye to a rule and  intervention by outside forces even when we know that would  bring the nation to a nuclear catastrophe? Coming to terms and  turning a blind eye will lead the nation to self-destruction.    People from all parties, factions, and walks of life in  South  Korea and overseas compatriots: You must remove national  betrayers who pursue the policy of relying on outside forces and  resolutely wage the struggle to defend national independence!  You must also resolutely part with the toadyist and treacherous  regime and boldly join in the struggle to remove this regime!  If you do not join in the struggle today, this will help the  toadyist and treacherous forces find ways for their existence,  and, then, a fuse to war will be ignited in this land. It will  be too late to regret it and useless to lament it then.    The struggle to remove the toadyist and treacherous forces  in  South Korea is a patriotic road toward rescuing the country from  a disaster and keeping the fellow countrymen alive and the road  of sacred struggle to achieve peace in the country and hasten  the country's peaceful reunification.    People from all parties, factions, and walks of life in  South  Korea: You must vigorously rise up and fight to remove the Kim  Yong-sam treacherous regime and build an independence,  democratic regime on its grave!    If the danger of war is to be prevented, the reckless war  maneuvers by the United States and South Korean warmongers must  be checked and frustrated [choji patan].    The Team Spirit war exercise cannot be peaceful, and the  introduction of Patriot missiles is not intended for peace.  And, the movement of the U.S. military warships to the South  Korean waters will surely threaten peace, and the reckless  military actions taken under a special alert order will surely  destroy [pagoe] peace.    All South Korean people and overseas compatriots: You  must raise your voices of denunciation everywhere and raise the  flames of resistance to oppose the resumption of the Team Spirit  joint military exercise, reject the introduction of Patriot  missiles, and check and frustrate the deployment of U.S.  warships to the South Korean waters and all other commotions for  military provocations!    Officers and men of the South Korean Armed Forces: You must  resolutely reject the criminal orders of the warmongers who  force you to become mercenaries [yongbyong] of outside forces  and inflict a catastrophe of nuclear war on your fathers and  mothers, wives and children, and brothers and sisters and your  fellow countrymen, and aim your guns at the aggressors and  treacherous forces!    It is time the South Korean people free themselves from rule  and intervention by outside forces. The real danger of war was  caused by rule and intervention by the United States, and the  endless continuation of national division was caused by it.    There is no war only when there is no aggressor in the  country, and there is no nuclear war only when there are no  nuclear weapons.    All South Korean people: You must vigorously wage the  struggle to defend national dignity and independence and remove  the U.S. forces and nuclear weapons from South Korea by  displaying the proud wisdom and courage of a nation with the  5,000-year history! You must wage an anti-U.S., antiwar, and  antinuclear struggle to free yourselves from a rule and  intervention by the United States, check and frustrate the  maneuvers by the South Korean rulers to develop nuclear weapons,  and turn the Korean peninsula into a nuclear-free peace zone!    Great unity of the entire nation leads to peace in the  country and the fatherland's reunification. Today, when the  fiery clouds of war are coming in every moment, all fellow  countrymen in the North and South and abroad, transcending  differences in ideas, ideology, and systems, must unite and  unite among themselves.    Only the strength of unity can prevent war, defend peace,  and  rescue the nation from a disaster.    The 10-point program of great unity of the entire nation for  the fatherland's reunification is a banner of patriotism that  prevents war and calls our fellow countrymen to peace and unity  and a torch of patriotism that enables our fellow countrymen to  cultivate their destinies on their own.    Let us all consider the 10-point program of great unity of  the entire nation to be a common guideline for the nation, unite  with each other as one nation, first of all, and join in the  struggle to prevent the danger of nuclear war hovering over the  head of the nation and open a road toward peace in the country  and its peaceful reunification!    All parties, factions, and people from all walks of life in  the North and South and abroad: Let us achieve the consensus of  will and unite their strengths to make joint efforts time and  again for the sake of great national unity, the most sacred  patriotism!    Our people in the northern half of the Republic will always  firmly stand by the South Korean people who are fighting to  prevent the danger of war, which looms in the face of the  nation, and defend peace in the country.    [signed] DFRF Central Committee    [dated] 29 March 1994, Pyongyang</p>

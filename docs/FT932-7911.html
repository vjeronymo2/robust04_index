			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / CBI warning over Continental orders ORDER BOOKS are continuing to fill gradually, but exports are being affected by the sharp economic slowdown on the Continent, especially in Germany, members of the Yorkshire and Humberside region of the Confederation of British Industry reported yesterday. The CBI's regional council, meeting in Sheffield, said UK markets were still fragile for many companies, but that an upward trend in demand was emerging. The outlook for employment had improved but job losses were expected to continue in the short term, with uncertainty restraining consumer spending. Mr Peter Barker, the council's chairman, said the construction industry was still finding the economy sluggish, but investment in plant and equipment in other sectors was picking up as confidence mounted. Sheffield steel processing companies supplying niche markets have reported increasing export business in the wake of the devaluation of sterling last September, but worry is mounting about a slowdown in Germany. Continental prices are also competitive in high-volume steelmaking sectors, so although Sheffield's output of steel products is at record levels, margins and profits are under increasing strain.</p>

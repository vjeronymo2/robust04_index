			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Antonio Jose do Carmo] </F>   [Text] Ribas do Rio Pardo, 10 Jun (AE) -- One year after  the invasion of 83,000 hectares of a eucalyptus reforestation  area in the Mato Grosso do Sul county of Ribas do Rio Pardo, 150  km from Campo Grande, the landowner has filed a request with the  courts demanding the restoration of his right to possession of  the land, and the eviction of at least 1,000 families who have  settled on the ranch, building fences, planting grass, and  feeding cattle.    Industrialist Leo Chueri, the landowner, said the hundreds  of  intruders are ranchers and owners of small estates in Sao Paulo  State. The announcement of their possible eviction has increased  tension among settlers. Contrary to other movements that remain  organized behind unions and church leadership, the Ribas de Rio  Pardo settlers are not organized. Each one chose an area  according to his own economic capacity, hiring armed foremen to  guard their sites.    The Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable  Natural Resources (Ibama) and the National Land Reform and  Settlement Institute have both produced reports saying that the  land is inappropriate for agriculture. Yet cattle breeders have  succeeded with their grass plantations.    The elite of intruders, who are also called the  "landowners,"  even include a deputy whose name is on the official list  submitted by the ranch owner. Roberto Razuk (PMDB) [Brazilian  Democratic Movement Party] is considered the strongest invader  of the ranch. He maintains an armed group. The deputy could not  be found to comment on the accusation.    Judge Raul Roveda, of Ribas de Rio Pardo, ordered the  removal  of settlers from 18,000 hectares. This area was occupied by  hundreds of families of itinerant workers who were hired by the  Union of Rural Workers of Ribas de Rio Pardo. Most of them  claim to have no land on which to graze the cattle they are now  grazing on the abandoned reforestation project land. The  landowner, however, claims that "the courts can be human only  with men, women and children; the cattle must be put on the  highway."</p>

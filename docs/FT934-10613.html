			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Fenchurch pathfinder reveals strong profit growth FENCHURCH, the insurance broker which plans a stock market flotation later this month, yesterday published its pathfinder prospectus and reported a strong increase in profitability. Operating profits from continuing operations increased by 44 per cent to Pounds 6.9m in the year to September 30. Interest payable on some Pounds 19.5m of debt - which will be repaid with the proceeds of the flotation - and losses of Pounds 818,000 at the Lloyd's agency business, which is to be demerged, depressed pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.56m (Pounds 2.96m). The group is planning a placing and intermediaries offer and will issue listing particulars on November 17. Dealings are expected to begin on November 26. JO Hambro Magan is acting as financial adviser to Fenchurch and James Capel is sponsor and underwriter of the issue. Turnover from insurance broking increased to Pounds 28.4m (Pounds 25.3m), offsetting a fall in investment income to Pounds 1.95m (Pounds 2.39m). Turnover at the Lloyd's agency business fell to Pounds 2.83m (Pounds 3.84m). Operating expenses in broking increased to Pounds 23.2m (Pounds 22.9m) and to Pounds 3.65m (Pounds 3.23m) in the demerged agency business. Profits on ordinary activities before interest payable rose from Pounds 5.49m to Pounds 6.15m. Interest payable fell to Pounds 1.59m (Pounds 2.53m). Earnings per share improved from 7.3p to 12.9p, or adjusted, to 15.5p (5.5p).</p>

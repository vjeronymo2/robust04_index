			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Arts: Verdi Requiem - Concert In the dark, holy surroundings of Westminster Cathedral it is easy to let one's mind drift back in time. Recordings do not exist from 1874 and so it is left to the imagination, supported by a thorough reading of contemporary reports, to form an idea of what the first performance of Verdi's Requiem might have been like. With this concert on Monday the issue has come alive. John Eliot Gardiner, the hare among the period performance specialists, has left the tortoises well and truly standing by racing ahead to the later years of Verdi. The keenness of intellect that he has focussed upon Handel and Mozart in the past was here turned on music that equally excites the physical senses. Whatever doubts it may have raised, the result was an important and compelling evening. Nothing in it was slack; nothing was done without deep thought and preparation. The biggest surprise came in the solo music, where the disciplinarian Gardiner melted to allow his singers a measure of freedom - a malleable, sensitive, yet still precise style. The choruses were thrilling, tingling with energy, every part phenomenally clear from the Monteverdi Choir (including a couple of male altos, which would have given Verdi a surprise). From a seat near the front the Requiem's extreme contrasts sounded tremendous, not least when the strident period trumpets pealed out from the cathedral galleries to announce the day of judgment. Unfortunately, the acoustics at Westminster were too resonant to let us hear the instruments of the Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique (all as close to 1870s Italy as possible) in any detail - though the pastoral oboe at 'Inter oves' was a singular success. It was with the four soloists that the problems arose. We know from accounts of early performances that the original soprano was renowned for the power and intensity of her top C, which rode over the climax of the final chorus, while the mezzo was so deep in tone as almost to be mistaken for a tenor. Excellent artists though they are, Luba Orgonasova and Anne Sofie von Otter are not those kinds of singer. Orgonasova's exquisitely delicate soprano could not be heard at the big top C, or in much of the rest; von Otter's light mezzo has no tenor leanings, whatever her other virtues. The sensitive, Italianate Luca Canonici and long-breathed Alastair Miles were nearer the mark, though even they have relatively small voices. Too often the whole quartet simply disappeared from audibility. What Gardiner did here was to take some of the singers from his Mozart team and transfer them to the music of a century later. Logic dictates that they cannot be 'authentic' in both. Still, on the forthcoming recording they may well be more successful, while the exemplary technical standard of the music-making will carry all before it. Concert sponsored by Goldman Sachs</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Cao Min: "Wage Law To Adjust Pay Scales"] </F>   [Text] The government is stepping up work on a wage law  that will set up a national minimum wage and standardize  industry pay scales.    Speaking yesterday at a national conference in Beijing,  Labour Minister Li Boyong stressed the need to reform the wage  and wage distribution system.    "A market economy does not preclude macro-economic control  by  the government," Li said.    In the first half of this year, the country's pay rolls are  expected to grow 25 per cent over the same period last year, the  minister said.    The draft of the wage law includes 10 chapters covering pay  scales, minimum wage, payment, wage disputes, insurance and  supervision.    It says the State will control all wage-related issues  through laws, macro-economic means and administrative measures.    According to the draft law, wage distribution must follow  four principles:    -- Wage levels should rise based on economic development;    -- Pay should be given based on work done;    -- Priority must be given to efficiency and fairness;    -- Equal pay for equal work.    Based on the country's economic growth, unemployment, prices  and investment, the government will also establish references  for enterprises when they decide their staff's wages.    The minimum wage is to be determined after consultation with  representatives from local government, trade unions and  enterprises.    It is expected to be more than the local poverty relief  ceiling but less than the current wage level of the average  worker, according to the draft law.    Shanghai, Guangdong and Fujian already have minimum wage  laws.    The four-day conference will cover labour reform, changes in  calculating labour statistics and information, and medium- and  long- term goals for the ministry.</p>

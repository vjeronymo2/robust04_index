Velasquez from the Miraflores Palace Ayacucho Room in  Caracas--live]    [Text] Men and women of Venezuela: The year 1993, which  is drawing to an end, can be seen in our history as the door to  a new phase in the nation's life. This is so due to the  importance of the situations that were resolved in the framework  of democratic and institutional norms and due to the political,  economic, and social changes that the transformation crisis made  evident.    These changes, which began building up along the initial  phases of our democratic life, acquired dramatic urgency when  national maladjustments resulting from, originally, the foreign  debt pushed the people to protests in the streets and when new  political and community organizations appeared; in addition, the  people made demands due to the continued deterioration of the  majority's social and economic situation.    The ceaseless concentration of wealth and the state's  inability to handle efficiently health, security, education, and  housing conditions have also contributed to the situation I  mentioned.    These protests and the charges about corruption and the  trafficking of influence made daily through the media have  created in Venezuelans the awareness that they have to  participate in and watch how the country is doing, an awareness  the people did not have before.    The events of 27 February 1989 are especially significant,  because they took place before the promulgation and  implementation of the measures that would modify the state's  economic policies. The military events of 4 February and 27  November 1992; the new composition of regional and municipal  governments as a result of the elections of governors and mayors  in 1989 and 1992; the unprecedented and most important process  that culminated with my election as president of the country;  the new composition of the national and state legislative branch  that was the result of this December's elections; and the  election of the new president of the country as a product of an  alliance of political forces that have broken the traditional  process that for 35 years had assured two parties the control of  the state; the government's growing fiscal weakness to promptly  attend to national problems due to the obligations that the debt  has created; and increasingly marked social unbalances are all  undeniable signs of the historic conflict to which I have  referred.    To these factors we must add the growth of the population,  the states' economic, political, and cultural growth, and the  autonomy of their governments, as well as the importance of  organized communities that are out of the control of the  traditional parties.    In Venezuela, the historical gap between the early 1960's  and the present, which will reach the threshold of the new  millennium, can be seen clearly now. No sector of the country  has escaped this commotion. The established order in the  political system, the military's demands and proposals, and the  tension and struggle among economic sectors are expressions of  this cyclical change, which is also present in the fields of  science and arts, where the great progress that raises the  country's cultural level makes itself evident. We have strived  to look for a way out through elections. Although we know that  elections are not the only solution, it is the most immediate  instrument that the democratic system places in the hands of all  Venezuelans to attain peace in this new world to where history  is leading us.    We advanced toward the elections amidst incredulity,  threats,  and rumors. In the end, all of the political currents, both  traditional and those that represent the new participation  scheme, were present in the elections. It was a multiple  participation of the political sectors. From the beginning, my  government announced its main objective: to create the national  climate and conditions for the elections. We intended to turn  the elections into the basis for a national rapport of the  Venezuelan people. We intended for the winning candidate to  become the standard bearer of national reconciliation, so that  the hatred that has divided the country lately could be laid  down, so that the retaliatory spirit that has been marking the  struggle could be put down, and so that an understanding pact  reaching every sector could be attained, because the scope of  the existing social, economic, and fiscal problems underline the  need for general support so the task of governing Venezuela can  be performed.    Venezuela has elected Dr. Rafael Caldera as the new leader  of  the country. He is a fundamental personality in the democratic  process. To his experience as a statesman he adds the moral  authority of his life and the broad-mindedness provided by the  humanistic disciplines. The Supreme Electoral Council performed  the difficult task of presiding over elections that introduced  voting methods that proved difficult to understand due to their  innovative nature, hasty application, and the legislative  branch's tardiness in disseminating them. I am sure that these  very difficulties will allay us of the urgent need to finally  adopt the automatic methods used by the majority of countries at  present. In this new electoral process, the Armed Forces did  their duty as usual. This is a task they have been performing  since 1958 as guarantors of the electoral process and respecters  of the election results. The Armed Forces have reaffirmed their  institutional role during these 35 years of democratic life.    We will initiate a uniquely dramatic stage due to the urgent  need to solve problems accumulated over decades. The state's  present structure cannot bear the weight of these problems or  the behavior of the country's fundamental sectors whose vision  appears to have been anchored in a remote time in the past: a  sparsely populated Venezuela, a debt-free government, and an oil  revenue whose daily increase solved, or, even better, avoided  every problem. This was a Venezuela living under a gold bell,  but this time is over. The various sectors must agree on a  truce for an understanding for the success of the leaders whom  the country elected as its legitimate governors on 5 December.    The governments' difficulties resulted from, among other  causes, an economy in transition, dominated by our lacking  capacity for continuing to produce riches based on the income  distribution system and on petroleum income, which no longer  covers our needs nor does it allow us to continue to finance an  easy lifestyle.    Difficulties have also been caused by dissatisfaction, as  each one has a reason to feel frustrated by a deficient economic  performance after years of discontinued economic policies, often  incoherent, whose common denominator, until shortly ago, was  attempting to perpetuate the system of living off of rent at the  expense of huge economic distortions and visible inefficiencies.  Difficulties were caused by pressures from groups, sectors, and  institutions that aspire to continue to live off state funds.  Difficulties were caused by the high fiscal deficit due to  insufficient ordinary income, rigid spending with little  productivity, and the weakening of petroleum income based on the  traditional schemes. Difficulties were caused by the profound  deterioration of the state's structure, of its internal control  system, and, therefore, of its operational efficiency.  Difficulties are becoming bigger each day and the effects are  more harmful each day, as they generate defensive attitudes,  mistrust, and instability because they harshly strike the  sectors of lower income.    The nation must provide the next government with active and  permanent support throughout its term to allow it to eliminate  conflicts by substituting them with agreements, stopping the  deterioration in the distribution of income, and eliminating the  dangers of social violence, in a word, so that it can, with  national support, create a time of strategic consensus in which  today there is only mixed-up words and confused intentions.    The government over which I preside understood that its  basic  responsibility was to conclude a constitutional period and guide  the country to elections, but it also understood its duty of  guiding the economic transition with responsibility and not  differing the solution of problems but confronting them to  prevent the imbalances from growing.    We have tried to ensure that the political and economic  transition over which we are presiding would have the least  possible impact on Venezuela. Part of this context was the  government initiative for assuming the responsibility of the  Special Powers Law; we did this to leave an important  contribution in the areas of the greatest priority to contribute  toward setting Venezuela on the path to a healthy economic  growth.    We undertook banking legislation reform, which is necessary  for strengthening and modernizing the financial system and  making it more efficient. We undertook reforms to the housing  policy as well as to the system of the mortgage debtors to  bolster housing construction for the disadvantaged social groups  to obtain the most from the resources the state and depositors  may allocate toward this goal.    We took on the responsibility of creating new taxes during  very difficult election times with the conviction that every  Venezuelan must contribute to the state expenditures in order  for us to become permanent fiscal overseers of how Treasury  funds are used; these are essential for correcting the fiscal  deficit, and we considered the fact that we will never get rid  of that deficit by simply cutting the budget or asking for more  contributions from the petroleum industry.    We did it because a chronic fiscal deficit has been feeding  inflation and will continue to interfere with and threaten  national stability if proper corrective measures are not taken  soon. This situation -- a situation stemming from a large  foreign debt that was supposed to bring about the resources  necessary for its own amortization -- in practice did not yield  the expected results, and, instead, it grievously burdened  public finances. Along with this, we must add the great changes  that have taken place in the oil market over the past few years  and the scant political willingness to check our increasing  public expenditures. We have taken up this task as the first  step in a new fiscal order because it is urgent to take  simultaneous action in both public spending and fiscal revenues.  A sizable portion of the fiscal deficit has been compensated  for through devaluation, which has become a tax in disguise  which affects all sectors but weighs more heavily on the lower  income classes. In addition, this disguised tax has not  resulted in substantial increases in nontraditional exports as  originally intended.    The government's administrative actions in the essential  areas of local politics, international relations, economy,  finances, and other areas will be discussed in detail in the  speech we will present to Congress this coming January. During  our government's tenure, we have witnessed a stronger national  willingness to create the basis for a sincere understanding to  overcome the difficulties impeding our progress. This certainty  is the result of countless discussions, consultations, and  proposals presented to those who represent the most diverse  local sectors. This is the singular voice of all regions. The  Catholic Church has been present at all times in the search for  a way out. Political, entrepreneurial, and labor sectors, and  universities and citizens agree that today, more than ever,  there is a willingness to join forces and lay aside rivalries to  resolve the crisis.    Venezuela will indeed resolve its crisis, and 1994 will mark  the beginning of a recovery by the hand of the new government  aided by the national determination to cope with problems and  resolve them positively, fully aware of the new country's  demands. Venezuela will overcome its crisis because we are  participants in an unprecedented political transition that has  proven the validity of our allegiance to democracy.    Venezuela will overcome the crisis because its main  problems have been identified. Some problems are being  resolved, while others remain in the hands of the government  that a great many people elected for five years, thereby  demonstrating their trust.    Venezuela will overcome the crisis because it is  increasingly  understood that inflation is the worst evil which needs to be  corrected. This understanding is necessary to take action to  fight this evil, and this is always difficult.    Venezuela will overcome the crisis because it has realized  that the straightening out of finances is necessary and cannot  be postponed, and this fact must be faced not only through a  more efficient and honest administration, but also with income  generated through taxes.    It has been demonstrated that the framework established in  1992 -- reforms to the organic laws on public credits, the  budget system, and the Central Bank Law -- is a useful tool that  is changing the trends in events and is revealing the fact that  there is a fiscal crisis, that this has harmful effects, that  essential solutions must be found without a delay in facing  problems, that requests made to the treasury must be rational,  and that we must recognize that some demands cannot be met, as  in the recent past, because the costs of not recognizing this  would have to be covered by the rest of society by means of  inflation and high interest rates resulting from fiscal deficits.    The crisis will be overcome because the country's leaders  know it is urgent and necessary to face this difficult social  situation, because the poverty levels are increasingly high,  because imbalances in income are becoming intolerable, and  because of persisting deficiencies in the institutional  capabilities of the social sector -- that is, the public and  private organizations that provide essential social services.    We are dedicated to making reforms that distribute the costs  of the adjustments policy. The big differences that exist are  the main cause of social discontent.    The crisis will be overcome because the Venezuelan people  reject and want to fight the degradation of moral values;  because the Venezuelan people are prepared to face the challenge  of modern times; and because the new generations have  professional scientific, business, and management training and  know that there have been global changes that demand that we  understand and participate in the integration process.    The crisis will be overcome in order that the Venezuelans,  thanks to the work and creativeness of all, may again believe in  the possibility of every new generation living better than the  previous one and in building a society capable of generating  enough well-being that will enable it to again be a country with  hopes.    On the threshold of 1994, I wish all the Venezuelan people  and those who have decided to live in Venezuela the best of  life. Have a good day. [applause]</p>

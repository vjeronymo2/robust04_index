In January, the city approved 223 foreign-funded  enterprises.  Promised investment recorded a 500 million U.S. dollar total, of  which 300 million U.S. dollars is from abroad.    Deputy Mayor Ye Disheng attributed the city's charm to its  comprehensive industrial system, convenient communications and  above all, its 600,000-strong scientific and technological  force, including undergraduates at nearly 100 institutions of  higher learning in Beijing and Tianjin.    In addition to over 70 million U.S. dollars for the  Chengtangzhuang heating and power plant from Ka Shing-li, a  well-known Hong Kong tycoon, on the last day in 1993, there have  been many projects established in the last month:    On January 3, Malaysia's Gold Lion group signed a contract  with the city, with an investment of 4.5 billion yuan in such  fields as auto manufacturing and housing renovation.    On January 5, a conglomerate from the Republic of Korea held  a discussion with the local government on the feasibility of a  chemical project worth 400 million U.S. dollars.    On January 10, Innovation International (H.K.) Ltd. decided  to inject one billion yuan into a housing project, with another  250 million yuan on a heating and power plant.    On January 18, Hong Kong's Kuop Group signed an agreement  with the city's Hexi (the west bank of the Haihe River) area to  build a commercial mansion. It also plans to build projects in  the Tianjin development zone.    On January 20, Taiwan investors poured 600 million U.S.  dollars into the Gangwan Industrial Park.    Meanwhile, over 60 inspection teams from countries such as  the U.S., Germany, Italy, Japan and Singapore lined up to enter  the city.    Average investment for each project stands at over two  million U.S. dollars, double the investment scale last year.  And there have been 15 projects funded with more than five  million U.S. dollars each.</p>

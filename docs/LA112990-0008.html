			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CULTURAL CLASH IN SAUDI ARABIA  </P> <P> Saudi Arabia's recent political actions repressing women make it clear that the  United States is not in the Persian Gulf to protect freedom, democracy or human  rights. We should not use our resources or the men and women of our armed  forces to defend the interests of a country that subjugates a segment of its  people. We will never set the moral standard for the world as long as we  continue to compromise our principles.  </P> <P> ROCHELLE M. LINDSEY  </P> <P> JODY COHAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOY, 8, KILLED ON FREEWAY NEAR BORDER CHECKPOINT  </P> <P> An 8-year-old boy believed to have been an undocumented immigrant from Mexico  en route to family in Orange County was struck by a car and killed along  Interstate 5 north of the San Clemente border checkpoint early Wednesday.  </P> <P> He was run down about 12:15 a.m. as he and six others, including his mother and  three siblings, were crossing the busy freeway in the early-morning darkness,  authorities said.  </P> <P> The boy was identified as Constantino Loreto Marin, a resident of the Mexican  Pacific Coast city of Acapulco. He was dead at the scene.  </P> <P> He was the 10th pedestrian believed to have been an undocumented Mexican  immigrant to be struck and killed this year along a 10-mile stretch of  Interstate 5 in northern San Diego County, where illegal immigrants finding  their way north frequently cross the freeway.  </P> <P> Since 1987, according to the California Highway Patrol, 33 pedestrians believed  to have been undocumented immigrants have been killed along Interstate 5 in  that area.  </P> <P> All apparently were trying to bypass inspection at the U.S. Border Patrol  checkpoint on the highway.  </P> <P> Undocumented immigrants heading toward the Los Angeles area from the Mexican  border have long attempted to walk around the checkpoint, subjecting themselves  to the hazards of fast-moving freeway traffic.  </P> <P> Women and children often are the most vulnerable, officials say, because they  cross the roadways more slowly. U.S. immigration authorities say more and more  women and children are entering the United States illegally from Mexico, often  seeking to reunite with husbands and fathers who have recently become legal  under the amnesty program.  </P> <P> "This just shows how much desperation there is out there," said Roberto  Martinez, an immigrant-rights activist in San Diego.  </P> <P> Many of the victims are from rural areas and are unaccustomed to high-speed  freeways. In addition, they reportedly have often been traveling for hours and  are exhausted by the time they try to cross the freeway.  </P> <P> The California Department of Transportation has placed flashing signs along  Interstate 5 warning motorists of the potential presence of pedestrians, but  the deaths have continued to mount.  </P> <P> The boy killed early Wednesday was believed to have been en route to the  Anaheim-area home of relatives, according to the Mexican consul general in San  Diego. However, his precise destination and the identity of his family members  in the United States were not known, said Marcela Merino, a Mexican consular  official in San Diego.  </P> <P> He was hit by a rented 1990 Chevrolet Corsica driven by Sharon K. Frisby of  Mesa, Ariz., according to Stephen Tomasiak, a traffic officer with the CHP in  Oceanside. The vehicle was traveling about 60 miles an hour. The driver was not  cited because she could not have avoided the accident, the CHP said.  </P></p>

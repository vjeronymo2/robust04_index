			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Markets: Inchcape's fall from favour - The Bottom Line Inchcape's decision this week not to increase its 15 per cent stake in Gestetner, the distributor of office equipment and photographic supplies, has focused attention on the international motors, marketing and business services group. Although Gestetner's shares fell on the announcement, Inchcape's rose - partly reflecting City relief that the larger group had dropped any idea of launching a full bid for Gestetner, which would probably have required a rights issue. However, Inchcape shares remain 25 per cent below this year's peak level of 606p, which they reached at the end of January. This is partly due to the adverse impact of the strong Japanese yen on the group, which does a lot of its business in and from the Far East. Charles Mackay, Inchcape's chief executive, said the decision not to lift the group's stake in Gestetner was taken for strategic reasons - rather than any concern for market reaction. As the chart shows, Inchcape's shares were uprated in the early 1990s, as the market warmed to its management strategy and exposure to the fast-growing Pacific Rim. The group's strong presence in Hong Kong means it is well placed to benefit from increased development in China. How justified is the recent decline in the group's share price? Last year was certainly a tough one for Inchcape. The motors business, which now accounts for just over half of the group's operating profits, was hit by a sharp decline in the continental European market and the higher cost of Japanese vehicles. The continuing Japanese recession hit the group's marketing activities, which also suffered when the Chinese authorities imposed austerity measures to slow the pace of the boom sweeping the southern provinces. Yet Inchcape still managed to increase its pre-tax profits and earnings last year. Even a downbeat statement on the current trading at May's agm said the group was cautiously optimistic that it would again grow profits from last year's level of Pounds 272m. Inchcape has certainly been active in recent years. Its acquisition of TKM for Pounds 383m in 1992 made it into the world's largest independent distributor of motors. This April's purchase of the insurance broker Hogg for Pounds 177m created - when combined with the group's own insurance broking subsidiary, Bain Clarkson - the seventh largest insurance broker in the world. Current forecasts put the shares on a prospective multiple of about 14 - a discount to the market as a whole of more than 20 per cent. Yet as recently as last year, the shares were on a 40 per cent premium to the market. Stock markets have a tendency to overshoot. Arguably the enthusiasm for Inchcape as a Far Eastern play became overdone in the early 1990s, but the recent correction looks equally extreme. Certainly most City analysts now have the shares as a buy or a hold. Mike Smith, an analyst with Robert Fleming Securities, points out that there has been a strong correlation between the yen/dollar rate and Inchcape's share price in the past two years. 'It appears obvious from this that, as and when there is a reversal from this yen strength, the shares will begin to regain their previous momentum.' Calling the turn on the dollar/yen exchange rate is no game for the small shareholder, and there seems scant prospect of currency stability in the immediate future. However, Inchcape's credentials as a well managed play of Far East remain intact. This month it bought a motor distributor in the Chinese city of Nanjing and formed a joint venture to promote sales of consumer goods in central China. The group is well placed to benefit from the gathering strength of the British motors market and will also benefit from recovery in continental Europe. By declining to increase its exposure to Gestetner, Inchcape has removed one potential area of uncertainty which was unsettling the market. For investors prepared to take a medium to long-term view, the recent fall in the share price presents a buying opportunity.</p>

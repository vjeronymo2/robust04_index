			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / US special zone bids invited President Bill Clinton yesterday called for applications from cities and rural areas seeking to be designated as 'empowerment zones' and to receive tax breaks and federal grants. The administration will pick six urban and three rural zones to benefit from the new privileges of an empowerment zone, including wage credits for businesses hiring local residents, extra tax write-offs and a 50 per cent capital gains tax exclusion for small business investments. Each urban empowerment zone - similar to what used to be called an enterprise zone under Republican administrations - will also receive Dollars 100m in grants for social services; rural zones will get Dollars 40m each. In another 95 'enterprise communities', small businesses will be allowed to issue tax exempt bonds. These communities will also receive federal grants. Several Indian reservations will also benefit. 'We have to give special attention to those areas that have been left behind in the ghetto,' Vice-President Al Gore said yesterday at a White House ceremony to launch the programme, which is expected to cost around Dollars 2.5bn in tax breaks and Dollars 1bn in grants. The creation of urban enterprise zones was a central element in Mr Clinton's election campaign, but the plan has been considerably modified by Congress. Its scope has been reduced and rural communities added to placate powerful congressional interests.</p>

Section 1945.163 is amended by revising paragraph (d) to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1945.163  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Determining qualifying losses, eligibility for EM loan(s) and the maximum amount of each.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Compensation for losses.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All financial assistance provided through any disaster relief program and all compensation for disaster losses received from any source by an EM loan applicant will reduce the applicant's loss by the amount of such compensation. All such compensation will be considered in determining the maximum amount of loss loan entitlement. Disaster related assistance/compensation will not be considered in the EM eligibility calculation. The amount of any disaster program benefits received from ASCS, including the Emergency Feed Assistance Program (EFAP), Emergency Conservation Program (ECP), and Disaster Program payments will be considered as compensation for losses (ASCS Deficiency Payments are not to be considered as compensation).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Section 1945.169 is amended by revising paragraph (j) to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1945.169  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Security.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (j)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Crop insurance.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All recipients of EM loans must agree, as a condition of the loan, to obtain multi-peril crop insurance under the Federal Crop Insurance Act for the coming year's crop. When one of the conditions of paragraph (j)(1) of this section exists, the approval official will document in the applicant's file the basis for not requiring crop insurance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Applicants will not be required to obtain crop insurance when any one of the following conditions exists:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Crop insurance is not available for the crop, i.e., there is no open season and no opportunity to acquire crop insurance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The financial projections on which the loan approval is based indicate that the premium cost of the required insurance would prevent the applicant from projecting a feasible plan, and thus disqualifying the applicant for loan assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) When crops are the primary source of repayment for EM loans, FmHA will require an ``Assignment of Indemnity'' on the borrower's crop insurance policy(ies).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) When EM loans are based on physical losses only, crop insurance will only be required when loan funds will be used for annual production expenses. In such cases, the same conditions will apply as stated in paragraph (j)(1) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) When the payment of crop insurance premiums is not required until after harvest, the premiums may be paid by releasing insured crop(s) sale proceeds, notwithstanding the limits of &sect;&sect;1962.17 and 1962.29(b) of subpart A of part 1962 of this chapter. If the borrower's crop losses are sufficient to warrant an indemnity payment, the premium due will be deducted by the insurance carrier from such payment. The FmHA County Office will maintain a record on Form FmHA 1905&hyph;12, ``Monthly Expirations,'' of the dates which each borrower's crop insurance premium(s) is due. This is in accordance with FmHA Instruction 1905&hyph;A, a copy of which is available in any FmHA office.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) When an applicant purchases the necessary crop insurance as a condition to receiving an EM loan and, after the EM loan is closed, allows the policy(ies) to lapse or be cancelled before completion of the production year, the borrower will become immediately liable for full repayment of all principal and interest outstanding on any EM loan made on the condition of obtaining crop insurance. The loan approval official will insert this requirement in item 41 of Form FmHA 1940&hyph;1, ``Request for Obligation of Funds,'' which is signed by the applicant and the FmHA loan approval official. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

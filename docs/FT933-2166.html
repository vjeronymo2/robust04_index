			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Warsaw sends reform warning eastwards: The Polish economy had hitherto been a source of encouragement THE ELECTORAL victory of the two political parties with their roots in Poland's communist past imparts a new and negative spin to the country's track record as the harbinger of change in a volatile region. It was Polish economists, led by Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, working closely with US academic advisers such as Harvard professor Jeffrey Sachs, who pioneered 'shock therapy' economic reforms in eastern Europe four years ago. After taking the medicine, Poland became the first country to plunge into recession in 1990 and the first to resume economic growth two years later. Now, as the election results have made clear, Poles have become the first to register a strong political protest against the social and economic costs of the painful transition to a market economy. The resurgence of Poland's neo-communists could change not only the political map of Poland but send shudders throughout the former Soviet empire. In Hungary, the conservative coalition, which has introduced market reforms that have attracted more than Dollars 5bn in foreign investment, faces a similar backlash. In Budapest, the xenophobic nationalist right, led by Mr Istvan Csurka, has been making the headlines. But the reformed communists, led by Mr Gulya Horn, have also been vying to take votes away from the centre parties, including the youthful Fidesz party. Only the Czech Republic has been able to produce a leader with the tenacity to argue the pro-market reform case tirelessly and clearly, in speeches and through his weekly column in a popular newspaper: Mr Vaclav Klaus, a passionate advocate of privatisation. The promise of Poland's neo-communists to square the circle of reform without pain is clearly gaining credence. Lithuania, Poland's north-eastern neighbour, sent out the first warning signal six months ago when this former Soviet Baltic state re-elected the new-style communists to power. Until now the success of Poland's economic reforms, measured by well-stocked shops, rapidly rising industrial growth and labour productivity, a growing inflow of foreign capital, declining inflation and a successful switch to western markets after the collapse of Comecon, has been a great source of encouragement to the embattled pro-market reformers in the former Soviet states. The positive results of Poland's adherence to tight spending and budget deficit targets, imposed by the International Monetary Fund, helped the small band of Russian reform economists to persuade President Boris Yeltsin to support their efforts to stabilise the economy. The Polish experience thus gave substance to the intellectual arguments of those in Russia who favoured rapid economic reform. It helped them overcome the siren songs of powerful men from the factory nomenklatura elite who argued that it was impossible for the heavily-militarised Soviet command economy to be transformed into a functioning market economy in a hurry. The trump card of the go-slow brigade was, and remains, the argument that the social costs of high unemployment and declining living standards would make such change politically impossible and raise the risk of a bloody revolt. This argument echoed through the 10-week-long Polish election campaign with subtle but important differences. Mr Alexander Kwasniewski, the 39-year-old leader of Poland's Left Democratic Alliance (SLD), does not argue against the basic thrust of the economic reform strategy introduced by Mr Balcerowicz, nor does he ignore the benefits of IMF and World Bank supervision or the need to continue privatisation. Under its pragmatic new leaders, the SLD presented itself to the electorate as the party best able to guarantee the continuation of economic reform. This could only continue, the party's young leaders argued, if the economic and social costs borne by the poorest sections of the community were alleviated. But to deliver the goods, Mr Kwasniewski believes that it will take at least four more years of market-orientated reform under a stable government. Without any false modesty he is putting his party forward as the guarantor of that stability. Editorial Comment, Page 19</p>

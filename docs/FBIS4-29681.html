			<p>BFN     [Text] Yomitan -- The Japan-U.S. Joint Committee has  established a task force to deal with the issue concerning the  return of Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield. Yomitan village is  welcoming this move. Deputy Mayor Keizo Yasuda said: "The  official establishment of the task force will help promote the  study of specific measures (for the airfield's return). This is  a big step forward."    Meanwhile, the village is surprised that besides "the issue  of looking for a substitute for the parachute training area in  the airfield," "the possibility of removing Onna communications  site" is also included in the items the task force is to  discuss. The village has long thought that there was little  possibility that the Onna communications site (also called the  elephant's cage) would be removed. Thus, it has demanded the  return of a part (0.6 hectare) of the airfield, not the whole of  it, which covers 53 hectares. Taking into account the assertion  that a radio wave buffer zone is indispensable for the  communications site, the village has drawn up a returned land  development plan that does not hinder the functions of the  communications site. Thus, the village is perplexed at the fact  that the task force will study the communications site's  removal. Yasuda said: "We never expected the removal of the  communications site would surface."    Nevertheless, the village is welcoming the establishment of  the task force. Yasuda said: "It can be said that this is the  result of our campaign calling for the airfield's return. We  have conducted the campaign since Okinawa's reversion to Japan  20 years ago. We expect and believe that a concrete result (a  decision to return the airfield to the village) will be achieved  in time for the 50th anniversary of the end of the Pacific war."</p>

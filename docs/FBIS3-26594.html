			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, February 9 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President  Bill Clinton announced here today that NATO has approved an  ultimatum on the Bosnian Serbs to remove heavy weapons from  around Sarajevo and stop shelling the Muslims within 10 days.    Speaking at a White House press conference, Clinton said  NATO  forces "stand ready" to carry out air strikes against "anyone,  anyone" who further launch shells.    NATO made a similar announcement, with more details, in  Brussels, Belgium, minutes later.    Just before the NATO announcement, the Bosnian Serbs and  Muslims reached a new ceasefire, on top of the numerous ones  that failed before.    Clinton welcomed the move, hoping the latest ceasefire would  really hold this time.    He said Washington has important interest in seeing the end  of the Bosnian carnage.    Although the situation does not justify U.S. unilateral  actions, it deserves active U.S. efforts and leadership in  seeking a diplomatic solution to the conflict and otherwise,  Clinton said.    In response to a question on Russia's opposition to the NATO  air strikes ultimatum, Clinton said attempts earlier today to  call President Boris Yeltsin had failed and he would try to talk  to him later.    Clinton said he hopes the Russians would at least  understand,  if not agree with, the NATO move.    Russia has traditional and historical links with the Serbs  and Clinton stressed that the NATO threat "applies to anyone,  not only the Serbs."    The President said he was grateful for the support of the  countries with soldiers in Bosnia, such as France, Britain,  Canada and Spain.</p>

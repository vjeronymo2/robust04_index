			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Bull pleads for FFr9.2bn aid: Alan Cane and John Ridding report on the plight of the French computer maker GROUPE Bull, the troubled computer manufacturer, is asking the French government for FFr9.2bn (Pounds 1bn) to fund a package of measures designed to restore the state-owned company to profitability. The company has lost FFr15bn in the past three years. The package includes a fundamental transformation of the way the company carries out its business. Restructuring will continue and there may be further factory closures. Politically sensitive steps, such as phasing out production of personal computers at Villeneuve D'Ascq, near Lille, and St Joseph, near Chicago, are not ruled out. The managing directors of Bull subsidiaries outside France are likely to find their autonomy drastically curtailed. They will be obliged to follow business strategies laid down in Paris. The essential details of the plan have been agreed since the end of June, it is understood. Over the past three months Mr Bernard Pache, Bull's chairman, has been negotiating with the government over the size of the investment it is prepared to make. An announcement is expected soon. Mr Pache, formerly head of the French coal board, was appointed last year with instructions to cut costs and return the company to profitability. The government has put Bull on its list of 21 privatisation candidates, but the computer manufacturer's parlous state make this a remote prospect. Observers believe it has little option, therefore, than to make a significant capital injection. But this is likely to bring the French government into conflict with the competition authorities in Brussels, which are already questioning whether the French are ploughing anti-competitive subsidies into their computer champion. An investigation into FF2.5bn given in February by the former government is expected to be announced this week. Bull, Europe's second largest indigenously owned computer company after Olivetti of Italy, has been hurt by fundamental changes in the computer industry. These have forced down prices and profit margins and lessened the importance of mainframe computers, traditionally the largest contributor to Bull's revenues. The company was slow to exploit personal computers. The purchase of Zenith Data Systems, of the US, to retrieve the situation has proved a disaster.</p>

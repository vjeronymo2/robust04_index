			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alvaro Ayala] </F>   [Text] Two marine infantrymen have accused Army Colonel  Rodrigo Quinones of being the head of an intelligence group that  murdered at least 100 union leaders in the central Magdalena  region, mainly in Barrancabermeja.    One of the marines has served for eight a half years in the  Navy and as a result of his duties was responsible for a  logistics office where hired killers were paid.    Everything was uncovered when Col. Rodrigo Quinones gave the  order to execute several subordinates in order to conceal what  was taking place. In addition, the two marines indicated that  the U.S. Government is seeking to establish a military base in  the Colombian pacific coast through the region of Bahia Solana  in Choco Department.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified marine] The Venezuelan case  is clear evidence that there is an intention to destabilize the  region with the objective of increasing an arms buildup in the  region because of its location and because the Americans have  always been interested in the bay area.    [Ayala] How did the Army intelligence network in the middle  Magdalena region operate?    [Marine] The only thing the network did was to channel all  information and leave everything on Rodrigo Quinones' desk. He  in turn would determine who would be eliminated as he did with  journalist (Ibal Jaime). Quinones said that Jaime was making  too many inquiries and there was need to silence him or get rid  of him. (Ibal Jaime) was followed until he was finally killed.  The same thing happened to some union members and human rights  activists.    [Ayala] As an Armed Forces serviceman, were you ever a  member  of a group that became involved in illegal activities?    [Marine] I was part of a special forces group in 1986 and  1987 that operated in the central Magdalena region and was  involved in several murders in the Antioquia sierra.    [Ayala] At that time, whom did the group attack?    [Marine] During that period we executed several union  members  of the petroleum [words indistinct].    [Ayala] The same group to which you belonged?    [Marine] Yes, the special forces group. In addition, the  central Magdalena authorities cooperated with us and [words  indistinct].    [Ayala] Did the group become involved in anything illegal in  Bahia Solano?    [Marine] I was ordered to eliminate two persons in Bahia  Solana. I was instructed to organize as well as to plan  everything and that several persons would be sent to assist me  in eliminating someone in Bahia Solano. I refused to do it  because it was against my principles. However, when I returned  I found out I had earned Mr. Rodrigo Quinones' enmity.    [Ayala] Who ordered the execution of those persons?    [Marine] We received the order from Mr. Rodrigo Quinones,  but  through Major Jairo Osorio and Captain Rafael Colon.    [Ayala] Whom where you ordered to execute?    [Marine] Well, local investors and businessmen.    [Ayala] What was the reason for wanting to eliminate them?    [Marine] For the simple reason that they were the most  visible persons in the community. It is not the same thing to  kill a tramp as it is to kill someone who is investing in the  region. This would prompt massive protests as well as unrest  and would allow military intervention which is what we were  seeking. [end recording]    At this time the former marines are under the protection of  a  human rights organization and Attorney General Carlos Gustavo  Arrieta is personally conducting the investigation.</p>

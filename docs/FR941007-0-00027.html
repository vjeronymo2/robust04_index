This rule is necessary because of a change in the method that the National Council of State Boards of Nursing employs in administering the permanent state licensure examination (NCLEX). In response to this change in testing procedures, this rule provides that nurses entering the United States on the basis of a temporary license issued by the state of intended employment must pass the NCLEX within six months after the date of their initial admission to the United States. The rule also clarifies for businesses and the general public the requirements for the admission of foreign nurses into the United States. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> dates:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> This interim rule is effective October 7, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Written comments must be submitted on or before December 6, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> addresses:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Please submit written comments, in triplicate, to the Director, Policy Directives and Instructions Branch, Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street NW., room 5307, Washington, DC 20536.

The Act requires, among other things, that the nurse must have either: (1) a full and unrestricted license to practice professional nursing in the state of intended employment or (2) have passed an approximate examination (under current 8 CFR 214.2 (h)(3)(iii), the examination given by the Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools (CGFNS)) and have a temporary license for the state of intended employment. Under the current regulations, a foreign nurse who is accorded H&hyph;1A status based on a temporary license after passage of the CGFNS is required to sit and pass the first available permanent state licensing examination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prior to April 1, 1994, the permanent state licensing examination was given twice a year, in February and July. Under current 8 CFR 214.2(h)(3)(v)(B), a nurse admitted in H&hyph;1 classification based on passage of the CGFNS examination and temporary licensure who fails the permanent state licensing examination or fails to sit for the first available permanent licensing examination is no longer eligible for H&hyph;1A status. On April 1, 1994, however, the National Council of State Boards of Nursing altered its testing procedures and now offers the permanent state licensing examination on a walk-in basis, six days a week. Thus, the current regulatory requirement that the alien sit and pass the first available state nursing examination is no longer appropriate since the test is now available to the nurse immediately upon entry into the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to provide a nurse with sufficient time to acclimate himself or herself to the country and to prepare for the examination, the Service has determined that a nurse who has been accorded H&hyph;1A status on the basis of a temporary license shall be granted a period of six months after the date of entry to sit and pass the permanent state licensing examination. After passage of the permanent state licensing examination, the alien's employer must file an application to extend the stay of the alien. At the time of the application for extension of stay, the alien's employer must demonstrate that the alien has remained in H&hyph;1A status continuously from the time of his or her admission by submitting evidence reflecting that the alien has been employed continuously as a registered professional nurse since entry. An alien who does not pass the permanent state licensing examination with six months of his or her admission or fails to maintain a valid H&hyph;1A status is not eligible for a further extension of stay. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Despite these changes, petitions for H&hyph;1A aliens entering the United States based on a temporary license will continue to be approved for a period not to exceed one year. Further, an H&hyph;1A alien shall be admitted to the United States for the validity of the supporting petition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service's implementation of this rule as an interim rule, with provisions for post-promulgation public comment, is based upon the ``good cause'' exception found at 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). Because of changes in the National Council of State Boards of Nursing testing procedures, immediate implementation of the interim rule is necessary to ensure foreign nurses admitted to the U.S. in H&hyph;1A status based on possession of temporary licenses an adequate and realistic period of time to prepare for the permanent state licensing examination and therefore, continued eligibility for H&hyph;1A classification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLICE ACADEMY II  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Police Department says it has no plans to take any more land  from Elysian Park for its proposed Police Academy expansion. That may or may  not be. The Citizens Committee to Save Elysian Park has seen a breakdown of  planned building square footage (224,000 square feet) but, to date, LAPD has  failed to show us how the buildings will fit on the site it currently occupies.  We have seen plans that include three parking structures of two and three  stories, not underground as Capt. Gregory R. Berg states (Letters, April 2), to  accommodate 1,000 cars. Nowhere in any of the plans is there any mention of  enclosed firing ranges.  </P> <P> Capt. Berg's claim that the issue of moving the Academy out of the park was  "extensively debated" in 1972 is misleading. In 1972, the city administrative  officer submitted a report to the City Council that studied complete cost  estimates of alternative sites for a new Police Academy.  </P> <P> Of the 29 sites considered, six were judged to have good potential. Two would  have required no land acquisition cost. A third site of 60 acres (Ascot  Reservoir) was both centrally located and would have cost only $600,000. The  LAPD, however, did not wish to consider any of these alternatives. There was no  debate. There were no public hearings. What ensued was a debate among City  Council members whether or not to place Charter Amendment U on the ballot.  </P> <P> Although a majority of then-council members had long sought to oust the police  department from Elysian Park land, the council, under intense pressure from  LAPD, agreed 8 to 7 to place the proposed charter amendment on the ballot. This  proposed to transfer jurisdiction of 21.46 acres of Elysian Park from the  Department of Recreation and Parks to the Department of Public Works.  </P> <P> LAPD stated that a "yes" vote would save taxpayers $15 million that it would  cost to relocate the Academy. Where that figure came from, we don't know. The  point to be made is that LAPD successfully used tax threats to gain a narrow  margin for the passage of Proposition U, and in November, 1972, 21 acres of  parkland was lost. Capt. Berg is obviously unaware of this history or he would  not have "seriously doubted" that voters would allow any land to be taken away  from the park in the future.  </P> <P> A Police Academy does not belong in a park. The training exercises and pistol  firing are not compatible with park enjoyment. The traffic the officers and  recruits generate add air and noise pollution. To increase the training  capacity threefold is what LAPD has in mind. To think that this would not  negatively impact the surrounding park is ridiculous.  </P> <P> We do not argue that LAPD needs better facilities to train our officers, but  please, not in Elysian Park.  </P> <P> SALLIE W. NEUBAUER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P>  Neubauer is president of Citizens Committee to Save Elysian Park.  </P> <P> </P></p>

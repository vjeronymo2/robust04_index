			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Observer: Len's last word 'As global as business itself' gushed a recent corporate ad for UBS, Switzerland's largest bank. Not so, according to Len Harwood, who resigned as head of debt capital markets at UBS in London last month. Indeed, Harwood blames his departure on UBS's lack of global presence. 'The big ticket deals these days go to firms with a global set-up,' claims Harwood in the latest issue of Euromoney magazine. 'I didn't see UBS becoming a global player.' Tough news for one of the few banks in the world still sporting a triple A credit rating. Then again, Harwood's view of UBS may have been coloured by the arrival from Bankers Trust, in December, of John Gianotti, who was appointed over his head to run origination and derivatives. Whatever the reason for his exit, the man once dubbed the 'Billy Graham of the euro-commercial paper market' doesn't expect to be out of work for long. His passion for the medium-term note market, in particular, remains undiminished judging by his personalised car number plate - A1 MTN.</p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Car trade warned of risk posed by thefts STOLEN cars are being offered for sale to the motor trade in such volumes as to present a risk to the viability of dealers who buy them inadvertently, according to HPI, the credit information agency. In the final quarter of last year 6,900 such cars were offered to traders, more than three times the level of a year previously, HPI's statistics show. The agency believes those figures considerably understate the extent of the activity because its statistics include only those cars offered to traders. They take no account of individuals who may have bought such cars privately. HPI describes the volume of car thefts as having reached 'epidemic' proportions. In last year's final quarter, one out of every 103 dealer inquiries about cars offered for sale resulted in the car being established as stolen. A 'security alert', indicating that a car was probably being offered for sale without the owner's consent, was issued for one in every 406 inquiries made in last year's final quarter - more than double the rate of the corresponding 1990 period. A quarter of cars inquired about were shown as being subject to a finance agreement. HPI emphasised that cars subject to such agreements remained the property of the finance house concerned.</p>

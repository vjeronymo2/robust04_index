			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Relationship to the Federal Response Plan (FRP)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Without a Stafford Act Declaration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Federal agencies will respond to radiological emergencies using the FRERP,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each agency in accordance with existing statutory and funding resources. The LFA has responsibility for coordination of the overall Federal response to the emergency. FEMA is responsible for coordinating non-radiological support using the structure of the Federal Response Plan (FRP).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. With a Stafford Act Declaration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When a Stafford Act Declaration has activated the FRP and an associated radiological emergency exists, the functions and responsibilities of the FRERP remain the same. The LFA coordinates the management of the radiological response with the Federal Coordinating Officer (FCO). Although the direction of the radiological response remains with the LFA, the FCO has the overall responsibility for coordination of Federal response in support of State and local governments under the FRP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Authorities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following authorities are the basis for the development of this Plan:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Nuclear Regulatory Commission Appropriation Authorization, Public Law 96&hyph;295, June 30, 1980, sec. 304. This authorization requires the President to prepare and publish a ``National Contingency Plan'' (subsequently renamed the FRERP) to provide for expeditious, efficient, and coordinated action by appropriate Federal agencies to protect the public health and safety in case of accidents at commercial nuclear power plants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Executive Order (E.O.) 12241, National Contingency Plan, September 29, 1980. This E.O. delegates to the Director of FEMA the responsibility for publishing the National Contingency Plan (i.e., the FRERP) for accidents at nuclear power facilities and requires that it be published from time to time in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Authorities for the activities of individual Federal agencies appear in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Concept of Operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The concept of operations for a response provides for the designation of one agency as the Lead Federal Agency (LFA) and for the establishment of onscene, interagency response centers. The FRERP describes both the responsibilities of the LFA and other Federal agencies that may be involved and the functions of each of the onscene centers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The concept of operations recognizes the preeminent role of State and local governments for determining and implementing any measures to protect life, property, and the environment in areas not under the control of a Federal agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Determination of Lead Federal Agency (LFA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency which is responsible for leading and coordinating all aspects of the Federal response is referred to as the LFA and is determined by the type of emergency. In situations where a Federal agency owns, authorizes, regulates, or is otherwise deemed responsible for the facility or radiological activity causing the emergency and has authority to conduct and manage Federal actions onsite, that agency normally will be the LFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following identifies the LFA for each specified type of radiological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Nuclear Facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Licensed by Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) or an Agreement State. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NRC is the LFA for an emergency that occurs at a fixed facility or regarding an activity licensed by the NRC or an Agreement State. These include, but are not limited to, commercial nuclear power reactors, fuel cycle facilities, gaseous diffusion facilities, and radiopharmaceutical manufacturers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Owned or Operated by DOD or DOE. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The LFA is either DOD or DOE, depending on which agency owns or authorizes operation of the facility. These emergencies may involve reactor operations, nuclear material and weapons production, radioactive material from nuclear weapons, or other radiological activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c. Not Licensed, Owned, or Operated by a Federal Agency or an Agreement State. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The EPA is the LFA for an emergency that occurs at a facility not licensed, owned, or operated by a Federal agency or an Agreement State. These include facilities that possess, handle, store, or process radium or accelerator-produced radioactive materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Transportation of Radioactive Materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Shipment of Materials Licensed by NRC or an Agreement State. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The NRC is the LFA for an emergency that involves radiological material licensed by the NRC or an Agreement State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

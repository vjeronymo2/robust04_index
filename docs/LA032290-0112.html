			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: NORWALK;  </P> <P> CHURCH EXPANSION DENIED WHEN NEIGHBORS COMPLAIN  </P> <P> Heeding the complaints of residents, the Norwalk City Council on Tuesday  rejected a proposal to expand the Dong Shin Presbyterian Church on Kenney  Street in the northwest corner of the city.  </P> <P> The church had purchased two neighboring houses, which it wanted to use for  Sunday school classes and parking.  </P> <P> But several residents objected to the expansion because it would bring more  traffic into the residential neighborhood. Residents complained that  churchgoers monopolize the curb parking on Kenney Street each Sunday, and that  they often park illegally.  </P></p>

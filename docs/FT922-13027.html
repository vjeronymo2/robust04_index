			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Kinnock leaves an empty legacy to successor The Opposition is shut down for re-pairs. These may take some time. I hope they do. A hasty patch-up following the devastating defeat of Labour last Thursday is unlikely to save the people's party from permanent electoral frustration and eventual extinction. A quick fix with the Liberal Democrats, who also did less well than expected, would have all the chances of success of two drowning parties clinging together. We must wait awhile. Politicians of a left-wing persuasion must be given time to think. The trouncing received at the hands of the Conservatives under Mr John Major has not yet begun to sink in. Labour could not manage to attract more than 35 per cent of the votes in mid recession after a campaign universally hailed as smoothly professional. If not then, when? The Lib Dems could not hold their optimum support when it became apparent that to plump for them would be to let Labour in. That was true in 1987 and 1992; who is to say that it will not hold good in 1996 or 1997? Certainly not Mr Neil Kinnock. The outgoing Labour leader, who announced his resignation yesterday, deserves full credit for reconstructing the party, but it has to be said that the legacy he leaves his successor is an empty one. This may be harsh, but it is the truth. He achieved a great deal, but in terms of winning the next election, it is as if it were nothing. A little reminder of recent history will show what I mean. When Mr Kinnock took over in October 1983, Labour was in ruins, shattered by the leadership of Mr Michael Foot and the consequential defection of many of its middle-class supporters to the Social Democrats. Its vote in that year's election was less than 28 per cent; last week it was seven percentage points higher. That is the most accurate measure of Mr Kinnock's bequest to his successor. There are other, perhaps more valuable heirlooms. Labour is no longer in favour of unilateral nuclear disarmament, withdrawal from the European Community, or the wholesale nationalisation of industry. During the past three years, it has devoted itself to becoming less frightening to middle-of-the-road voters. It has tried to emulate the continental social democrats it so admires. It has begun, ever so gingerly, to detach itself from the lethal embrace of the trade unions. Mr Kinnock worked hard on this successful transformation of a ragged and inchoate movement into a structured political machine. He demanded discipline of his followers and set a personal example of self-control. Yesterday's outburst against the Tory tabloids may have been imprudent, but you have only to recall their combined ferocity to understand his position. It would, however, be fatal for Labour to convince itself that it was defeated by the Daily Mail, the Daily Express and the Sun. It might have been less badly beaten without them, but the fears upon which these papers played - of higher mortgages, higher taxes and a prolongation of the recession - were genuinely felt by many voters. The arguments had to have some semblance of rationality to succeed. It would also be a mistake to assume that another four or five years of Kinnock-style modifications of party policy will be rewarded by victory next time. This is the trap inherent in the apparently unstoppable movement to elect Mr John Smith as successor. I have frequently expressed admiration for Mr Smith's political personality. He has handled the task of shadowing the chancellor with immense skill. What is being questioned, not least by those who would prefer a different leader, is his tactical judgment. This requires some explanation. A few weeks ago, I thought that his proto-budget, taxing higher earners and spreading the benefits, might have neutralised the political effect of the real Budget presented by Mr Norman Lamont. Now, with hindsight, it must be acknowledged that Labour fell into a trap. Once Mr Lamont had introduced his 20 per cent band for low earners, Messrs Kinnock and Smith felt obliged to find tax cuts of their own, however small. They therefore put aside all thought of phasing-in their proposed top rates. This gave verisimilitude to the Conservative charge that there would be higher taxes for all under Labour. It gave the black tabloids a basis of fact upon which to build their propaganda. Mr Smith would nevertheless be the leader best able to steady the opposition's nerve after last week's shock. Some Labour folk fear a further haemorrhage of support over the next few months, taking the party down to where Mr Kinnock found it. Mr Smith might be able to stop that by his mere presence. There is, however, a catch. Under present plans, the leadership election will take place before the end of June, using existing party rules. That means 40 per cent of the vote is in the hands of trade unions. This is the wrong way to elect a party leader for the 1990s. It would hamstring Mr Smith from the start. Worse, such a quick election could perpetuate the myth that the maintenance of party unity is of paramount importance. That would perpetuate unity all right - the unity of the political graveyard. For Labour is still hypnotised by its history. It continues to believe that it is a great party, with a noble destiny. Not so. Last week's 35 per cent popular vote strongly suggests that unless it makes a break with its own history it has no future. In short, the new Labour leader must risk disunity if he is to save the party. For everything must be questioned, and much must be changed. The divorce from the unions must be absolute. Reducing the block vote at annual conferences from 87 per cent to 70 per cent or even 50 per cent is no good. The correct figure is zero. Some of the dearest beliefs of the Labour movement must be re-examined. Mr Roy Hattersley has stuck doggedly to his belief that equality is of greater importance than anything else; he is now to retire without further hope of office. The proper level of taxation, the role of regulation in the market, the nature of the state - all need to be rethought, with the mental focus shifted away from the past century and towards the likely needs of the next. It may be that the conclusion is that so much would have to be altered that there would be no purpose in continuing with the Labour party. That is the Liberal Democrats' dream; they are as vultures perched. But they too live in a fantasy world. The debate within the non-Conservative parties should be accompanied by debate between them. Mr Kinnock's successor must reach out - to the Lib Dems and beyond - for ideas, shared principles, alliances, partners, supporters. Mr Tony Blair could do that, perhaps after a spell of apprenticeship under Mr Smith, or possibly as his deputy. Do not mistake me. Mr Smith would have been an excellent leader this year. The question remains - does he appreciate the scale of change now needed? Mr Kinnock never quite kept ahead of changing opinions. The policies that failed on Thursday might have succeeded in 1987. The danger for the opposition is that the next election will be fought by Labour, in fruitless half-hearted partnership with the Lib Dems, on policies that might have won last week.</p>

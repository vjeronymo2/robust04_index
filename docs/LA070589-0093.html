			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> CRASH KILLS NEWPORT MOTORCYCLIST  </P> <P> A 28-year-old Newport Beach man died when his motorcycle collided with a pickup  truck making a U-turn at MacArthur Boulevard and San Joaquin Hills Road in the  second traffic fatality in the county during the long Fourth of July weekend,  authorities said today.  </P> <P> An 86-year-old woman was struck by a car as she was crossing a street in  Huntington Beach on Monday in the earlier fatal accident. She died Tuesday at  UCI Medical Center, said Bruce Lyle, a supervisor with the coroner's office.  </P> <P> The motorcycle driver, Dietrich Charles Long, was heading south on MacArthur at  about 9:30 p.m. Tuesday when he was struck by a pickup driven by Ira Louis  Radstone, 21, of Lancaster, Newport Beach Police Lt.

The front wheel and fork of  his motorcycle landed 200 yards away in a ditch, Newman said.  </P> <P> He was treated by paramedics from the Newport Beach Fire Department and then  transferred to Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach, where he  died, Newman said.  </P> <P> Police did not cite or arrest Radstone, Newman said, but an investigation is  continuing.  </P></p>

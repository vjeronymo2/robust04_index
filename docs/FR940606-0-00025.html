			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For medium vessels, about 8 percent of the vessels are controlled with either a 90-percent efficient control device or an IFR or EFR with a continuous seal. All of the controlled medium-sized vessels contained liquids with vapor pressures of 13.1 kPa (1.9 psia). Because the arithmetic mean characteristics of the top 12 percent of the medium vessels would not represent the performance of any known technology, the EPA used the median as the average for these vessels. Thus, for medium-sized storage vessels, the floor determined by the average characteristics of the top 12 percent of the sources would require control of vessels storing liquids with vapor pressures of 13.1 kPa (1.9 psia) by either a 90-percent efficient control device or an IFR or EFR with a continuous seal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In selection of the control provisions for medium-sized storage vessels, EPA considered the regulatory alternatives that were presented in the April 22, 1994  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  document. These alternatives reflected a combination of: (1) The floor control for medium-sized storage vessels, which at the time of proposal, were equipped with the floor controls and (2) the proposed control provisions for medium-sized storage vessels which were equipped with no control or less efficient controls than the performance of the revised floor component for the source-wide floor. The EPA did not develop a regulatory alternative corresponding to application of the revised floor control level to all storage vessels. Such an alternative would have essentially the same control costs as the proposed control provisions, but would result in a lower emission reduction. Because the floor control would represent a less economically efficient option and would add to the complexity of the rule, this option was not formally evaluated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For medium storage vessels at existing sources, control at the regulatory alternative used to represent the floor control was estimated to cost $2.4 million/yr and to result in an emission reduction of 370 Mg/yr (110 tons/yr). The regulatory option for control level beyond the floor component is estimated to further reduce emissions by less than 100 Mg/yr (110 tons/yr) at an additional cost of $4 million/yr, or $48,000/Mg for each additional Mg of emission reduction. Due to the relatively high incremental costs and low emission reductions of this alternative, the EPA believes that the control level for the medium storage vessels component of the source-wide floor represented the maximum reduction achievable considering cost and other impacts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Administrative Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Docket <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The docket is an organized and complete file of all the information submitted to or otherwise considered by EPA in the development of this rulemaking. The principal purposes of the docket are: (1) To allow interested parties to identify and locate documents so that they can effectively participate in the rulemaking process and (2) to serve as the record in case of judicial review (except for interagency review materials) (Section 307(d)(7)(A)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information collection requirements of these provisions in this rule have been submitted for approval to the OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An Information Collection Request document has been prepared by the EPA (ICR No. 1414.02), and a copy may be obtained from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch, EPA, 401 M Street, SW., (2136), Washington, DC 20460, or by calling (202) 260&hyph;2740. These requirements are not effective until OMB approves them and a technical amendment to that effect is published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reporting and recordkeeping burden of the information collection requirements of the provisions for medium sized storage vessels are included in the estimate of the overall reporting burden, which is presented in ICR No. 1414.02. The information collection requirements for the entire rule has an estimated annual reporting burden averaging 1,400 hours per response, and an estimated annual recordkeeping burden averaging 5,400 hours per respondent. These estimates include time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch, EPA, 401 M Street, SW., (Mail code 2136); Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final action regarding provisions applicable to medium sized storage vessels in facilities subject to the HON has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the Order, the Administrator has assessed the potential costs and benefits of the regulatory action. The methods for and results of these cost and benefit analyses are described in the HON's Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA). The RIA was included in the HON docket at proposal, and thus it was made available for public comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

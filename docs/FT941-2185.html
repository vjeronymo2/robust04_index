			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: UAP up 32% despite steep domestic slide Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the insurance group which is the next candidate for the French government's privatisation programme, yesterday reported a 31.8 per cent increase in net profits to FFr1.42bn (Dollars 230m) in 1993 from FFr1.08bn in the previous year. The group, which is France's largest insurer and which recently fulfilled a long-standing ambition to expand into Germany by taking control of Colonia, said it had benefited from a 'strong improvement' in profits from foreign activities and increased asset sales. These helped to counter the steep fall in insurance profits within France and a FFr3.25bn charge for Banque Worms, its banking unit. Mr Jacques Friedmann, the financier who last year became chairman of UAP to orchestrate its privatisation, recently warned that profits would be at the lower end of expectations for 1993, at about FFr1.5bn. The profits were slightly below that forecast, given the gravity of Banque Worms' problems and the continuing pressure on the French insurance sector. But they are not expected to affect UAP's privatisation prospects. Mr Friedmann yesterday confirmed that UAP would stage a capital increase as part of the privatisation. He also announced plans to split UAP's shares into three. Other privatisation candidates have adopted similar tactics to make their shares more marketable. UAP mustered a 12.3 per cent increase in consolidated sales to FFr141.5bn in 1993. Life insurance interests, buoyed by a strong performance from Sun Life in the UK, saw sales rise 17.7 per cent to FFr74.1bn. The non-life arm increased 7 per cent to FFr67.4bn. UAP's French insurance interests suffered a 31.7 per cent fall in net profits to FFr948m, with profits outside France rising 8.6 per cent to FFr1.09bn. Banque Worms registered a FFr1.49bn loss, against a FFr1.53bn deficit in 1992.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Vatican/Iraq: 'Aziz Meets Sodano </F> on UN Embargo"]    [Text] (ANSA) Vatican City, June 27 -- The effects of the  UN embargo imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990  were examined here today in talks between Cardinal Secretary of  State Angelo Sodano and Iraqi Deputy Premier Tariq 'Aziz.    Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro told reporters later that  the Holy See is standing by its policy of urging a "periodic"  examination of the effects of embargoes such as those against  Iraq, Cuba and Serbia on the populations involved.    Only two days ago, Pope John Paul II urged religious and  international aid organisations to exercise their "inalienable  right to assist" Cuba despite the 23-year embargo against the  island, saying that the almost total ban on relations was only  hurting the poorest Cubans.    According to Navarro, 'Aziz, who met Cardinal Sodano at his  own request, briefed the prelate on the difficulties that the UN  embargo continues to create for his country, above all the  poorest Iraqis.    The spokesman pointed out that, in his New Year's speech to  the Vatican diplomatic corps, the pope voiced concern over the  effects of the embargoes and urged that they should be reviewed  periodically "to avoid deleterious collateral effects" on the  population.    The Vatican's policy on international embargoes started  taking shape at least as long ago as early last year. In  February 1993, the Vatican's representative at the UN, Msgr.  Renato Raffaele Martino, urged greater flexibility in the  embargo against Iraq, mentioning a "moral duty" because of its  aggravation of the country's "humanitarian" situation.    The following May, in a message to the Iraqis taken to  Baghdad by Cardinal Achille Silvestrini, the Vatican's man  responsible for Eastern Rite Catholic churches, the pope did not  mention the UN embargo, but he voiced the hope that the Iraqis  would soon be able to re-establish "mutual and fruitful"  relations with the rest of the world.    In the message, which was handed to President Saddam Husayn,  the pope added that Iraq's emergence from isolation should take  place in a "spirit of reconciliation and peace, within a  framework of international solidarity and respect for the common  good."    The papal missive also said the entire Catholic Church was  "near" the Iraqis in their suffering and stressed that the "weak  and innocent" were being forced to pay for "responsibilities for  which they are not responsible."    The pope also voiced concern over the exodus of Iraqi  Catholics since the Gulf war, voicing the hope that improved  living conditions would enable them to stay.</p>

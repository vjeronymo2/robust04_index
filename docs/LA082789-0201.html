			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFING: EVENTS IN THE NEWS THIS WEEK.  </P> <P> An 11-member citizens advisory group will meet at the Trabuco Canyon fire  station Monday and Wednesday to consider a county proposal to allow 1,700 new  homes and a new two-lane road to be built in the Foothill-Trabuco area. The  controversial plan is aimed at regulating growth in a 6,500-acre swatch of  backcountry northeast of Mission Viejo. The advisory group, made up of local  residents and property owners, will either endorse or reject the plan before it  goes to the county Planning Commission and ultimately the Board of Supervisors  for a vote. The plan has already drawn fire from both environmentalists and  developers.  </P></p>

			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Access to Equity: Closure would put 'brake on enterprise' VIEWED FROM the City, the threatened demise of the Unlisted Securities Market may be seen as the end of an experiment that has outlived its usefulness and profitability. For the growing medium-sized business and the venture capital community, the market's passing will be a serious setback. It will deprive small companies of an important method of financing growth through equity, and venture capitalists of a valuable exit from their investments. The USM played an important part in the rapid expansion of the venture capital industry during the 1980s. Worryingly, plans to shut the USM come at a time when concerns are growing about the ability of banks to provide loan finance. Chastened by losses on their small loans books, the banks are expected to be cautious about lending when the upturn comes. Now, if ever, is the time when small businesses need equity. Not that a stock market listing is the preferred outlet for the ambitious entrepreneur. Far more businesses opt for a trade sale - that is, a sale to another, usually larger company. In 1991, according to the European Venture Capital Association, twice as many UK companies chose a trade sale as went for a flotation. Trade sales make sense for a number of reasons. They allow the venture capitalist to get all his money back in one go and free the entrepreneur to retire or to start up all over again. They frequently realise more money than a listing because a trade buyer can benefit from filling a gap in his market or product range. Equally important, some business owners do not relish the obligations and limitations imposed by managing a quoted company. But even if trade sales have proved more attractive over the years, the shutting down of the USM option is causing serious concerns in the venture capital industry. 'Unless a young company can have access to the public market at an earlier stage than is now possible there will be a brake put upon enterprise,' says Mr Ronald Cohen, chairman of Apax Partners and a member of Cisco, the City Group for Smaller Companies. Companies could wait longer until they matched the criteria for a full market listing but this may mean market openings are missed or technological developments would have to be foregone. The founders might then find themselves forced to sell as the only way of finding the money for expansion. This would further worsen Britain's already poor record for generating independent, medium-sized companies on the model of the German Mittelstand. The lack of equity for small businesses and the poor liquidity for smaller UK listed stocks has prompted a flurry of activity aimed at creating alternatives. The options being considered are: A Europe-wide exchange owned and operated by the European venture capital industry. Provisionally titled the European Private Equity Exchange, this market would be self-regulating - operating as an investors' club. It would recommend valuations, provide a quotation service and complete transactions. The brainchild of Baring Venture Partners, a UK venture capital company, it would allow venture capitalists to trade their portfolio companies. National exchanges run on the model of the Dutch Participations Exchange launched by the Dutch venture capital industry. This exchange would open twice a year, provisionally May and November, and would allow venture capitalists to auction their shareholdings in investee companies. Both EPEE and the Dutch exchange are being studied by the European Venture Capital Association though there are concerns that EPEE may be over-ambitious. A relaunched USM-style market. If the London Stock Exchange can be persuaded to relaunch a smaller companies' market it needs to be in a radically different format, says Mr Robert Drummond, chairman of the British Venture Capital Association. It must not carry a label that suggests it is a second-class market. The USM and the Third Market - closed in 1990 - both carried titles which branded them as less than first-class arenas for the trading of shares. Any new market must also have sensible rules designed to appeal to the owners of, and investors in, small growth businesses. It must not be weighed down by excessive legislation intended to protect investors from their own follies. Finally, says Mr Drummond, the trading system should not depend on finding marketmakers but, like the US Nasdaq market, it should be a screen-based system allowing deals between principals. If none of these proposals comes to anything, UK companies might consider a listing on Nasdaq itself. Nasdaq says it has sought links with a European exchange to provide a service for European companies but they have seen its approaches as a threat. As it is, more than 250 non-US companies already have a Nasdaq listing. Nasdaq has 4,400 stocks quoted on its two main markets and listed 422 new entrants in 1992. It is a successful market which can offer smaller companies liquidity unparalleled on any of the European stock exchanges. But a Nasdaq listing means frequent visits to the US to stay in touch with local investors and offends European sensibilities. Until a viable market place for smaller company stocks can be established in Europe, however, Nasdaq will remain an attractive option for growing businesses.</p>

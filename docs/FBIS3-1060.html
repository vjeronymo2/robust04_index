			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Stephen Laufer and Paul Stober] </F>   [Text] South African Police [SAP] deputy commissioner  Lieutenant-General Basie Smit is at the heart of an  investigation by the Goldstone Commission into a major  gun-running operation to "one of the parties to the conflict in  Natal".    The commission's report -- which was due to be handed to  President F.W. de Klerk on Wednesday, but was delayed at the  last minute -- could contain the hardest evidence to date of an  organised third force within the security forces. The  Goldstone report could blow the police general staff right out  of the water, said sources inside the SAP. Several other police  generals are understood to have been under scrutiny in the case,  which has been under investigation by the commission since  mid-February.    Sources close to the investigation expect De Klerk to move  against Smit within days.    Smit is widely believed to have survived an attempt by De  Klerk to purge the SAP of conservative generals in August 1992,  because it was felt that Smit's previous positions on the  highest state security councils had given him access to  information which would be damaging to the government and SAP if  released.    Smit is the former head of the 12,000-strong Crime Combating  and Investigation Unit, which amalgamated the Special Branch  with other detective branches of the SAP. As senior  deputy-commissioner he is the number two policeman in South  Africa after SAP Commissioner General Johan van de Merwe. He  is currently in charge of staff functions in the SAP which  include all administrative and auxiliary services. The other  deputy commissioner, Lieutenant-General Johan Swart, heads the  executive branch in charge of police on the ground.    Smit has headed the security police in the Northern  Transvaal  and was chief of the SAP Special Branch. He has been described  as "harsh" and as having "political ambitions". Judge Richard  Goldstone said on Wednesday the report into gun-running by  senior figures within the security forces had been delayed  because "the commission has been conducting further related  inquiries."    But the delay may also have been the result of threatened  legal action by some of the generals the commission was  planning to finger, said one source. Revelations of a  high-level gun-running operation and a plan to instigate  political violence could help explain violent incidents which  have cost thousands of lives in recent months.    Van der Merwe was in emergency meetings with members of  general staff this week. Smit was said by his secretary to be  "in very urgent meetings until Monday. He is in the  commissioner's office." Swart was on annual leave for three  weeks, according to his office. The Goldstone Commission is  believed to have delayed its report in order to give De Klerk  time to fire the SAP generals involved. "That would allow De  Klerk to seize the initiative in time for the election," said  one senior source.    ANC [African National Congress] intelligence is understood  to  have co-operated with the Goldstone Commission's investigation.  A senior ANC source said: "This involves very high-level police  officers, including generals." The investigation was made  public early this week by Transkei leader Major General Bantu  Holomisa, who is number 13 on the ANC's list of candidates for  the national assembly. Judge Goldstone confirmed an  investigation had been underway since mid-February, saying he  had kept both De Klerk and Nelson Mandela informed throughout.    A highly placed source described one of the generals  involved  in the gun-running operation as "the second-in-command of one of  the security forces", but refused to name him. The number two  slot in the South African Defence Force, chief of Defence Force  Staff, is currently unoccupied after the departure late last  year of Lieutenant General Pierre Steyn. It is understood  Holomisa forced the commission's hand over the results of the  investigation because of continuing ANC suspicion that Goldstone  is vulnerable to pressure from De Klerk.</p>

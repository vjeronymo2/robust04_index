			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Greens set to help shape the German agenda: Michael Lindemann charts the radicals' return to parliament The Greens are back - and not just by the skin of their teeth but, with 49 seats, as the third strongest party in Germany's federal parliament. That gives the left-wing environmentalists the right to appoint one of the parliament's four deputy speakers and gives them access to other committees which shape the parliamentary agenda. They celebrated longer than anybody else on Sunday night but were yesterday holed up in a hotel outside Bonn reviewing their strategy for the next four years, sure they will be able to build on their success. 'I think you'll see us winning the sort of support that we got in the European elections next time round,' said Ms Anne Nilges, the party spokeswoman, referring to the result in June when the party won 10.1 per cent of the vote. Four years ago the Greens scored just 3.8 per cent. They lost voters to the Social Democratic party which had shifted leftwards and they lost their 44 seats in the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament. Other parties have meanwhile taken up many of the environmental policies mooted by the Greens, but the party says it will remain on the environmental offensive and can turn environmental concerns that stretch across German society into more votes at the next election. The Greens will work together with the SPD, with whom they had hoped to form a so-called red-green coalition government, but have few fears of having the ground stolen from beneath them. 'The SPD is much more likely to move to the right as it tries to become the ruling party,' Ms Nilges said. Mr Joschka Fischer, the former environment minister in the state of Hesse who hopes to become one of the two leaders of the parliamentary party, set the tone for the new party when he faced the cameras on Sunday night after the election. He first saw action in the Bundestag 10 years ago when he was scruffily dressed and wore trainers. Ten years ago to the day he was expelled from parliament for rowdy behaviour and on leaving called the acting speaker of the Bundestag an 'arsehole'. Mr Fischer now wears a tie, but it is still poorly knotted and his top button is still undone. The party now faces competition of a different sort. The party of Democratic Socialism, the renamed east German communist party, has no impressive environmental credentials but it has proved that it can steal radical votes from the Greens. Four years ago just 0.3 per cent of west German voters backed the PDS. This time 0.9 per cent plumped for the PDS in the west, many of them one-time Green voters who were disappointed that the Greens were ready to tone down their revolutionary agenda to form a coalition with the SPD. The Greens appear to have made decisive inroads into the support of the Free Democratic party, the small liberal coalition partner of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union. The Greens also won seats in the state parliament in the Saarland, the small south-western state, and were able to bolster their presence in councils across North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, where their share of the vote jumped from 7.3 per cent to 10.2 per cent. The Greens' biggest problem remains eastern Germany where it picked up just 5 per cent of the vote. It has been unable to get its environmental message across to people who, leading Greens admit, have more everyday concerns.</p>

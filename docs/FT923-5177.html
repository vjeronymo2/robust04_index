			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets: Timely leaks lift Tokyo off the bottom Last week demonstrated the Japanese market's ability to anticipate events; and, linked with this, it showed that the prospect of determined and broadly based government action can do more for equities than a period of masterly inactivity. Japan's Y10,700bn (Dollars 87bn) economic stimulus package was not detailed until after the Tokyo equity market closed last Friday, but there was a succession of helpful leaks, mainly on Thursday and Friday, which left the FT-Actuaries Japan index up 9.9 per cent last week after a rise of 11.8 per cent over the previous five trading days. In two weeks, Tokyo has recovered from a fall of 33.7 per cent this year to one of 18.5 per cent, and from a position of the worst performer in the World Index series to fourth from bottom, after Finland, Denmark and Italy. Europe's decline continued with a fall of 2 per cent on the week, and a neutral performance in the US left the World Index 1.9 per cent higher on balance. The time is ripe, it seems, for the analysts, investment strategists and asset allocation specialists to guide their clients. On Japan, Mr Shigeki Sakaki says in an economic commentary for Nomura International that the government package includes public loans which may crowd out private loans and, therefore, not increase demand for goods and services. Thus, he says, the package's true effect on the economy may be Y4,000bn to Y5,000bn, or about 1 per cent of GNP. Mr Sushil Wadhwani, the Goldman Sachs strategist, says the move is evidence of a change in the attitude of the authorities to the market - 'equivalent, so to speak, to drawing a line in the sand' - but that while a bottom in the market may have been found, that equities are now well up with events and there is scope for short-term disappointment. On Europe, Mr Wadhwani is more sanguine. European equities, he notes, have fallen by more than 15 per cent since the Danish referendum three months ago, on European monetary union uncertainty and downgrades of economic forecasts partly precipitated by pessimism about German interest rates. He adds, however, that using a quantitative framework, neither the rise in bond yields nor the actual downgrading of earnings growth stemming from these uncertainties can explain more than a small proportion of the actual decline in share prices. There are other opinions, notably from Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, which says the sharp and painful corrections necessary to adjust the markets' 'notoriously optimistic' profit and interest rate expectations to reality still have some way to go. Mr Wadhwani thinks European equities are a 'good medium-term buying opportunity'. There is short-term risk in the French referendum, but a 'Yes' vote would prompt a general rise, while there would be little risk to German, Dutch or Swiss equities if the voters were to say 'No'.</p>

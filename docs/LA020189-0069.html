			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: LETTERS TO JUDGE SAY KIMBALL IS TROUBLED, REMORSEFUL  </P> <P> Letters to a judge on behalf of Bruce Kimball portray the 1984 Olympic diver as  remorseful, devastated and embattled by alcohol problems for nearly a decade.  </P> <P> Kimball, 25, has had nothing to say publicly in his defense since his speeding  sports car killed two teen-agers and injured four in Brandon, Fla.  </P> <P> He maintained his silence through a lengthy hearing Monday before Hillsborough  Circuit Judge Harry Lee Coe, who sentenced him to 17 years in prison followed  by 15 years' probation on alcohol-related manslaughter and injury charges.  </P> <P> In his own letter, Kimball told Coe that he has been fighting alcohol problems  since he was 16.  </P> <P> Coe received an estimated 50 letters, most from friends and family, supporting  Kimball.  </P> <P> They described how Kimball was traumatized by a 1981 accident in which he was  the victim of a drunk driver and how he rebounded from the near-fatal crash  that left his face shattered.  </P> <P> "When he saw the teen-agers on the road that night in August, he was in total  shock and disbelief," his father, Dick Kimball, wrote. "And I'm sure the pain  of his accident must have immediately come to mind."  </P></p>

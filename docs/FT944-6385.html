			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Trade gap cut in Australia A better export performance caused Australia's trade deficit to narrow last month, bringing relief to the Keating government and lessening the chances of another interest rate increase before Christmas. The latest figures showed a current account deficit for October of ADollars 1.65bn (Pounds 750m), seasonally adjusted, still higher than the ADollars 1.27bn seen in October 1993, but below the deficits of ADollars 1.8bn and ADollars 2.1bn in September and August respectively this year. Exports rose 5 per cent seasonally adjusted in October, with commodities such as gold, wool and coal contributing strongly. Imports, on the same basis, were 2 per cent higher. Economists had been predicting an October deficit of ADollars 1.8bn-ADollars 1.9bn; as the prospect of a further early interest rate rise ebbed, the Australian dollar drifted lower. A sharp decline in building approvals last month suggested the recent housing boom has peaked. Figures for business investment were more complicated; new capital expenditure for the quarter declined overall, but spending on plant and equipment was 3.4 per cent higher (27.6 per cent above that seen a year ago). Mr Ralph Willis, treasurer, focused mainly on the capital expenditure figures, claiming these supported 'a continuing strong recovery in business investment'. But some economists said they expected the full-year current account deficit to reach ADollars 21bn-ADollars 22bn, well above Mr Willis's ADollars 18bn forecast. Attention will now shift to the September quarter's GDP figures, to be released today, and expected to show growth running at 5.5 per cent annualised. Mr Bernie Fraser, governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, said the government should consider raising taxes to cut its budget deficit, and warned that lack of wage restraint would mean higher interest rates. 'It's time we faced up to the fact that trying to manage the budget without the capacity to vary taxes is not a winning strategy. There are always areas where government spending can be trimmed but possible tax increases should not be ruled out.' Some unions had recently submitted big wage claims, but it was essential settlements should not run ahead of productivity gains. 'Once a wage breakout has occurred, it becomes largely a matter of where the damage is sustained, in higher unemployment or higher inflation, or both'. A case existed for cutting the current account deficit to around 3 per cent of GDP, against the 4-5 per cent seen recently. 'That is not a target so much as a judgment about what is comfortably sustainable over the long term.'</p>

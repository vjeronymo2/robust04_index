			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Andrey Krasnoshchekov </F> and Konstantin Oribytkov]    [Text] Crans-Montana (Switzerland), 17 Jun -- The  deployment of CIS peace-keeping forces in the Georgian-Abkhazian  conflict zone is an important step along the path towards a  comprehensive settlement of the conflict. This was stated in an  exclusive interview to the ITAR-TASS correspondent by Georgian  Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia. He is heading Georgia's  delegation at the international forum devoted to the problems of  East-West relations which started here on Thursday.    "We regard this action with hope," the head of the Georgian  Government noted, "and think that it should not be restricted  solely to the bounds of Gali Rayon." He called the results of  the visit to Georgia by Russian Federation Defense Minister  Pavel Grachev "encouraging," having stressed that "common  approaches were achieved which allowed a number of agreements to  be signed." "In relations with Russia," O.Patsatsia said, "we  are returning to what it ought to be -- to friendship. We  cannot get away from that."    At the same time, it is necessary to continue the active  quests for ways of attaining a peaceful political settlement to  the conflict, the prime minister pointed out, having admitted  that "this process will be a lengthy and delicate one." In  Crans-Montana he intends to discuss this issue with (Eduard  Brunner), the special representative of the UN secretary general.    Commenting, at the request of ITAR-TASS, on the stand taken  by the Georgian prime minister, Ramazan Abdulatipov, deputy  chairman of the Federation Council of the Russian Federation,  who is head of the delegation at the Crans-Montana forum, noted:  "This is not the first time we have been able to see for  ourselves that Georgia's progress, the prospects for development  that are opening up before her are directly linked with Russia.  There is no other way. Russia has saved Georgia from internal  division and outside threat more than once, and therefore  orientation on Russia corresponds to the interests of Georgia."  This is also important for Russia, he continued, since any  destabilization in this region has a direct effect on us too.  It is sufficient to recall that approximately 100,000 refugees  from Abkhazia and South Ossetia have been forced to seek refuge  on the territory of Russia. R. Abdulatipov spoke out in support  of the decision of Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin to  deploy peace-keeping forces in the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict  zone and expressed the hope that, in discussing this issue on 21  June, the Federation Council would also express itself in favor  of this measure.    In the opinion of the deputy chairman of the Federation  Council, "Russia is not interested in servicemen from other  states taking part in the peace-keeping forces since it is a  question of the zone of her national interests." The  interference of any other forces, he thinks, will not promote  stability in the region. "For the moment I can only remind you  that it is largely thanks to the Russian peace-keeping forces  that they have practically managed to put an end to the war in  South Ossetia, and thanks to Russian soldiers and officers peace  is being maintained there and the situation is gradually getting  back to normal," R. Abdulatipov pointed out.</p>

			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MONORAIL PROJECT AND TRANSIT DISTRICT  </P> <P> As the "unnamed (OCTD) official" cited in the McDonnell Douglas Realty monorail  column (Orange County section, Feb. 5), I'd like to comment on several of Bob  Young's remarks and clarify the OCTD staff position on a number of issues  raised relative to his project.  </P> <P> First, and perhaps foremost, the Orange County Transit District is  wholeheartedly in support of McDonnell Douglas' efforts to develop the airport  monorail project. Anything that will remove cars from the area's congested  streets is a welcome part of the office-building projects and airport expansion  being planned and constructed.  </P> <P> What concerns us, however, is the expectation that a project such as the one  McDonnell Douglas Realty is planning would have a significant impact on Orange  County's commuter traffic problem. The hundreds of workers in the Douglas Plaza  area will still need their cars to get to and from the office each day. To help  deal with this problem of improving peak-hour access for commuters, OCTD is  working closely with the employers in the Irvine Business Center to establish a  Transportation Management Assn. that will allow us to better develop customized  transportation services for workers in that area, as we are now doing in the  South Coast Metro area. This will include car-pooling and van-pooling,  telecommuting, flexible work hours, special commuter buses and employer  incentive programs. To truly improve traffic in the airport area, daily  commuters need attractive alternatives to driving alone.  </P> <P> With respect to the issue of monorail technology, the airport monorail system,  with its limited speed and capacity, is an ideal local circulation people  mover. As a regional system, however, it would require substantially higher  capacity and speeds. A much larger Mark IV monorail vehicle, currently being  developed for Disney World, or one of the Japanese monorail systems are  potential technologies for a regional system.  </P> <P> I would also like to note that it is my understanding that the enlarged airport  facilities will include access provisions for airport-related bus service.  These services will be provided, as they are now, by private buses, vans and  taxis operating between the terminal and nearby hotels, rental car agencies and  parking areas. These buses are better equipped to handle the particular needs  of the airline passenger than are public transit buses. OCTD, with its bus  system designed to meet the basic needs of the daily user and commuter, has  never felt the need to duplicate services better provided by the private sector  at no cost to taxpayers.  </P> <P> BRIAN PEARSON  </P> <P> Director of Development  </P> <P> OCTD  </P></p>

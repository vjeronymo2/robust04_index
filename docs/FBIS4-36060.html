Replying [to] questions raised by the reporter of Middle  East  Broadcasting Center (MBC), King Fahd highlighted the attention  given by the state to the pilgrims.    He said he will make an inspecting tour of Muna, 'Arafat and  al- Muzdalifah, accompanied by the concerned authorities, to  explore suitable means for extending better services to the  pilgrims and enabling them perform their rituals in comfort and  ease and in particular at jamarat (stoning zone).    I am determined to go ahead in developing Mecca and Medina,  but this does not mean that the other Saudi cities will be  neglected, he said and added 'with the grace of the God we will  provide all the regions with the required facilities and  services including electric and telephone services and  desalinated water. [no closing punctuation as received]    King Fahd said the state would benefit from the ideas  presented by the members of the Consultative Council on means of  serving the country.    I, and the Council of Ministers are keen on listening to the  views and ideas of the Consultative Council, he said.    King Fahd pointed out that the new systems, recently  announced, have opended new horizons for the service of the  country.    King Fahd noted that the new regulations and systems have  fixed the period of the portfolios and added 'but changing of  ministers or officials does not necessarily mean that they have  committed a mistake'.    Shedding light on the economic situation in the kingdom,  King  Fahd described the kingdom's economy as strong.    He noted that the kingdom had spent billions of riyals and  dollars because of the Gulf crisis caused by Iraq and in  addition to that, King Fahd, said the country had extended large  amounts of money to a number of Arab, African and Asian  countries in forms of grants and loans.    King Fahd criticized those who write about the kingdom's  economy in a biased way.    Thanks to the God who has bestowed on us so many bounties,  the kingdom has so many resources inclduing oil 'and a number of  new oil wells were recently discovered south of Riyadh'.    He noted that these new wells are expected to be on stream  soon and their production would be exported via the country's  sea ports either in the west or east of the kingdom.    King Fahd described the oil of the new wells as oil of high  quality.    Moreover, King Fahd said gold was discovered in the kingdom  and arrangements were underway to benefit from these new  discoveries.    Highlighting the existing confidence between the state and  the citizens, King Fahd said the state does not interfere in the  affairs of the citizens an well as in the manner the citizens  manage their properties.    Refuting the fabricated reports on the economic situation in  the kingdom, King Fahd said it would not be a shameful thing if  the state resorted to obtain loans from inside or outside the  country.    He noted that reduction of expenditure by about 20 percent,  as being announced by the minsiter of finance and national  economy, would not have an adverse impact on the existing major  projects.    The Saudi currency is covered by gold and hard currencies,  he  said.    The monarch said the state had extended soft and  free-interest loans, worth of billion riyals, to the citizens  including real estate and agricultural loans.    On handling over of some of the public enterprises to the  private sector, King Fahd said shares would be floated for  subscription by the citizens in enterprises like the national  airlines, posts, telegraphs and telephones.    There is also possiblity of the private's sector's  contribution to oil refinery, he said and added the state will  hand over to the citizens any enterprise that can be run by them.    This policy will be carried out in the appropriate time  after  making the required arrangements, he said.    On the developments of the situation in Yemen, King Fahd  said  the kingdom's relations with North and South Yemen are  deeprooted and added 'we believe that all Yemenis are keen on  the stability of their country'.    He commended the resolution recently issued by the Security  Council and hoped that it would pave the way for ending the  fighting in the country.    Yemen is a dear country and we do respect it, he said and  added the kingdom is keen on maintaining good relations with all  Arab countries.    It is hoped that the Security Council's resolution, which is  accepted by the concerned parties, will be implemented because  failure of its implemtation will mean continuation of  bloodshedding, he elaborated.    King Fahd reiterated that the kingdom does not interfere in  any Arab problem unless it is requested to do so.</p>

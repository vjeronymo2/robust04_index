			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday afternoon, persons in charge of the  Guangdong provincial government and relevant departments  listened to the report by the State Council's commodity price  inspection team on the results of its inspection of the  province's general price developments. Beginning 10 April, the  commodity price inspection team went down to Guangzhou,  Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Zhongshan, and Dongguan to conduct on-the-spot  price inspection. The results of the inspection showed that the  province's current economic and market price developments are  fine on the whole, but the price hiking momentum is relatively  grim. There is still something to be done in intensifying price  inspection work and implementing some specific measures.    The commodity price inspection team pointed out: To check  the price hiking momentum, Guangdong Province should intensify  price inspection work, focus on the main points, and rectify the  price order while conducting price inspection. With regard to  the hot-point items that are most sought after by the masses of  people and to those important commodities that have a bearing on  the national economy and the people's livelihood, the province  should organize forces to conduct special inspections. As for  the commodities, grain, edible oil, important service items, and  chemical fertilizers, the prices of which were forced up without  authorization by capitalizing on taxation system reform, the  province should persist in rectifying the price order while  conducting price inspection, and should strive for speedy and  innovative advances in this regard. It should adopt appropriate  measures to manage grain, edible oil, pork, and major  vegetables, and should step up efforts to introduce a system of  risk funds for grain and for non-staple food, concentrate  necessary forces on implementing the practice of selling goods  at marked prices, and put price readjustments under strict  control.</p>

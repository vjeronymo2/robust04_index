			<p>BFN     [Text] Willy Claes, Belgian deputy prime minister and  foreign minister, held several meetings with Romanian officials  today. During this morning's meeting with Senate President  Oliviu Gherman the guest withdrew for a few minutes for a  telephone conversation, trying to reach UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali to discuss the serious worsening of the  situation in Rwanda. Ten Belgian UN troops were killed in the  Kigali incidents.    Also at the meeting with the president of the Senate, which  was devoted to discussions about the political and economic  situation in our country, prospects for the Partnership for  Peace, and relations with the European Union, Claes announced  that he will cut his visit short to participate, together with  his colleagues, in a government meeting in Brussels that will  examine the situation in Rwanda.    Our correspondent also informed us that in a second round of  official talks this morning between Claes and Romanian Foreign  Minister Teodor Melescanu, the sides examined international  issues, particularly the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Melescanu  briefed his counterpart on his contacts in Athens and the visits  to Bucharest of Presidents Slobodan Milosevic and Suleyman  Demirel; he also discussed the Romanian position regarding the  need to involve Bosnian Serbs in the peace process.    The sides also examined developments in the former Soviet  Union, especially in the Russian Federation and Ukraine. The  Romanian side also informed the guest about aspects of our  relations with neighboring countries: Hungary, Bulgaria, and  the Republic of Moldova. Willy Claes noted that one of the  major elements in addressing developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina  is the UN sanctions policy. The Belgian guest expressed the  view that it was imperative to reach an accord on the three  approaches to this issue: the American, the Russian, and the  European Community's.    The two foreign ministers also examined aspects of the  Partnership for Peace and the Balladur Pact. Belgium believes  that an enlarged Europe is also a stable Europe.    After the talks, the two foreign ministers signed the joint  political declaration between Romania and the Kingdom of  Belgium. Mr. Melescanu was invited to pay a visit to Belgium.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Higher margins boost SR Gent THE CONCENTRATION on higher margin products helped SR Gent, the Barnsley-based Marks and Spencer garment supplier, report pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.52m for the year to June 30, a rise of 10 per cent on the comparable Pounds 2.29m. Turnover fell 6 per cent from Pounds 128m, including Pounds 2.66m from discontinued activities, to Pounds 120.5m with Pounds 4.45m from acquisitions. The fall for continuing activities was 5 per cent. Mr Peter Wolff, chairman, said the sales fall was the result of the rationalisation of certain ranges. He added that overseas production of specialised garments had risen over the year to 40 per cent of sales by the period end. During the year the retail division became fully owned and was relaunched under the Susan Woolf name. Mr Wolff said the financial impact was reflected in the figures but would ease as additional stores came on stream. The pre-tax figure was struck after share of losses of related companies of Pounds 430,000 (Pounds 66,000) and net interest charges which fell from Pounds 2.71m to Pounds 1.93m. Earnings per share came out higher at 3.2p, against 2.4p and the proposed final dividend is being raised to 1.35p making an increased total for the year of 2.1p, compared with 2p. The shares dipped 6p to 62p in a falling market.</p>

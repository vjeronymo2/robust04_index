			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Ramos has directed the Department of  Interior and Local Government to conduct an intensive manhunt  for members of the Alex Boncayao Brigade [ABB] responsible for  bombings of the offices of Petron, Caltex and Shell. The  Philippine National Police is undertaking several security  measures to prevent the repetition of yesterday's bombings.    President Ramos has also ordered more police visibility in  strategic locations following the bombings by communist rebels.  He appealed to the people to stay calm as the national police  and the Armed Forces of the Philippines are tracking down the  bombers. The president was airborne on his way to Calaban,  Mindoro, when the three bombs exploded. The taxi driver hired  by the suspects was picked up by the police shortly after the  explosions in Makati. He is now undergoing interrogation to  help probers identify the bombers.    Press Secretary Jess [Jesus] Sison said the violence being  perpetrated by the ABB will worsen the situation and may affect  the peace process. Sison urged the people to remain calm and to  bring their complaints to the proper authorities and through  legal means. Earlier, the ABB claimed responsibility for the  bombings of the oil companies' offices.    Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief General Lisandro  Abadia  said that the military will fully support the national police in  its efforts to capture the bombers. Abadia said the armed  forces will not tolerate and allow these lawless elements to sow  terror among the public. The armed forces chief said that the  public should not be unduly alarmed by these attacks as the  military is conducting normal security measures to prevent its  repetition.    Meantime, Energy Secretary Delfin Lazaro has assured that  adequate military measures are in place on vital facilities of  National Power Corporation, Philippine National Oil Company and  the Energy Regulatory Board. Lazaro said strict security is  being implemented in all energy offices to ensure adequate  protection for every official.    Police and the military are now under red alert following  yesterday's bombings of the offices of three oil companies. The  Philippine National Police has put into effect Oplan [operation  plan] Lawaan, in anticipation of several unrests over the oil  price increase. [Interior Secretary] Alunan said the violence  could send wrong signals to foreign investors.</p>

"The April 1 statement by the U.N. Security Council  president  on the North Korean nuclear problem reaffirmed that the  U.S.-North Korean agreement reached on Feb. 25 in New York was  still effective," a high-ranking government official said. "In  view of this development, Seoul and Washington share the  position that further U.S.-North Korean talks and suspension of  the annual military drill are linked to more inspections by the  International Atomic Energy Agency."    Robert Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of State for  political and military affairs, and Kim Sam-hun, ambassador for  nuclear issue, are expected to reiterate their position when  they hold a meeting here Monday [18 April].    Regarding Team Spirit in particular, U.S. Defense Secretary  William Perry, who will soon to visit South Korea, and his South  Korean counterpart are expected to agree that the military  maneuver will be suspended only after they get hard evidence  that North Korea did not divert nuclear materials to making  weapons.

Stressing that in no country in the world have terrorist  organizations overpowered the state forces, Mentese remarked  that in Turkey, too, terrorist organizations will be buried in  the dark pages of history as a result of the determined and  dedicated struggle waged by security forces. The interior  minister said that the state is the counterpart of movements  directed against the country's integrity and the principles of  the republic, regardless of where these movements originate  from. These movements will be stopped and the matter will be  resolved with speed, Mentese added. He declared: We will  overcome this nuisance of terrorism with the help of our great  people and we will certainly bring about an atmosphere of  tranquillity and security, which our people long for.</p>

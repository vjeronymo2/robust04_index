			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] In answering an interpellation by legislator (Chiu  Chueh-cheng) regarding Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's announcement of his resignation, president of the  Executive Yuan Lien Chan said that political instability in  Japan at present is understandable because the present Japanese  Government is formed by several political parties and the  Japanese Government is also faced with the call for political  reform and the problem of economic recession. Lien Chan said:  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and concerned government  departments have made efforts to strengthen relations with  various Japanese political parties which have formed the current  Japanese Government. It is believed that the Japanese  Government will certainly attach importance to relations between  China [Republic of China -- ROC] and Japan. President of the  Executive Yuan Lien Chan said:    [Begin recording] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other  related departments have done their best to promote and enhance  relations with various Japanese political parties which have  formed the coalition govevnment. Those Japanese political  parties have successively held panel discussions between  Japanese and Chinese [ROC] legislators. I am convinced that the  Japanese Government will certainly attach great importance to  the relations between China [ROC] and Japan. [end recording]    The preceding are remarks by Lien Chan, president of the  Executive Yuan.    After the release of the news of the Japanese prime  minister's resignation, U.S. President Clinton expressed his  regret over Hosokawa's decision. Communist China hoped that the  resignation of Hosokawa would not influence the friendly  relations between China [PRC] and Japan. South Korean President  Kim Yong-sam, who had a 15-minute talk with Hosokawa, expressed  his concern for Hosokawa and guaranteed that his personal  friendship with Hosokawa would not change.</p>

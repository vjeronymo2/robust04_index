			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Government Bonds: European sector hit by surprise rate rises Unexpected rises in interest rates in Sweden and Italy sent European government bond markets into a tail-spin yesterday. In spite of their status as Europe's high-debt, high-deficit nations, their pre-emptive actions were widely interpreted by investors as harbingers of rate rises in Europe's hard-currency nations. 'These rises came against a backdrop of people re-assessing their outlook on the Bundesbank and the view that we were at the bottom of the interest rate cycle,' said Mr Jouni Kokko of S. G. Warburg Securities. The markets were also upset by the timing of the rate rises, which came when they were least capable to cope with surprises. Volume in the cash market has been thin in recent weeks, due to the summer holiday season, which means even the lightest of sell orders can have a strong impact on prices. Ms Alison Cottrell of Midland Global Markets, said that Sweden's move would create serious problems for the rest of the Scandinavian bloc, where governments were already having to deal with fiscal issues and referendums on whether to join the European Union. In Sweden, yields rose sharply after the Riksbank raised the ceiling rate by 50 basis points to 8 per cent and the central repo rate by 28 points to 7.20 per cent. The National Debt Office delayed its bill auction due to the turmoil triggered by the rises and the fall in the krona put additional pressure on the market. At the short end, the rate on six-month Treasury bills jumped 71 basis points to 8.74 per cent while the yield on nine-year bonds closed up 56 basis points at 11.28 per cent. Ten-year UK gilts fell by nearly two points as many dealers now believe that an autumn rate rise is inevitable. One dealer noted that due to the bearish mood in the market, it would take longer than expected for the Bank of England to complete its recently-announced taps. Of the Pounds 700m to be sold, almost Pounds 500m still has to be taken up. On Liffe, the long gilt future fell 1 27/32 points to 100 3/8 in volume of 93,400 lots. Longer-dated US Treasury prices fell sharply yesterday in the wake of inflation and retail sales data that was deemed bearish for the government securities market and a disappointing 30-year bond auction. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  27/32 at 83 23/32 , yielding 7.649 per cent and the two-year note down  1/8 at 99 25/32 , yielding 6.226 per cent. The July inflation figures produced mixed feelings among bond market investors. The headline 0.5 per cent rise in the producer prices index was above expectations, but the bulk of the gain was attributable to higher petrol and coffee prices. Core producer inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy components, was up only 0.1 per cent. More disturbing for the market, and the factor behind the early declines in bond prices, was the retail sales data. Although sales were reported to have declined by 0.1 per cent last month, analysts latched on to the upward revisions in prior months' sales, in particular an increase in the original estimate of June sales from growth of 0.6 per cent to 0.8 per cent. The retail sales data unsettled investors, and made dealers sceptical about the chances of the afternoon auction of Dollars 11bn in 30-year bonds passing off successfully. Their doubts subsequently proved well-founded when investors stayed away from the auction in droves. Demand for the new issue was extremely weak, and Wall Street dealers were left with the bulk of the 30-year bonds on their books. See Lex</p>

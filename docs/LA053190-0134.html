			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> BED AND BREAKFAST;  </P> <P> CASA DE LA LUNA;  </P> <P> ROOM TO RELAX;  </P> <P> THE SPANISH-STYLE HOUSE IN OJAI OFFERS SECLUSION, A BEAUTIFUL VIEW AND, OF  COURSE, A BOUNTIFUL MORNING MEAL.  </P> <P> There is a place in Ojai that is so still and private that Hollywood types slip  in frequently for weekend getaways. In fact, two Canadian psychologists once  holed up here for weeks to write a textbook.  </P> <P> So if you suffer from ho-hum breakfast, whiny kids, noise overload or a simple  case of the blahs, you may find the relief you need at Casa de La Luna, a  one-of-a-kind bed-and-breakfast hideaway.  </P> <P> Ancient oak trees envelop the long driveway leading to the 5,000-square-foot  Spanish-style home Bud and Doris Scott built themselves in 1968. It's part of a  seven-acre estate they call the Gardens of Perpetual Spring, named for the  2,000 flowers, shrubs and trees they've planted.  </P> <P> The Scotts' talent and resourcefulness are apparent all over the house and  grounds of Casa de La Luna, yet the couple have a casual, warm and folksy  manner. On a recent morning, Doris Scott was pushing a broom on the walkways.  Her husband, in jeans and an undershirt, was working on a temperamental toilet.  </P> <P> Bud Scott, a 70-year-old retired dentist, loves to talk about his cattle  ranching family, which settled in Ventura in 1869.  </P> <P> "My grandfather was known as the cussingest man on the plains," he said. Bud  was a rancher himself in the San Joaquin Valley until he decided to study  dentistry at the age of 36.  </P> <P> "I wanted to practice dentistry in Mexico," he said. "I settled for building  Mexico here," he said, gesturing around the vast home.  </P> <P> "We decided to build an authentic colonial hacienda," he said. "So we started  exploring Mexico to find out what we wanted."  </P> <P> They found it in a little village in northern Mexico. It was the jail -- housed  in an old hacienda.  </P> <P> They drew the plans for the house, and pretty much built it themselves, with  the help of their daughter, Carol Barr, the oldest of their three grown  children. The huge wooden front doors open to a spacious entryway with a high,  beamed ceiling.  </P> <P> Had it not been for the 1984 Olympics, they never would have gotten into the  bed-and-breakfast business. When the call went out for Ojai Valley residents to  open their homes to athletes, the Scotts did just that.  </P> <P> Casa de La Luna has been open ever since. It's one of only four home-style  bed-and-breakfast spots in the county. (Santa Barbara has at least 15.)  </P> <P> Barr, a nurse and the mother of two children, is now back home with her family  to help her parents run the place. Both mother and daughter are artists and the  house is filled with their work. Barr's specialty is porcelain painting. Her  delicate roses are seen on the tile and sinks in the guest bathrooms and on the  many oil lamps and vases.  </P> <P> Together, mother and daughter painted an exquisite Florentine rose ceiling in  the dining room. Below it is a long table, carved by Bud Scott. His wife  hand-finished, stained and upholstered 14 chairs for the table. He cut ornate  windows in the room and fitted them with stained glass.  </P> <P> Paintings hang everywhere, some by Doris and Carol. Others are collectors  items. They sell limited-edition prints, and often display works from  collections on loan.  </P> <P> There are six rooms available to guests, ranging from $65 to $95 a night. Three  are in the main house, two in a converted caretaker's home, and one is a  separate cottage. All have baths, two have fireplaces, and one is quite roomy,  1,000 square feet.  </P> <P> They all have little personal touches. The curtains and decorative pillows are  handmade.  </P> <P> "I found these wonderful marbles at a Ben Franklin store," said Barr, pointing  to a tall glass of glistening marbles on a dresser in one of the rooms. Years  ago, her grandmother had a similar goblet on her dresser.  </P> <P> Breakfast at Casa de La Luna is a treat. Macadamia nuts, gathered from the  trees on the estate, go into the waffles. And, oranges, peaches, tangerines,  apples, plums, cherries, apricots, lemons and limes -- all grown there -- go  into the fruit salad. They also serve eggs, potatoes, and French toast.  </P> <P> But the best part of all is the view from the dining room table. It faces an  aviary where two dozen or so canaries and other birds flutter about.  </P> <P> "Everyone wants to sit on the window side of the table," said Doris Scott.  </P> <P> Here are some other home-style bed-and-breakfast spots in Ventura County.  </P> <P> * La Mer, 411 Poli St., Ventura: This 1890 Cape Cod-style house has a view of  the ocean. The five rooms are decorated in a European motif. A breakfast buffet  includes fruits, homemade cereal, cheeses, European breads, ham, croissants,  apple strudel and homemade cakes served in a Bavarian-style dining room.  Complementary wine comes with each room. Mid-week specials include excursions  to a local dude ranch, Wheeler Hot Springs and carriage rides in Ojai.  </P> <P> * Theodore Woolsey House, 1484 E. Ojai Ave., Ojai: This oak-shaded house, built  in 1887, is a historic landmark. The seven rooms are decorated with antiques.  Breakfast, served buffet style, includes pastries, breads, muffins and cereal  -- oatmeal in winter.  </P> <P> * Ojai Manor Hotel, 210 E. Matilija St., Ojai: This former school, built in  1874, is the oldest building in Ojai. Located downtown, the two-story building  with six guest rooms features contemporary art, antiques, folk art and  handcrafted furniture. Continental breakfast includes homemade muffins and  scones.  </P> <P> * THE DETAILS: Casa de la Luna is located at 710 S. La Luna Ave., in the  Meiners Oaks district of the Ojai Valley. From U.S. 101, take the Ojai Freeway  to Ventura Avenue, make a left on California 150 (Baldwin Road) and a right on  La Luna Avenue. For information and reservations, call 646-4528.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A very grave situation involving a danger of war  [chonjaeng wihomul naepohan maeu omjunghan chongse] is being  created on the Korean peninsula.    The United States and the South Korean puppet clique are  openly saying that they will resume the provocative Team Spirit  joint military exercise. They have decided to deploy Patriot  missiles to South Korea and are finally planning to send  additional U.S. troops to South Korea. In addition, U.S. Navy  aircraft carriers are now moving toward waters near our country.    Amid these circumstances, the South Korean puppet Armed  Forces have been put on a state of alert at traitor Kim  Yong-sam's order, and the puppet Joint Chiefs of Staff ordered  the entire puppet military forces to be put on special alert.    Seoul is scheming war plots [chonjaeng mouidul] every day.  These very unusual, provocative moves that can be seen only just  prior to an adventurous [mohomjogin] war are an extremely  dangerous development that may cause a catastrophic crisis  [pagukchok wigirul choraehalsu innun kukhi wihomchonmanhan satae  palchon] on the Korean peninsula.    The insidious forces [pulsun seryoktul] of the United States  are making extremely provocative warmaniac outbursts [kukhi  tobalchogin chonjaeng pogondul], such as remarks that the  international community must take strong measures, that pressure  on North Korea must be strengthened by actual steps, that North  Korea must not misunderstand the U.S. intent, and the like,  posing military threats against us.    All these facts plainly show that the United States is not  interested in resolving the nuclear issue of the Korean  peninsula and is only trying frantically to isolate and stifle  [apsal] our republic.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Shigetaka Mayumi: "Information Highway: Japan </F> Leads in Equipment, But United States Is Market"]    [Text] In hardware, Japan has led, but demand has burgeoned  in the United States. Japan, too, must relax its regulations so  as to encourage its communications companies to compete over  services and use these high-tech products.    In 1992, the University of North Carolina in the United  States began an experiment using a high-speed communications  network for a cancer treatment involving X-rays. This is one  part of the "information highway," a concept that Vice President  Gore has taken the lead in promoting. In this treatment, 3D  images from a CT scanner (a computer tomography device) are  sent, through a telecommunication line, to a computer center,  where they are processed by a supercomputer. CT images are  normally difficult to tell apart, but the supercomputer  three-dimensionalizes them, changing them into images that make  it easy to determine at what angle and to what extent x-rays  should be applied, and that are then sent to the physician.    A state-of-the-art "asynchronous transmission mode" (ATM)  machine developed by Fujitsu is being used in the experiment.  AT&amp;T in the United States, Northern Telecom in Canada,  Siemens  in Germany, Alcatel in France and other manufacturers throughout  the world are frantically trying to develop ATM machines and  other systems necessary for the information highway. However,  NTT has led the way in the ATM field with the B-ISDN (broad-band  ISDN = integrated digital communications network) concept, so  that, according to an NTT representative, "The performance of  [the machines of] Japanese manufacturers is presently at the  top."    NTT's animated television pictures, the first to be  developed  in the world, can also be easily transmitted    In February 1990, NTT, in preparation for the age of  high-speed communications, announced a plan to lay optical fiber  to all the homes in Japan by the year 2015. In September 1990,  NTT was the first in the world to experimentally manufacture an  ATM switching machine, which it began supplying internationally  in the fall of 1992. In response to NTT's activities, Japanese  communications equipment manufacturers, such as Fujitsu and NEC,  quickly began developing ATM switching machines and other such  systems.    The United States feels threatened by these activities.  Accordingly, one of the aims of Vice President Gore's  information highway concept is for the United States to build an  optical fiber network and take back the initiative in the  optical fiber field. Ironically, the Japanese manufacturers, due  to the above-mentioned activities, have a strong hold on ATM  switching machines, which are the core for such a network.    ATM switching machines are the key technology that will be  used in the next generation of communications services and  B-ISDN. They are far more efficient than current digital  switching and can also regulate data traffic, so that they are  able to transmit at the high speed of 150 megabits/second (mega  = million). They are from 100 to more than 1,000 times faster  than the N-ISDN (narrow-band ISDN) that NTT is currently  providing.    The data volume of animated pictures is more than 200 times  that of compact disks; and with ATM, animated television  pictures can easily be transmitted. Also, ATM can partition  large-capacity telecommunication lines. Thus, ATM will become  pivotal in cases where a multiplicity of computers spread out  over remote areas are linked by telecommunication lines and  large volumes of information are exchanged.    If ATM switching machines spread throughout the world, it  will be possible for a company's Tokyo head office to retrieve  document data from its research center in the United States and  design data from its plant in Nagoya and conduct a television  conference on product development with the staff of its Osaka  office.  <H3>  U.S. Telephone Companies Lead in Commercial Services;  Japanese Companies Shift Their Focus to U.S. Market </H3>   According to Kazuo Iwama, Product Planning Director of NEC's  Switching and Transfer Communications Department, "In 1997, the  ATM market worldwide will be 250 billion yen." Of this, the U.S.  will account for 50 percent; Europe, 20-30 percent; and Japan,  15 percent. There are already 20-30 switching machines operating  in the United States.    The Williams Communications Group (Wilter), a long-distance  telephone company, is using switching machines for its  commercial services. It has installed them in eight locations,  and plans to install them in still more. Of the Bell telephone  companies, which split off from AT&amp;T, four--including Nynex  and  US West--have begun experiments aimed at using switching  machines for commercial services.    On the other hand, NTT, in 1994, will introduce an ATM  switching machine into a relay station and use it for relaying  data transmissions. In 1995, moreover, it will begin a  common-carrier-lease-line service; however, this will ultimately  use no more than part of the functions of an ATM switching  machine. A genuine B-ISDN service that can make full use of the  capacity of an ATM switching machine will not appear until after  the U.S. information highway project: in 1994, NTT will begin  experiments [for such a service] in Kansai Scientific Research  City.    In a word, Japan has led in the development of ATM machines  and other hardware, but the United States is far ahead in  communications services. With NTT at the forefront, Japanese  manufacturers developed [this hardware] with the aim of  introducing it domestically, but due to the domestic market's  slowness in getting started, they have shifted their focus to  cultivating the American market.    And they have steadily been achieving results. For example,  NEC will deliver switching machines to Wilter and the  independent company, GTE; and Fujitsu will deliver equipment to  the four Bell companies for use in their experiment. In 1992,  moreover, Fujitsu supplied Nynex and US West with switching  machines for their commercial services.    The spread of ATM machines will depend on whether new  services that fully use the power of ATM are created in the  communications field. As in the experiment at the University of  North Carolina, applications using images have already been  developed; therefore, Fujitsu, believing that there is a strong  possibility that ATM will be used at subscription telephone  companies, has been aggressively trying to sell their product to  the Bell telephone companies and other regional [phone]  companies.    At the end of 1994, Fujitsu will begin manufacturing ATM  machines at a plant in Texas. Since Fujitsu will provide the  Bell companies with machines, the Bell companies asked it to  establish a manufacturing division in the United States and to  set up a support system for after sales. According to Akio  Moritera, a representative of Fujitsu's Core Communications  Headquarters, "Basically, it isn't profitable to carry out local  production if there aren't sales of near 20 billion yen."  However, Fujitsu has judged that the market for ATM machines  will start up by 1995, and that adequate demand can be expected.    On the other hand, NEC believes that, for the time being,  ATM  switching machines will be used in a trunk line role, for  relaying between switching machines. Its strategy is to wait to  begin selling until after the regional telephone companies that  link users to switching machines start coming up with truly  high-speed applications, such as image transmission.  <H3>  U.S. Companies Connect Their Individual LAN's; Relaxation of  Regulations Also Leads to Transmission of Rental Videos </H3>   Computer aided design (CAD) has come to be used in the  development of semiconductors and automobiles. There are also  examples of companies in which the main office's local area  network (LAN) is connected to the research center's LAN by a  telecommunication line. And LANs are installed not only in  research centers and plants; in the United States, they also  link various other places of work, thereby shortening the time  required for product development.    According to NTT, the U.S. has 40 times more LAN-equipped  plants than Japan. In computer graphics data, the data volume is  large, so a large-capacity transmission route--from several  megabits/second to 100 megabits/second--is necessary. Among LAN  products, there are already high-speed ones that can handle 100  megabits/second. For N-ISDN, 64 kilobits/second is basic, so LAN  is faster by a double-digit factor. If high-speed LANs are  installed and a system for sending image data--from CAD and the  like--is set up, the system will be meaningless if the LAN's are  connected with a line that has a small capacity.    If an ATM switching machine is used, a large volume of data  can be sent even with a telecommunication line. Therefore, every  service company is trying to deal with data transmission by  introducing ATM's. Actually, ATM standardization has still not  been completed. It is currently impossible to phone just anybody  [with ATM]. Those who connect LANs are large corporations and  other major customers of communication companies. U.S.  communication companies have taken the bold step of introducing  [ATM machines] with the as yet unstandardized parts made  according to the company's own specifications. This is because  they want to quickly respond to the desires of their big  customers who connect LAN's.    In the United States, competition among communication  companies is severe; there are over 100 regional telephone  companies; and the competition is increasing. This is greatly  different from Japan, where NTT has almost a monopoly.    As a result of liberalization, a new rival, CAPS, has  recently appeared. CAPS are communication companies that, using  optical fiber, link relay-related telephone companies, such as  AT&amp;T, with their large corporate customers. Since CAPS do  this  without going through regional phone companies, they are called  by-pass companies. The reason that Nynex, Bell South and other  regional phone companies are hurrying to introduce ATM is to  prevent their important customers from being lured away by the  optical fiber of CAPS.    The relaxation of regulations has also been important.  Because the Bell telephone companies are powerful telephone  companies that succeeded to the assets of AT&amp;T, they were put  under numerous regulations. Image transmission, such as cable  TV, was also regulated. In 1992, however, the authorities  concerned, the FCC, lifted the ban on video on demand (VOD)  service. VOD is a service that could be described as the  communication industry's version of rental videos: a customer  informs the telephone company of a movie that he or she wants to  see, and the telephone company then takes the movie from its  data base and delivers it by telecommunication line to the  customer.    This service is expected to become a main source of income  for regional telephone companies. Nynex expects that "over the  next 10 years, income from our voice service alone will be flat,  but if, to [this] high-speed data transmission, image  [transmission] is added, our income will double." The 150  megabits/second capacity of ATM switching machines is basically  unnecessary for data transmission alone, but it is necessary for  image transmission.    Cable television companies have also developed a policy of  installing optical fiber so as to counter the image transmission  service of telephone companies. TCI, the top cable TV company in  the United States, has invested about 1.9 billion dollars in  building a digital optical fiber network with a total length of  12,000 kilometers.  <H3>  In the Regulation-Bound Japanese Communications Market, It  Is Difficult To Develop Services for ATM </H3>   Mitsubishi Heavy Industries will install an ATM switching  machine in the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Yokohama Building,  which will open in the spring of 1994. Telephones, fax machines,  and computers will be connected by LAN. An ATM machine will be  used for the trunk line. At the stage when animated pictures and  other multimedia start being sent from terminals, other ATM's  will be installed for the branch lines.    In order to start a B-ISDN, an enormous investment is  required. In an estimate announced by NTT in the spring of 1993,  this amount was put at 45 trillion yen. Annually, NTT's total  facilities investment is about 1.8 trillion yen. Even if all of  this is invested in an B-ISDN, completion will take 20 years. In  order to maintain this kind of investment, services that will  increase income are needed. The one that is easiest to  understand is an image transmission service. At present,  however, telephone companies are unable to provide images to a  large number of people simultaneously.    The Research Committee of the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications has estimated that, by 2015, the diffusion  rate of B-ISDN's [in Japan] will be 77 percent. However, this is  if attractive applications appear and transmission charges are  inviting. If attractive applications do not appear, the  diffusion rate will rise no higher than 12 percent.    In 1988, NTT began an N-ISDN, "INS Net 64." This N-ISDN was  for the purpose of switching over from an analog phone line; at  the same time, it kept charges down to analog phone levels. The  goal was a system that "anyone can use anywhere." Thus, the  region in which it is used has rapidly expanded.    As of the end of May 1993, however, the number of  subscribers  was 30,425. In May 1994, the number of registered telephone  customers is expected to reach 59 million. As was anticipated,  customers did not initially switch to the INS network, which was  thus a service for which NTT ran a deficit. With the Japanese  communications market hedged round with restrictions, there is  little possibility that competition over the kind of services  that require ATM will rapidly develop within it. Through much  effort, Japanese ATM switching machines have become the most  advanced in the world, but it seems that it is American  communication companies who will be able to fully enjoy their  performance.</p>

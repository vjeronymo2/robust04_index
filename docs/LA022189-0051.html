			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEST BANK HEALTH CARE  </P> <P> An article by Daniel Williams ("Israeli Doctors and Arabs: Politics, Ethics in  Collision," Part I, Jan. 23) paints a distorted picture of the availability of  health care for Palestinian Arabs of Judea, Samaria and Gaza.  </P> <P> Allegations that Hadassah discriminates against any patient, under any  circumstances, are totally without foundation. Since 1913 Hadassah has provided  health care of the very highest quality to all who come to us in need -- Jews,  Christians, Muslims, Druze -- regardless of their ethnic origin, religious and  political beliefs or ability to pay. Throughout eight decades, as the Hadassah  Medical Organization has grown to become Israel's largest and finest  health-care complex, that policy has remained unchanged.  </P> <P> Arab doctors in Judea, Samaria and Gaza continue to refer patients to Hadassah  facilities despite the unrest in the territories, as they have done since the  hospitals first opened their doors.  </P> <P> For the past 20 years, Hadassah has been working to upgrade health care in the  territories by providing advanced professional training for Arab doctors and  nurses. At present, 85 doctors from Judea and Samaria and 11 nurses from Gaza  are participating in these programs. In addition, Palestinian Arabs are well  represented among graduates of Hadassah's international master's degree program  in public health and community medicine.  </P> <P> It is true that the conflict in the territories has had an impact on health  care for Palestinian Arabs. Like all Israelis, residents of the territories  contribute from their salaries to a fund for their medical needs. As Arab  unrest has taken its toll on earnings, less money has been available to pay for  medical treatment.  </P> <P> However, under an agreement between Hadassah and the civil administration of  Judea and Samaria, Hadassah will be reimbursed for the care of any patient who  is certified as being "in immediate risk of life or limb" on admission. In  other cases, the cost of treating patients who cannot afford to pay is absorbed  by Hadassah. Despite economic obstacles and the continuing conflict between  Palestinian and Israeli, Hadassah remains committed to caring for all who come  to us for help, without regard to race, creed or economic circumstances.  </P> <P> HELENE GREENFIELD  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> Southern Pacific Coast Region  </P> <P> of Hadassah  </P></p>

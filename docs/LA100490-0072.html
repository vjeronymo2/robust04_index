			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GREENSPAN BOOSTS BUDGET PACT BUT OPPOSITION GROWS;  </P> <P> CONGRESS: DEFEAT WOULD MEAN TROUBLE IN FINANCIAL MARKETS, THE FED CHIEF SAYS.  DEMOCRATS JOIN GOP CRITICS. CALLS FROM VOTERS HEAVILY OPPOSE THE  DEFICIT-CUTTING DEAL.  </P> <P> Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned Wednesday that there will be  trouble in the financial markets if the new bipartisan budget accord is  defeated, but opposition in Congress surged as Democrats joined Republicans in  opposing key provisions.  </P> <P> In testimony before Congress, Greenspan said failure to enact the agreement  "would have an adverse reaction in the financial markets that could undercut  our economy." President Bush echoed that, saying: "If we . . . don't get a deal  . . . we are courting economic disaster."  </P> <P> The developments came as the $500-billion deficit reduction package ran into a  firestorm of protests from voters Wednesday, raising the risk that it could be  defeated in the House today, despite intensive lobbying by Bush and top  congressional leaders.  </P> <P> Rebellious House Republicans, upset over higher taxes, were joined by key  Democrats, who protested the agreement's provisions for Medicare cuts and new  tax incentives for wealthy investors on the eve of the first test vote on the  plan.  </P> <P> At the same time, lawmakers of both parties reported receiving a barrage of  telephone calls from constituents protesting key elements of the budget-cutting  package, prompting some lawmakers to reconsider supporting the pact. Many  reported that opposition to the pact was running as high as 20 to 1.  </P> <P> Rep. Bruce A. Morrison (D-Conn.), who opposes the plan, said his phone calls  were averaging 3 to 1 against it after Bush's televised appeal. "The cuts are  all flesh and blood, while the deficit is abstract, and (President Bush) didn't  succeed in changing that" in his speech," he said.  </P> <P> The lawmakers are scheduled to vote today on a fiscal 1991 congressional budget  resolution -- the first of a series of such ballots designed to incorporate the  new budget plan into law. The process is slated to be completed by Oct. 19.  </P> <P> Bush canceled a Republican party fund-raising trip to New England to try to  round up votes for the agreement, telephoning undecided Republicans and meeting  with regional reporters to help promote the plan.  </P> <P> Although strategists in both parties acknowledged that they still lack the  votes to pass the resolution in the House, Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.)  said his "intuition" still tells him that the measure will pass.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Budget Director Richard G. Darman asserted that Bush will not accept  any changes in the agreement, even if he was offered a chance to restore his  own proposal for a cut in capital gains taxes.  </P> <P> "If we start to change this, it will unravel," Darman told reporters at a  Washington luncheon Wednesday. "You are either for it or you are not. It's got  to be a package."  </P> <P> There were these other developments:  </P> <P>  -- House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) protested  that some parts of the accord will "muck up the tax code," hinting that his  panel probably will rewrite much of that part of the pact.  </P> <P> Rostenkowski indicated that at the least he will try to change a new incentive  for investors in start-up firms that have a total stock equity of less than $50  million, which he said would help only the wealthy at the expense of the poor  and the elderly.  </P> <P>  -- Rep. David R. Obey (D-Wis.), a ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations  Committee, organized a group of liberal Democrats to oppose the budget  resolution on grounds that it would give "tax breaks to the rich while socking  the middle class with new taxes."  </P> <P>  -- Both parties reported that they were still short of the votes needed to  approve the budget agreement in the House. Republicans acknowledged that they  were at least 20 votes shy of the necessary 89 needed to provide the GOP's  House endorsement of the accord.  </P> <P> And Democratic leaders also fell short of nailing down the 130 votes that they  would have to deliver. "We haven't got the votes yet," one insider said. "The  outcome is uncertain." Under the terms of the pact, a majority of each party  must endorse it before it takes effect.  </P> <P> Democratic leaders scheduled a third caucus of rank-and-file members just  before today's scheduled vote in hopes of generating additional support, but  one of Foley's lieutenants said time seemed to be working against the  agreement.  </P> <P> By far the most stunning development Wednesday on Capitol Hill seemed to be the  impact of the deluge of telephone calls that lawmakers received from their  constituents.  </P> <P> One supporter of the plan, Rep. Don J. Pease (D-Ohio) received 136 calls in his  district offices and only seven of them favored it. "It's the gas tax and  Medicare," an aide said.  </P> <P> Rep. Ron Marlenee (R-Mont.), an opponent of the plan, said calls to his office  were running 80% against, and Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Highland), who endorsed the  President's speech, said his telephone calls were running almost as heavily  against the accord.  </P> <P> Greenspan's comments Wednesday reflected a fear that he has expressed before --  that defeat of the accord would plunge the financial markets into turmoil and  might send the economy into a serious recession.  </P> <P> Those fears have been supported in financial markets in recent days. The dollar  has been sliding for several weeks, largely because of investors' dismay over  U.S. economic policies before the budget accord was negotiated.  </P> <P> Bush argued to a group of reporters Wednesday that one of the major unheralded  benefits of approving the accord would be "staving off economic catastrophe."  He said foreign investors already have balked at financing the huge U.S. budget  deficit.  </P> <P> Greenspan has been telling both sides for weeks that, if the White House and  Congress reached a credible accord on how to reduce the budget deficit, the  financial markets probably would be revitalized and interest rates would go  down on their own.  </P> <P> At the same time, he has refused to ease monetary policy to help push interest  rates down artificially, as the Administration has asked, contending that such  a move would only fuel fears that the Federal Reserve was abandoning the fight  against inflation and ultimately would send interest rates rising in the  markets.  </P> <P> Asked Wednesday if he believes that interest rates would decline if the current  accord was approved, he replied without hesitation: "Most certainly."  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who previously has been  urging Greenspan to help push interest rates down artificially, sided with the  Fed chairman and argued that enacting the budget plan would produce that same  effect.  </P> <P> "It's simple," Brady said in a statement late Wednesday: "If Congress passes  the budget agreement, interest rates will come down. If they don't, interest  rates will go up." He called the accord "credible and enforceable."  </P> <P> For all the sharp divisions in the House, strategists say prospects in the  Senate are far brighter. "Compared to the House, our waters are calm -- not  smooth, but calm," said Sen. Wyche Fowler Jr. (D-Ga.), one of the original  budget negotiators.  </P> <P> In his meeting with reporters, Bush said he would encourage lawmakers to make  him the scapegoat, if necessary, to support the agreement. "Say the President  encouraged you," he said. "Blame me, because I know what's best for our  country."  </P> <P> Just the same, the vote slated in the House for today appeared likely to be  close.  </P> <P> "My prediction is that it will pass by one vote -- it's tough going on both  sides" of the aisle, said Rep. Charles W. Stenholm (D-Tex.). "I don't like it  at all, but I'm supporting it because there is no credible alternative."  </P> <P> House Democrats from California, who usually support their party's leadership  on major votes, were against the plan, 13 to 5, at their weekly breakfast. A  delegation source said he expects as many as 18 of its 27 members to oppose the  package when the vote is taken.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, frictions intensified Wednesday between the White House and House  Republican Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who has annoyed the Administration by  leading a GOP revolt against the accord.  </P> <P> In one incident Wednesday, Bush pointedly snubbed Gingrich when the Georgian  came to the Executive Mansion for a ceremony celebrating Atlanta's success in  landing the 1992 summer Olympics. Gingrich shrugged it off, terming the  President a "tough competitor."  </P> <P> And Darman predicted that the conservative rebellion that Gingrich is leading  ultimately would prove to be only "a distraction. I do not believe his  objections will be lethal" to passage of the accord.  </P> <P> Gingrich said Wednesday that he had received 775 calls, 83% of them siding with  him against the President.  </P> <P> Other offices, although reporting a lower volume of calls than Gingrich, said  they were running heavily against the agreement, primarily because of its  Medicare cutbacks and a big increase in the gasoline tax.  </P> <P> The office of Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), for example, tallied 86 calls  against the plan and only six in favor of it by midday Wednesday. "People are  not just opposed, they're vehemently opposed," said Levine's top aide, William  Andresen.  </P> <P> Other House members surveyed by The Times reported similar counts. They  included Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Los  Angeles), Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) and Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles).  </P> <P> Rep. George E. Brown Jr. (D-Colton) said he probably would vote against the  package because of its cutbacks in Medicare and higher taxes on gasoline and  beer.  </P> <P> Voting on the package only weeks before the Nov. 6 elections makes it more  likely that House members, who all stand for reelection every two years, may  vote against the agreement, congressional sources acknowledged.  </P> <P> Staff writers James Risen and David Lauter contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE BATTLE FOR THE BUDGET  </P> <P> Where the major players stand:  </P> <P> BUSH ADMINISTRATION: President Bush stepped up his lobbying. "It is our last,  best chance to try to get this federal deficit under control. . . . A major  benefit is short-run -- a staving off of economic catastrophe."  </P> <P> FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN: Alan Greenspan strongly endorsed the package.  Although he did not promise to ease credit, he said he expected interest rates  to fall if it passes.  </P> <P> CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP: House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said he expects a  majority of both parties in the House will vote for the plan today. Senate  Majority Leader George J. Mitchell said it would pass if a majority of  Republicans decide to back Bush.  </P> <P> CHIEF TAX WRITER: Dan Rostenkowski, House Ways and Means Committee chairman,  complained the budget deal "mucks up the tax code" by providing new tax  shelters for the wealthy at the expense of the poor.  </P> <P> CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS: The rebellion led by Rep. Newt Gingrich, the  second-ranking GOP leader, lost some steam. "Gingrich is just a distraction,"  said White House Budget Director Richard G. Darman. "He's got a bright future,  but not right now."  </P> <P> LIBERAL DEMOCRATS: A group of liberal Democrats led by Rep. David R. Obey  organized to try to scuttle the agreement. "I really think it stinks," said  another liberal, Rep. Patricia Schroeder. "It's very unfair to the middle  class."  </P></p>

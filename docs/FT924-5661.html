			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rallies on strong durable goods orders Wall Street US stock markets rallied strongly in heavy trading on unexpectedly good economic news, although late selling took the edge off some of the gains, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 25.66 at 3,248.70, well below earlier highs when the index had been up 40 points. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 finished 2.47 higher at 427.59, the Amex composite 0.79 firmer at 391.53, and the Nasdaq composite up 7.10 at 645.94, a new all-time high. Turnover on the NYSE was extremely heavy at 242m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 1,113 to 707. After a relatively quiet opening, prices moved higher after the Commerce Department said that durable goods orders in October rose by 3.9 per cent, and the Conference Board that its index of consumer confidence had climbed from 54.6 in October to 65.5 in November. Both reports were much more positive about the economy than analysts had been expecting. Investors were initially hesitant about responding to the durable goods orders number - one of the most unreliable of the monthly indicators, and heavily affected by volatile defence and civilian aircraft orders - but the consumer confidence figures were more convincing. Cyclicals and other blue-chips posted especially big gains. International Paper rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 62 5/8 , IBM climbed Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 64 7/8 , Procter &amp; Gamble put on Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 54 5/8 , Caterpillar rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 54 and Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing firmed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 101 3/4 . The effects of some of Monday's big corporate announcements continued to wash through the market. Martin Marietta, which rose sharply on Monday on news of its Dollars 3.05bn acquisition of General Electric's aerospace interests, suffered a reaction, dropping Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 62 1/8 . GE, which had also risen on the news, fared better, firming Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 82 7/8 . Westinghouse was another stock to run into profit-taking. Following a big rise on Monday's major restructuring news, the industrial conglomerate fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 11, erasing part of Monday's advance. On the Nasdaq market, Dell Computer rose Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 35 1/2 on the news that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into recent trading patterns in the stock, particularly the gains that followed its earnings last week, and the sharp losses which came after Kidder Peabody, the broking house, issued a report raising questions about improper accounting of foreign currency trading activities at Dell. Microsoft jumped Dollars 3 to Dollars 91 1/2 in turnover of 4.3m shares after Mr Rick Sherlund, who cut his earnings forecasts for the computer group on Monday, said that his new estimates were 'likely too conservative.' Canada Final closing volume on the Toronto Stock Exchange was 31.92m shares, including after-hours trading volume of 129,700 shares. PWA Corp fell 24 cents to CDollars 1.21 and traders said that a federal government promise to provide the company with up to CDollars 50m in financial aid was not enough to support the share price.</p>

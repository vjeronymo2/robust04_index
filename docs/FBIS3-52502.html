There is no immediate solution to the problem  of these foreign nationals and the apparent moves initiated by  the government from time to time seem a futile exercise.  Nothing concrete could be achieved in the past nor are there  any chances of success in future.    Most of these Arabs, primarily Egyptians, Tunisians and  Algerians, are engaged with various non-governmental  organisations (NGOs) working for the welfare and rehabilitation  of the Afghan refugees across the NWFP [North West Frontier  Province]. Their major concentration is in Peshawar.    Recently there have been serious allegations against these  foreigners for their involvement in a number of terrorist  activities in their mother countries. Pakistan it is learnt,  has come under quite a lot of pressure from those countries  following the increased militant activities, including bomb  explosions and armed attacks on the government officials as well  as on the foreign visitors by the religious groups.    However, the dilemma was that Egyptian, Tunisian and  Algerian  nationals cannot be extradited even if their respective  government formally demand because there is no extradition  treaty between Pakistan and these countries. A senior Interior  Ministry source explained that these foreign nationals can only  be arrested under the Foreigners Act for their illegal entry or  over-stay in Pakistan. They can be tried in the court of law and  punished for these offences but can't be extradited to their  countries forcibly.    "The legal process is that we can deport them to the country  where these people may wish to go and that for only if that  country is willing to accept them. If no other country is ready  to welcome them, then they must remain in jails. The process  also involves the concerned embassy officials and the Foreign  Office", the Interior Ministry official said.    He also said that there were hardly 300 to 400 such foreign  nationals now working with various Afghan groups and in  international NGOs [non-governmental organizations] helping the  rehabilitation of the Afghan refugees. He said that the  government has no plans to initiate any action against these  NGOs because they are working on humanitarian basis to help the  displaced Afghans. These NGOs are also a big [word indistinct]  factor for the resettlement and rehabilitation of the Afghan  refugees, he added.    The official said that all the foreign nationals engage with  these NGOs are under close watch. However, as they manoevre  across the border [word indistinct] freely, it is very difficult  to keep track of them. "Still our agencies are keeping an eye on  their activities", he said.    The officials dispelled all apprehensions about a major  action against the NGOs working for the Afghan refuges. It is  out of question. They are helping the refugees a great deal and  are of great assistance to the Government as such. However, any  foreign national found illegally staying in the country will be  dealt with appropriately", he warned.</p>

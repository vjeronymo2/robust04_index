			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hambros wanted The merchant banking sector was among the market's best performing areas, led ahead by Hambros, the UK's third biggest merchant bank by market capitalisation, after SG Warburg and Schroders. Hambros shares climbed 12 to 335p, with much of yesterday's buying interest said to have been triggered by a buy note issued by stockbroker Robert Fleming Securities. The banks team at Fleming upgraded profits and dividend forecasts, citing expectations of good underlying growth in the bank, strong recovery in estate agency profits, the highly successful flotation of Hambros Insurance Services and the attractive dividend yield, currently at a 30 per cent premium to the market. 'We have a 1993 target price of 375p, giving 16 per cent upside on the current share price,' said Fleming. The stockbroker lifted its 1993 profits estimate from Pounds 60m to Pounds 65m and its 1994 forecast from Pounds 70m to Pounds 86.5m. The 1994 dividend is expected to rise from 14.5p to 15p. Other merchant banks also performed well, SG Warburg adding 10 at 635p and Kleinwort Benson 3 at 386p.</p>

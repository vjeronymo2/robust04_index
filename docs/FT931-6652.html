			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Demand for healthcare MRS Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, yesterday called on health authorities to ensure that patients received emergency treatment when they needed it, following publication of a survey showing restricted hospital admissions because of shortage of funds. The survey from the British Medical Association showed that hospitals in every English region were introducing restrictions on admissions as money ran out before the end of the financial year. Restrictions were significantly greater in the south of England, the BMA survey found, with three of the four London regions reporting the highest levels. Surgical specialities were hardest hit with more than half the surgeons and gynaecologists in the survey facing restrictions. The survey found evidence of ward and bed closures, and non-emergency admissions restricted to patients of GP fundholders or those who have been waiting for long periods.</p>

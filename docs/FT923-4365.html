			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Trouble for the treaty With only two weeks to go before the French referendum, it is clear that the Maastricht treaty is in serious, possibly terminal, trouble. When the day arrives, perhaps France will vote Yes. But the recent collapse in popular support for the treaty suggests the result could go either way. This possibility is so seismic that we need to rethink the political implications of the treaty, and what is required to give it operational credibility. If the French vote No, the treaty is dead; but if they vote Yes by only a narrow margin, the treaty will still be in trouble, both in France and in the rest of Europe, because French support will be in doubt. It is not really useful to try to explain the shift in French sentiment mainly in terms of national factors. Obviously, there are such factors. But we are probably facing a general and systemic problem, which goes beyond the unpopularity of President Francois Mitterrand, let alone the convergent agitations of the National Front, the Communists and the unreconstructed Gaullists. When the Danes voted No to Maastricht, the experts were astonished, but they quickly ran up a Danish explanation: the Danes have never been really European. When victorious ('game, set and match') John Major started running away from the treaty, the experts were again stunned, but they soon came up with a British explanation: the British have never been really European. But in France the polls have for many years shown a large majority of general support for Europe. So if aversion to Maastricht has started spreading to France (not to mention to Germany as well), we are compelled to suspect that the problem is general, not specific. Some people cite an unfavourable constellation of events in Europe. The Community has yet to make any beneficial impact on the Yugoslav civil war, the disintegration of the ex-Soviet Union, the cost of German unification, high rates of interest, low rates of economic growth, and high and rising levels of unemployment. It is not surprising, perhaps, that the Community and its future ambitions fail to inspire confidence. This kind of explanation implies a deep frivolity on the part of the governments which negotiated the Maastricht treaty. It is obviously more difficult to launch monetary union in the depths of a recession; did they think it would ever be easy? Did they think they could have monetary union without confronting the issue of economic growth? Did they think they could sign up for a liberal-market economic policy without taking the political consequences? Nationalists say that Europe's record in Yugoslavia is proof positive that there can be no common European foreign policy. Not so; it is proof positive that a common foreign policy does not come cheap, let alone free; it does not prove that there is any alternative. The British government is manifestly determined that there shall be no common foreign policy; the Danish government has no desire for a common defence policy; yet they both signed the treaty, and have no alternatives. The heart of the matter is that there is a deep mismatch between the far-reaching policy ambitions of the Maastricht treaty and the absence of corresponding reforms of national democratic political processes. Maastricht calls for colossal poolings of sovereignty in economic and monetary policy, as well as in foreign and defence policy. Those poolings of sovereignty simply cannot be counted on to be effective without the continuous and whole-hearted support of the electorate. But governments have largely disregarded the voters. This problem is usually called the Community's 'democratic deficit', meaning that there should be more powers for the European Parliament. This is just Euro-cant. The reality is that the EC is a community of democratic nation states. All significant strategic choices in this community will have to be mediated through the democratic systems of these nation states for many years to come; and every extra pooling of national sovereignty must be worked through the national democratic processes. Yet most of the 12 governments appear to think they can put the treaty into practice without further reference to the voters; all of them appear to think they can dispense with reform of their domestic democratic arrangements. Moreover, a Maastricht-type programme requires the kind of cross-party consent which would survive electoral swings. The Danes voted No by a little more than 50 per cent; does anyone think they could have implemented Maastricht with an equally narrow Yes vote? Mr Jacques Chirac, Gaullist leader, has at last committed himself to a Yes; but half his party is hostile to Maastricht, and it is likely to lead a conservative victory in March's parliamentary elections. The most acute internal contradiction is in Britain, of course. Mr Major has made 'subsidiarity' his hobby horse, but there are just two problems. In Europe, subsidiarity implies mutual trust, but the British do not trust foreigners; at home, subsidiarity implies local democracy, but Mr Major rejects any democratic reform of Britain's monolithic centralised state. Whatever happens in France, the arithmetic of the Commons will make it very difficult for Mr Major to ratify the Maastricht treaty; the conflict between the political requirements of the treaty and the nature of the British state will make it impossible for him to implement it.</p>

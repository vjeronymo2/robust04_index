			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SANCTIONS AGAINST JOHNSON'S COACH, DOCTOR PROMISED  </P> <P> The International Amateur Athletic Federation promised today to impose  sanctions against the coach and doctor who administered Ben Johnson's steroid  program.  </P> <P> Federation President Primo Nebiolo said once the IAAF is in possession of the  report from the Canadian government inquiry into drug use by athletes, punitive  action will be taken against Coach Charlie Francis and Dr. Jamie Astaphan.  </P> <P> The IAAF decided Tuesday to strip Johnson of his 100-meter world record set in  Rome. Earlier, Johnson forfeited the gold medal he won at the Seoul Olympics  after testing positive for a steroid.  </P> <P> Neither Francis nor Astaphan have IAAF affiliation, but Ollan Cassel, an  American member of the federation's 24-member general council, said the IAAF  can impose sanctions to ensure that they are regarded as persona non grata by  the track and field community.  </P></p>

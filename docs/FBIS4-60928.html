			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mykola Bilovil, UKRAYINSKA HAZETA military </F> columnist: "It Is for Good Reason That Admirals Bezkorovaynyy  and Ryzhenko Are Sounding the Alarm"]    [Text] Two reprints from the newspapers SLAVA SEVASTOPOLYA  and FLOT UKRAYINY have recently been discussed quite extensively  and with concern by servicemen. The authors of the articles are  extremely reputable people and, in my opinion, their positions  and their proposals must be taken into account by Ukraine's  minister of defense and by President Kravchuk in their actions  and decisions, as these people know the state of affairs and the  situation in the Crimea best of all.    Today, in the south of our fatherland and especially in  Sevastopol, one can see the most intricate tangle of  Ukrainian-Russian relations and contradictions.    Let me remind you that, in many of its publications,  UKRAYINSKA HAZETA foresaw this development of events in the  Black Sea Fleet. More than once, our newspaper sounded the alarm  that Ukraine's sea borders remain either totally defenseless or  will, together with our armed forces, be occupied by our  northern neighbor.    Unfortunately, the leadership of the Ukrainian State thought  differently. Nothing at all has been done by it to defend our  sacred right to have our own navy and be a sea-faring power. On  the contrary, everything was done in order to open channels for  bringing this undertaking to naught. The most graphic example  here is the removal from the post of Ukraine's defense minister  of Colonel General Kostyantyn Morozov, who came out against the  Massandra accords honestly, frankly, and openly. UKRAYINSKA  HAZETA also wrote about this. To safeguard Ukrainian interests,  General Morozov did not hesitate to disagree with the president,  who was about to give Russia our entire Black Sea base. One can  see now who was wrong. With the difference that General Morozov  lost his post. Perhaps, our two supreme chief commanders  [Kravchuk and Radetskyy] will pat attention to the hardships  that the Ukrainian sailors are subjected to by the Russian  "guests," more specifically, by the impudent masters of the  situation."    Nor do some politicians overseas pay attention to the  Ukrainian Armed Forces. For example, at the beginning of April,  U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine W. Miller visited Sevastopol. For  some reason, he rushed to meet with commander of the Black Sea  Fleet Admiral Baltin -- Russia's plenipotentiary. This was  confirmed to me by the Press Service of Ukraine's Naval Forces.  It is also a surprising fact that nothing is known, neither  there or in Kiev, about the objective, course, or results of the  U.S. diplomat's visit.    Who needs this game between two fires? I believe that this  is interference on the part of a foreign state into our internal  affairs. Living in our home and going to neighbors. This is  the kind of independence we have. Everybody ignores us, and our  own people seem to encourage such an attitude.    It is on this matter that Vice Admiral Volodymyr  Bezkorovaynyy and Rear Admiral Oleksiy Ryzhenko are sounding the  alarm. It is to their credit that they risk their careers by  caring about Ukraine's interests and tell us how our "sworn  brothers," with whom we share the Black Sea, deceive us, and  also demand that the leaders of our state return to Yalta  Accords in dividing the Black Sea Fleet into Russian and  Ukrainian parts.    Unfortunately, very unfortunately, so it seems to me, their  voices do not reach our president's ear, heart, or mind. Why  does he keep silence and does not react to the cold-blooded  injustice that the Russian military leaders perpetrate on our  land?    Today, Mr. Baltin only fulfills Russia's orders, introduces  Russian symbols everywhere and dismisses, on various pretenses,  those servicemen who have pledged allegiance to Ukraine....    Who is then the guest and who is the host? Who will defend  Ukrainian sailors, expected to defend Ukraine? This is a  paradox of an independent country. The country is dependent and  it appears that so is its president.    However, upon whom?</p>

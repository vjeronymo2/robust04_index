			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: REFLECTIONS IN A JAUNDICED EYE BY FLORENCE KING (ST.  MARTIN'S PRESS: $7.95)  </P> <P> These essays confirm Florence King's reputation as one of the wittiest  curmudgeons in the United States: Her escutcheon undoubtedly bears the motto  "with malice toward all." She mercilessly excoriates the follies of American  popular culture, from portentous magazine articles on the role of the American  male to the "pseudo-feminist myth" of the caring workplace.  </P> <P> A discussion of contemporary literature includes a devastating assesment of  John Updike ("reading him is like cutting through whale blubber with embroidery  scissors") and a hilarious spoof of "Gone With the Wind," rewritten in  contemporary jargon ("Frankly, my dear, it doesn't impact me"). The delightful  cynicism of "Reflections" provides a welcome antidote to the blandly optimistic  catch phrases and sound bites of America in the early '90s.  </P></p>

			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Kumagai likely to follow the LDP policy line: Trade and Agriculture - As Japan's coalition takes office FT writers assess the likely policy changes CONCERN among Japanese bureaucrats that inexperienced politicians would take the lead in trade policy was alleviated yesterday by the appointment of the Japan Renewal Party's Mr Hiroshi Kumagai as the minister for International Trade and Industry, and Mr Eijiro Hata, also of the JRP, as agricultural minister. Mr Kumagai, 53, is an advocate of deregulation and decentralisation, and has been critical of the cohesion among politicians, bureaucrats and businesses. He is also known as the right hand man of Mr Ichiro Ozawa, co-leader of the JRP, and has nurtured international links during his stint at Harvard University. He is known for his outspokenness and is famous for openly criticising Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, former prime minister, for his economic policy. However, as a former trade bureaucrat and ex-Liberal Democratic Party member, Mr Kumagai is likely to inherit the policies of the LDP and produce few surprises. He yesterday reiterated the line of the Miti mandarins on numerical targets for the country's imports. He said managed trade would counter Japan's direction of deregulation and market liberalisation. Instead it was Mr Tsutomu Hata, the new foreign minister, who shed some light on the new government's direction on trade. He expressed the need for Japan to take 'tough and painful' decisions to open its markets to avert the consequences of trade friction with the US. 'Not only the government, but private industries and the people must see that it is not good for Japan to be sole winner,' he said. Mr Hata suggested that Japan would take a tougher stance on trade, as he said an impression that Japan is being bullied into concessions by the US would create 'extremely dangerous' feelings on both sides. For those who had hoped Mr Hosokawa's rise to power would lead to an opening of the country's rice market, the coalition's official line of keeping the market closed has been disappointing. Mr Hosokawa's Japan New Party had initially called for the liberalisation of the rice market. Most of the members of the JRP, the core of the coalition, are supported by rural constituencies, while the Social Democratic Party is also beholden to farmers' interests. Mr Hata said it was simplistic to think Japan's rice import ban alone was preventing conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks. Mr Eijiro Hata said he would respect the ban on rice imports. While Mr Hata, aged 64, has had close links to the post and telecommunications ministry, and has been involved in the privatisation of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, his background lies in a rural area in southern Japan. Mr Kumagai yesterday repeatedly stressed the importance of the successful completion of the Uruguay Round. Officials at Miti claim that there will be a more international focus on policies. However, to lead his former colleagues at the trade ministry to a new openness, while fighting off pressure from Japan's western peers, Mr Kumagai will need to be more than Mr Ozawa's right hand man.</p>

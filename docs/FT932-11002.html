			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Arts: Balanchine's 'Ballet Imperial' The history of Balanchine's Ballet Imperial at Covent Garden has been curious, lamentable. The ballet was made in 1941 for a show-the-flag tour of South America by Balanchine's erstwhile company; the choreographer's realisation of Tchaikovsky's second piano concerto was an abstraction of the emotional and technical world of the Petipa repertory, and also of the courtly society that sustained it. When New York City Ballet was preparing to make its first London visit in 1950, Balanchine was invited to mount a piece for the Royal Ballet, and Ballet Imperial was staged with designs by Eugene Berman. The design, like the ballet, was a marvel, and our dancers soon took the measure of the choreography and its bravura style. Fonteyn, the first cast ballerina, was not happy in the role; her successor, Moira Shearer, gave a glittering, splendid interpretation. Among later ballerinas, Nadia Nerina and Antoinette Sibley were especially fine, rejoicing in the classic exactness of the part and in its evocative richness. Ballet Imperial was a jewel in the repertory. It was, inexplicably, given new - and very blue - design in 1963 by Carl Toms. A decade later, as Balanchine revised the piece for his own company, it was further democratised here by Terence Emery's design, which set the piece in an urban underpass with dismal outfits for the performers, who did not look their best. Ballet Imperial was now Piano Concerto Number 2, and much of its identity was eroded. Worse was to come in 1985 with a wholly inapt re-designing by Christopher Lebrun (the piece now located in a wasteland), compounded by ferociously inadequate performance. Balanchine was betrayed. With this season's revival we have something like an amende honorable. The Berman designs have been restored - albeit 'realised' by Anthony Dowell - and the piece has been re-staged by Patricia Neary. There must be at least two and a half cheers for the return of Berman's concept. The stage looks magnificent, and Berman's fantasy of pillars and flambeaux and crowned eagle, between great swags of gold drapery, is a triumph of stage decoration. Dowell has lightened the image through use of gauzes - the pillars are more vaporous than heretofore - but he respects the emotional world that Berman established in such harmony with the choreography. The costumes are in the main well realised, though some colours and details are, I think, slightly 'off'. The leading ballerina should wear a brighter, clearer yellow; the decoration on the second ballerina's bodice is missing and must be restored, since it reflects Berman's visual theme. A more serious matter is the text proposed by Miss Neary. She has given the Royal Ballet the version now current in New York. The choreography as mounted in London in 1950 was, if memory serves, more varied in detail, and more suited to the idea of dancers wearing tutus. Shearer, Nerina, Sibley, were pur-sang classical artists who cut Balanchine's steps like diamonds, and showed these gems with imperious dignity and grace. The later text (Balanchine's revision for his own troupe) implied speed and a more democratic image - the women wore chiffon dresses - and it runs counter to the courtly world of Berman's decoration. Vastly welcome as this Ballet Imperial is, it is not quite at ease with itself. Matters may be helped with more idiomatic performances than those from the first cast. Viviana Durante skims through every difficulty with enviable ease, but the scale of her dancing is too small: grandeur is lacking. The ballerina's consort was first taken by Michael Somes. Nobility, romantic presence, were his, and he made the ravishing middle movement seem like a vision scene from some long-lost Petipa work. No-one since has given the part such poetry. In this revival Bruce Sansom is extinguished both by the role and by his costume. Darcey Bussell is happy as the second ballerina - if not always as bright in step as she might be - and her two cavaliers are pleasing. The ensemble is clear, well-mannered: if I have a wish for this important restoration, it is that experience will enable the cast to show these superlative dances with bolder attack, greater feeling for their grand shape. Like St Petersburg itself, the choreography is ideal in proportion, gleaming with light. This latest Covent Garden triple bill brings a powerful revival of MacMillan's Gloria, done with tangible dedication by its cast - Leanne Benjamin, Christopher Saunders, Adam Cooper, Nicola Roberts. The images of grief and despair - and compassionate love - which inspire these revenants touch the heart. It is a beautiful ballet, given with absolute integrity. The programme also includes David Bintley's 'Still Life' at the Penguin Cafe, which I do not understand at all. The audience reacts with delight to dancers impersonating animals (yet again]). I think we should encourage poachers. This programme repeats on May 6, May 20, May 26</p>

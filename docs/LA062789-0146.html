			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GEORGIA PROFESSOR'S COMPLAINTS REJECTED;  </P> <P> PRESIDENT SAYS KEMP BECAME TARGET OF RETALIATORY ACTS  </P> <P> An investigation into grievances filed by University of Georgia Prof. Jan Kemp  found that she was subjected to retaliation, but university President Charles  B. Knapp said in a report released today that most of her complaints have  little merit.  </P> <P> The details were included in an inch-thick report released by the university.  </P> <P> In a wide-ranging set of grievances, Kemp earlier this year alleged that there  were deficiencies in the student judicial program, problems in the testing of  students and reporting of their scores, excessive assistance by tutors for  athletes in the developmental studies program, abuses in drug testing of  athletes and partiality toward wealthy students and athletes in disciplinary  matters.  </P> <P> Two faculty committees and the university's legal advisers reviewed the  grievances filed by Kemp, who gained prominence in 1986 for a lawsuit that  successfully challenged her firing from the university. She won a $1.08-million  judgment.  </P> <P> Knapp said at a news conference that there was no basis for the major  complaints filed by Kemp, although he added that the university is going to  "tighten up" a variety of academic and administrative procedures as a result.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mandated by State  </P> <P> In the report, Knapp said a recommendation by a faculty committee that the  university consider abolishing its developmental studies program is impossible  because the remedial program is mandated by the state Board of Regents.  </P> <P> But Knapp did find instances of retaliation against Kemp.  </P> <P> According to the report, the university committees confirmed that inaccuracies  had been placed in Kemp's personnel file, that her campus address had been  changed in the university directory to an erroneous one, that she discovered by  mailing faked letters that her mail was not being forwarded to the correct  address and that in 1986 a university administrator interfered with her  speaking engagements.  </P> <P> Knapp said he considered the acts of retaliation against Kemp a serious matter.  He refused to detail the inaccuracies found in her personnel file, saying that  would be an invasion of privacy.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE AUDIENCE  </P> <P> Cultural historians have long remarked on America's need for a frontier. First  there was the American West, conquered by covered wagon. Then more distant  continents caught the national eye, sought by ocean steamer and battleship.  Since the early 1980s, America's frontier has been the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> This is less farfetched than it sounds. Ever since Mikhail S. Gorbachev parted  the Iron Curtain, Americans have been romanticizing the Soviet Union and its  apparent barrenness. By the thousands they have sent themselves and their  culture to this New World, and the Soviet Union, with its archaic rituals and  puritanical cultural traits, has in turn bestowed an aura of exotica on each  endeavor -- just like a new Amazon or another North Pole. Unfortunately,  Americans have all too often selected the mediocre from their culture for such  evangelizing, as in sending Big Macs and Motley Crue to the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Consider this past weekend's two-day heavy-metal showdown in Moscow's Lenin  Stadium. Hyped as the Soviet Union's "Woodstock," much of the press coverage  has made imperialistic assumptions about the Soviets who flocked to the  extravaganza. Many reports implied that this was Moscow's first taste of real  heavy metal, for instance. In fact, such Western bands, including one of the  festival's headliners, the Scorpions, have toured the Soviet Union in past  years.  </P> <P> Other reports assumed that Soviet spectators had learned their concert behavior  from Western videos. In fact, there is a large, well-developed "metalist"  culture in the Soviet Union that has a complete set of its own rites, including  concert rituals. There was also an expectation that this event was an  unmitigated thrill for poor heavy-metal-deprived Soviet adolescents. Did anyone  consider that maybe this concert could have been no more and no less than a  big, fun party for Soviet heavy-metal fans -- as it would have been for their  American peers? There was a pervasive and unwarranted assumption throughout all  this hype that the Soviets were ignorant of heavy metal and grateful for the  brush with anything American.  </P> <P> This arrogance has fed into a new cultural fad: Everything Soviet is hip. Every  interest group -- from trout fishermen to disabled boaters -- wants to hook up  with a Soviet counterpart. Corporations want to sell their wares to the  natives; performers gain prestige by singing to them. The Soviets have become a  bulging reservoir that Americans tap to feel good about themselves, their  economy and their culture, no matter how mediocre.  </P> <P> So before this American cultural imperialism gets out of hand, we'd like to put  in a plea for respect and moderation. The heavy-metal fest revealed less about  changes in the Soviet Union than it did about static American attitudes toward  the rest of the world.  </P></p>

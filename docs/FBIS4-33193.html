			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Enrique Mora] </F>   [Text] San Jose, 1 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Costa Rican President  Jose Maria Figueres said that because of world changes, the  collapse of ideological barriers, and the end of the Cold War,  Costa Rica believes that it should review its policy toward Cuba.    Figueres, in statements to NOTIMEX, said he considers "this  review of the Cuban case should be done by all the hemisphere's  countries, to find a peaceful solution to the island's  situation."    It is not a question of establishing relations in the near  future. It is a question that relations with that country  should take on a new, broader outlook, more in accordance with  the international situation, Figueres said.    The president has repeatedly said that the solution to the  Cuban problem should be dealt with through negotiations at the  hemispheric level, to avoid bloodshed in Cuba.    The government of former President Rafael Angel Calderon  Fournier (1990 to May 1994) on several occasions spoke of the  need to resolve Cuba's integration into the inter-American  system through dialogue, in order to avoid bloodshed.    During the last UN General Assembly, Costa Rica voted with  the majority of countries against the U.S. blockade of Cuba.    Costa Rica considers the U.S.-imposed blockade of Cuba a  violation of international law contrary to the spirit of free  trade, which the United States promised to respect through the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    On this same topic, Foreign Affairs Minister Fernando  Naranjo, underscored that "today Cuba lives under an oppressive  political and economic situation, in which the people are the  ones who suffer."    "The Cuban people deserve a better future, and it is Latin  America's obligation to raise its voice in defense of democracy,  sovereignty, and liberties for the entire hemisphere," Naranjo  explained.    The foreign minister clarified that "Costa Rica is not  willing to support actions that condemn a people to hunger,  poverty, and oppression, because respect of all human rights is  part and parcel of being Costa Rican."    Naranjo pointed out to N0TIMEX that "Cuba's delicate  situation should be analyzed in depth by all countries in the  hemisphere because of international changes that have taken  place," such as the end of the East-West conflict and the end of  the Cold War.    "If Costa Rica is able to contribute anything, if Costa Rica  can add its grain of sand to find a solution to Cuba's crisis,  we are willing to play that role, because passivity is the worst  mistake at this moment," Naranjo stressed.    The foreign minister said that "hopefully all Costa Ricans  will join together to encourage a hemispheric position in the  case of Cuba, and this is in full agreement with the democratic  principles the American continent today brandishes with pride."</p>

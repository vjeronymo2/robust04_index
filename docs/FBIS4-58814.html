			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben and Yosi Torpstein] </F>   [Excerpts] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said during his  meeting yesterday with Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa  that if Japan wishes to have an impact on the Middle East  political process, it should embrace a balanced policy and show  greater involvement in Israeli affairs.    Rabin said the Russians have realized that if they wish to  influence the peace process, they cannot hold biased views.  "Having understood that, the Russians decided to adopt a  balanced policy, which allows them to influence events," the  prime minister said.    The prime minister said that Japanese-Israeli relations have  known difficulties, and although a favorable change has taken  place over the past few years, there is room for continuing  improvement. He stressed the importance of increased Japanese  investment in Israel, which cannot be only a market for Japanese  products. "U.S.-based multinational companies, such as  Motorola, Digital, and IBM, have invested in Israel," Rabin  noted.    The prime minister stressed Israel's commitment to the  implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord, explaining that at  the PLO's request, the withdrawal from Gaza will take longer  than anticipated. He asked Japan to increase its involvement in  the peace process, mainly by exploiting its ties in the Arab  world.    The prime minister asked his guest to raise the issue of the  Israeli MIA's and Israel's request for new information on this  issue during his forthcoming meetings with President Hafiz  al-Asad in Damascus.    The Japanese foreign minister said his country has pledged  $200 million to the Palestinians over a two-year period. "Japan  assists Jordan as well, and it is acting to convince Syria to  join the multilateral talks," Kakizawa said. He added that  Japan is committed to continued active participation in the  multilateral process. Japan chairs the multilateral working  group on environmental issues.    Kakizawa noted the developing Japan-Israel ties in the  spheres of trade and scientific, technological, and cultural  cooperation. He said his country is committed to action against  the Arab boycott, and it misses no opportunity to pressure Arab  countries to call off the boycott. [passage omitted]    The Japanese foreign minister surprised the prime minister  by  revealing that he had visited Israel in 1964. "My return after  so many years reinforces the hope that we will see you in Japan  as early as this year," Kakizawa said. Rabin accepted the  invitation, explaining that his planned visit to Japan had been  postponed due to developments in Israel. [passage omitted]</p>

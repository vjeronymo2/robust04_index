Addressing a press conference tonight at the end of his  three-day official visit to Bangladesh, Canadian Secretary of  State for Asia-Pacific Raymond Chan said that Canada is not in  favor of linking trade with the so-called "human rights" in  China.    It will strengthen it's trade as well as political, social  and cultural exchanges with China, Chan affirmed.    Replying to a question, Chan also said that "Asia-Pacific  region is playing more and more important role in the world and  is becoming a more important trade partner of Canada."    Canada has to be more aggressive to seek out more trading  partners in the region, the secretary for state said, adding:  "Canada will continue to be friends of Asians."    As regards water sharing dispute between India and  Bangladesh  as well as Kashmir issue, Chan noted that his country is in  favor of resolving those issues through bilateral talks and  negotiations.    The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)  is a good forum for resolving bilateral issues among SAARC  member states, he stressed.    Chan described Canada-Bangladesh relations as "very good,"  saying the recent economic and political developments here "make  us optimistic about Bangladesh" and Canada would continue with  its assistance to this country.    Canada's development program for Bangladesh is its largest  worldwide and Canada is one of the major contributors to  development assistance here. Approximately 2 billion Canadian  dollars (about 1.5 billion U.S. dollars) has been provided to  Bangladesh since its independence in 1971.    Chan arrived here on March 6.</p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Travel '93: A touch of the hawk's wild wing - Adam Hopkins considers Aragon, which has some of Europe's most exhilarating countryside SOMEHOW the name of Aragon, though lovely on the ear to start with, also has a mean tinge to it - entirely appropriate to that doughty local monarch Ferdinand: the one, you will remember, who married a young lady from Castille (her name was Isabella) and became a model for Machiavelli's Prince. Since Aragon's countryside is not well known, what one may not realise in advance, is that large parts of it must rank among the most exhilarating in Europe, with more than a touch of the hawk's wild wing and a tremendous history. First, though, the saddest aspect of contemporary Aragon. Like Leon and Castille, like neighbouring Navarre, like rural Spain in general, Aragon is heavily depopulated, apart, that is, from Zaragoza, the local capital, which is vigorously alive and well. You might not spot the emptiness at first, since the local people are famous for loud voices and speaking their minds. Depopulated - yes; curmudgeonly - sometimes; lively - almost always; dreary - definitely not. As for the land itself, this comes sweeping down from the tops of the Pyrenees and, in the west, across the still-high valley of the River Aragon. The Aragon valley offers breadth and openness and mountain views, a tingling springtime greeness and deep old gold in summer. Its rocky edges are traversed by the shadows of red kites and griffin vultures. After the Aragon, it is on down into the tablelands of the Spanish interior, with a second river crossing at the Ebro (Zaragoza stands on the Ebro's banks) and any number of lesser mountain outcrops. Having teased myself in recent years with several small forays into Aragon, I decided to string some of the northern parts together, starting off with a few days in Jaca, in the Pyrenees, then making a car tour, first down to the plains and then up again into the mountains, but moving always in the general direction of the Mediterranean. My route was odd in the sense that it ended in the central Pyrenees. As it happened, I went on into Catalonia, though equally one could turn northwards into France, but apart from minor niggles I can commend it as fascinating and revelatory, and just occasionally quite challenging. Jaca was in fiesta when I got there, cheerful if a little ragged, with dancing outside the cathedral and water-fights among the children. My error lay in sticking too close to Hilaire Belloc, who swept through the area in 1909. The poem that begins 'Do you remember an inn, Miranda, do you remember an inn?', with plenty of muleteers, was a product of this trip, along with a less memorable prose work. Belloc called the Hotel Mur in Jaca: 'The kindest little hotel in Europe and certainly one of the cleanest in Spain.' Alas, it proved the epitome of dinginess and meagre spirits, a terrible contrast with the fiesta in the streets. There is no doubt that a modern Belloc would have put up 300 yards away in the entirely charming Conde Aznar. The history, though, more than made up for the Mur, for Jaca had acted as first capital of Aragon when the tiny state first started to emerge in the 9th century, fighting off the local Moorish conquerors inch by inch until finally, centuries later, it achieved the once unthinkable and captured Zaragoza. In Jaca, the early kings of Aragon built a dark and solid Romanesque cathedral and gave it some splendid sculptural touches. Sculptures and cathedral made a statement of intent. They also came in handy for impressing the pilgrims who now began to flow through the Somport Pass above (as equally they did at Roncesvalles, a good step further west) to start their long trek to Santiago de Compostela; and one of a visitor's cultural duties while in Jaca is to take at least a peek at Somport, a sombre affair due to be by-passed in the next few years by a road tunnel. The coming of this new all-weather route from France seems likely to result in many local changes, adding to those already caused by skiing, and may be seen as strengthening the case for an early visit. From Jaca, it was easy to take in Ferdinand's birthplace at steep and stony Sos del Rey Catolico, and, closer home, the monastery under a rock at San Juan de la Pena. Long before Ferdinand (born 1452, with bones in fact residing in Granada), the Aragonese kings and gentry had taken a fancy to being buried at San Juan beneath the rock. But the place was plagued by damp and falling stones, just as anyone remotely rational would have predicted. It was finally done in by Napoleon's troops at the start of the 19th century. San Juan remains an exciting little spot, historically and architecturally, but not half so exciting as the Ordesa and Monte Perdido national park, also close to Jaca, which occupied me for a further day and could have held me for a week if I had been braver. There is one high-level walk here where you hang on to iron stakes as you make your way along what seems from the photographs to be a precipice. I saved it up for next time, thank you. As it was, I spent two hours wiggling up a steep ascent, then six of purest joy descending through a gentle Z-bend, 10km on either haul, in the company of miniature azaleas, a brilliance of Alpines, butterflies by the kilo and waterfalls. If there is a lovelier or more impressive cleft in the Pyrenees, entirely without roads or noise of engines, I have yet to find it. Now it was time to follow the Aragonese advance with a lancing movement south towards the plains. The castle of Loarre, another royal artefact, soars up in a rugged stump on the very final outcrop of the Pyrenean foothills. Loarre is intoxicating, and certainly deserves the detour it involves. But Huesca, next kingly capital in the advance from Jaca, was now my goal for a first night on the road. It is curious how small a showing Huesca makes in English language guidebooks. Its cathedral is magnificent, combining ruggedness and Gothic aspiration and once again a great richness of sculpture. Huesca has a good hotel. Barbastro, the next town eastwards, has mainly history, for it was here in the 12th century that a marriage was celebrated between the ruling houses of Aragon and Barcelona, quite as decisive for the future as the later alliance of Ferdinand and Isabella and sometimes referred to as the master-stroke of the Spanish Middle Ages. In place after place in Aragon, the visitor gets an odd, sometimes hair-raising, sense of great events gone by, as in a dream, leaving a ghostly presence, the swishing of a curtain, a footfall on stone. It comes as a huge change of mood to head back north again into the mountains, first through the peach groves that line the River Cinca, on land worked and watered by the Moors, those brilliant agriculturalists, then up through the gorge along the River Esera and so at last by way of charmingly faded Graus - good for another night in a rough and ready roadside hotel - to the skiers' playground round Benasque, last outpost of Aragon. Thanks to the skiing there is a building boom in Benasque. If this is the future, I reflected selfishly, then give me the ghostly past in Sos and Huesca. And long live, too, the national parks on both the French and Spanish sides of the Pyrenees. The easiest way to arrive in Spain from Britain by car is to cross from Plymouth to Santander by Brittany Ferries (tel: 0752-221321). It takes 24 hours. Nearest suitable airports: Barcelona, Girona and Bilbao, are all some distance. All are served by Iberia (tel: 071-437-5622). Spanish National Tourist Office: 57 St James's St, London SW1A 1LD.</p>

In Gaoyang, Boye and Lixian Counties, where the projects  have  been located, the officials said, grain production has increased  from 81 million kg in 1991 to 165 million kg in 1993, and the  average income of farmers risen to 710 yuan a year.    The three counties used a total 45.5 million yuan worth of  loans from the World Bank since 1990.    With the money, the counties have upgraded 26,600 ha. of  low-yielding farmland, adding 6,600 ha. to the irrigated area,  according to the officials.    The loans also sponsored the expansion of a cotton ginning  mill, the completion of which boosted the local processing  ability by 300,000 kg, and the storage capacity of cotton seeds  by 600,000 kg, the officials noted.    A large part of the loans went on the training of  agricultural technicians and the setting up of a farm technology  service network in rural areas.    The officials said that so far 26,818 agricultural  technicians had been trained, and the technological service  network is covering 40,000 ha of farmland in 20-odd towns and  villages.    Besides providing improved seeds and farm materials to  farmers, the network also offers services in soil analysis,  fertilizing, field management and the promotion of new farm  technology, the officials added.</p>

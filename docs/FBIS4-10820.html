			<p>BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities in Brazil monitored through 14  April:    The Brazilian car manufacturing sector produced 140,000  units  in March. This is the highest monthly production figure in 40  years. Executives of the sector expect production in 1994 will  surpass that of 1993, which amounted to 1,391,000 units. (Rio de  Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 6 Apr 94 Business and  Finance Section p 6)    Brazilian Petroleum Corporation, Petrobras, has signed a  contract with Central Puerto -- a private Argentine company  which supplies 40 percent of the electrical energy consumed in  Buenos Aires -- for the supply of 2.7 million barrels of fuel  oil. The deal is worth $45 million. The fuel oil will be  delivered between May and September. Alberto Guimaraes,  Petrobras assistant superintendent for foreign trade, has  reported that the profile of Brazilian crude oil imports has  changed and that Argentina has become our second oil supplier.  He added that between January and March, Brazil imported crude  oil from the following countries: Saudi Arabia (150,000 barrels  per day); Argentina (110,000 barrels per day); Kuwait (80,000  barrels per day); and Algiers (70,000 barrels per day). In  1993, Petrobras imported an average of 500,000 barrels per day  of oil and 280,000 barrels per day of oil byproducts. (Rio de  Janeiro JORNAL DO BRASIL in Portuguese 9 Apr 94 p 6)</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Survey of Guernsey (6): End to recession will bring growth - Guernsey has advantages for long-term contracts such as a retirement pension / Pensions GUERNSEY has been trying to capture a sizeable slice of the market in off-shore pensions, but although a range of products is now in place, success has been patchy. The target market is the expatriate employee or third-country national who works in a number of countries or who finds it impractical or impossible for tax reasons to fund a retirement policy in his or her own country. It is a market which grew rapidly throughout the 1980s and although it has been badly affected by the world recession it could be set to expand substantially during the 1990s. Two broad types of international pensions products are marketed in Guernsey: international personal pensions or retirement annuities aimed at individuals; and off-shore pensions targeted at companies to establish for their employees. Guernsey-based insurance companies tend to specialise in one or the other. According to Mr Rodney Benjamin, a Guernsey partner in consulting actuaries Bacon &amp; Woodrow, some of the schemes could also be of interest to capped executives in the UK where there is no tax advantage for pensions on earnings over Pounds 75,000. 'These are now being marketed quite actively and as the UK claws its way out of recession and the cap bites more deeply, interest should increase,' he said. There are certain clear advantages for choosing Guernsey for a long-term contract such as a retirement pension. According to a recent survey of clients conducted by the Guernsey branch of Generali, the Trieste-based international insurance conglomerate, top of the list is political stability, which has been a big factor in the island's success as a financial centre. This is followed by its fiscal independence - Guernsey is responsible for its own domestic affairs, including taxation, and is not subject to harmonisation of European Community taxation; excellent communications; and a sophisticated infrastructure which provides the back-up services of lawyers, accountants, actuaries and other specialists. For off-shore insurers, policyholders' funds are free of Guernsey taxation, thus the income and capital gains accruing on the funds are not taxed and no tax is imposed when payments are made. Guernsey also has specific legislation for the establishment of pension fund trusts. However, despite these inherent advantages, progress has been disappointingly slow, partly because of a flying start by neighbouring Jersey which soaked up much of the early business. Both islands produced similar concepts for expatriate and off-shore pensions but Jersey was able to put its proposals through much more rapidly because it does not need Privy Council approval as does Guernsey. Guernsey's legislation was also part of a package which included local pensions provisions and this delayed implementation for a year. Jersey passed its so-called Article 131(C) pension plan legislation in 1990 and Norwich Union, the market leader, and other insurers achieved an early start. Guernsey's Section 40 (ee) for personal pensions and Section 40 (O) for organisations did not come into operation until 18 months ago, and Guernsey-based companies have had problems catching up. Although broadly similar, there are subtle differences in approach between the two islands. Both want to ensure they gain revenue benefits from the products channelled through them, but whereas Jersey has provided that the pension plans must be sold through a resident insurance broker, Guernsey has imposed no such requirement. The difference is largely explained by the fact that Jersey has no life assurance companies of its own, whereas Guernsey has several including Providence Capitol International, Sun Alliance International and Nordben, all incorporated in Guernsey, and Generali and Equitable Life, which are branch operations. A branch selling Article 131(C) business in Jersey is exempt from tax, whereas an operation in Guernsey is liable to tax on its profits but at the low rate of 20 per cent, and for a non-resident company this can be offset against tax levied elsewhere. In addition, the income tax authorities have specifically excluded the sale of Article 131(C) contracts to UK residents, but Guernsey does not exclude this possibility. Offshore pension contracts are much more flexible than their onshore equivalents in aspects such as retirement age, cash commutation, or the form in which benefits are received in retirement, and they are not constrained by tax legislation. Providence Capitol, probably the biggest local insurer with a staff of 75, has developed a flexible international personal pension plan. Others are thinking of following. Mr Mel Carvill, Guernsey branch manager for Generali which specialises in offshore pensions for multinational companies and for international organisations such as the United Nations, also emphasises the flexibility that local plans give, including scope to transfer funds to the UK or elsewhere to buy an annuity on retirement. 'Our growth in Guernsey has been significant,' he says.</p>

People in the province are doing well and the number of  prosperous families is on the increase, 95 percent of villages  have been supplied with electricity, 85 percent of villagers  live in brick houses, and fresh water supply has reached the  rural area.    In a meeting with the local cadres and people, comrade  General Secretary Do Muoi said:    [Begin Do Muoi recording] "The party and state are very  pleased to see changes for the better in Nam Ha Province thanks  to efforts by the local people. Generally speaking, our people  are still very poor. We are a lot better now in comparison with  the era under French domination. We, however, are still far  behind if we compare our people's standard of living with people  in other countries. As a result, we must strive to improve our  socioeconomic development. Our party has set lines and policies  to firmly maintain national independence and called all people  to integrate efforts to build the nation, strive to extricate  the nation from poverty and backwardness; work hard to make our  people prosperous, our nation powerful, and our society just and  civilized. We must strive to ensure happiness and a better life  for all people including ethnic minorities and religious groups  throughout the country. To fulfill this task, first of all, we  must strive to enhance the people's intelligence, provide them  with better education, and enhance their background and  capability. Moreover, we must strive to practice thrift and  work hard to amass wealth while enhancing unity to ensure our  happiness. Uncle Ho taught us: Unity, unity, great unity;  success, success, great success. As a result, we must strive to  enhance unity among people of various nationalities, religious  groups, and within the entire party for the sake of national  independence, freedom, and happiness of the people so as to  write new pages of our glorious history. I hope that Nam Ha  Province will be able to overcome all difficulties, extricate  itself from poverty, and soon enjoy prosperity. On the new year  occasion, I wish all comrades and countrymen in the province a  happy and prosperous new year and success in building the  party." [applause] [end recording]    In his talks with leading cadres and the executive committee  of Nam Ha party organization, Comrade Do Muoi urged them to  satisfactorily renovate the provincial economic structure in the  direction of promoting agro-industry, export-import, and  business. Nam Ha must strive to firmly grasp the spirit of the  midterm national party conference resolution and turn it into  concrete programs of action.    Dear friends, during his stay in Thai Binh Province, Comrade  Do Muoi visited the Doan Ket Engineering Enterprise, the Hong  Quan Textile Enterprise, and the Tien Hai Industrial Complex.

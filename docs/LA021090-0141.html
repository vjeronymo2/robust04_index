			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> NEIGHBORS BUILD TRUST, WIELD CLOUT  </P> <P> The people who live in Wilshire Square say their neighborhood is much like  television's fictional town of Mayberry, home of Sheriff Andy Taylor, Opie and  Aunt Bee.  </P> <P> It is the kind of neighborhood where people know each other, socialize, bring  chicken soup when someone is sick and share the fruit off their trees.  </P> <P> "This is what a neighborhood is supposed to be like," said Ricki Older, an  8-year resident and co-chairman of the Wilshire Square Neighborhood Assn. "If  someone needs help changing a light bulb, you help. If they need a ride  somewhere, you give them a ride. We've helped each other with everything from  yard work to painting fences."  </P> <P> The tree-lined neighborhood with period concrete lampposts is only blocks from  downtown Santa Ana. Yet this is a place that has managed to change very little  with time.  </P> <P> Wilshire Square is 650 homes, most of which were built between the 1920 and  1950, and now worth about $200,000. It is bordered by McFadden, Main, Edinger  and Flower streets. The homes boast a diversity of custom designs and  architectural styles ranging from Tudor revival to Spanish colonial.  </P> <P> Houses are characterized by massive signature windows, breakfast rooms, garages  separate from the houses and large yards with fruits trees bearing lemons,  oranges, figs, plums and even persimmons.  </P> <P> "Most of these houses were probably custom-made for the original owner," said  Marc LaFont, also co-president of the neighborhood association and an 11-year  resident. "You have to be willing to stand out from the crowd if you live here  because no two homes in this neighborhood are the same."  </P> <P> The neighborhood association, one of 16 in Santa Ana, was formed in 1987 to  help preserve the area's rich history and maintain the charm of the  neighborhood, LaFont said. The group produces a newsletter every two months and  has even commissioned Wilshire Square T-shirts and sweat shirts.  </P> <P> Monthly meetings and social events have given the neighbors a chance to become  friends -- and to become somewhat of a political force at City Hall.  </P> <P> The neighbors were vocal in their opposition to the proposed installation of  nine oversize billboards in the city and collected more than 300 signatures on  petitions protesting them. Due to intense public opposition, both advertising  companies seeking to install the billboards abandoned their plans on Monday.  </P> <P> Residents Doug and Deborah Gillen just won a battle with City Hall and  prevented city crews from trimming a 70-year-old cedar tree in front of their  house. The Gillens will hire a professional trimmer to do the job.  </P> <P> The neighbors also have spoken out about density in Santa Ana, blocked a plan  to remove a large number of trees that make up what LaFont calls the  neighborhood's "urban forest" and have rid their neighborhood of graffiti with  an aggressive program.  </P> <P> Their efforts have not gone unnoticed. On Feb. 7, they were honored by the  Santa Ana Historical Preservation Society.  </P> <P> They also were awarded a certificate of appreciation last year by Rep. Robert  K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) for outstanding service to the community.  </P> <P> Plans are under way for "Welcome to Wilshire Square" markers at four sites,  with the city paying for their installation.  </P> <P> "What's really special about living here is that it's a neat cross-section of  people," said LaFont, who runs his own public relations company. "We have  lawyers, teachers and architects. We run the gamut from millionaires to the  little old lady living next door." GREG HERNANDEZ  </P></p>

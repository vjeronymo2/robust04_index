			<p>BFN     [Text] Ethnic Russians in Estonia have appealed to Russia's  President Yeltsin, parliament, and government to head off a  serious ethnic conflict in that Baltic republic. The document,  a copy of which has been made available to Interfax by the  Congress of Russian Communities, points out that "the Estonian  side by its actions is provoking mass acts of civil disobedience  and in the background of a continuously worsening economic  situation are preparing to introduce police rule."    The community charges the Estonian nationalist government  with the intent to start ethnic cleansing in the republic by  various means, direct deportation included, for which a  concentration camp has been set at Rummu near Tallinn, and a  special police service is being formed.    The community regards as humiliating for Russia the Estonian  government's demands that the Russians permanently residing in  the republic and persons without Estonian citizenship be  required to formally apply for residence and employment, and  that retired army officers are additionally forced to present  their army service records and results of medical checks on  AIDS, tuberculosis, and other diseases.    Those without residence permits are declared illegal foreign  migrants and are expelled from Estonia immediately. But even  with residence permits, the Russians and other nationals who  have permanently lived in Estonia are only entitled to temporary  residence (5 years) with all the ensuing consequences (the loss  of the right to privatize housing, buy property, etc.), the  appeal says.</p>

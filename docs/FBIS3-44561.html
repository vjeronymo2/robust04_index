			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Sun Shangwu: "WB Loans Strengthen </F> Efforts in Forestry"]    [Text] A $300 million World Bank loan has helped modernize  China's forestry sector since it was granted in 1990, said a  senior official from the Ministry of Forestry in a recent  interview.    The loan, given to China's National Afforestation Project,  will assist the country through 1997.    About 25 percent of it goes toward expanding national  forests  and the rest to developing collective woodlands.    In the past three years, China has used $180 million of the  loan to afforest 900,000 hectares, said Qu Shuye, head of the  World Bank Loan Projects Management Centre under the Ministry of  Forestry.    When the project is completed, Qu said, it will boost the  country's timber output by 300 million cubic metres, helping to  ease the country's lumber shortage.    Loan money has gone to 16 provinces and autonomous regions,  most in South and East China, including Guangdong, Guangxi,  Hainan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang and Shandong.    As part of the project, a computer network has been set up  to  link forestry centres nationwide, allowing officials to  co-ordinate efforts across the country and solve problems  immediately with regular feedback.    Qu said an ecological monitoring system has also been set up  to make sure that excessive planting does not lead to soil  erosion.    He added that the World Bank's loan has not only helped  afforestation efforts, but has helped bring new concepts and  technology to the forestry sector.    Forestry officials have hammered out a scientific  afforestation research plan.    More than 80 specialists worked on the plan, which Qu called  "unprecedented."    To supervise the loan, the country has set up a system that  links the use of money with planting results, the senior  official said.    The World Bank is to grant another $200 million loan this  year to the Forestry Resources Development and Protection  Project, which will cover the intensive farming of artificial  forests, the building of multipurpose shelter-belts and the  improvement of management of nature reserves, Qu said.</p>

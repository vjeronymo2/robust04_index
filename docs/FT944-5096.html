			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / CIS sends out deadly economic signals: High inflation and falling output are rampant The countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States continue to experience high inflation and falling production - the deadly mix of signals which point to incomplete economic reforms, or reforms barely attempted. Probably dragged up by Russia's growing inflation in the autumn, inflation jumped sharply in October in nearly all the CIS states (the former Soviet republics except the three Baltic countries). According to figures from the CIS statistical committee reported by Interfax, consumer price rises in October over September showed Georgia, one of the most desperate of the former Soviet states, suffering the highest price inflation, at 36.3 per cent - with the neighbouring Caucasian state of Azerbaijan in second place with 28.3 per cent, Belarus at 25.4 per cent and Kazakhstan at 24.8 per cent. Russia, for which later figures are available, had inflation of just over 14 per cent in November, compared with 15 per cent in October - a reduction which was smaller than forecast. The one country again to show growth in these figures was Armenia, the smallest of the three former Caucasian Soviet republics and the one most impoverished by the war with Azerbaijan over the enclave of Nagorno Karabakh. Its growth in gross domestic product of 1 per cent is, however, from an industrial base reduced to less than half of its Soviet-era capacity. In most other states the production drops are in the order of 20-plus per cent for the 10 months of January to October compared with the same period in the previous year. These figures are likely to be exaggerated, possibly by large amounts - since the Soviet era tendency was to exaggerate output to express conformity with the plan while the present tendency is to express low output to avoid taxes. However, there is little doubt that the official figures measure a trend which remains downwards. Georgia is again the worst hit, with its already low level of industrial output down by a measured 42 per cent (figures January to September) - followed by Moldova, with industrial output down 31.1 per cent. The basic distortion in the figures is because of the Soviet era habit of measuring only physical output. They thus do not capture, or at best inadequately reflect, the rise in services and trading. However, this rise has been most marked in Russia. In other ex-Soviet states, the figures of decline are probably closer to reality.  --------------------------------------------           CIS GROWTH AND INFLATION  --------------------------------------------                                Consumer                    GDP          prices                   yr/yr        mth/mth                   (Percentage changes)  -------------------------------------------- Azerbaijan       -22.2 (1)      +28.3 Armenia           +1.0 (1)      +10.5 Belarus          -24.0          +25.4 Georgia            n/a          +36.3 Kazakhstan       -29.6 (1)      +24.8 Kyrgyzstan       -24.8           +3.4 Moldova          -29.7 (1)       +4.4 Russia           -15.0          +12.0 Tajikistan         n/a           +7.2 Turkmenistan       n/a            n/a Uzbekistan        -6.9 (1)      +17.9 Ukraine          -24.3 (1)      +14.3  -------------------------------------------- Notes:  -------------------------------------------- (1) Net material product.

			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOT TOPICS: GIFT IDEAS OUT OF THE MOUTHS OF THE TEENS  </P> <P> Though Hanukkah gift giving has ended, there remains just a little more than a  weekend to get in last-minute Christmas shopping.  </P> <P> To help mothers and fathers with gift selection, Hot Topics asks, "What is the  most popular gift -- within economic reality -- parents can give their  teen-agers?"  </P> <P> "Freedom and trust; to respect their thoughts and let them go places with  friends; just basically respecting their judgment."  </P> <P> Heather Reed, 14, freshman, Los Alamitos  </P> <P> "A Nintendo because it develops hand-eye coordination."  </P> <P> Tessa Goss, 16, sophomore, Connelly  </P> <P> "The gift of knowledge -- educate the youth of the world about sexuality."  </P> <P> Christian Corbo, 17, senior, Valencia  </P> <P> "Love, affection and attention."  </P> <P> Bao Vo, 16, junior, Santa Ana Valley  </P> <P> "Earrings, socks, underwear or bras."  </P> <P> Stacy West, 14, freshman, Dana Hills  </P> <P> "Either Chia-Pet or The Clapper, one or the other."  </P> <P> Steve Chuck, 18, senior, Esperanza  </P> <P> "A nose job, but at a reasonable price."  </P> <P> Sujata Mody, 17, senior, Irvine  </P> <P> "Parents can give them a secure home.

Lots of times the way your parents treat you and the  things they say really affect the way you act. Although most teen-agers would  enjoy a new Porsche or something, in the long run a positive home life will do  better things for you."  </P> <P> Keri Bailey, 14, freshman, Valencia  </P> <P> "A car because it gives you freedom and the sense of responsibility."  </P> <P> Rosy Davalos, 15, sophomore, Santa Ana Valley  </P> <P> "Encyclopedia Brittanica."  </P> <P> Chris Reese, 16, junior, Dana Hills  </P> <P> "Probably clothes, because most everybody can use them, and you don't have to  spend a lot of money."  </P> <P> Erika Waday, 17, senior, Esperanza  </P> <P> "A nice pair of skis."  </P> <P> Amy Har, 15, sophomore, Irvine  </P> <P> "A motorized Big Wheel."  </P> <P> Eric Jones, 16, junior, Dana Hills  </P> <P> "A CD player."  </P> <P> Amy Moreau, 15, sophomore, Connelly  </P> <P> "It would have to be money, because you can spend it any way you want."  </P> <P> Jannah Llewellyn, 15, sophomore, Esperanza  </P> <P> "A college education."  </P> <P> Bret Davidson, 16, sophomore, Los Alamitos  </P> <P> "A computer."  </P> <P> Charlene Exline, 17, senior, Santa Ana Valley  </P> <P> "The most popular gift a parent can give a teen-ager is the freedom to make his  or her own choices."  </P> <P> Kamyar Kashfi, 17, senior, Valencia  </P> <P> "An education."  </P> <P> Denise Ching, 17, senior, Connelly  </P> <P> "I would want unique little things that I wasn't expecting to get. I think it  makes the holiday time more fun."  </P> <P> Jill Llewellyn, 14, freshman, Esperanza  </P> <P> Next Week's Hot Topic:  </P> <P> What do you predict will be the upcoming year's biggest news story?  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH REJECTS EXTENSION FOR CHINA STUDENTS  </P> <P> President Bush on Thursday rejected legislation that would have enabled tens of  thousands of Chinese students to stay on in this country indefinitely, saying  that he is opposed to "congressional micromanagement of foreign policy."  </P> <P> However, Bush announced that he is acting on his own to grant the Chinese  students some of the same protections that were contained in the bill passed by  Congress. Specifically, the President said he is lifting the current  requirement that students must return to China for at least two years after  completing their studies.  </P> <P> Bush's action does not have the force of law and thus could be revoked at any  time. But for now, it appears to ensure that Chinese students will not be  forced to go home and face reprisals from the Chinese regime for taking part in  pro-democracy demonstrations in this country.  </P> <P> The President exercised a "pocket veto," meaning that he did not take any  action on the bill within 10 days after receiving it, as is required for a bill  to become law when Congress is not in session. The effect is to kill the  legislation.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, the bill, sponsored by Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco),  was approved 413 to 0 in the House and by voice vote in the Senate.  </P> <P> "We'll pass it again," Pelosi told The Times Thursday night. She said Bush's  contention that he is granting Chinese students the same protection contained  in the legislation is "baloney. . . . If he was really serious, all he had to  do was sign the bill. If he really wanted to do the same thing we did (for the  students), why wouldn't he sign the bill?"  </P> <P> But Administration officials said they hope that the President's own actions to  protect the students -- plus additional lobbying by the Administration and  perhaps some changes over the next few months in the political climate inside  China -- may help dissuade Congress from further action.  </P> <P> "I believe that China, as its leaders state, will return to the policy of  reform pursued before June 3," said Bush in a written message explaining his  reasons for rejecting the legislation. "I further believe that the Chinese  visitors would wish to return to China in those circumstances. . . ."  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Chinese students criticized Bush's action. "We consider it  a tragedy," said Zhao Haiching, a Harvard University student and chairman of  the Committee on Chinese Student Affairs. "The key thing (behind Bush's veto)  was the opposition of the Beijing government."  </P> <P> Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) termed Bush's action "a grave  mistake." Bush, he said, "has made it easier for the Chinese government to  succeed in its campaign of intimidation to silence the students' cry for  democracy in China."  </P> <P> The legislation passed by Congress would have applied to all Chinese students  and scholars who have come to this country with the official sponsorship of the  Chinese government.  </P> <P> According to State Department and congressional estimates, there are about  40,000 students from the People's Republic of China in this country now -- a  number larger than that from any other nation. About 70% to 80% of these  students have come here on visas saying that they are sponsored by the Chinese  government and thus have been subject to the requirement to return home for two  years.  </P> <P> Many students say that this classification of government sponsorship is  misleading, because the Chinese government requires such visas even of many  students who get their tuition and expenses paid by American universities or  other private sources.  </P> <P> Bush insisted Thursday night that he is "supportive of the humanitarian  principles" that prompted Congress to pass the legislation protecting Chinese  students. However, he said, such legislation "puts America in a straitjacket  and can render us incapable of responding to changing circumstances."  </P> <P> The President also complained that passage of the legislation could jeopardize  future educational exchange programs between the United States and China. A  Chinese deputy foreign minister warned last week that there would be "serious  consequences" for relations between the United States and China if Bush signed  the legislation on Chinese students.  </P> <P> Bush suggested that he believes the Chinese regime will follow through with its  threats. "It is in the national interest of the United States to promote the  exchanges of technical skills and ideas between Chinese and Americans," said  Bush in his written message. "It is my hope that by acting administratively, we  will help foster the continuation of these programs."  </P></p>

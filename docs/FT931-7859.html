			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (16): Shake-out may be near end - Contract Hire AFTER a spate of acquisitions, contract hire seems to be absolutely the flavour of the month. But the reality is rather different. Those companies that have been expanding through acquisition are doing so only extremely cautiously and selectively. In the 1980s, when contract hire took off, the rapid growth of the industry persuaded many newcomers to the business that this was a source of easy money. And indeed, while there was constant growth, that regular new business tended to disguise the structural problems that became all too evident once the recession took firm hold. Several smaller contract hire companies got into difficulties because they underestimated maintenance and other costs and overestimated residual values. Big losses ensued at the end of a three-year contract when vehicles turned out to be worth hundreds and in some cases thousands of pounds less than expected. Contract hire companies such as these - with a poor portfolio of customers - will find it hard to attract a white knight. Mr Norman Donkin, former managing director of Lease Plan UK who, as director of AT&amp;T Capital, has a specific brief to develop a European leasing division for the American corporation, says: 'We looked at a number of contract hire companies that were for sale. What we wanted were sound management, a good quality portfolio of customers and good systems. 'Many of the companies for sale did not meet all these criteria. Even more did not meet our other requirement, which is that the company should be profitable. 'So what we did is to look at some companies that were not necessarily for sale and decided that instead of buying a large contract hire company we would do better to acquire a medium-sized one with an infrastructure in place that could be built upon.' It was the combination of a lack of profitability, losses on disposals and problems with gearing that contributed to the decisions by a number of groups to try to dispose of their contract hire and leasing businesses, says Mr Nick Brown, managing director of Trimoco Leasing and chairman of the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association's leasing committee. But he also believes that the recent shake-down in the industry may be coming to an end. 'After a period of consolidation, the companies that remain are mostly trading profitably because at the beginning of the recession they recognised the problems that were coming and so adjusted their rental rates upwards and their residual value projections downwards. Those that have survived the last three years will probably grow as the market expands.' Most of the current rash of takeovers and acquisitions are due to some smaller companies getting into difficulties over residuals and costs, according to Mr Ron Elder, managing director of Avis Lease and Fleet Management, who says that there will still be room in the marketplace for the niche players. 'Some companies certainly did misread the market and are now looking for someone to bail them out. And while it is true that some of these smaller companies - especially the non-specialist firms which took on contract hire as an add-on to their core business during the boom period - may now want out, there will always be a demand for a smaller company offering a local service and a higher level of personal attention to their customers. 'But I believe we will not see the same number of start-ups and new entrants to the business once residual values improves and leasing looks a good bet again. A lesson has been learnt the hard way that contract hire is a specialist business requiring specialist skills to survive the down periods as well as thrive during the good times.' Avis Lease and Fleet Management itself has a new parent company since last year when General Electric of the US acquired the business. And the recent period of consolidations and mergers is not wholly over yet, predicts Mr Elder. 'We have a parent with the capacity to grow the business. So when opportunities come along, nothing will stop us going after them - we have plenty of investment funds available for the right acquisitions,' he says.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Chloride Pounds 2.73m in the red PROFITS at Chloride, the once famous batteries supplier which has been reduced to a small electronics group, crumbled in the half-year to September, as the group turned a Pounds 1.02m pre-tax profit into a Pounds 2.73m loss. Chloride staggered under the weight of restructuring costs and poor demand for its main products: power electronics, uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), and emergency lighting systems. The interim dividend is passed, and retained losses rose to Pounds 3.92m (Pounds 523,000). Turnover fell 17 per cent to Pounds 45.4m (Pounds 54.7m). The group made an operating loss after exceptional costs of Pounds 932,000, against a profit of Pounds 2.05m. Reorganisation costs this year totalled Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 586,000) and there was a loss on discontinued operations amounting to Pounds 916,000. The interim dividend is passed. Mr Keith Hodgkinson, chairman, said the interim period had been 'interesting', but management was not despondent. He predicted 'a significant improvement' in results by the year-end. Exceptional costs would not recur, new products - especially Chloride's latest UPS - had been well received, but the group would not return to profit. Chloride's operating loss of Pounds 556,000 before exceptional costs included Pounds 876,000 in 'stringent provisions' for bad debts and stock obsolescence, which reflected encouraging underlying profitability. Net borrowings were reduced from Pounds 8.68m at the end of March to Pounds 3.05m. Losses per share were 1.6p (0.2p).</p>

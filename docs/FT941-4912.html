			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Arts: Sacred fires flare amid quaint Flamenco capers - Clement Crisp finds the Cristina Hoyos troupe has that uninhibited, raw, earthy energy after all A Spanish Arts Festival is upon us and dance must inevitably play its part. So the Cristina Hoyos troupe is in Rosebery Avenue this week, with the spectacle given the unlikely title of 'Flamenco Dreams': anyone able to dream through the rattle of handclaps and the clatter of feet will deserve a medal. It is of course, yet another Flamenco show; more slick than most - well staged; well danced; well vocalised in those arabesques of howling that suggest permanent pressure on a favourite corn - and absolutely the mixture as before. The fascination of Flamenco in the theatre is that moment when production falls away, the usual posturings are stilled, and the sacred fire flares in a dancer. For much of Monday night's opening at Sadler's Wells, predictability was all. The women, adept at slow-burning glances as their skirts stir up the stage dust, look lovely - if occasionally miffed by what the men are up to. The chaps, in buttock-hugging trousers and expressions of baleful uncertainty, stamp, and go on stamping. ('Never live under a Flamenco dancer,' is a good rule for flat-dwellers.) Guitars run the gamut of tonic/dominant harmonising, and voices are raised in what I suppose is supplication. I have no Spanish, but suspect that the texts amount to little more than 'Watch out, she's on the war-path'. All this is what we have come to expect, and if, as with Mme Hoyos' troupe, it is polished and well-lit, then audiences are happy. They are what theatricalised folk dance is always about: instant quaintness and capers designed for tourists. But in this packaging one may, as in a lightning flash, discern the real thing. The greatest Flamenco artists spontaneously combust. As Isadora Duncan said after one extraordinary performance: 'The god was with me'. So with the inspirational flamenco style. Carmen Amaya, the truest Flamenco dancer I have seen, was, at her most intoxicating, a gypsy divinity pursued by demons. Cumbre Flamenca, at the Wells a few years ago, showed us two other marvels: Carmen Cortes and La Chana, whose art became incandescent with rhythm and the very spirit of the dance. With Cristina Hoyos, I feared that this transcendent moment might not arrive. Her initial appearance - red flounces; arching torso; a star dancer on display - told of obviously fine qualities that have always been hers: glorious arms; electric timing. Yet it was an exteriorised performance, and like most of what we saw, brilliantly contrived. Then, in a Taranto, Mme Hoyos came on stage in a simple grey dress, as if to confront her art and her own talent. Guitarists and singer started to commune with her. Urgent rhythms, awkward poses, the dance kicking and battling, inhabited her totally, and we saw the real, the raw and earthy flamenco which is so wonderful - and so rare. Her arms curled around the block of her torso; the music's pulse drove her feet and legs; nothing was polite, and everything was thrillingly true. The god was with her, and we rejoiced. Lest I seem in the least sniffy about the Hoyos troupe, let me say that every artist is gifted, each number well-staged, and that prodigies of stamping and rhythmic acuity abound. Adrian Galia is a most stylish soloist  -his solo farucca tautly elegant. The evening runs to 100 minutes without an interval. Cristina Hoyos is at Sadler's Wells until March 12.

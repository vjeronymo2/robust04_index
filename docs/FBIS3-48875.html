			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 25 January </F> Morning Edition]    [Text] Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura has  published a book entitled: "Japan, a Small But Brilliant Nation"  [Chisaku Tomo Kirari to Hikaru Kuni Nippon]. As if reacting to  the notion of a "normal nation" [futsu no kuni] advocated in  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa's  book: "A Plan to Rebuild Japan" [Nihon Kaizo Keikaku], Takemura  proposes building Japan into a country which is small, but has a  unique identity. Takemura and Ozawa, who are rumored to  conflict in the ruling coalition parties, have apparently shown  their sense of rivalry even in their books. Takemura's book  directly refutes Ozawa's ideas. For instance, while Ozawa  advocates the participation of the Self-Defense Forces in UN  operations to make active international contributions, Takemura  writes: "I do not agree with such ideas."    While Takemura's aides stress: "This is not meant to clarify  his relations with Mr. Ozawa," the book says: "When we cooperate  with other political parties, the basis will be ideas on the  Constitution, the future and image of Japan, international  contributions...we would like to work hand in hand with  political parties which share our ideas and will work with us  toward a common goal." As Japan faces the second stage of the  process of political realignment, there is bound to be more  controversy between the two men.</p>

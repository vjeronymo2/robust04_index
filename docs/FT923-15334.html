			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / Eurobond firms fear impact of EC securities directive EUROPEAN regulations for the securities industry agreed this week could lead to large areas of the off-shore Eurobond market being driven back on to domestic stock markets, according to senior bankers. On Monday, European governments reached agreement on a draft Investment Services Directive, which lays down rules for the conduct of securities business in the European Community. The agreement gives governments the right to demand that securities transactions undertaken by retail investors - private individuals rather than institutions - are conducted on regulated markets. The Eurobond market does not qualify as a regulated market because it does not meet the strict disclosure and reporting requirements laid down in other sections of the directive. Bankers had expected Eurobonds to be specifically exempted from the provisions of the directive. However, monetary officials familiar with the agreement confirmed yesterday that no blanket exemption for Eurobonds has been granted. Firms fear that some European governments could now use the directive to increase the volume of business traded through domestic stock exchanges, by demanding that all retail bond business is conducted on a regulated market. 'We were given specific assurances by the regulators on this issue. I am astonished and concerned that the exemption is not in place,' said Mr Dirk Hazell, Secretary General of the International Primary Market Association, which represents leading Eurobond underwriters. In the first six months of this year companies and governments raised Dollars 148bn (Pounds 80bn) in the Eurobond market. Although institutional investors take the majority of big Eurobond issues, retail investors remain a significant and lucrative area of the market. Yesterday, IBM raised Dollars 300m from an issue targeted at retail investors. Other areas of European legislation exempt Eurobonds from securities regulations. For example, the Public Offers Directive says borrowers in the Eurobond markets need not publish a full prospectus before a new issue. Eurobond underwriters are already concerned that capital adequacy rules for the securities industry agreed two weeks ago will increase their costs.</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / S African rights probe planned: 'Truth commission' to be set up The South African government is to set up a 'truth commission' to probe human rights abuses under apartheid, but those who prove their crimes were politically motivated might be pardoned, Justice Minister Dullah Omar said yesterday. Mr Omar said the commission of eminent and respected South Africans would examine abuses by the previous white-dominated government as well as by his own African National Congress (ANC), now the leading party in the coalition government of national unity. 'The fundamental issue for all South Africans is to come to terms with our past on the only moral basis possible, namely that the truth be told and that the truth be acknowledged,' he told a Cape Town press conference. 'We cannot forgive on behalf of victims. The identity of the victims and what happened to them and the identity of perpetrators must be made known.' However Mr Omar left many important questions unanswered, including whether the commission would hold public hearings, whether its findings would be published and whether those who committed abuses would have their identity concealed in the interests of national reconciliation. No decision had yet been taken on these issues, he said, and no definition of a political crime had been agreed, though he said persons who committed 'heinous crimes' might not be considered for pardon. This was understood to be a reference to the convicted murderers of former ANC leader Chris Hani, assassinated last year in the country's most notorious political killing. Mr Omar said some 13,000 people had already been pardoned for offences ranging from membership of an illegal organisation to racially motivated massacres, most of them from the black liberation movements. In future, amnesty would be linked to the acknowledgement of human rights violations. Human rights monitors say tens of thousands of people including children were tortured and detained without trial and hundreds killed under apartheid. No amnesty would be considered for offences after December 5, 1993, when the final round of multi-party democracy talks began. Omar said the commission would sit for up to two years.</p>

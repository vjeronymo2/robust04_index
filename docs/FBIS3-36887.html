			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Summary] Late last week Prime Minister Sergey Tereshchenko  visited East Kazakhstan and Semipalatinsk Oblast.    In Leninogorsk the prime minister visited the Riddersky mine  in the Obruchovskaya valley, which is a big mineral deposit of  ores with gold, silver, and zinc which can be recovered in big  amounts with little expenditures. Foreign firms are very  interested in these deposits.    In Ust-Kamenogorsk, the prime minister familiarized himself  with a new store run by the titanium and magnesium combine.  This store is currently under construction and is expected to  be commissioned this year. Mr. Tereshchenko examined samples of  products from titanium and displayed interest in the way the  combine tackles its problems in selling the products. He gave  useful advice on the problem.    He also met representatives of parties and public movements  of the oblast. During the conversation, the head of government  stressed that the disintegration of economic ties in the former  USSR influenced all spheres of life. New burdens were placed on  the nation's shoulders after Kazakhstan had to opt out of the  ruble zone. In order to tackle the problem, President  Nazarbayev recently put forward an initiative to create a  supranational currency -- the altyn, from which all the  republics could have benefited.    The head of government said: "We are aware how complicated  the situation is. One of the reasons for this are non-payments.  Enterprises of the oblast have over 1 billion tenge of debts.  Main debts and counterclaims will shortly be offset. This will  help to find out insolvent and loss-making enterprises which  will be declared bankrupt.    "Many enterprises ask for loans and demand that power should  be made cheaper. Kazakhstan will soon receive over 1 billion in  foreign loans but we will not allow credit issue [sentence as  received]. The money will be mainly channeled to the economy.    "Russia sells us power at virtually world prices and we  should accelerate the commissioning of another power generating  unit of Ekibastuz-2 which will allow us to to reduce our import  of energy.    "Our agriculture is inefficient. We have much greater  production costs per tonne of grain in comparison, say, with  Canada. We should implement advanced technology in agriculture  so as to reach a modern production level in in 5-7 years.    "We have discussed dual citizenship here. But people of over  100 nationalities live in Kazakhstan. If we pass the law on  dual citizenship, what kind of situation will we have in our  sovereign state? I think we have a different way out. We are  preparing a treaty with Russia according to which every person  who leaves Kazakhstan for the Russian Federation will obtain its  citizenship, and vice versa. In order to stop specialists  leaving, we are elaborating a document which envisages signing  5-7 year contracts with a better salary.    "The language policy is constantly the focus of attention of  the state leadership. The president will soon speak very  precisely on these issues."</p>

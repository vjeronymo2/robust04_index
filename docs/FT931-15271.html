			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Campaign to curb quangos fails to hold down costs THE GOVERNMENT'S campaign to curb the power and influence of non-elected quangos appears to have failed, according to a survey carried out by the Financial Times. The number of quangos - quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations - has fallen by more than a fifth since 1979, when Mrs Margaret Thatcher became prime minister. But the amount of taxpayers' money they spend has increased threefold, to Pounds 41.7bn, 20 per cent more than the rate of inflation. Unelected members of quango boards are now responsible for more than a fifth of public expenditure, including key public services, such as health, higher and further education and the legal aid system. The FT survey found that the Conservatives have used their patronage powers to appoint many more businessmen to run the largest quangos. Nearly two-thirds of the chairmen of the top 40 quangos in 1990-91 were from business and industry, compared with a third in 1978-79. Full report, Page 9</p>

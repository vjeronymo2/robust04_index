			<p>BFN     [Text] ASEAN views attempts by developed nations to link  social issues to trade agreements as another form of  protectionism. This is because of the greater concern of such  countries with how their workers can cope with competition from  developing countries.    Deputy Prime Minister Brigadier General Lee Hsien Loong made  the point at the opening of the 10th ASEAN labor ministers  meeting in Singapore. Gen. Lee said ASEAN must resolutely  oppose attempts in international forums to increase any  unreasonable standards and practices. These ignore the  different stages of development and the different economic,  political, and cultural context of the developing countries. He  noted that ASEAN governments had adopted a non-adversarial  approach to labor relations. Instead of compromising workers'  rights, it in fact assures workers of more secure jobs and  higher standards of living. As ASEAN's economies develop, this  approach will have to revolve to meet change and needs, but the  pace and direction of that revolution must be decided by the  ASEAN countries themselves.</p>

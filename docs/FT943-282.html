			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Australian deficit leaps to ADollars 2.1bn Australia's current account deficit, seasonally adjusted, surged to ADollars 2.14bn (Pounds 1bn) in August, the largest figure since the beginning of 1990 and far in excess of market forecasts, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. The revised July deficit figure stood at ADollars 1.81bn, and most analysts had been predicting a similar figure for the following month. Although many of Australia's economic indicators have looked healthy in recent months, there has been persistent concern that the country could experience a 'blowout' on the balance of payments front. Merchandise exports rose by 2 per cent, or ADollars 123m, although non-rural exports were below the level recorded in 10 of 12 months of the 1993/4 fiscal year. This rise, however, was more than outweighed by a 7 per cent increase, amounting to ADollars 412m, in merchandise imports. Government ministers played down the figures' significance. Mr Kim Beazley, finance minister, said 'monthly volatility in the data should be treated with caution'. Mr Paul Keating, prime minister, admitted the deficit was 'higher than we would like', but also warned about reading too much into one month's statistics. Both denied the balance of payments figures would put pressure on the federal budget, or immediately influence monetary policy. However, the Australian dollar came under selling pressure, and closed at Dollars 0.73825, compared with the previous close of Dollars 0.73985. The long bond yield hit a three-year peak, but steadied later. Meanwhile, Mr Alexander Downer, leader of the coalition opposition, warned the effects of drought could compound a surge in capital investment-related imports.</p>

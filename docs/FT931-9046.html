			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Inco may aid Russian nickel clean-up THE WORLD'S two biggest nickel producers, Norilsk of Russia and Inco of Canada, have signed technical assistance protocols that may lead to Inco helping to reduce pollution from Norilsk's smelters. Inco said yesterday that Norilsk wanted to cut sulphur dioxide emissions, the main cause of acid rain, and might use the oxygen flash smelting technology Inco developed for its Sudbury, Ontario, smelter where the group expects to reduce sulphur dioxide pollution by 60 per cent in three years. The companies are also discussing a possible joint venture to build mining equipment, using Inco's so-called Continuous Mining Systems technology. However, Inco denied reports from Moscow that it was also discussing with Norilsk methods of limiting nickel exports from Russia. The upsurge in Russian exports is widely held to be responsible for present low London Metal Exchange nickel prices. Falconbridge, another Canadian nickel group, also denied reports that it was involved in three-sided talks with the other two producers. Falconbridge said there had been exchanges of technical people between itself and Norilsk for the past two years, but no other contacts.</p>

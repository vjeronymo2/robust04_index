			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Japan remains quiet ahead of G7 meeting TRADING remained quiet ahead of this weekend's G7 finance ministers' meeting in London, and share prices closed higher after fluctuating on technical trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed up 108.45 at 16,907.39 having risen to the day's high of 16,926.06 in the morning as arbitrageurs bought the index on the overnight rise in Nikkei futures in Chicago. However, prices fell to the day's low of 16,779.47 before receiving support from public fund buying. Volume was 250m shares against 220m as gainers led losers by 474 to 451, with 196 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 2.92 to 1,278.20 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.16 to 1,025.71. Although investors remain uncertain about corporate earnings and prospects of economic recovery, buying by public funds has provided a support around the 17,000 level. With the currency market stable, exporters regained some ground: Sony rose Y40 to Y3,920 and NEC Y9 to Y624. Showa Shell Sekiyu, the day's most active issue, closed up Y25 at Y825 after fluctuating in heavy trading. The issue has plunged 45 per cent since last weekend's announcement of Showa's Y125bn foreign exchange loss. Other oil stocks, which were previously weak on Showa's fall, also rose. Cable companies firmed on expectations that the government will increase spending on telecommunications as part of an expected economic package. Sumitomo Electric gained Y25 to Y905 and Fujikura advanced Y10 to Y528. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 5.81 to 18,057.89 in volume of 106.4m shares. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets produced some strong performances. SINGAPORE rose into record territory for the third straight day, boosted by late index buying. The Straits Times index rose 3.32 to 1,680.96 after losses in morning and early afternoon trade. Trade in speculative Malaysian shares fuelled market activity with the over-the-counter Metroplex the most active, falling 7 cents to SDollars 1.01 with 23.06m traded. TAIWAN closed at its highest level since last July, boosted by a late wave of buying of financial shares. The weighted index rose 107.38 or 2.7 per cent to 4,156.88, with the financial sector up 5.3 per cent in active turnover of TDollars 40.5bn. Banks, which led the market rally earlier in the month but fell prey to profit-taking in recent days, closed limit-up on expectations of big stock dividends next fiscal year. AUSTRALIA staged a late advance on opposition suggestions of lower interest rates after the March 13 elections, the All Ordinaries index ending 2.1 higher at 1,606.9 in turnover of ADollars 280.37m. Brambles Industries shed 40 cents to ADollars 15.80 on marginally lower interim net profits, and Lend Lease eased 12 cents to ADollars 14.96 in spite of a slight rise in net profit and a higher dividend. HONG KONG moved ahead but investors remained wary, waiting to see if publication of the governor's reform package would be delayed to allow talks with China on the issues. The Hang Seng Index advanced 26.19 to 6,203.88 as turnover dipped to HKDollars 2.73bn. KUALA LUMPUR saw late profit-taking and the composite index closed 4.61 higher at 638.83 due to gains in two major component stocks, in volume of a record 464.0m shares. Malayan United Industries rose 50 cents or 18 per cent to MDollars 3.22 on rumours that Hong Leong's Quek Leng Chan was buying up the shares from the open market. BOMBAY was unmoved by the disturbances in New Delhi, concentrating instead on expectations that Saturday's national budget would prove favourable to business. The BSE 30-share index rose 26 to 2,803 in light trading. SEOUL ignored the inauguration of President Kim Young-sam and broadly-based selling pulled the market down. The composite index fell 17.20 to 655.61. BANGKOK lost ground amid rumours about more share manipulation cases and heavy sales of Bangkok Bank as it announced a capital increase. The SET index dropped 4.59 to 954.53.</p>

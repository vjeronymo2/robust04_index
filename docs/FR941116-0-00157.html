			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (f) Removing catfish, crayfish, and other fish for commercial purposes is prohibited during any period during which haying and/or grazing is prohibited in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)(1) Land that has been converted to water storage uses shall be considered to be devoted to conservation uses and may be designated as ACR if the land had been planted to wheat, feed grains, cotton, rice, or oilseeds in at least 3 of the 5 years immediately preceding the conversion. The land shall be considered to be devoted to conservation uses for the period the land remains in water storage uses, but not to exceed 5 years subsequent to its conversion to water storage uses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The water stored on the land may not be ground water;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The farm on which the land is located must have been irrigated with ground water in at least 1 of the last 5 crop years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Land converted to water storage uses may not be devoted to any commercial use, including commercial fish production.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The ACR and CU for payment acreage may be used for noncommercial recreation, or temporary location of beehives. Fees may be charged for hunting and fishing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the Deputy Administrator may authorize, and prescribe conditions under which, on a county by county basis, ACR and CU for payment acreage may be used for haying or grazing, when abnormal weather conditions cause a critical shortage of hay and forage in the county, except that haying and grazing is not allowed with respect to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) program crops;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) mixtures of crops containing program crops, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) alfalfa that is or could be irrigated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1413.67  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Control of erosion, insects, weeds, and rodents on ACR and CU for payment acreage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The farm operator shall use needed control measures in a timely manner to control erosion, insects, weeds, and rodents on the ACR and CU for payment acreage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Control measures for weeds need only be sufficient to prevent the spread of weeds. These measures must be consistent with control practices normally carried out on similar cropland in the area. It is not intended that control practices be more costly to the producer than what is normal for the area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The county committee shall prescribe and require additional control measures upon a determination that those used by the producer are inadequate. When clipping or mowing to control weeds is prescribed, the county committee shall specify a time for clipping or mowing which is compatible with wildlife practices, but such time must be before the time such weeds form seeds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1413.68  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Orchards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Unless the State committee determines otherwise, the entire area of an orchard or nursery meeting the eligibility requirements specified in &sect;1413.61 is eligible to be designated as ACR if the trees were planted in the current year or fall of the previous year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1413.69  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Land going out of agricultural production.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the county committee determines that the designated ACR acreage may be devoted to a nonagricultural use during the current year, the operator must establish that the land, in the absence of the program, would have been planted to a program crop.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1413.70  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Wildlife food plots or habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Land devoted to wildlife food plots that meets requirements determined by the State committee, in consultation with wildlife agencies, is eligible to be designated as ACR acreage.

However, there must also be compliance with the requirements of &sect;1413.61.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Land which is owned or operated by State or Federal agencies and which is planted to grain for wildlife for the agency is not eligible to be designated as ACR acreage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The State committee, after consultation with local wildlife agencies concerning areas to be planted for wildlife food plots or wildlife habitat on privately owned or operated farms, shall:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Determine the recommended mixtures and practices on approved land devoted to soybeans in mixtures, ensuring that the mixture contains less than 30 percent soybeans on the total plant population;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

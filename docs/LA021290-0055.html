			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO;  </P> <P> PATROLS TRY TO STOP HARASSING OF WHALES  </P> <P> Coast Guard and National Marine Fisheries Service agents began patrolling the  San Diego coast to prevent weekend boaters from harassing migrating gray  whales, officials said. The huge mammals, which are protected under the Marine  Mammal Protection Act, travel down the coast on their journey from Alaska to  their breeding grounds off Baja California.  </P> <P> "I don't think anybody starts out their day by saying, 'Let's go harass some  whales today.' I think they just want to get closer," Fisheries agent Ray  Sautter said. "But when you start seeing boats that are making course changes  to pursue the whales and whales making course changes to evade the boats, that  is a violation." Sautter said he called for the patrols after observing boaters  while he took a whale-watching cruise. Fines for harassing whales could be as  high as $25,000, he said.  </P></p>

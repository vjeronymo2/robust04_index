Al-Hariri was on a visit to the Arab Press House and was  joined there by Lebanese journalists working for AL-SHARQ  AL-AWSAT, AL-MAJALLAH, and SAYYIDATI.    As the guest of the [Arab Press] House, he met there with  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Chief Editor 'Uthman al-'Umayr, AL-MAJALLAH  Chief Editor 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Rashid, SAYYIDATI Chief Editor  Matar al-Ahmadi, and the company's General Manager Yasir  al-Dabbagh. They then moved to the conference table where Prime  Minister al-Hariri discussed details of Lebanon's internal and  external situations.    Al-Hariri said: Lebanon is a friend of all the Arab states  including those who supported it and those who did not, but  there can be no doubt that the position of some states is  distinguishable from other Arab states in that they fulfilled  their commitments and were clearer in what they said. The  Kingdom of Saudi Arabia under the leadership of Custodian of the  Two Holy Mosques King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz spares no effort in  supporting Lebanon and its causes and has fully honored its  commitments, and so have Kuwait and Syria, which sent assistance  at the time of the Israeli attempt to hit southern Lebanon.    Al-Hariri expressed the view that the aim of the Israeli  aggressions against Lebanon last July was to show that Israel  would never allow any reconstruction in Lebanon and would not  allow the government to begin the reconstruction process unless  it concludes a peace agreement with Israel, but in practical  terms the aggression achieved none of its objectives. He added:  "True, it caused death and destruction but it achieved no  political results because the people who had left their cities  and villages in the south for a week have returned, thanks to  the aid we received and the measures taken by the Lebanese  state. There was one big united national workshop."    Asked if there is a chance that the company which undertook  the reconstruction of the commercial center in Beirut  (Solidaire) could operate nationwide in Lebanon after its  success in Beirut, he replied: The law creating Solidaire was  introduced for all Lebanon not just Beirut. It is a general law  for the entire country and therefore there is nothing to prevent  its being applied to other parts of Beirut and its suburbs and  also to Jabal Lubnan and Tripoli but, as a government, we wanted  to give the experiment in central Beirut its full range until it  becomes a proven ssuccess, and it has been successful so far.  The public want to see the achievements on the ground. I  expect work to begin next summer opening the way for discussion  of the possibility of implementing the Solidaire experiment in  other areas.    Asked about the Lebanese currency improvement and whether  that was based on confidence in the person of Prime Minister  al-Hariri or other internal factors supporting the Lebanese  pound, he replied: "It is difficult to pass judgment by saying  that the matter was linked to the prime minister or to objective  reasons because the currency issue has to do with confidence in  the country. I should not be talking about this because it  would be like someone talking about himself."    Did he sense in his talks with the British officials that  European confidence in Lebanon has returned? He replied:  "Actually, I rarely visit Britain but the impression I had  before making this visit, which I was invited to make, was that  British officials were interested in the Lebanese situation but  what surprised me was the magnitude of that interest in Lebanon  and their willingness to contribute. They seemed to me to be  very serious and that, I believe, will have an effect on us.  Britain is a large state and such interest on its part in  Lebanon reflects Lebanon's worth."    He revealed that Lebanon received two offers from two major  British companies to contribute to the work on and financing of  Lebanon's electricity network restructuring.    He said that Britain is willing to help in the armament of  the Lebanese Army and Internal Security Forces. He said: "We  are talking not about building an army that wages war but about  strengthening the Army and the Internal Security Forces so that  they can discharge their security duties of maintaining general  order."    Touching on domestic issues, al-Hariri said that the  naturalization file has not been closed and is not linked to the  question of Palestinian resettlement. He emphasized that the  Lebanese citizenship law needs amending and that the government  is serious about introducing the necessary amendments to enable  the resolution of urgent cases. On the administrative purge, he  said that that is an ongoing process that did not end with the  dismissal of some employees.    Prime Minister al-Hariri reaffirmed Lebanon's rejection of  Palestinian resettlement on its territory and spoke of the  negative effects that would have on the demographic, political,  economic, and social fabric of the country. He pointed out that  there is a provision in the Lebanese Constitution prohibiting  resettlement in any form. He stressed that no such project can  be imposed on Lebanon and nobody would sign anything of that  kind under pressure or otherwise. He said that he has many  ideas for the solution of the problem of the Palestinians in  Lebanon and is ready to discuss them with any interested party.    In reply to a question about calls for the amendment of the  Lebanese Constitution introduced under the al-Ta'if agreement,  he said that his position is that he is in favor of developing  the al-Ta'if formula and constitution for the better, not  turning back the clock. He said that "nobody can stand in the  way or reject development." He recalled what he recently said  in the House of Deputies to the effect that he is in favor of a  forward development of the al-Ta'if formula on the basis of  coexistence, balance, and participation.    Al-Hariri will leave London today for Beirut via Istanbul  where he will stop over at the airport for talks with his  Turkish counterpart Tansu Ciller which, according to sources  close to al-Hariri, will focus on development and reconstruction  issues he raised during his recent visit to Turkey a month ago.    The same sources say that he might also visit al-Qaradihah  to  attend the ceremony marking the passage of one week since the  death of President Hafiz al-Asad's son Major Basil al-Asad.</p>

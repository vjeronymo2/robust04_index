			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Arts: Fiac, twenty years on - Nicholas Powell finds optimistic sellers but low prices for contemporary art in Paris AGAINST THE background of unprecedented economic gloom Paris's contemporary art fair, the Fiac, is celebrating its 20th anniversary in the Grand Palais. One hundred and fifty dealers, 10 fewer than last year, are taking part in the week-long fair which ends tomorrow night, and many big international galleries have stayed away. Sales at the Fiac tumbled from FFr400m in 1989 to only FRr100m last year. One stallholder, the Banque de la Cite, which holds the accounts of 530 Paris galleries, says it is owed FRr300m in outstanding loans and that two-thirds of its gallery clients are in financial difficulties. Regularly inaugurated nowadays by government ministers, the Fiac began quietly in 1974 when only 9,000 people attended. The following year's event was marked by a 'happening' staged by Austrian artist Hermann Nitsch involving a cow's carcase and lots of blood. With such bohemian capers well behind them, organisers asked galleries this year to stage shows illustrating major art movements of the past two decades. Eighty have put on exhibitions of one or two artists, often of a museum-like quality, although few have respected the 1974-1993 period. Prices meanwhile are the lowest most people can remember. Galerie Jan Krugier from Geneva is showing drawings by Picasso from the early 1920s, during his so-called 'Ingres' period alongside drawings by Ingres himself - a fascinating juxtaposition of high quality works. The Florence gallery, the Vivita, has some very fine pieces by Picabia and Galerie Gmurzynska from Cologne is showing costume designs, oil paintings, photographic portraits and sculptures by Soviet 'suprematists' Alexander Rodchenko and Varvara Stepanova, all but one of which featured on the Soviet stand in the Universal Exhibition in Paris in 1925. Annely Juda Fine Art, one of five British dealers at the Fiac, is showing works by the same artists as well as by their suprematist colleagues, Malevich and Lissitsky. Just a little more modern, Galerie Boulakia of Paris has a show of surrealist works by Ernst, Matta and Lam while Parisian Marwan Hoss has devoted his stand to paintings - stark urban scenes with stylised figures and oppressive architecture - and sculptures of the past 10 years by the Argentinian Antonio Segui priced at FFr45,000 to FFr250,000. 'They say we are brave to put on one-man shows. But people enjoy them, and buy,' Hoss said. Others are doing good business. Galerie de France of Paris showing five whimsical mechanical sculptures by German artist Rebecca Horn, priced at FFr200,000-FRr300,000 and made especially for the Fiac, rapidly sold three to museums and a private collector. London's Crane Kalman Gallery, over for its second successive Fiac with a display of classical British modern art including works by Graham Sutherland, William Scott, Mary Newcomb, Jenny Franklin and Ray Richardson, made a number of sales and received a range of offers from collectors. There may be no 'happening' or cow's carcase in this year's Fiac. But to keep silliness alive, Canadian gallery Olga Korper is selling reproductions of the Mona Lisa's mouth. Video artist Suzanne Giroux claims Leonardo da Vinci painted the lips to resemble the back and buttocks of a young man if held vertically. Each reproduction costs FFr100,000 and there are only eight for sale.</p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Survey of Korea (4): Threat of confrontation - Relations with North Korea A YEAR ago, there was optimism that North and South Korea were on the path to reconciliation and eventual peaceful unification. The two countries had signed a non-aggression pact and a non-nuclear treaty in December 1991. This was followed by North Korea's acceptance last spring of nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in an apparent attempt to dismiss suspicions that it was developing a nuclear weapon. But relations since then have deteriorated to the point where the threat of a military confrontation on the Korean peninsula has become a frightening possibility. The current crisis was sparked by North Korea's announcement on March 12 that it was withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), an action that increased worries that Pyongyang was determined to develop a nuclear weapon. The roots of the crisis, however, can be traced back to Seoul's demand last year that North Korea accept challenge inspections of suspected nuclear facilities in compliance with the bilateral non-nuclear treaty. Pyongyang refused the request, which blocked progress in inter-Korean talks. Seoul then adopted a carrot-and-stick policy. The carrot consisted of offering aid to help rescue North Korea's struggling economy if Pyongyang accepted inspections. The stick was the resumption of the annual US-South Korean military 'Team Spirit' exercise, which had been suspended in 1992 as a goodwill gesture in response to North Korea's signing of the non-nuclear treaty with the South. Pyongyang has routinely condemned previous Team Spirit exercises as a rehearsal for a possible attack against North Korea. If the Pyongyang leadership seriously believes its own propaganda, this year's Team Spirit may have seem particularly alarming. The holding of Team Spirit in mid-March occurred shortly before the expiry of a deadline set by the IAEA for it be allowed to inspect two unreported facilities believed to contain nuclear waste. Examination of the waste material might confirm IAEA suspicions that North Korea is producing more bomb-grade plutonium than it has declared. Pyongyang then pulled out of the NPT, explaining it was doing so in response to Team Spirit and the IAEA special inspection demand, which it described as 'a seditious political machination aimed at forcing us to open military objects and bases and thereby leaving us disarmed militarily.' If it agreed to the IAEA inspection, North Korea would also create a precedent for accepting similar inspections by South Korea. Many observers concluded that North Korea dropped out the NPT because it feared that the IAEA was close to discovering that Pyongyang was indeed developing nuclear weapons despite denials. North Korea is committed to a producing a nuclear weapon because Pyongyang views it as the ultimate guarantee against the country's absorption by the South, according to these analysts. The nuclear programme 'would provide the means to bargain with the outside world for its acceptance of the permanent division of Korea,' Mr Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former US national security adviser, said in Seoul recently. But there have also been other explanations for the North Korean action. One is that it is connected to transfer of power from President Kim Il-sung to his son, Mr Kim Jong-il. The junior Mr Kim needed to create a crisis atmosphere to rally public support for his gradual assumption of power at a time of economic hardship, while winning the backing of the military, which is sceptical about his leadership ability. Another theory is that North Korea is using its threat of withdrawal in a desperate attempt to win concessions for its return to the NPT. These could include gaining diplomatic recognition from the US and Japan, the right to inspect US military bases in South Korea, a promise by the US not to attack North Korea, and the permanent suspension of Team Spirit. North Korea's diplomatic brinkmanship has paid dividends in the past. It successfully managed to avoid falling under the influence of either China or the Soviet Union, its Cold War patrons, by skilfully playing off the two Communist rivals against each other. Pyongyang possibly believed that a diplomatic gamble with the west could succeed now when new administrations were taking office in Seoul and Washington. Recognition by the US and Japan may be Pyongyang's chief goal. This would reverse the diplomatic defeat North Korea suffered when Moscow and Beijing established relations with South Korea. The NPT withdrawal caught off guard Mr Kim Young-sam, South Korea's new president, who wanted a more flexible diplomatic approach to North Korea. The current crisis has also set back hopes in Seoul that the problem of unification might be solved between the two Koreas without involving the regional powers, the US, Japan, Russia and China. That has been considered a desirable goal because it would symbolise Korea's autonomy in deciding its own fate after a century of being dominated by outside powers. But South Korea is now relying on the US and China to intercede directly with Pyongyang to solve the NPT issue before North Korea's withdrawal formally takes effect on June 12. Seoul could see the issue slip further from its control as the UN Security Council becomes involved in the crisis, including possibly imposing economic sanctions on North Korea if it does not reverse the NPT decision. Moreover, the crisis has exposed underlying tensions between Seoul and the US. Seoul favours a conciliatory policy toward Pyongyang because it fears that a hardline response could push the peninsula into war. It is willing to grant diplomatic and economic concessions if North Korea returns to the NPT. The US is likely to adopt a tougher attitude on North Korea because it views the nuclear issue in a global perspective. It wants to prevent North Korea's permanent withdrawal from the NPT because it could encourage other nations to do the same. The US also fears that a renegade North Korea could provoke a nuclear arms race in north-east Asia, while becoming the supplier of nuclear technology to other anti-western nations. But the Clinton administration, already preoccupied with other international crises such as Bosnia, may be willing to concede diplomatic recognition as the price to be paid for encouraging North Korea back into the treaty and accepting inspections from South Korea. Whether North Korea would accept such a deal depends on its true intentions in provoking the crisis. Even if the nuclear inspection issue is resolved, North Korea will remain an unstable place. North Korea's rulers face a painful and profound dilemma. They must open the country to economic reforms to prevent its likely collapse from growing shortages of food and fuel, but to do so could cause political instability that threatens the survival of the current regime.</p>

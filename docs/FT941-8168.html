			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Poll vaults and politics: The man who made Mori It is 25 years ago to the day that Mr Bob Worcester, an American with a background in management consultancy, set out to pioneer 'strategic decision research' in the UK. Four years later he formed Mori, which today is the UK's largest independent research company. Tonight, leading figures from British industry and politics will gather in London to applaud his achievement. His mission, in 1969, was to persuade British companies to find out, through research, what their employees, their shareholders, and the public at large, thought about them. He originated the mantra: awareness; involvement; persuasion; action. In the intervening years he has worked for most of the top hundred companies in the UK; for local authorities; for the government; and, most famously, for the political parties. He has become, not unwillingly, the public voice of British market research in general and opinion polls in particular. Mr Worcester did not find it hard to attract customers. 'I had three clients in 24 hours.' He enjoyed an after-glow from former prime minister Harold Wilson's 'white heat of technology': companies were caught up in the general enthusiasm for innovation and new approaches to management, especially when presented by an American who had worked for McKinsey, the US management consultancy. By providing British industry with empirical research on changes in consumer tastes and public attitudes, Mr Worcester can claim a small but significant part in helping business to respond more effectively to the developing marketplace over the past 25 years. If industry has gained so, too, has Mr Worcester. He has rejected all takeover approaches for Mori and now controls a research company with a turnover of Pounds 10m, employing 130 full-time staff and another 1,150 part-time interviewers in the field. In 1988 he cashed in on his success by selling 25 per cent of Mori to 3i, the venture capital group, for Pounds 2m. Though industry and the government provide the vast bulk of the work, it is for his research in the political field that Mr Worcester is best known. This amuses him because 'in an average year political polling accounts for 4 per cent of our turnover; in an election year it is 7 per cent', though his influence in government is far greater than these figures suggest. Within a year of his arrival in the UK he had introduced the Labour party to private polling. He was soon a confidante of Lord Wilson. 'Harold was the cleverest client I ever had. He got more out of me than anyone before or since.' Mr Worcester did not always provide the Labour party with good news. But he was employed for 17 years before becoming a casualty of the shake-up introduced by Labour's then communications director Mr Peter Mandelson in the mid-80s. Mr Worcester has since worked for Conservative Central Office, but most of his energies go into political polling for the media. Of course, opinion polls can get it wrong, most disastrously at the 1992 general election when the predicted Labour victory failed to materialise. Mr Worcester has tried to learn from the experience; he has employed a researcher to find out what went wrong. Mr Worcester's explanation for the election debacle was that a late shift by voters, worried by Labour's tax plans and the prospect of a hung parliament, won the day for Mr John Major. He claims not to have lost a single client as a result of what he describes as 'a black day for polling'. Half of Mori's projects now come from the public sector, an indication of the importance attached by ministers to research. Mr Worcester is currently working for the Local Government Commission, finding out what people on the ground want from the proposed re-organisation of local government. On one recent occasion the commission chose to ignore Mori's findings and, Mr Worcester says, paid the price when its recommendations were criticised by the public. Mr Worcester has survived as technology has advanced. Clients can now be given data an hour after a questionnaire has been received for evaluation. But, unlike the US, where most research is conducted by telephone, he prefers face-to-face interviews because, at least in the UK, they are cheaper and more comprehensive. He sees growth abroad, mainly in India, Mexico and Brazil, where he has set up joint companies. But it is in London that Mr Worcester has made his greatest mark. Success to date has been based on exploiting relatively narrow areas of corporate and political research, where he has benefited from contacts in high places. As the international market research business matures, he may find it harder to thrive in the bigger pond.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Esteemed listeners, we have just received a  statement from the office of the president of the Presidency.    According to reliable information, the aggressor will  withdraw by tomorrow morning 3 km from the center of Gorazde,  from both banks of the Drina River. In order to make this  possible, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army will temporarily hand over  the point Mala Biserna to the control of a British unit of the  UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR]. If the aggressor does not  comply with the agreement in full, the British have given  guarantees that the positions on Mala Biserna will be returned  to the Gorazde defenders at 1200 on 14 May.    This offer has been conveyed to our side by the aggressor  via  UNPROFOR. Sefid Buljubasic, commander of the Eastern Bosnian  Operative Group, has informed the General Staff about this  offer. President Izetbegovic has agreed to the plan since the  departure of the Serbian aggressor creates the conditions not  only for the further normalization of life in the enclave, but  also for the return of the expelled population to the right bank  of the Drina River.    This is contained in a statement from the office of the  president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency.</p>

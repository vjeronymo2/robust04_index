			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH TO PRESS GORBACHEV ON LATIN ARMS  </P> <P> President Bush, reacting to the escalating bloodshed in El Salvador, said  Tuesday that he intends to press Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at their  Malta meeting next month to "stop sending arms into the hemisphere."  </P> <P> The statement, airing Administration unhappiness over continued arms shipments  by Soviet allies to Nicaragua and the Salvadoran rebels, is the strongest  criticism Bush has made of Gorbachev in recent months.  </P> <P> Bush also named a 20-member congressional commission, co-chaired by Los Angeles  Democratic Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson, to monitor the Nicaraguan election  process.  </P></p>

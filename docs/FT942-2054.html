			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Eldridge Pope expands estate with Hovetop buy Eldridge Pope, the USM-traded brewer and wine shipper, is expanding its pub estate through the acquisition of Hovetop, which runs 22 houses, mainly in Bristol and along the Thames Valley. The vendors are Mr Michael Collins, a director of Eldridge Pope, and Mr M Jackson. Initial consideration of Pounds 2.6m in cash and shares will be adjusted either way to between Pounds 2.15m and Pounds 3.3m depending on Hovetop's performance in the 12 months to end-April 1995. Mr Christopher Pope, chairman, said the purchase would increase the managed estate by more than 20 per cent, enlarge its catchment area and increase the food element. Some 40 per cent of Hovetop's turnover of Pounds 2.8m in the year to April 2 comprised food sales. He anticipated 'significant cost savings' within the Hovetop estate, 'particularly in the areas of distribution, administration and central overheads'. Eldridge Pope, best known for its Thomas Hardy and Royal Oak brands, recently announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 606,000 for the half to March 31, on turnover of Pounds 17.3m.</p>

On April 11, 1994, the Phlx amended the proposal: (1) To change the manner in which the current Index value would be calculated; (2) to represent that the surveillance procedures currently used to monitor trading in each of the Exchange's other index options, which include having complete access to trading activity in the underlying securities comprising the Index (all of which are traded on the NYSE), also will be used to monitor trading in options on the Index; (3) to provide that the Intermarket Surveillance Group Agreement dated July 14, 1983, as amended on January 29, 1990, will be applicable to the trading of options on the Index; and (4) to confirm that the trading hours for the Index will be 9:30 a.m. to 4:10 p.m. (New York time).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Letter from Michele R.

Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Phlx, pursuant to Rule 19b&hyph;4 under the Act, proposes to list and trade options on the Phlx Phone Index (``Index''), an index developed by the Phlx and comprised of eight common stocks representing the companies created as a result of the divestiture of the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. (``AT&amp;T'') in 1983, as well as AT&amp;T itself.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, the Phlx included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The Phlx prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the proposed rule change is to list for trading an American-style option on the Index. The Index, which is comprised of the common stocks of the eight companies created as a result of the divestiture of AT&amp;T in 1983, includes the seven regional telephone companies spun off from AT&amp;T as well as AT&amp;T. AT&amp;T and the spun-off regional telephone companies represent some of the largest and most widely-held U.S. common stocks. If at any time the number of stocks comprising the Index increases to more than ten or decreases to less than eight, the Exchange will submit a filing to the Commission pursuant to Rule 19b&hyph;4 under the Act prior to opening any new option series on the Index.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The Phlx believes that there is a need for an index option that represents solely AT&amp;T and its spun-off regional telephone companies. In this regard, the Phlx states that there is a significant segment of the investing community that avidly follows these companies. The Phlx believes that the Index, therefore, would fill a current market void by creating a pure U.S. telephone industry index that would not be diluted with other telecommunications stocks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

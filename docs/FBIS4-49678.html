			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "An Important Event in the History </F> of Human Civilization in This Century--Warm Congratulations to  the Success of the First Multiracial General Election in South  Africa"]    [Text] Goods news came from the distant continent of  Africa and attracted worldwide attention. The results of the  first multiracial general election in South Africa showed that  the African National Congress [ANC] of South Africa led by  Mandela will win a majority of the vote. In South Africa, a  ANC-led national unity government will be formed. The result of  the general election showed that the last apartheid system,  which was also the most inhumane one in the world, has come to  an end; and a new South Africa with racial equality is born.  The vast number of black people being oppressed under the  racist rule in South Africa have stood up today, and they,  together with white people, have become masters of the country.  The success of the first multiracial general election in South  Africa was not only a significant event in the political life of  the South African people and the African people as a whole, but  was also an event of great historical significance in, and with  far-reaching impact on, the history of human civilization in  this century. The Chinese people always firmly support the just  struggle of the South African people, and also heartily rejoice  at the historic victory scored by the South African people. We  extend warm congratulations to them.    In order to achieve today's universal suffrage, the people  of  South Africa continued to fight for more than 300 years. In  particular, after the ANC was founded in 1912, it led the black  people in the country to carry out prolonged and unremitting  struggle against apartheid and racial discrimination and to  fight for South African black people's equal political and  economic rights. Their struggle drove the racist regime into  dire straits, made the authorities realize that they could no  longer maintain racist rule, and forced them to hold peace  talks. Constitutional talks began in December 1991. The  multiparty talks, which lasted more than two years and were  attended by the ANC and more than 20 other political parties,  underwent innumerous twists and turns and encountered many  obstacles, because there were different opinions and interest  conflicts between various parties, and the far-right wing of the  white people continued to stir up trouble and provoke conflicts.  However, backed by Mandela and De Klerk, representatives of  most political parties cherished the spirit of racial  reconciliation and democratic consultation, continued to make  joint efforts to remove various difficulties and obstacles, and  eventually achieved significant results in advancing the process  of peace and democracy in South Africa.    Today's victory won by the people of South Africa is also  inseparable from extensive assistance and support from other  African countries and peoples, especially the great assistance  and sacrifice made by the forefront countries in Southern  Africa. The Organization of African Unity, the United Nations,  other international organizations, and the international  community as a whole have also made positive contributions to  supporting the struggle of the South African people. Because  the struggle of the South African people won extensive support  and assistance from all justice-upholding and peace-loving  people inside and outside the country, the situation in South  Africa could develop in an orientation favorable to the people's  progress.    The success of the first whole-people-involved election in  South Africa does not indicate the end of the South African  people's struggle. An extremely small number of far-rightists  among the white people are not willing to see the collapse of  the racist system, and they will continue to stir up trouble and  carry out sabotage. The differences among various organizations  of the black people have not been completely solved. It will be  hard to eliminate the influence of the long-standing racist rule  and violent conflicts within a short time. However, people  believe that the South African people, who have freed themselves  from the shackles of the apartheid system, will certainly be  able to overcome difficulties, and continue to advance along the  course of racial reconciliation and national peace and  stability. A new South Africa with democracy, equality, peace,  and prosperity will certainly appear on the continent of Africa.</p>

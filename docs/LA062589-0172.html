			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WARRIORS SIGN MARCHULENIS, FIRST NBA SOVIET  </P> <P> Sharunas Marchulenis, the leading scorer for the Soviet Union's 1988 Olympic  gold medal-winning team, became the first player from his country to join the  National Basketball Assn. by signing a three-year contract with the Golden  State Warriors.  </P> <P> The Warriors, in announcing the signing of the 6-foot-5 guard from Lithuania  Saturday, declined to disclose contract terms.  </P> <P> "He is the world's premier basketball player outside the United States, both in  my opinion and in the eyes of many basketball authorities," said Don Nelson,  Warrior coach and general manager. "It is indeed an incredible day for us."  </P> <P> Nelson said Marchulenis is so good that he would have been a lottery pick in  the college draft the past two years. "He's a ready-made package," Nelson said.  "By taking his skill and putting him on a basketball court, he's ready to  roll."  </P> <P> Marchulenis, 25, is playing for the Soviet national team in the European  Championships at Zagreb, Yugoslavia. He is expected to visit the Bay Area  within a month.  </P> <P> Alexander Volkov, another member of the Soviet team, also received permission  to sign with the NBA, but a controversy is brewing over his rights. The league  says he can sign only with the Atlanta Hawks, who drafted him in 1986, while  Volkov and his American agent, Marc Fleisher, say he is free to sign with any  team. Fleisher also is Marchulenis' agent.  </P> <P> Arvydas Sabonis, said to be the best Soviet player before suffering an  Achilles' tendon injury, is passing up a chance with the Portland Trail Blazers  to play in Spain for a year.  </P> <P> Marchulenis averaged 18.1 points in eight games during the Seoul Olympics,  including a 19-point effort in an 82-76 victory over the United States.  </P> <P> "I am extremely pleased to be playing with the Warriors," Marchulenis said in a  statement read at a news conference. "Don Nelson is the best coach, and Chris  Mullin and Mitch Richmond are two of the best players in the NBA. Golden State  was one of the most-improved teams in NBA history last year. This season we  will be even more successful."  </P> <P> Richmond, last season's rookie of the year, played on the U.S. Olympic team.  </P> <P> Nelson said the Warriors have been watching the Soviet player for 2 1/2 years  and had been negotiating with him for several months.  </P> <P> Exactly where Marchulenis will fit in with the Warriors' plans, and whether he  will start, will be answered at training camp, Nelson said. A factor that  helped complete the deal was the ruling last spring by the international body  governing basketball that NBA players will be allowed to compete in  international competition.  </P> <P> The effect of the ruling in Europe has been that basketball authorities  interpret it to mean they may bring their national players back for Olympic  competition.  </P> <P> A native of Vilnius, Lithuania, Marchulenis and his wife Inga have a young  daughter. Marchulenis is able to speak and understand some English but will  take additional language lessons, Nelson said.  </P> <P> NBA TRADE  </P> <P> Portland sends Sam Bowie and the 12th choice overall in Tuesday's draft to New  Jersey for Buck Williams.

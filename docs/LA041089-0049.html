			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> VIOLA GIVES UP TWO HOMERS AND LOSES HIS SECOND STRAIGHT, 8-1  </P> <P> The love affair between left-hander Frank Viola and Minnesota Twins fans, which  reached a peak in 1987 when he played a major role in making the Twins world  champions, has turned colder than the Midwest weather.  </P> <P> It was freezing and snowy in Minneapolis Sunday, and it wasn't exactly warm in  the Metrodome after Viola gave up two home runs to the eager young Baltimore  Orioles, who beat the Twins, 8-1.  </P> <P> Viola followed up his two World Series victories by posting a 24-7 record in  1988 and winning the Cy Young Award. He was acclaimed as the best left-hander  in baseball.  </P> <P> When he turned down the Twins' offer of a three-year contract extension of $7.9  million and said he was leaving after this season, he drew criticism even  before he lost the opener last Tuesday to the New York Yankees.  </P> <P> The pregame greeting Sunday was warmer, but after giving up a three-run homer  to Randy Milligan and a two-run shot to Cal Ripken, the Metrodome shook with  boos.  </P> <P> Viola was 14-2 at the Metrodome last season, but is 0-2 already this year. He  said he is taking his poor start in stride.  </P> <P> "I thought I threw the ball good today," said Viola, who wants an extension  worth $8.1 million for three years. "All in all, I have to be pleased except  for five runs and a loss. I guarantee you this isn't the end of my season. I'll  be back."  </P> <P> The Orioles, who lost their first 21 games last season, are now 3-3 after  collecting five hits in six innings to back Jeff Ballard's seven-hitter.  Ballard missed a shutout when Kent Hrbek hit his second home run in two games  in the seventh.  </P> <P> Milligan's home run came in the first inning and Ripken's in the sixth.  </P> <P> Ripken was 0 for 14 prior to the home run, which followed an infield hit by  Mike Devereaux with two out. It was Ripken's second home run of the season and  gave Ballard a 5-0 cushion.  </P> <P> "I was conscious of the fact that the Twins like to put big innings together to  break open games," Ballard said. "It was nice to have five runs before they  even scored."  </P> <P> Cleveland 4, New York 3 -- It was new Manager Dallas Green, not owner George  Steinbrenner, who lashed out at the Yankees Saturday night after just the fifth  game of the season.  </P> <P> "We stink," Green said. "I don't care about injuries. It's no excuse for  playing dumb baseball. We're trying to hit 10-run home runs when we need a  couple of base hits back-to-back."  </P> <P> What Green didn't tell his players was what to do with the knuckleball of Tom  Candiotti and they lost their fifth in a row since starting the season by  beating Frank Viola.  </P> <P> Candiotti baffled them, allowing only fourhits in seven innings, and left with  a 4-1 lead. The Yankees scored twice on an error by second baseman Jerry Browne  and had the bases loaded in the eighth with one out before Doug Jones shut the  door.  </P> <P> Jones, who had 37 saves last season but pitched only five innings all spring  because of a pulled rib-cage muscle, put a quick end to the rally to give the  Indians their first three-game sweep at Yankee Stadium since 1966.  </P> <P> He struck out pinch-hitter Jamie Quirk, then retired Mike Pagliarulo on a fly  to right. He struck out two more in the ninth for his third save.  </P> <P> "I don't hurt one bit," Jones said. "I feel completely rested. "I don't feel  like I've lost any time. My pitches are all there."  </P> <P> Once again former Dodger Steve Sax provided much of the Yankee attack. He was  two for three and drove in two runs.  </P> <P> Tommy John, the only Yankee winner this season, was the loser. He gave up nine  hits in seven innings, but only two of the four runs were earned.  </P> <P> Oakland 4, Chicago 2 -- As a two-time 20-game winner, Dave Stewart believes it  is a good idea to be ready to open the season.  </P> <P> He struck out nine White Sox in 8 1/3 innings at Oakland and stretched his  April winning streak to eight games. Last season he was 6-0 in the first month  and is 2-0 already this season.  </P> <P> The White Sox hammered Stewart in his early seasons with the Athletics, but  they can do nothing with the hard-throwing former Dodger lately.  </P> <P> Stewart, who hasn't lost to the White Sox since the season finale in 1987, had  held them to two runs in 28 innings until he ran into problems in the ninth.  </P> <P> Stewart gave up a single Greg Walker and a double to Carlton Fisk. When Ron  Kittle hit a sharp grounder for an out, Manager Tony La Russa, brought the  hook.  </P> <P> Sox Manager Jeff Torborg was impressed. "He came right at us with fastballs and  got some strikeouts in key spots," Torborg said.  </P> <P> Boston 8, Kansas City 6 -- Wade Boggs had four hits at Kansas City and the Red  Sox, the last team to win a game this season, finally got a victory.  </P> <P> The Royals jumped in front 4-0, but then four relievers shut them down and the  Red Sox pounded out 13 hits and were helped by third baseman Kevin Seitzer's  three errors.  </P> <P> Ellis Burks had two hits for the Red Sox and his three-run double put the Red  Sox ahead 6-4 in the seventh.  </P> <P> Texas 3, Toronto 2 -- Although his Rangers are off to a 4-1 start at Arlington,  Tex., Manager Bobby Valentine is not happy with the way the middle of the  lineup is hitting.  </P> <P> He felt a little better about it when clean-up hitter Ruben Sierra hit a  two-run home run with one out in the ninth off Tom Henke to pull out a win for  the Rangers.  </P> <P> "It wasn't a very good at-bat until the last swing," Valentine said. "Nobody in  the middle of the lineup had hit a home run all spring until that one. It was  an exciting way to end a ballgame."  </P> <P> Sierra's smash gave Kenny Rogers his first win in the majors. Rogers, appearing  in only his second game, pitched one inning. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

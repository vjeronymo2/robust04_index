			<p>-- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY  <F P=103> OW2705095894 </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo SANKEI SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> BFN   <F P=106> [By Akihiko Ota] </F>   [Text] Phnom Penh, 23 May -- A Cambodian Government  military source disclosed on 23 May that government forces had  secretly purchased ammunition from Vietnam for use in battles  with the Pol Pot faction. The SRV has acted at the request of  Cambodia, and thanks to the SRV's supply of ammunition, the  Cambodian Government forces have gained the advantage in the  war. However, the purchase of ammunition from Vietnam, which  once invaded Cambodia, will likely invite strong hostility from  the Pol Pot faction at a "roundtable conference" scheduled in  Pyongyang in North Korea.    According the source, Vietnam started supplying ammunition a  few weeks ago, transporting it to Cambodia by an overland route.  Most of the ammunition comprises bullets for AK-47 type rifles,  and 152mm shells and rocket shells made by the former Soviet  Union.    "They have been purchased at half the price of the  ammunition  sold by North Korea," the source said.    The source said the Vietnamese military concluded the secret  transaction at the request of cadres of the former Phnom Penh  Government, which was once allied with the Vietnamese military,  and is currently a major force of the Cambodian Government  forces. The Vietnamese side then promised to back the Cambodian  Government forces, saying: "Vietnam is ready to supply as much  ammunition as Cambodia wants."    However, the source said that as Cambodia had already spent  its defense budget for the current fiscal year, accounting for  30 percent of the national budget, "budgets for the repair of  national roads have been used to make the payments."    Although in March the government forces brought Anlong Veng  and Pailin, the base of the Pol Pot faction, under its control,  they were later recaptured by Pol Pot fighters. To deal with  the situation, officials as National Defense Minister Tie Banh  visited such countries as Russia, China, Laos, and Vietnam and  officially asked for the supply of arms and ammunitions. Each  nation rejected Cambodia's request on the grounds that "it would  lead to intervention in Cambodia's domestic affairs." Among  those approached, only North Korea showed a favorable reaction.  However, Cambodian officials decided to ask Vietnam because  North Korea is a long way away and it costs huge sums and takes  a long time to transport ammunition, the source said.    The Cambodian Government has asked foreign nations for  military cooperation in fighting the Pol Pot faction. In  response, such nations as the United States and Australia have  shown a positive stand toward the supply of arms.    Meanwhile, the Thai Government has announced it will reject  the Cambodian Government's request, saying military cooperation  would lead a spread of the fighting.    In an interview with SANKEI SHIMBUN, Vice Information  Minister Kyu Knayrit [as published] said: "Although I cannot  disclose the names of the countries, we have already received  arms and ammunitions from some. We also had them dispatch  military instructors a few months ago."    His comments amounted to an admission that Cambodia has  received arms and military advisory groups from such nations as  North Korea and France.    Proposed by Prince Sihanouk, the Cambodian Government and  the  Pol Pot faction are scheduled to start peace talks at a  roundtable meeting due to begin in Pyongyang on 27 May with the  issue of the Pol Pot faction's participation in the government  as a main topic.    The Vietnamese forces invaded Cambodia in 1978 and  established the former Phnom Penh Government after overthrowing  the government led by the Pol Pot faction. For that reason, the  Pol Pot faction has since continued warfare backed by the  Cambodians' historically deep-rooted anti-Vietnamese feelings  and national consciousness.    It is seen, therefore, as inevitable that the Pol Pot  faction  will strongly defy and criticize Cambodia for the purchase by  government forces of war supplies from Vietnam.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, April 25 (AA) -- Constitutional Court  President Yekta Gungor Ozden today called for a new constitution  to underline democracy in Turkey.    "A new constitution, suitable to our nation, should be  prepared at the soonest, to bring rules which would strengthen  the democratic and secular structure of the Republic of Turkey,  based on human rights," Ozden said.    Speaking at the ceremony marking the 32nd year of the  Constitutional Court, Ozden said that the Turkish nation was  founded on the concept of humanity, rather than a racist  understanding and the national characteristic of the republic  cannot possibly be changed by force.    Ozden said that sovereignty belonged unconditionally to the  Turkish nation not to parliament.    "Parliament is an organ authorized, on behalf of the nation,  to legislate and execute," he said.    Ozden warned against illegal rallies which were in fact  rehearsals for establishing a Shariah (Islamic law) state and  were exploiting democracy in Turkey.    ``National, regional or city-level sheikhs or dervishes,  political dervish lodges cannot be allowed or considered valid.    ``Law is our scientific illumination,'' he said. ``To live  under freedom, happiness and confidence requires independence  and willpower, rather than pressure and violence.    ``This state and country belongs to us all. We shall live  with pride and make our state live in pride, if we appreciate  the value of these and are aware of our responsibilities.''</p>

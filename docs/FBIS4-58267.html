			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Mr Hamilton's Logic"] </F>   [Text] The speech of Mr Lee Hamilton, Chairman of the House  Foreign Affairs Committee, at a meeting of the Asia Society,  needs to be noted for the perception about Kashmir in the US  Congress. It could, of course, be different from that of the US  Administration, but it does reflect the views of the most  powerful group of US legislators who are likely to fashion the  future course of American policy in the Sub-Continent. That  this group has for long been subjected to pressure of the Indian  lobby in Congress is clear from two specific statements that Mr.  Hamilton made. One, that the Kashmir plebiscite proposal had  been overtaken by history and two, that the present Line of  Control should be made into an international border. The first  is obviously the repeat of the Indian line which says that since  local elections have been held in the Valley and since Sheikh  Abdullah, the then pro-India Kashmiri leader, authenticated the  State's accession to India, the promise of plebiscite given to  the people of Kashmir has been overtaken by history. The  argument suffers from two serious flaws. First, that the  elections were held under Indian supervision and not that of the  UN. And second, that Sheikh Abdullah soon realised that he had  been tricked into accepting the accession of Kashmir and wanted  its reversal. He was jailed for 14 years. This is the history  that is supposed to have overtaken the UN resolutions. It was  clearly contrived with a lot of deceit and chicanery. To accept  such a history to legitimise an immoral act and then fashion the  future on that basis, is to repudiate the very principles the US  stands for. When Hitler occupied Poland, why did America decide  to stand up and fight? Why was not that piece of history  accepted as a fait accompli? The answer lies in the fact that  the circumstances which lead to a historical event too have to  be judged. If the Indian occupation of Kashmir has now to be  legitimised by the US, then the American people should ask  whether India had promised to hold a plebiscite or not, under  the UN supervision? Or whether the people of Kashmir ever  surrendered that right? Or whether India ever stopped  manipulating the local governments of the Valley? Or whether it  dares to hold and election there? These are moral questions  that need to be addressed before accepting the fait accompli.    Mr. Hamilton's second proposal that the Line of Control be  converted into a permanent border, also echoes the Indian line.  But in this case he began contradicting it himself when he said  in the same speech that any negotiated settlement must take into  account the wishes of the people of Kashmir. How does one  ascertain those wishes? And what if the people of Kashmir do  not want Indian rule? Hitler too could have said that he would  address the economic grievances of the Polish people, provided  he was allowed to rule there. The faces of land-grabbers change  but moral principles do not.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 7, RIA -- The federal authorities of  Russia are taking no timely and effective action to stabilise  the socio- political situation in the north-Caucasian region.  So says the appeal by the Forum of North Caucasian Mass  Organisations and Movements and Cossacks to the president,  prime-minister and speakers of both parliamentary chambers of  the Russian Federation. The forum took place in Nazran.    In the opinion of its participants, the Russian leaders  should proceed from an all-round analysis of the causes of  inter-ethnic conflicts, to be conducted by well-trained and  civic-minded experts.    The appeal expresses the hope that wisdom and foresight of  Russian politicians and statesmen will enable them to make a  profound estimation of the conditions in the northern Caucasus  and take effective political, economic and legal measures aimed  at stabilisation.</p>

			<p>920605 FT  05 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: NZ sells off NZDollars 500m of home mortgages THE New Zealand government yesterday announced the sale of NZDollars 500m (USDollars 269m) worth of mortgages on state-owned homes, marking a significant withdrawal of government support for people on low incomes, writes Terry Hall in Wellington. The government is selling a tranche of mortgages to Postbank, a subsidiary of the ANZ Bank, and the Mortgage Corporation of New Zealand. They are to buy some 20,000 mortgages between them, each paying NZDollars 250m. The government said it was open to offers for the remaining mortgages held by the state-owned Housing Corporation. It said all that had been sold were prime rate mortgages charging market interest rates.</p>

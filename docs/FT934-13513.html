			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Retailers warn chancellor on taxes threat to recovery COMPANY DIRECTORS and top retailers yesterday warned Mr Kenneth Clarke that significant tax rises in next month's Budget could jeopardise the fragile consumer recovery. The chancellor heard the message in separate, private meetings with 20 retail chiefs and Mr Peter Morgan, director general of the Institute of Directors, after news of a bigger than expected rise in retail sales volumes last month. Mr Clarke was told that confidence in industry was low and that many consumers remained wary of spending more. Retail sales in September rose 0.5 per cent on August, a figure higher than expected in the City. The Treasury said the result was 'consistent with recovery'. The news pushed up prices on the London stock exchange to a record closing high, with the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares closing up 26.7 at 3,156.3. But retail executives from large stores including J. Sainsbury, Tesco, Kingfisher, Burton and Storehouse urged the chancellor at a lunch in a London hotel organised by the British Retail Consortium to treat the latest statistics with caution. They told Mr Clarke that a further rise in VAT in the November 30 Budget could lead to a dangerous fall in consumer confidence. They said much of the recent increase in sales had been won only at the expense of much reduced profit margins. Mr Morgan told the chancellor he understood the Treasury's interest in a fiscal tightening to bring down the Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement. But a tax rise in the Budget, on top of the fiscal tightening of nearly Pounds 7bn pencilled in for next April, would threaten the faltering recovery. Mr Clarke's Budget deliberations were made no easier when the British Chambers of Commerce said in its latest quarterly survey that the rate of overall economic recovery slackened during the summer, largely because of weak export markets. Mr Christopher Stewart-Smith, the Chambers' president, said there were good economic reasons for the chancellor to cut bank base rates by at least 1 percentage point from 6 per cent and give more help to exporters. The chancellor also faced renewed protests from some Conservative MPs at Westminster about the planned imposition of VAT on domestic fuel due to come into force in the next financial year as part of the effort to cut the Budget deficit. Six Conservative MPs signed an all-party motion demanding greater compensation for the elderly than planned by the government. The consensus on Tory backbenches is that any move to end VAT zero rating for items such as food and children's clothing would risk a full-scale revolt which could easily overturn the government's 17-seat majority. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, urged Tory rebels to join Labour in overturning the VAT extension during the Finance Bill following the Budget.

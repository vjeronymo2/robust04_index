The chief Palestinian negotiator Nabil Sha'th said he was  optimistic that an overall accord on the implementation of the  September 13 autonomy accord was within sight.    "If the negotiations go on at the same rhythm as the last  two  days, we will not take long," he said.    On the third day of negotiations in Egypt's Red Sea resort  of  Taba, his Israeli counterpart General Amnon Shahaq said: "The  paper on the police is almost completed. There are some things  that can wait a few more days."    Israel and the PLO drafted two documents on Tuesday, one on  the size and strength of the force and the other on coordination  with the Israeli army, Sha'th told reporters.    However, differences remain over "how large the force should  be and how many weapons it should have," said Hasan 'Asfur,  another PLO negotiator.    The Palestine Liberation Organisation wants a force of 9,000  police for the Gaza Strip and the West Bank district of Jericho,  while Israel has set a ceiling of 6,000.    Israel's Police Minister Moshe Shahal said the Palestinians  would be allowed to use the same light weapons and armoured cars  as their Israeli counterparts, but a request for tanks was  rejected.    The PLO also wants speed boats to patrol parts of the  Mediterranean coast.    The negotiators turned Wednesday to the key issue of  prisoners, with the Palestinians seeking the phased release of  all 11,000 detainees within four or five months.    Colonel David Agmon, an adviser on the intifada to the  Israeli army command, and Palestinian deportee Muhammad Dahlan  headed the sub-committee in charge of drawing up a timetable for  the releases.    Israel has said it would not pardon Palestinians who carried  out attacks since the autonomy accord was signed in Washington.    A separate timetable is under discussion for the withdrawal  of Israeli troops from Gaza and Jericho, the launch of which is  already two months behind schedule because of a deadlock on  security issues.    PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister  Shim'on  Peres finally signed a security agreement last week in Cairo.  Economic talks are to resume next Monday in Paris. A committee  on the hand-over of civilian powers also met Wednesday to hammer  out deals on electricity, archaeology and communications,  including the launch of Palestinian television and radio  stations.    Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin insists his country  will  take as much time as necessary for a detailed, overall agreement  on autonomy.    In Washington, the wider Middle East peace talks resumed on  Tuesday with the heads of Israeli, Palestinian, Jordanian,  Syrian and Lebanese delegations meeting away from the cameras  after a two-week break.    The Israeli-Palestinian negotiations were focused on  elections in the self-rule areas set for July.    US State Department officials said privately that Secretary  of State Warren Christopher was planning to return to the Middle  East in late March to try and advance the Israeli-Syrian track  of the peace process.</p>

			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Falls in construction orders point to continued recession THE DEEP recession in the construction industry shows little sign of abating, according to figures published yesterday by the environment department that show a further fall in contractors' order books. The department said the value of construction orders at constant 1985 prices during the three months to the end of November fell by 6 per cent compared with the corresponding period last year, and by 5 per cent compared with the previous three months. Orders at the end of the first 11 months of last year were more than a tenth lower than during the same period in 1990 and almost a quarter down on that period in 1989. Mr John Smith, president of the Building Employers Confederation, said on Monday that competition for work meant that at least half of building contracts won recently were either loss-making or had a zero margin. He warned that construction output was expected to fall by about 5 per cent this year to the lowest level since 1986, and was likely to lead to the loss of a further 50,000 jobs. Mr Tim Yeo, environment minister, said the order figures for the period from July to November showed an increase in housing and industrial orders on the corresponding period in 1990. 'I welcome this latest evidence that orders in much of the construction industry are showing signs of recovery,' he said. Miss Joanne Cutler, economist at the confederation, said Mr Yeo's comments on recovery conflicted with what companies were telling her organisation. The environment department's most recent figures, for September, October and November, showed that orders compared with the corresponding period in 1990 were falling or flat in every sector except public housing, she said. According to the department, private industrial orders were 16 per cent lower than during June, July and August and 8 per cent lower than during the corresponding period in 1990. Private commercial orders were 6 per cent and 15 per cent lower respectively. Private housing orders were 18 per cent lower than during the previous three months, but 1 per cent higher than during September, October and November in 1990. Public housing orders including housing associations were 8 per cent and 141 per cent higher. Orders for public works other than housing were 14 per cent higher than during the previous three months, but 7 per cent lower than a year earlier. British brick manufacturers last year sold 3.1bn bricks, the lowest annual deliveries since records started in 1968. Figures published yesterday by the environment department show that the number of unsold bricks at the end of last year stood at a record 1.4bn. Lex, Page 20</p>

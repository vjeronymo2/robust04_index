			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Cementia ahead 7% to SFr76.7m CEMENTIA, the Swiss sub-holding company in the Lafarge Coppee cement group, reported consolidated net income of SFr76.7m (Dollars 51.40m) in 1991, up 7 per cent from the previous year. The rise was attributed to restructuring in North America and strong demand in Spain, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. Directors have proposed dividend increases, from SFr65 to SFr70 on bearer shares and from SFr13 to SFr14 on participation certificates.</p>

			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUSTICES BACK STOCKBROKERS IN FRAUD DISPUTES;  </P> <P> INVESTORS MUST SEEK REDRESS FROM INDUSTRY ARBITRATORS, NOT FEDERAL COURTS  </P> <P> The Supreme Court, in a victory for the securities industry, ruled Monday that  many unhappy investors who believe that they were cheated by their stockbroker  must take their complaints to an industry arbitrator, not a federal court.  </P> <P> The 5-4 ruling helps the stock firms avoid potentially huge damage awards by  juries, which are often sympathetic to small investors who believe that they  were bilked by their brokers. Instead, if an investor signs a standard contract  pledging to take any dispute to arbitration, the justices said, he must abide  by that deal.  </P> <P> Leaders of the securities industry, in briefs to the court, say these  arbitration hearings are fair, speedy and unbiased. More than half of the  arbitrators may have no direct ties to the industry, and in 1987, 55% of the  customers' cases that went before arbitration resulted in a damage award for  the customer, the justices were told.  </P> <P> But a Texas lawyer who represents 17 widows who may have lost as much as  $400,000 because of a shady broker said his clients would have much preferred  to go to a federal court.  </P> <P> "This way, you are playing on their home court," said attorney Denis Downey of  Brownsville, who was on the losing end Monday. "They (arbitrators) may profess  to be neutral, but they are picked by the industry. Plus, even if you win in  arbitration, you usually don't win much. Maybe a few thousand dollars in  damages if you have lost $200,000."  </P> <P> Federal court juries cannot only award a plaintiff damages to cover all of his  or her losses, but can also tack on extra, huge punitive damage penalties to  punish the broker or his company for their wrongdoing.  </P> <P> Still, the ruling Monday was no surprise. Two years ago, the court issued a  similar ruling concerning the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Then,  investors had sued their broker in federal court under the 1934 law, but the  justices said the door to the court was closed because their contract language  called for arbitration.  </P> <P> In this case, the 17 Texas widows had filed a federal court suit under the  Securities Act of 1933. They contended, among other things, that the broker who  worked for Shearson-American Express had churned their accounts and put their  money into the most risky investments.  </P> <P> They relied on a 1953 Supreme Court ruling in the case of Wilko vs. Swan which  specifically said that investors can use the 1933 Securities Act to get into  federal court.  </P> <P> On Monday, however, the conservative majority simply overruled the 1953  decision, saying it was now "outmoded."  </P> <P> "To the extent that Wilko rested on suspicion of arbitration as a method of  weakening the protections afforded in the substantive law to would-be  complainants," wrote Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, "it has fallen far out of step  with our current strong endorsement of the federal statutes favoring this  method of resolving disputes."  </P> <P> The four more liberal members -- Justices John Paul Stevens, William J. Brennan  Jr., Thurgood Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun -- accused their colleagues of  "judicial activism" since Congress has had 36 years to rewrite the securities  law if it believed the Wilko ruling incorrect.  </P> <P> The ruling not only spares the securities industry a big headache, but does the  same for the federal court system. In 1987, 2,844 securities-related complaints  were filed in federal courts.  </P> <P> In its brief endorsing arbitration, the securities industry noted that the  average U.S. judge handles 460 cases, meaning that the securities complaints  alone could fill the schedules of six judges for a year.  </P></p>

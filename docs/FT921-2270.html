			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Beregovoy to boost ownership of shares MR Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance minister, yesterday announced proposals to introduce a FFr600,000 (Dollars 30,447) personal equity plan as the linchpin of his initiative to create a 'shareholder's democracy' in France. The new personal equity plan, which will have a tax-free element and a six-year lifespan, is a short-term savings vehicle to be launched as part of a longer-term programme to reform the French pension system. Details will be announced during the spring session of the National Assembly. Pension reform has important implications for France's financial markets as it should provide an influx of investment to resolve the long-term problem of poor liquidity. However, the financial community was disappointed by the announcement earlier this week that Mr Beregovoy had abandoned plans to launch corporate pension funds in France. The initiative comes at a time of sweeping change within the French financial system. The government is currently reviewing the legislation on takeovers. This week the Conseil des Bourses de Valeurs, the stock market regulator, voiced its support for proposals to abolish the rule whereby predators can mount 'partial bids' for two-thirds of a company's equity in favour of forcing them to make full offers for 100 per cent.

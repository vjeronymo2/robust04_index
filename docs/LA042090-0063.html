But Alia made clear that Albania will  not follow other East European countries in abandoning one-party Communist  rule. Addressing the ruling party Central Committee in Tirana, the state and  party leader said Albania had never had a phobia toward the two superpowers and  that the renewal of ties is now on the agenda.  </P></p>

These schedules shall be based on annual special wage surveys conducted by the Bureau of Reclamation in each special wage area. Survey jobs representing Bureau of Reclamation positions at up to four levels will be matched to private industry jobs in each special wage area. Special schedule rates for each position will be based on prevailing rates for that particular job in private industry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Each supervisory job shall be described at one of four levels corresponding to the four supervisory situations described in Factor I and four levels of Subfactor IIIA of the FWS Job Grading Standard for Supervisors. They shall be titled in accordance with regular FWS practices with the added designation of level I, II, III, or IV. The special survey and wage schedule for a given special wage area includes only those occupations and levels having employees in that area. For each position on the special schedule, there shall be three step rates. Step 2 is the prevailing rate as determined by the survey, step 1 is 96 percent of the prevailing rate, and step 3 is 104 percent of the prevailing rate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) For each special wage area, the Bureau of Reclamation shall designate and appoint a special wage survey committee, including a chairperson and two other members (at least one of whom shall be a supervisor paid from the special wage schedule), and one or more two-person data collection teams (each of which shall include at least one supervisor paid from the special wage schedule). Full-scale surveys shall be planned and conducted in each area at least every 3 years, with wage change surveys in each intervening year. More frequent full-scale surveys may be scheduled to balance the agency survey workload. The local wage survey committee shall determine the prevailing rate for each survey job as a weighted average. Survey specifications are as follows for all surveys: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Tailored to the Bureau of Reclamation activities and types of supervisory positions in the special wage area, private industry companies to be surveyed shall be selected from among the following Standard Industrial Classification Major Groups: 12 coal mining; 13 oil and gas extraction; 14 mining and quarrying of nonmetallic minerals, except fuels; 35 manufacturing industrial and commercial machinery and computer equipment; 36 manufacturing electronic and other electrical equipment and components, except computer equipment; 42 motor freight transportation and warehousing; 48 communications; 49 electric, gas, and sanitary services; and 76 miscellaneous repair services. No minimum employment size is required for surveyed establishments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Each local wage survey committee shall compile lists of all companies in the survey area known to have potential job matches. For the first survey, all companies on the list will be surveyed. Subsequently, companies shall be removed from the survey list if they prove not to have job matches, and new companies will be added if they are expected to have job matches. Survey data will be shared with other local wage survey committees when the data from any one company is applicable to more than one special wage area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) For each area, survey job descriptions shall be tailored to correspond to the position of each covered supervisor in that area. They will be described at one of four levels (I, II, III, or IV) corresponding to the definitions of the four supervisory situations described in Factor I and four levels of Subfactor IIIA of the FWS Job Grading Standard for Supervisors. A description of the craft, trade, or labor work supervised will be included in each supervisory survey job description. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Special wage area boundaries shall be identical to the survey areas covered by the special wage surveys. The areas of application in which the special schedules will be paid are smaller than the survey areas, reflecting actual Bureau of Reclamation worksites and the often scattered location of surveyable private sector jobs. Special wage schedules shall be established in the following areas: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

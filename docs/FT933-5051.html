			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / The Week Ahead: German monetary policy in the spotlight - Economics GERMANY will be the centre of attention this week with parliament resuming work after the summer recess today and the Bundesbank's decision- making council meeting again on Thursday. The debate over whether the Bundesbank should or should not ease its monetary policy will be fuelled by the expected publication tomorrow of second quarter gross domestic product figures and July retail sales figures during the week. The consensus among economists is that the economy stagnated in the second quarter. If true, that would lend support to the government's belief that the recession has bottomed out. But the outlook for recovery is bleak, with rising unemployment and continued self-doubt in Europe's biggest economy. The weak state of the Japanese economy will be highlighted in the Bank of Japan's latest 'Tankan' report on Friday. By coincidence international monetary officials meet in Paris that day to prepare the way for the annual International Monetary Fund meetings at the end of the month. Japan could again find itself under pressure to expand its economy. The main economic statistics and events of the week follow.

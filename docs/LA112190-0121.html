			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: 'WONDER YEARS' TEAM HIRED BY DISNEY STUDIOS  </P> <P> Walt Disney Studios said Tuesday that it signed the husband-and-wife television  writing team of Neal Marlens and Carol Black to a four-year contract to develop  "a wide range of projects."  </P> <P> Marlens and Black created "The Wonder Years" and originally produced "Growing  Pains," both on ABC.  </P> <P> The couple has a commitment for three more series at ABC.  </P> <P> Although the deal with Disney is exclusive only in respect to television, "we  hope to be involved with them in all areas," said Rich Frank, president of Walt  Disney Studios. Marlens and Black also wrote the 1987 movie "Soul Man."  </P> <P> As reported, Marlens and Black came close to signing a $15-million deal with  Universal Studios last year before negotiations collapsed over creative  differences. Sources valued the new agreement with Disney at about $13 million.  JOHN LIPPMAN  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME SHOPPERS, HAVE YOU HEARD THIS BEFORE?  </P> <P> Twenty answers home buyers must learn to recognize:  </P> <P>  -- "Why, before you know it, all those messy overhead wires will disappear  underground."  </P> <P>  -- "See, the overall plan calls for this particular street to end in a nice  quiet cul-de-sac when it's all finished."  </P> <P>  -- "Sure you can work out your share of the new fence with him -- he's a sweet  guy."  </P> <P>  -- "The city maintains the grass and trees from the curb up to, oh, about here  -- no problem, really."  </P> <P>  -- "Cable's due next month."  </P> <P>  -- "All I know is there's this big property fight at the traffic light -- the  supermarket can't wait to get close to this neighborhood."  </P> <P>  -- "It's a cinch, they are permanently rerouting the buses two blocks away."  </P> <P>  -- "Don't sweat it -- the owner's having all the old trash hauled away this  weekend and come Monday, the place will sparkle, believe me."  </P> <P>  -- "Oh, the red curb there in front -- that's a mistake the city will fix."  </P> <P>  -- "The street light's not broken, just turned off so as not to shine in the  master bedroom."  </P> <P>  -- "Well, you share the water meter with four others, but splitting the bill  every month is a breeze."  </P> <P>  -- "Oh, it's only a rumor that the SWAT team raided the Middle School down the  block last month."  </P> <P>  -- "So, your dog runs away a lot -- on this street everybody just loves pets."  </P> <P>  -- "That greenish coloring on the roof, that's just for old-style effect."  </P> <P>  -- "Reception's always real good, so you could move the two dish antennas off  the patio without any trouble."  </P> <P>  -- "They're awfully good out here about renegotiating your property taxes --  all you do is ask."  </P> <P>  -- "Those potholes will go -- they resurface in this district every six months  like clockwork."  </P> <P>  -- "Boats, campers, RVs -- park them anywhere -- driveway, front yard, on the  street as long as you want."  </P> <P>  -- "And you know what's real nice -- the trash people come right up to your  back door and no noise."  </P> <P>  -- "Those look little but they're really dwarf fruit trees and they're  supposed to turn brown right now."  </P></p>

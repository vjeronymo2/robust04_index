			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> URBAN BESTIARY  </P> <P> I was charmed by a family of opossums that lived in the brush near my home and  visited often. These episodes were totally riveting to my dog who, nose pressed  to the back sliding glass door, waited for their arrival.  </P> <P> A few days passed with no sightings. Apparently the brush had been cleared,  and, unfortunately, I found the mother opossum dead in my garden shed. My  depression about her death was quite real. In a high-tech world of concrete and  glass, this little family of wild beasties reminded me of my country upbringing  and the loss society suffers from distancing ourselves/itself from nature. So  many people never experience a natural environment, see a wild river or  mountain or glimpse an animal in its natural habitat. We, thus, lose part of  our soul focused as we are on materialism and consumerism. It's good to be  reminded that we are part of something larger than ourselves. The oppossums  came back in time, and, I and my dog, are very happy that they are.  </P> <P> ELAINE FRANCES LIVESEY-FASSEL, Los Angeles  </P></p>

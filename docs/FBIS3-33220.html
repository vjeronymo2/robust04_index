			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Christian Democratic Party Presidential </F> Candidate Fidel Chavez Mena by an unidentified reporter; place  and date not given]    [Text] [Reporter] What are the PDC's [Christian Democratic  Party] economic proposals within a market economy?    [Chavez Mena] We propose establishing conditions for  creating  an integrated economy with strong sustained growth, through a  model of social market economy, characterized by combining three  areas: free initiative or free competition, social development,  and citizen participation. We want to create a social market  economy that combines these three factors.    Three areas are important to us. We include investing in the  people in the first area. We propose four priority programs in  this area: education, health, potable water, and the ecology.    The second area attempts to broaden the business base. It  strengthens current entrepreneurs and encourages new ones so as  to broaden the base. To this end, there are four priority sector  policies. First, encourage cattle raising and agricultural  production levels; second, medium-, small-, and mini-sized  entrepreneurs should be supported with fair policies; third,  there would be a policy for professionals; fourth, the state  should encourage better academic preparation through the  supervision of university training.    The third idea is to incorporate women into the production  sector. There is a special emphasis on low-income women and  peasant women. Women are the head of the household in 63 percent  of Salvadoran homes, only 33 percent of homes are maintained by  a couple, and 1 percent are homes where just the man works. Our  policy is to incorporate women into production activities,  creating entrepreneurial agents and even banks for women. This  strengthens the small and the medium-size entrepreneur and  creates women agents.    [Reporter] The government says it has a social market  economy. What is the actual difference from your social market  economy? What measures would the PDC implement?    [Chavez Mena] To our way of thinking, the difference is that  the government has seemingly encouraged a structural adjustment  program to reach greater economic stability levels, which was  important and has yielded good macroeconomic results. I do not  question the macroeconomic figures.    The structurural adjustment program was applied to resolve a  problem at the time; however, it is not true that the government  set down the bases for a social market economy model, it was  more like an adjustment program that may or may not be done  within a social market economy program.    [Reporter] What is the problem then?    [Chavez Mena] Rather than a production economy, a more  speculative and financial economy was encouraged. To our way of  thinking, we should maintain all macroeconomic policies that  have created certain levels of economic stability. It is not a  question of destroying what works. What is needed is to  implement extensive sector policies.    Exporters of agricultural and other products have complained  of an absence of sector policies; there really were no policies  intended to encourage agricultural and cattle raising sector  activities. The topic of updating industries, which we feel is  part of the Central American integration, was not included  either.    The presidents made a lot of headway in political accords  and  have laid down important principles for the integration process,  but this should be coordinated with macroeconomic policies. For  example, basic grains: There cannot be complete freedom of trade  between Central American countries if all macroeconomic politics  are not coordinated. The EEC's toughest problem was to solve the  agricultural sectors' problems.    It is true the government achieved certain levels of  stabilization; what we need today is to encourage the country's  production. We propose creating new entrepreneurs through  credits with FIGAPE [expansion unknown] or Fedecredito  [expansion unknown]. We plan on opening new banks and allowing  these facilities to compete. It is important to allow foreign  banks to open but within a regulated framework. If we are going  to open trade, we need a very aggressive policy so our  industrialists can begin to improve.    Another difference is the need to increase remittances  [remesas]. Here we have an extraodinary amount that covers the  $1.4 billion trade deficit. These remittances must be used  appropriately. How? By offering homes, for example.    Production activities must be encouraged, which for one  reason or another this administration did not do.    [Reporter] Where will the funds come from?    [Chavez Mena] To implement this program we have drafted a  budget to cover 1994-99.    To this avail we have taken into account several resources.  First of all, we have taken into account fiscal income, which  does not require additional taxes. I believe that a lot of  headway has been made because the tax system has been  streamlined. Secondly, we have taken into account family  remittances over the next five years. A third source of revenue  is international cooperation. The country is going to need  loans, donations, and honestly speaking hefty international  cooperation.    [Reporter] Taking into account the delays in project  approvals, especially at the ECC and international organization  level, are there projects that have already been approved?    [Chavez Mena] There are some. From the [Jose Napoleon]  Duarte administration there were between $1.2 to 1.3 billion  left in projects, such as overpasses, repairs to the North  Junction Road, and the continuation of the road toward eastern  El Salvador.    The projects will take approximately 20 months from the time  the requests are presented and the contracts are signed to when  the plans are drafted and construction is undertaken. We are  taking this into account plus the existing volume. Thus, a very  aggressive foreign policy is needed to gain access to the  difference in funds required.    [Reporter] As part of this aggressive foreign policy, do you  have at this moment any general idea, for example, on reducing  the number of embassies and consulates, or obtaining the  necessary funds to send more qualified personnel abroad? Has  anyone thought of sending businessmen or economists to get more  aid?    [Chavez Mena] Foreign policy must have a strong economic  content. During the years I was foreign minister, there was  greater emphasis on the political side as opposed to the  economic side. This was due to the war situation. We intend to  take advantage of all our consular and embassy infrastructure to  promote our exports and to use that infrastructure more as a  commercial agent for exporters.    [Reporter] If you have an economic plan based on a market  economy already designed to be put into effect in case you are  elected, what was last week's "emergency" [emergente] proposal?    [Chavez Mena] We consider that there are several problems  that are urgent, which demand extraordinary measures. We  believe a plan to control crime is needed. With such a high  level of insecurity, the problem of encouraging economic  activity and investment, especially foreign investment, becomes  even greater.    Likewise, we need to freeze basic food basket prices. Supply  is too low and the market is distorted. When the imbalance is  so great the idea is to halt somewhat the demand during six  months to stimulate all participants in the production chain,  especially in the cattle raising and agriculture sector and in  the small and medium sized businesses.    What we propose, immediately after we take office, is to  call  on producers and union leaders to establish a social pact, much  like in Mexico, which also worked in Bolivia, and not freeze  basic food basket prices by decree.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The Just Struggle of South Korean </F> Youth and Students"]    [Text] The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated:  The South Korean youth and students have played a vanguard and  leading role in promoting the South Korean people's just  anti-U.S. struggle and their struggle for independence,  antifascist democratization, and national reunification. Our  nation is proud of their heroic struggles.    Today youth and students are vigorously struggling to pull  out outside forces and their nuclear weapons from South Korea.  As has been already reported, the United States has largely  reinforced and deployed its arms of aggression to South Korea  under the pretext of the nuclear issue and has aggravated  tensions on the Korean peninsula along with the puppets. Such a  criminal act by the United States has aroused the indignation  and protest of the South Korean youth, students, and people from  all walks of life.    On 19 April, approximately 500 youth and students waged a  harsh anti-U.S. demonstration in front of the U.S. Cultural  Center in Taegu, shouting slogans that they oppose the  introduction of Patriot missiles to South Korea, as well as the  National Assembly's ratification of the opening of agricultural  product markets. On the same day, when they failed to occupy  the U.S. Cultural Center because of the violent oppression by  the combat police forces, the demonstrators continued to bravely  fight against them, thus throwing stones at them. On 18 April,  youth and students in Taegu held a rally in front of the Taegu  department store to mark the 34th anniversary of the 19 April  people's uprising and condemned the nation-selling and  treacherous Kim Yong-sam clique's antinational and flunkeyist  act.    The National Alliance of College Students Organization  [Hanchongnyon], a mass-oriented struggling organization which is  made up of the South Korean youth and students, declared that it  would reaffirm that the anti-U.S. struggle is particularly a  basic road to the nation's democratic movement, saying that the  movement for independence, democracy, and reunification must be  earnestly carried out. Thus, it has bravely risen up to  participate in the just struggle of the South Korean youth and  students under the resolution that it will take the lead in  promoting the nation's just anti-U.S. struggle and their  struggle for independence that will defend the nation's  existence and dignity.    On 20 April, approximately 150 Hanchonnyon students  penetrated into the building of the puppet Defense Ministry in  which the U.S. secretary of defense and the puppet defense  minister had plotted together a war conspiracy and waged  demonstrations under the placards entitled "We Oppose the United  States and the Visit by William Perry; We Don't Want a War; and  Yankee Go Home." Also a group of youth and students in Seoul  waged demonstrations in front of the U.S. Embassy in Seoul by  breaking through a tightly-guarded siege of police, shouting the  anti-U.S. slogans "We Hate Patriot Missiles" and "We Hate  William Perry."    The anti-U.S. struggle vigorously waged in South Korea has  been further reinforced along with the antigovernment struggle.  Participants in the struggle have denounced that the puppet Kim  Yong-sam clique is more treacherous and flunkeyist than any  other South Korean rulers in the past.    According to a decision by Hanchongnyon, students in Pusan  -- who resolved on 8 April to go on strike, hold rallies, and  stage demonstrations against the National Assembly's  ratification of the opening of the agricultural product market  -- continued struggles even until later that night and, thus,  made the nation-selling and treacherous Kim Yong-sam clique  shudder.    Approximately 1,000 students, who participated in the  struggle waged during the daytime, carried out an offensive and  defensive battle against the combat police force units for  nearly three hours from 1900 to 2200 that day.    Youths and students -- who are infuriated at the South  Korean  authorities' antinational opening of agricultural product  markets -- even attacked the branch offices of the Democratic  Liberal Party in Kwangju and in Taegu.    In Kwangju, approximately 400 youths and students staged  demonstrations in front of the South Cholla Provincial local  branch of the Democratic Liberal Party and continued struggles  by throwing some 50 paint bottles at its branch building and  shouting slogans that called upon the government not to sign the  Uruguay Round accord.    The students of Myongji, Yonsei, and Hongik Universities,  who  belong to the western district branch office of the Seoul  District Federation of General Students, have also waged the  just struggle. On 26 April, approximately 700 students held  rallies and demonstrations to mark the 3d anniversary of the  death of student Kang Kyong-tae, thus raging against the fascist  murders. Participants in rallies prayed for the bliss of their  fellow student who sacrificed himself in the sacred struggle for  independence, democracy, and reunification and then strongly  condemned the military fascist elements who had mercilessly  killed the young patriotic student.    Through their practical struggles, the South Korean youths  and students have been clearly aware that the aspiration of the  youths, students, and people for independence, democracy, and  reunification can never be achieved as long as there are outside  forces remaining in South Korea. The outside forces will be  also doomed to a greater disaster.    Therefore, the South Korean youth, students, and people are  now vigorously conducting the anti-U.S. and antigovernment  struggles to save the fellow countrymen's lives -- which are  more important than their youth and lives -- even under a  warlike atmosphere in which the fascists act rashly.    The wise and brave youths and students in South Korea -- who  strongly call for the withdrawal of the U.S. Forces from South  Korea despite the fascists' clubs and bullets -- will continue  to fight on until the U.S. Forces stationed in South Korea are  fully withdrawn from this land. This is the will and vigor of  our youths and students in the colonial South, as well as the  unanimous voices of the South Korean youths, students, and  people. Thanks to the struggle of the wise and brave youths,  students, and the people, South Korea has been turned today into  an anti-U.S. struggling place where the struggles are waged more  harshly.    The puppet South Korean clique should be clearly aware of  the  will and faith of youths, students, and people who aspire for  independence, democracy, and reunification. They should act  with discretion. The wise and brave youths, students, and  people in South Korea should firmly cooperate with each other  under the anti-U.S. and antiwar banner. As a result, they will  more vigorously carry out the struggles to achieve independence,  democracy, and national reunification.</p>

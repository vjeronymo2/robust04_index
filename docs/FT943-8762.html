			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Spanish accused over drift nets The environmental group Greenpeace said yesterday it had found Spanish fishing boats in the Straits of Gibraltar using illegal drift nets of the kind which have provoked the so-called 'tuna war' between Spain and France. Greenpeace said its flagship Rainbow Warrior had found some 10 Spanish vessels using drift nets, which have been banned by the Spanish government since 1990, on Sunday night. Greenpeace volunteers managed to pull part of one of the nets out of the water and escape with it. In the Bay of Biscay, Spain's north coast fishing fleet, which uses traditional hook and line techniques to catch tuna, has clashed several times with French, Irish and British boats which it says use drift nets longer than permitted by the European Union.</p>

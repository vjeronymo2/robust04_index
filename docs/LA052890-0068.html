			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BATTLE OVER CLOSED-CAPTIONING;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: EDUCATION GROUPS SUPPORT LEGISLATION TO AID THE HEARING-IMPAIRED,  BUT THE ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY OPPOSES IT AS A 'REGRESSIVE TAX.'  </P> <P> Legislation that would make closed-captioning technology a required part of  most new televisions sold in America is winning support in and out of Congress.  </P> <P> That's good news for the estimated 24 million deaf or hearing-impaired U.S.  citizens, who now must rely on costly closed-caption decoding devices or, as is  more common, view their favorite programs hearing only muted mumbles or nothing  at all.  </P> <P> Installing decoding circuitry would allow television sets to display captions  without separate decoders. The bill calls for closed-caption decoding chips to  be installed in all new TVs sold in the United States with 13-inch screens or  larger, beginning Oct. 15. That is the minimum recommended size for viewers to  read closed captions, which run along the bottom of the screen in the manner of  a subtitled foreign film.  </P> <P> But the electronics industry is fighting the legislation with a "read my lips"  rationale, arguing that the bill's mandatory standard for all TVs would impose  a "regressive excise tax" on everyone who wants to buy a television.  </P> <P> The measure comes at a time when the Bush Administration and Congress are  acting on several fronts to increase rights and access for disabled Americans.  </P> <P> In March, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered sweeping redesign of  future commercial airliners to make it easier for handicapped people to fly.  Last Tuesday, the House approved landmark civil-rights legislation aimed in  part at gaining disabled Americans equal access to jobs, public transportation  and restaurant service.  </P> <P> Until now, however, disabled activists' calls for built-in decoders as standard  TV technology have largely been ignored.  </P> <P> In the closed-caption technology, first marketed to consumers in 1980, the  subtitles are contained in a portion of the television signal that does not  appear on the TV screen unless called up by a special decoding device. The most  recent model of decoder, the TeleCaption 4000, retails for about $175 and can  be purchased by telephone via the AT&amp;T Special Needs Center, or at Sears,  J.C. Penney, Highland Superstores and other chains.  </P> <P> But due to a combination of limited availability, spotty marketing and cost,  the National Captioning Institute estimates that only about 300,000 of the  machines have been sold in the last 10 years, with a roughly estimated  viewership of 1 million.  </P> <P> This suggests that only about 1 in 25 deaf or hearing-impaired people is now  able to watch closed-captioned shows -- not much market incentive for networks  and local affiliates to increase the hours in which they provide closed-caption  broadcasts, the bill's advocates contend.  </P> <P> "The audience for captioned programs must be enlarged," said Rep. Edward Markey  (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's  telecommunications subcommittee. He called the bill, introduced earlier this  month by Rep. Major Owens (D-N.Y.), "an essential tool for increasing the use  of captioning."  </P> <P> Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), the Senate sponsor of the measure, is expected to  push for its endorsement in a June 20 Commerce Committee hearing.  </P> <P> The legislative mandate would come with a price tag, although each side of the  debate offers different figures. Some proponents contend that the built-in  decoding equipment might boost costs only $3 to $5 per TV set; the bill's most  vocal opponent, the Washington-based Electronic Industries Assn., asserts that  prices could rise by as much as $20 per set.  </P> <P> Regardless of how much it might be, the electronics group objects to any cost  hike applied across the board to all citizens.  </P> <P> In testimony this month before Markey's subcommittee, the EIA's vice president  for its consumer electronics group, Thomas P. Friel, argued that while existing  closed-caption decoders are too expensive, forcing everyone to pay for  standardized in-set decoding chips is not fair.  </P> <P> "We do not . . . believe it is fair to impose what amounts to a regressive  excise tax on all purchasers of television sets in order to benefit a small,  albeit deserving, minority," Friel told congressmen.  </P> <P> Friel said the potential impact of the legislation is being exaggerated because  those people who now can't afford decoder boxes certainly couldn't afford new  TVs.  </P> <P> "We feel very strongly that we should try to help the hearing-impaired, but  raising the cost of all televisions sets is not the answer," said Cynthia  Upson, EIA's director of communications. "This is unprecedented legislation to  have this cost mandated to every television user. This country is based on  letting consumers have choices."  </P> <P> For the deaf community, "choice" is the central issue as well.  </P> <P> "This is not a mere luxury feature for deaf Americans," Larry Goldberg,  director of the Caption Center at PBS affiliate WGBH in Boston, said. "Right  now they have no options about how they can enjoy television.  </P> <P> "Captions are there, through at least 390 hours of broadcast, cable and home  videos each week," said Goldberg, whose nonprofit group is the second-largest  supplier of captioning services to network programs in the nation. "Television  manufacturers wouldn't think of making TVs that are, say, unable to receive  Channel 2 or Channel 4, and yet they feel comfortable manufacturing TVs that  are unable to receive . . . closed-captioning information."  </P> <P> Supporters of the legislation -- who include the National Parent Teachers  Assn., International Reading Assn., National Education Assn. and American Assn.  of Retired Persons -- foresee benefits from standardized closed-captioning  beyond its service to the deaf.  </P> <P> Sy DuBow, legal director of the National Assn. of the Deaf Legal Defense Fund,  points out that captioned programs can aid people trying to improve English  reading skills -- whether they are among the estimated 27 million adult  Americans with literacy problems, the millions of immigrants learning English  as a second language, or children learning to read.  </P> <P> "Studies have shown that closed captioning has improved literacy skills," DuBow  said. "It doesn't matter if you're 4 or 40: It can help."  </P></p>

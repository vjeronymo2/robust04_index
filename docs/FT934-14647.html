			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / US refuses to reopen Blair House deal on farm exports THE US yesterday moved strongly to distance itself from French pressure to reopen US-EC talks on subsidised farm exports, suggesting the matter was an internal European issue. In what appeared to be a mediation effort, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, outlined possible areas for compromise, although German officials denied reports from France that Chancellor Helmut Kohl would try personally to reconcile the two countries. Mr Rexrodt said it could prove fatal to hopes of a solution by mid-December for any side to raise obstacles at this late stage. His appeal was clearly directed as much at France, which has suggested that both agricultural trade and audiovisual services should be left out of the Gatt accord, as at the US. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, insisted that the US would neither reopen nor renegotiate the year-old Blair House agreement limiting Europe's subsidised farm exports. He was cool towards EC proposals for a special summit next week of trade ministers from the Quad group, which is made up of Canada, the EC, the US and Japan. A summit 'would only be useful if substantive progress is made in the meanwhile. Reiteration of statements would be counter-productive', he said. Mr Kantor drummed his point home by appearing with Mr Peter Cook, the Australian trade minister, who was also in Brussels representing the 14-nation Cairns Group of farm exporters. 'There are more countries involved in this negotiation than the Quad, or US-EC bilateral talks,' he said. Mr Kantor made an even more direct gesture in France's direction by accepting an invitation to dinner in Brussels last night with a French delegation headed by Mr Gerard Longuet, France's industry minister, and one of the few French ministers to have spoken out openly in favour of a successful Uruguay Round result by the end of the year. Discussions yesterday centred on steel and aircraft subsidies, where Mr Kantor said progress had been made, even though the US and the EC 'did not come to complete agreement'. But the US trade representative was emphatic that an EC offer on tariff cuts in manufactured goods, to be unveiled formally in Geneva at the beginning of next week, was unsatisfactory. He insisted that deeper tariff cuts on manufactured goods were needed for the EC's proposed Quad meeting. EC officials nevertheless remained optimistic that the Quad ministers would eventually agree to a meeting. Mr Rexrodt also called for concessions from the US on dismantling peak tariffs for textile imports, and firm pledges on market access for financial services and marine transport. In return, he said, Germany was ready to plead in Brussels for an extension of the EC's offer on market access in Europe. One EC spokesman said the US negotiators had not been expected to arrive in Brussels with any fresh initiatives. He said this was partly due to pressure on US trade negotiators to secure backing in Congress for the North American Free Trade Agreement. Blame game Page 7</p>

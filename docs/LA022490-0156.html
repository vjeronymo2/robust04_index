			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DEFICIT FORCED DENNARD OUT AT FULLERTON  </P> <P> Preston Dennard, who last week said he resigned his position as a Cal State  Fullerton assistant football coach, now says he did not resign but was  dismissed because of a staff cut caused by concerns over an athletic department  deficit.  </P> <P> Dennard, a former Ram receiver, coached at Fullerton for one season. He lost  his job when Coach Gene Murphy was told to reduce his staff to eight  assistants, one below the NCAA standard for Division I programs, Dennard and  other department sources said.  </P> <P> Dennard had the least seniority on Murphy's staff.  </P> <P> "I very much wanted to be there," said Dennard, who had said he resigned to  pursue other opportunities. "Technically, what happened was I was informed that  it was brought upon (Murphy's) shoulders to make a decision to remove one or  more persons from his staff to add to cutting the budget. . . . I love Murphy  dearly. It came down to business. I happened to be the last guy hired."  </P> <P> Murphy and Athletic Director Ed Carroll declined to comment.  </P> <P> The athletic department is operating with a deficit of $236,000, an athletic  department source said.  </P> <P> More cuts are likely in what Carroll said in a department memo will be "a  difficult spring" for the department, which operates 17 sports on a budget of  $4.37 million.  </P> <P> In addition to the current deficit, Fullerton must deal with the budgetary  implications of a recent study that showed that the university must allocate an  additional $145,000 to women's programs to come into compliance with Title IX,  the federal law that requires women's sports to be funded proportionally to  men's.  </P> <P> Dennard, 34, said he is pursuing work in the broadcasting field and possibly in  coaching.  </P> <P> "I was definitely enjoying coaching," he said. "I did not resign."  </P> <P> With Dennard's departure and the resignation of Ed Donatell, who is leaving to  become an assistant coach with the New York Jets, Murphy has seven assistants  on his staff.  </P></p>

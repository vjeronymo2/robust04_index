			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "froe/old.": "West German Consortium Takes Over </F> Veag and Lusatia Coal Fields"]    [Text] Bonn/Berlin -- The Trust Agency and energy supply  enterprises (EVU) in western Germany after more than two years  of negotiations reached agreement on the privatization of the  east German electricity enterprise VEAG AG and the Lusatia coal  fields. This was stated by Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt,  of the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] after the 20th  round of talks in the Chancellor's Office on the east German  economy in Bonn on Monday [28 February]. Thus, the way has been  paved for the investment of tens of billions of German marks  [DM]. Regarding the announcement that the French oil concern  Elf Aquitaine will partly withdraw from the large Leuna  refinery, Bonn insists on the fulfillment of the contract.    Both the Laubag brown coal enterprise and the VEAG  electricity enterprise will be taken over by a west German  consortium, which, apart from the major energy suppliers, RWE  [Rheinisch-Westfaelisches Elektrizitaetswerk], Bayernwerk,  Preussen Elektra, also includes various smaller electricity  companies, and, in the case of Laubag, the RWE subsidiary  Rheinbraun. Friedhelm Gieske, head of the RWE concern, said  that the price for Laubag was DM2.1 billion. In the year 2000,  Gieske expects a production of 50-55 million tonnes per year.  The current work force of 12,000 will, however, have to shrink  by another 4,000 by then.    According to board member Klaus Schucht, the sale of VEAG AG  will bring a cash value of DM8 billion into the Trust Agency  purse. In the new laender, the VEAG intends to boost the output  of the existing power plants by 4,000 megawatt (MW), while there  are plans for the construction of new brown coal-fired plants  with an output of 4,000 MW. In the eyes of Bayernwerk head Otto  Majewski, the participation in VEAG, which has been demanded by  laender such as Saxony and Brandenburg, is only a "fictitious  problem." The enterprises, however, are against a participation  in the capital, while Rexrodt did nor rule it out. Trust Agency  board member Schucht proposed a participation by the laender in  the board of supervisors or in advisory councils. Federal  Chancellor Helmut Kohl has urged a solution of the problem by  the end of March.    While the privatization of Laubag and VEAG should be  concluded by the middle of the year, the future of the large  Leuna refinery is still uncertain after Elf Aquitaine announced  that it would reduce its two-thirds share, to which it is bound  by a contract, to some 30-40 percent. The Federal Government,  however, strongly insists on fulfillment of the contract. Only  then could one talk about new industrial partners, Rexrodt said.  He could not imagine that Elf would resign from the contract it  concluded.    The news conference did, however, lay bare differences of  opinion between Rexrodt and Schucht. While the minister  regarded the resignation of Elf from the contract only as a  theoretical possibility, Schucht said that a withdrawal "would  not surprise us." Schucht said that the Trust agency would claim  some DM1.5 billion in damages.    Schucht is obviously planning to initiate negotiations with  British Petroleum to have a new investor in stock if Elf  Aquitaine really were to resign from the Leuna refinery project.  According to information received by SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, the  Trust Agency has already sent a letter to Elf pointing out that  the Berlin agency is not intending to make any further  concessions to the French.  <H5>  "Declaration of Divorce" </H5>   An insider from the Federal Government has described this  document as a "declaration of divorce." Whether British  Petroleum, which made an offer for the modernization of the  existing refinery in Leuna even during the tender procedure, is  still interested, is dubious. Originally, the new refinery was  to go into operation in the middle of 1996. Elf's partner, the  Thyssen Handelsunion AG, of Duesseldorf, will stick to the  contract, but, according to press reports, will not not increase  its stake for the time being.</p>

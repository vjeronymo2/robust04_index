			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Nestle Worry about brand values has battered the shares of consumer products companies. The once-dull Nestle, though, has emerged relatively unscathed. Its geographic and product spread underscores its defensive attractions. But the company has also been promoting its expansionist ambitions as it raises SFr1.2bn of fresh equity and seeks a New York listing. US investors appear especially attracted to Nestle, which contrasts with the seemingly secular decline of their own food manufacturers. Nestle still appears to retain considerable growth potential. Since 1985, Nestle has spent Dollars 10bn on acquisitions which have yet to bear full fruit. There may be scope for more. Philip Morris's determination to defend its home turf in US tobacco may mean European food assets become cheaper. Nestle's greatest volume growth is likely to come from developing markets. It is well-placed in foods in the Far East and South America. While European markets remain soft and US competition fierce Nestle seems likely to bask in the sunshine. Unilever's shares, which have flagged recently, may be better geared to recovery given its greater industrial interests.</p>

This is  demonstrated by the following:    1. GPS technology is being used to serve the nation's  economic and social development. In 1992, the State Bureau of  Surveying and Cartography, in cooperation with relevant  departments, completed outer operations surveying [wai ye guan  ce 1120 2814 6034 3261] work for the state's high-precision GPS  main control network [zhu kong zhi wang 0031 2235 0455 4986].  It is now organizing the testing of the state's high-precision  earth control network [da di kong zhi wang 1129 0966 2235 0455  4986]. Using GPS technology, it has established high-precision  urban control networks for Haikou, Xiamen, Nanning, and dozens  of other cities. Since the beginning of the Eighth Five-Year  Plan, it has used GPS standard [shui zhun 3055 0402] measuring  technology to precisely measure China's earth standard surface  [da di shui zhun mian 1129 0966 3055 0402 7240]. At the same  time, GPS is also being used in large and key engineering  projects to position and measure the deformation [xing bian 1748  6239] of engineering works. The technology was used to  establish a high-precision control network between Changjiang's  Three Gorges Dam site and the Gezhou Dam. Construction of a GPS  satellite tracking network is being accelerated.    2. Vigorous efforts are being made to disseminate GPS  technology. The State Bureau of Surveying and Cartography has  held a series of GPS training and study classes as well as  symposiums.    3. Software development and basic research have also been  carried out.</p>

			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY TO BUILD STATE'S 1ST GENETIC TESTING LABORATORY  </P> <P> The Orange County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously today to build what  will become the first genetic testing laboratory in California and the third in  the nation.  </P> <P> The DNA lab, providing sophisticated crime-fighting tools, will be built with  $120,000 from county funds and $80,000 raised from private sources. The lab, to  open by the end of the year, will initially operate out of the county coroner's  offices in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> The vote followed an emotional meeting earlier this month at which the board's  only woman member, Harriett M. Wieder, questioned her male colleagues' concern  for female rape victims because of their refusal to quickly pay for a "genetic  fingerprinting" lab. The latest push for the DNA lab followed the rape of a  12-year-old girl in the same Huntington Beach neighborhood where Wieder lives.  </P> <P> Board members praised Supervisor Don Roth for his request two weeks ago to find  ways to finance the genetic testing lab without dipping into the general fund.  </P> <P> "Victims of crimes will be spared from painful and repeated efforts to identify  violent criminals," Roth said. "And let the word go out into the criminal world  that Orange County will have the most modern crime-fighting tools in our  arsenal -- a DNA lab."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Hata's Minority Government Faces Rough </F> Sailing"]    [Text] The Hata government has been inaugurated at long  last. The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is not  participating in the new government, and therefore it is a  minority government. We cannot help but say that the road ahead  of the Hata government is rough.    Immediately following his talks with SDPJ Chairman Murayama,  which ended in failure, Prime Minister Hata formed his cabinet  without the SDPJ's participation. He must have thought that it  was essential to form the cabinet quickly, to avoid prolonging  the interregnum. We think it was inevitable that he would form  the cabinet in that way.    There are a number of immediate, difficult problems  confronting the Hata government, which already faces  difficulties in managing the political situation. We urge not  only Prime Minister Hata but also the new cabinet ministers to  come to grips with those problems, keeping in mind the situation  affecting Japan.    "Because the new government has to tackle important tasks  right away, I have given these people, including those of the  younger generation, cabinet portfolios because they are  competent in the affairs of the secretariats they will head,"  Hata said after naming his cabinet. The prime minister's  comment reflects his determination to navigate the violent seas  ahead with a cabinet that will take a practical approach in  settling the critical problems facing the nation.    The new cabinet clearly shows that Shinseito [Japan Renewal  Party], the core member of the coalition, will have a bigger say  in running the government. Although many analysts say that  Hata's minority government will likely be short-lived, Shinseito  members in the cabinet seem determined to serve Hata well in  running the government by drawing on their experience as former  members of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP].    The post of chief cabinet secretary has been given to  Shinseito member Hiroshi Kumagai, who served as minister of  international trade and industry in the Hosokawa cabinet. Thus,  Shinseito members are in the pivotal posts of prime minister and  chief government spokesman. Unlike the Hosokawa cabinet's  combination of a prime minister from the Japan New Party and  Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura from Sakigake [Harbinger], Hata  and Kumagai will be able to function more flexibly and swiftly  in making decisions when different viewpoints must be ironed  out. The Hata-Kumagai team should also be able to function well  in times of crisis management.  <H5>  Settle Urgent Issues Quickly </H5>   The top priority task given to the new cabinet is to pass  the  budget bill for fiscal year 1994. The bill must be adopted as  soon as possible.    Fortunately, the LDP and the SDPJ have made a commitment to  cooperate in seeking the swift passage of the budget bill. Both  the ruling and opposition camps should begin budget  deliberations without delay. The early passage of the bill is  indispensable to the government's efforts to get the  economy--which is showing signs of a recovery--back on track.    Along with the adoption of the budget bill, the government  is  required to urgently carry out a reform of the tax system and to  break the impasse in Japan's economic relations with the United  States.    The government has to conclude the issue of tax system  reform  by the end of June while making efforts to resume the Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks. To continue tax cuts into next year  and beyond in order to boost domestic spending and to cope with  the challenges of an aging society, the Hata cabinet must work  for indirect tax hikes accompanied by effective administrative  reform.    Promoting deregulation as part of economic reform is also  important. The appointment of the Hosokawa cabinet's finance  minister, Hirohisa Fujii, to the same post in the Hata cabinet  shows that the prime minister takes a serious view of the job of  revitalizing the economy by such means as expanding domestic  demand, tax reform, and deregulation.    Hata's decision to have Koshiro Ishida retain his post as  Management and Coordination Agency director general means a turn  to strong administrative reforms, which are crucial to the  success of deregulation. We have no objection to the Hata  cabinet assuming the economic and administrative reform lines  set by the Hosokawa cabinet. We hope that the new cabinet will  play a leading role in carrying out those reform while holding  the bureaucrats' resistance in check.    As for crisis management, Japan must keep its attention on  the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development  program. How Japan will maintain and strengthen its cooperative  relations with the United Nations as well as with the United  States and South Korea is now being tested.    Prime Minister Hata -- together with Foreign Minister  Kakizawa and Defense Agency Director General Kanda, who have  become cabinet members for the first time -- is required to  hasten to study possible measures that can deal with any  emergency situations in the future.    It is obvious that the political base of the Hata  administration is weak. Many in the political world anticipate  that the cabinet will most likely be forced either to resign en  masse or dissolve the House of Representatives and call a  general election shortly after the fiscal 1994 budget is passed,  thus creating a tense situation within the political arena again.  <H5>  LDP, SDPJ Must Act Responsibly </H5>   Meanwhile, the cooperative ties that are apparently being  forged between the LDP and the SDPJ are irresponsible. The  tieup is outrageous if it is aimed at toppling the Hata cabinet  and eventually nullifying the electoral reform plan--the  introduction of single-seat constituencies combined with  proportional representation--that was passed in January.    If the LDP were in power now, it would have to deal  responsibly, just as the Hata cabinet does, with such key issues  as tax reform, trade friction, and the North Korean problem. It  should be noted that a significantly large number of Liberal  Democrats are able to concur with the policies advocated by the  Hata administration on these questions.    Nevertheless, it seems that most LDP members, apparently  either in pursuit of partisan interests or animosity over being  driven out of power, have taken a futile confrontational  attitude toward the coalition government.    The LDP should rise above partisan politics and join hands  with the coalition and put the nation's interests first. Now is  not the time for ruling and opposition camps to be pitted  against each other over whether the cabinet should resign or  whether a snap general election should be staged.    In the SDPJ camp, there is also a group of legislators in  favor of the reform policies of the Hata cabinet which is  willing to find ways to cope realistically with impending issues  facing the country. Prime Minister Hata, under the  circumstances, should continue his efforts to muster all  political forces sharing a common will in order to create a  stable government.</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / New star rises for American Jews: Israel's US lobby is questioning its future role THE American Jewish lobby in Washington, bruised a year ago by a scathing attack from President George Bush over Israel's request for a big package of US loan guarantees, might be excused for celebrating this autumn. Not only is President Bush on the political ropes as he struggles against the odds to win re-election, but also Congress approved the 1993 US foreign aid bill last month, which included the full Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees originally requested by Israel. Grants to Israel of Dollars 3bn were the largest to any country, as in previous years. The real value of this has fallen, but as a proportion of all US foreign assistance it has risen sharply to some 30 per cent as the overall 'aid-cake' has shrunk. The consolidation of the aid followed the fall in June of the right-wing Israeli government of Mr Yitzhak Shamir, an event welcomed by many American Jews who supported his more conciliatory successor, Mr Yitzhak Rabin. Yet Israel's supporters in the US are not celebrating much. Instead, changing circumstances have raised the prospect that the US Jewish community's high-profile fund-raising and political lobbying for Israel may have peaked. The battle over the loan guarantees, in which US financial assistance to Israel was tied for the first time to political conditions, was a chastening experience for the Jewish lobby. But other factors have also raised questions about its future role. In August, Mr Rabin attacked the most prominent American Jewish lobbying organisation, saying it had damaged US-Israeli relations by its aggressive tactics. More subtly the traditional concentration on pro-Israel activity may have been undermined by the apparently receding threat to the Jewish state from its Arab neighbours and growing internal concerns within the US Jewish community about its own erosion by assimilation. There are literally dozens of pro-Israel groups operating in the US, where the 6.5m Jewish population is 2m more than that of Israel itself. 'It is probably the most highly organised ethnic community in the world,' says the director of one such group. The Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organisations has 48 member groups. Privately-raised funds for Israel, including Israel Bonds, total almost Dollars 2bn a year. The main lobbying group is the Washington-based American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or Aipac. With an annual budget of Dollars 17m, a staff of 140 and nine offices around the US, Aipac has developed into a powerful advocate of support for Israel, lobbying both congress and the administration. It was Aipac which was the main focus in September 1991 of an unprecedented attack by President Bush on the Jewish lobby for attempting to push the loan guarantees through congress in defiance of his insistence that they be delayed until after the Middle East peace conference in Madrid the following month. Aipac - and the 1,000 volunteers it had brought to Washington to lobby Congress members on the issue - was routed by the president. Congress quickly agreed to the delay. It was the biggest reverse for the Jewish lobby since President Reagan pushed through the sale of Awac early-warning airplanes to Saudi Arabia in 1983. The shock of the defeat was compounded when President Bush linked approval of the guarantees - intended to aid the absorption of mass immigration to Israel from the former Soviet Union - to his demand that Mr Shamir freeze Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. This brought to the surface longstanding disquiet among many American Jews over the commitment by Mr Shamir and his Likud party to eternal Israeli rule over the West Bank and Gaza and to expanded settlements. A poll of top American Jewish leaders showed 78 per cent in favour of a settlement freeze in exchange for the loan guarantees. 'The community was not divided about fighting for the loan guarantees - but people were dismayed and appalled at Shamir for giving greater priority to the settlements. People were mad primarily at Bush, but they were also mad at Shamir,' says Mr Thomas Smerling, director of Project Nishma, an American Jewish organisation that supports territorial concessions by Israel. Mr Rabin himself provided a further, unexpected jolt when he took Aipac to task during a visit to Washington. This partly reflected concern that Aipac had too willingly championed Likud positions. But it was more an expression of Mr Rabin's view that the US-Israel relationship is a government matter which can be upset by Aipac attempts to exert pressure through Congress. Aipac staffers - they decline to be quoted - insist they will continue to do business as usual. They see, if anything, a greater need to lobby for aid at a time when foreign aid programmes are coming under increasing political pressure in the US. But others say a deeper shift may be taking place within the American Jewish community. Now that Middle East peace talks are well under way and as Israel's economy matures, the urgency of protecting Israel against a perceived existential threat has been blunted. The Rabin government itself is looking to American Jews for business investment, rather than hand-outs and propaganda support - a message which Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister, conveyed last month to Israeli diplomats working in the US. In this climate, more domestic concerns could come to the fore. The greatest of these is assimilation and the long-term threat this poses to the Jewish community's strength. A study of the US Jewish population published last year showed that 52 per cent of those who married between 1985 and 1990 chose a non-Jewish spouse. 'American Jews are going to be seeking a new role for themselves under the Rabin government,' says Mr Harry Wall, the Anti-Defamation League's representative in Jerusalem. '(The growing concerns) are internal focal issues, not external threats, so it is quite possible to see a turning inward by American Jews.'</p>

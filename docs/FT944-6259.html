			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Their Budget): Marketing executive David Rist, 36. Marketing director of British Shoe Corporation, parent company of Hush Puppies, married with a small baby. He declines to say how much he earns but is 'comfortably affluent'. Politics: Voted Conservative the last couple of times but is not committed. Wanted: A neutral Budget: He said: 'Tax increases are simply not on the agenda.' Said yesterday: 'We are fairly satisfied. There are a few things in it to make people happier, and no major shocks. It seems to be pretty neutral. I'm very relieved there has been no hike in interest rates. As a retailer, we certainly welcome the transitional relief on business rates. I didn't expect any significant tax reductions. Public expenditure seems to be under control and the measures will hopefully instill a little bit of the feel-good factor.'</p>

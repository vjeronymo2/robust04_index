			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by State Duma Deputy Vladimir Zhirinovskiy under </F> the general heading "Homespun Socialism, Smelling of  Footcloths": "On the Role of Russia as Gatherer, and the Young  Wolves"]    [Text] For centuries Russia used to gather land. Opening  up new land, conquering it by war. I am not a professor of  history and I am not about to deliver a lecture on how Russia's  lands increased and which czar was more notable than others in  this matter. I am more interested in the motive for this  movement. At a recent banquet, a representative of the  Ukrainian "Rukh" explained it all, in my presence, in terms of  the Russians' genetic aggressiveness. That is what he thinks.  What I think is that the crux of the matter lies in the sense  of self-preservation of a great people. For this reason,  military-strategic questions have been in the forefront for  every emperor. First security, life -- and then all the rest.  And therefore -- push the borders back as far as possible,  build fortresses to greet the enemy on the distant approaches.  Best of all, rely on the sea, on maritime borders, and have as  few land borders as possible.    Russia had no alternative. Too much territory, too much  wealth. Too many people who were upset by that wealth. The  Tatar-Mongol yoke, the Turks, the French, the Germans, and all  the other dribs and drabs....    The red monarch Stalin was not born bloodthirsty. In the  late twenties he was the perplexed leader of a vast peasant  state with indigenous industry, and therefore with a poorly  armed army and an administrative apparatus disintegrating under  the influence of the NEP [new economic policy]. Stalin realized  that Russia has no right to be weak, otherwise it will get eaten  up, and that in order to have thousands of planes and tanks, you  need plants, plants, and more plants.... Plus roads and mines.  And all this in a matter of a few years. History did not allow  decades. There were no foreign credits, the treasury was empty  after the wars and troubles. What was to be done? And how  could you get the peasant to part with his yard and his cow and  go off to the city to push trolleys? Pay him millions? There  were no millions.... So he chose the simple and terrible path  for which, in human terms, he cannot be forgiven, the path of  Peter the Great, Catherine, Ivan the Terrible. But the other  scenario -- the plan of Hitler's Ostministerium -- also  envisaged nothing cheerful for Russia in the event of its defeat.    We now have the same situation that Stalin had in the late  twenties. Economic collapse, an empty treasury, the loss of the  outlying lands. But we do not need savage repression, we are  not in a hurry as Stalin was, because we do not fear foreign  enemies as Stalin did. We have nuclear missiles and other kinds  of all-out weapons. We are much calmer today than then. We do  not now need to hold on to certain territories for  military-strategic purposes, we do not need to keep tens of  millions of breadwinners under arms. The army today is first  and foremost sophisticated technical facilities and up-to-date  infrastructure. And of course it is a pity to leave Europe and  the Baltic -- after all, we used to keep the very best things  there (once again, by old habit, we were thinking in terms of  striking at the enemy on the distant approaches). Airfields,  bases, depots -- all this cost billions. Because of this we got  paid 200 rubles all our lives and were packed into communal  apartments. But in politics, lamenting what is past or passing  is a waste of time. You have to think about the present and  future.    It is a total paradox that the present situation offers the  unexpected prospect of a fourth and fifth push [brosok]. If in  August 1991 the Communist Party -- the backbone of the system --  collapsed, in December 1991 the artificial construct of the  state of "equal republics" fell apart, and in October 1993 the  soviets were smashed, in the near future two more decisive blows  must be struck while the autocratic power still has the  initiative: It is necessary to "close down" the autonomous  republics, oblasts, etc., and immediately to bring back  guberniyas, headed by governors. With no debate about it.  Quickly and firmly, under an appropriate edict, bring those  sovereign presidents who are reluctant to become governors to  dachas outside Moscow for a "little chat." Let them take a  rest, eat plenty of sour cream, watch television, only do not  let them leave the grounds of the dacha...for their own safety.  When they come out in a couple of years, it will be another  country. And without a single drop of blood spilled.    And the names of the guberniyas would be strictly on  territorial principles -- for instance, Kazan Guberniya, not the  Tatar Guberniya. Because if one nationality is incorporated in  the name, the other nationalities are, so to speak, guests,  living from day to day.    The restoration of the guberniyas within Russia's borders as  of January 1992 is the fourth blow. This blow must be struck  quickly, and the Federation Council should be called the Senate  or something like that, and forget about that federation as if  it was just a bad dream.    After the fourth blow, the fifth. The "former" republics  rejoin Russia as guberniyas -- Nikolayev, Odessa, Minsk,  Alma-Ata [Almaty], Bukhara guberniyas.... Once again this must  be done quickly and sharply, against a background of sharp  destabilization of the situation in the "near-abroad" (I cannot  avoid using this idiotic term) and the use of propaganda on a  massive scale, since television broadcasting is in Moscow's  hands. At the moment the initiative is in Moscow's hands too,  and we must not delay or waste time talking. The best memorial  to those who died at the White House is not shoot-outs, but the  re-creation of a great state, an empire, on the 1900 model. I  know I will be accused of nationalism and extremism again. As  usual. As it was two and a half years ago, when I ran in the  presidential election with the slogan "I will defend Russians  and the small peoples." At that time they called me a  chauvinist. But now even Kozyrev is defending (only verbally,  as yet) the Russians in the Baltic region. Where now are the  Democratic Russia supporters with their panhuman values? Where  now is the Democratic Russia appeal to the regions to "take as  much sovereignty as you can carry"? It is embarrassing even to  mention it now. And that inappropriate conversion, which I  always criticized. And the cleansing of Moscow and other  Russian cities of criminal southerners? Whose idea, in a  watered-down form, has Mayor Luzhkov begun to implement? Gleb  Yakunin's, Lev Ponomarev's? Galina Starovoytova's -- the deputy  from Armenia? Who was the first in the entire country to start  talking about guberniyas and the pernicious nature of the  Sakharov draft constitution, whereby dozens of appanage  principalities would appear in Russia? At that time the  Democratic Russia supporters idolized Sakharov, now they keep  quiet. They have realized that Sakharov's ideas are the way to  wall-to-wall local wars. And people will remind me about the  vodka, too. I was not only talking about cheap vodka, but about  vodka and tobacco as exclusively state revenue. No imports of  tobacco or alcohol, production only at state plants under state  medical control, for sale exclusively at state stores and at  firm (I emphasize, firm) prices. Low prices, so as to stop the  manufacture of hooch. Only a fool or a CIA agent could give  away the state's revenue from alcohol and cigarettes to  foreigners who supply all kinds of muck in pretty bottles and  packs. And then that fool or agent comes crying to us that  there is no money for doctors' wages, for long-term investments,  for road building. True, there is not. You yourself gave that  revenue away. Tobacco, vodka, sugar, and wool should be managed  exclusively by the state. It is the state's money, treasury  money. Plus the railroads. They are also sacred, the state's.  That is what I was talking about. Yet they made me into the  "great friend of alcoholics" (although alcoholics are part of  our society too).    Shall we in any case define what kind of society we are  creating? Will there be rich people in that society?  Certainly. Will we have a redistribution every five years, take  various things away from people? No. We are not a proletarian  party. Will we recognize private initiative and private  ownership? Yes, of course. Will we let pensioners or children  with no parents die of starvation? Never. A grant, a roof over  their head, a medical examination, free bread and free milk  should be found for the most unfortunate. That is socialism.  But we will have our own brand of socialism, not Swedish and  not Belgian, but our own, national, homespun, hempen socialism,  laced with communal, corporative psychology and smelling of  footcloths. With a big role for the state and civil servants.  Gaydar wants to build a small -- compact, as he puts it --  state. How can that be? We have to build roads, feed the  North, maintain a big army and security, develop new  technologies and fundamental science. Who will provide the  money for this? The young wolves. Those who, when the Law on  Cooperatives came out, rolled up their pants and ran off after  money and the chance to establish themselves. Those who took  their computers everywhere, and then "made their way up" on  nonferrous metals and foreign junk. I am like them myself. At  the dawn of perestroyka I started my own thing -- in politics,  whereas they did it in business. I traveled that path from the  bottom -- from little groups huddled in dubious apartments, to  victory in the parliamentary elections in Russia. They went  from a small cooperative or currency speculation to reputable  firms. I will help these boys. I will not stifle them with  taxes. I will allow them to have weapons to ward off the  gangsters. I will make the state protect them, and, most  important, I will give them serious business -- not spirits or  vodka or chocolate, but the exploitation of large mineral  deposits and the construction of large plants. Chubays'  distribution of property to his own will be stopped. It will  all be honest and simple. If you have the money, go buy a plant  or a hotel, if you don't have the money, save up. And  everything openly, by auction. And every day a report showing  how much money the budget has received from privatization. Can  you imagine what sums the sale of facilities like the VDNKh  [Exhibition of National Economic Achievements] or the Kosmos  Hotel in Moscow could yield? Trillions. Where are those  trillions? In Chubays' dacha?    It is time military industry was privatized. And the young  wolves given a share. And then they will understand why we need  a new aircraft carrier or combat helicopter. And they will stop  worrying about customs dues on "Rasputin" vodka. Foreign policy  must also serve the young wolves. Take the case of Georgia.  What we should have done was to take away Abkhazia (at the  Abkhaz' request, naturally, and under a treaty with Georgia  itself, which will agree to anything just now) and settle  Russian entrepreneurs, officers, and those Vorkuta miners on the  coast, give them each a hectare of land, and let them build  houses, swim in the sea, and eat oranges. The Abkhaz would have  been very pleased. They would know: Since there are Russians  here, the people from Tbilisi will not poke their noses in (or  if they do, we will show them). Yet instead of these heavenly  places, we are cramming our boys into godforsaken corners of  Russia.    In general, the bureaucratic, red-tape mechanism of access  to  resources (from the leasing of nonresidential premises to the  exploitation of natural reserves) must be smashed. Only open  auctions, dealing not with individual facilities, but everything  -- real estate in cities, enterprises' fixed assets, monetary  and natural resources. Central Bank credits -- also by auction.  No special-purpose credits. If all this is done, lease  payments will immediately become many times cheaper and the  interest rate on credits will fall. If the Central Bank rate  falls to 30-40 percent, there will be long-term investments,  which we need. The only downside is that the bureaucrats will  lose their bribes. Well, they can go to hell.    The structural policy must consist of identifying areas of  production that are competitive on the world market  (petrochemicals, the gas industry, the aerospace sector,  weapons, etc.) and investing sufficient resources there. In  these "special zones" there should be a concessionary tax  regime. Elsewhere we will tighten up, but here we will give as  much as necessary. The government must compile a list of  200-300 priority facilities for investment on the basis of  existing production units. And the money must be given not  directly, but through stable commercial banks and structures  which can subsequently be held accountable for the money.    The problem of overcoming the production recession is a  problem of the population's effective demand. The rich alone  will not create demand for Russian industry -- they prefer  imports. But the collapse of the consumer market could be  halted by creating a system of consumer credit, indexation of  the population's Savings Bank investments, and special-purpose  bonds. During the election campaign, when I proposed  compensation for losses resulting from price liberalization and  the indexation of savings, all the "democratic" newspapers  started laying into me, accusing me of wild schemes and  demagoguery. But why, I ask you, is it not possible to  index-link savings by issuing people with bonds -- state loan  certificates with a term of 5-10 years (at 20-30 percent annual  interest) -- and creating a system of depositing these bonds in  commercial banks in order to obtain consumer credit. That would  not lead to additional monetary emission, it would only change  the structure of existing credit investments. But, I will be  frank, the wisest economic plans will collapse when there is no  elementary order, when instead of hard work people can steal  with impunity, when there is no authority, when bribery controls  everything. Therefore I will start from scratch. I will ask  20-year-old Akhmet, who is driving around Moscow in a Mercedes  600, what he actually does day after day. I will soon fire the  militiaman who, peering at a deputy's card, states baldly: "The  Duma is not my boss." And when billions are stolen by means of  banking manipulations, I will simply have people shot. Civil  servants must get on with their work for the set time -- from  nine to six. Janitors must sweep the streets. The trains must  run on time. Doorway lamps must work. It is elementary. If it  does not happen, someone will answer to me for it with his head.  Here I will act not like an economic theorist, but like a  pragmatic Russian.    And as a pragmatic Russian, I would not allow the  newspapers,  while the president is alive, seriously to discuss possible ways  of removing him and to "select" his replacements. Those  newspapers would quickly be discovered to have unpaid telephone  bills amounting to a couple of million dollars, and their  telephones would be cut off for nonpayment. And then there  would be a fine of 100 million rubles for using the kettles.  And maybe as a result people would realize that it is unseemly,  while daddy is present, to share out his legacy.    By the way, about daddy. His friends and colleagues are  already quietly discounting him. Hints to the same effect are  coming from the west, he has played his part, they say, look for  a new one. They even sent the Government Inspector -- grandpa  Nixon. I will tell you, as a pragmatic Russian -- they are  writing Yeltsin off too soon. Boris Nikolayevich is an  absolutely mystical figure. They have buried him -- politically  and physically -- dozens of times. And dozens of times he has  risen from the dead. He did not drown in the river on Nikolina  Gora, or get smashed up in a plane, or die in an air crash. He  won two putsches and outwitted and outplayed Gorbachev. Look  what a party he smashed! He is just like a hero from a Russian  folk tale. Did any of those who were present at the Central  Committee plenum in 1987 and who wanted Yeltsin, ever think that  they were looking at a future president? Yeltsin conducts  politics not by Friedman's schemes, but by intuition. And that  is why you cannot stop him by logic. Like me. We are both  mystics. By the laws of logic, I also could not have won the  parliamentary elections or come third in 1991. Therefore, among  the candidates for the new presidency, Yeltsin is my most  threatening rival. The others are village teachers and little  boys from the capital's special schools.    If Yeltsin, to whom it fell to make the first three pushes,  also makes the fourth and the fifth, his chances will increase  immeasurably. He will become the czar-father. Let me remind  you: The fourth push is the revival of guberniyas within  Russia's present borders. The fifth is the restoration of  Russia within the USSR's borders on the guberniya principle,  without republics as intermediaries. And then it is not far to  the sixth push -- to the south, to the Indian Ocean. But that  one is my chance, my mission.</p>

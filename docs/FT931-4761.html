			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Italian premier retreats on corruption decree MR GIULIANO AMATO, the Italian prime minister, yesterday withdrew plans to deal leniently with those implicated in the country's widening corruption scandals, staving off the immediate threat of a government crisis. Share prices fell in Milan and the Bank of Italy was forced to intervene to support the lira during a tense day which began with the arrests of two more leading industrialists and was rife with rumours that Mr Amato was preparing to resign. A degree of calm later returned to the markets when the cabinet decided to beat a humiliating retreat over its controversial plan to bring a 'political' solution to corruption scandals in which more than 1,000 politicians, businessmen and government officials have been implicated. Before the decision, spokesmen for the two main partners in the fragile four-party coalition, the Christian Democrats and Socialists, ruled out any change of government and stressed their confidence in Mr Amato. The prime minister himself had earlier met President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who also rejected the idea of Mr Amato resigning. Christian Democrat and Socialist leaders stressed the danger of bringing down the government, with the almost inevitable consequence of early elections. Even the majority of opposition parties, though baying for the government's blood, admitted they did not want elections before new laws are introduced to modernise the system of proportional representation. The climate of uncertainty was fuelled by news that Mr Gabriele Cagliari, president of Eni, the state oil concern, had been arrested. Mr Cagliari, head of Eni since 1989, was reported to have offered his resignation last night. He was arrested with Mr Franco Ciatti, the president of Nuovo Pignone, Eni's turbines subsidiary, on charges of alleged corruption relating to power industry contracts. The government's problems stemmed from a decision on Friday to introduce a decree laying down new rules for controlling the financing of political parties. Illicit funding of the parties through kickbacks on contracts has emerged as the central element in the corruption scandals. With the apparent backing of his four coalition partners, Mr Amato and Mr Giovanni Conso, the new justice minister, decided to make illicit financing of the parties no longer a criminal offence, and make the change retroactive. Instead, it was to be treated as an administrative offence, punished by fines, and judged by a government-appointed prefect. Faced with an unexpected wave of popular protest, hostility from the magistrates and vehement criticism from opposition parties, Mr Scalfaro refused to sign the decree. He argued the timescale of the decree, which had to be approved in its entirety or rejected within 60 days, conflicted with the referendum on April 18 seeking to abolish public financing of political parties. The government yesterday accepted the president's arguments and went further. The cabinet agreed to submit altered proposals for discussion as a law in parliament and accepted the principle that illicit financing was a criminal matter. This keeps the matter within the control of the judiciary and answers the main criticism of the magistrates involved in corruption cases - namely that the previous decree would offer an easy exit for those implicated and would effectively remove the bulk of the political corruption investigations from their control.

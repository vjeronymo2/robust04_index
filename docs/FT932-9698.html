			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Unigate surprise The surprise decision by Unigate to postpone the flotation of its US restaurant business, which was announced only last month, hit sentiment in the shares. The company had hoped to raise up to Dollars 250m through the float, valuing each share at between Dollars 15 and Dollars 17. However, market sources suggested that although the pre-placing had taken place at the upper range price, US institutional investors had baulked at this and offered only Dollars 14 a share. Unigate blamed poor weather conditions affecting sales for the postponement. Food manufacturing analysts said another factor had been that a number of poorly received small flotations in recent months in the US had soured investor sentiment. While Unigate said it intended to 'complete an IPO of the business at an appropriate time', rumours in the market suggested Unigate might opt for a trade sale, with PepsiCo tipped as a likely candidate. Unigate fell 12 to 353p. NatWest Securities moved the stock from long term outperform to neutral.</p>

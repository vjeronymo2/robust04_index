			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD VISION SUES TV STATION, CATHOLIC AGENCY  </P> <P> Stung by separate incidents of criticism regarding their financial practices,  the British and Irish branches of World Vision are taking a British TV network  and the Irish Catholic Relief Agency to court.  </P> <P> Both incidents, officials of World Vision contend, have undermined the major  fund-raising effort of the group, which centers on a 24-hour Lenten fast for  famine-struck people of the Third World.  </P> <P> The fast, expected to raise as much as $4.25 million in Britain and $474,000 in  Ireland, is "the biggest fund-raising event" of the year, according to Phil  Malone, the press officer for World Vision of Britain.  </P> <P> World Vision of Britain filed a libel action in a London court April 2 against  Channel 4 and the makers of the TV program "Dispatches," a March 28 documentary  which accused the charity of spending more money for overhead and proselytizing  than for relief.  </P> <P> In papers issued April 6, "Trocaire," the Irish Catholic bishops' relief arm,  is asked to "rescind allegations" made about the "high overhead and  proselytizing practices" of World Vision of Ireland, said Thora Mackey, a  spokesperson for the evangelical humanitarian aid organization.  </P> <P> World Vision describes itself "as a leading Christian relief and development  agency operating in 80 countries. It is non-denominational and has no political  affiliation."  </P> <P> The legal action was taken after the 24-hour fast in Ireland lost a number of  sponsors in the wake of the Trocaire criticisms and the Channel 4 documentary,  according to accounts in the Irish press.  </P> <P> "An awful lot of people have pulled out," Ingrid Knapp, director of the Irish  World Vision body, told the Irish Times.  </P> <P> The legal action was taken "to protect World Vision Ireland's reputation and  good name," according to an April 4 release by Knapp.  </P> <P> "We have asked them twice to rescind those allegations. As they haven't, we are  forced to take this legal action," Mackey said. "We don't like doing this, but  we are left with no alternative. It's interfering with our fund raising and  work in the field."  </P> <P> Brian McKeown, the director of Trocaire, sent a letter to all Irish bishops  urging them to inform their people that World Vision uses funds raised in  Ireland to try to turn Catholics in the Third World from their faith.  </P> <P> The "fundamentalist aims" of World Vision and the Catholic Church are in  conflict, the letter contends. Reports in the Irish press say Trocaire  officials accused the charity of timing its fund-raising campaign to cut into  Trocaire's own Lenten campaign and gearing it to Catholic youth.  </P> <P> Trocaire is "especially concerned that World Vision is actively seeking the  cooperation of Catholic schools, which are by nature and tradition supporters  of the church's Lenten campaign," according to a Trocaire spokesman. Especially  upsetting to the Catholic charity, according to Irish press reports, was that  "World Vision was approaching Catholic schools without revealing its  evangelical and fundamentalist origins."  </P> <P> On the other hand, World Vision leaders were upset because Trocaire's letter  was "beautifully timed" to coincide with World Vision's fast, according to  press reports.  </P> <P> A segment of the Dispatches TV series titled "In the Name of Hunger" was  broadcast March 28 and claimed that less than half the money collected by the  worldwide evangelical relief organization reached its charitable goal in the  developing world.  </P> <P> "World Vision of Britain made the decision to take legal action with deep  regret. However, the results of the program could be seriously detrimental for  World Vision's projects in the Third World," Malone said in a statement  released April 2.  </P> <P> The fund-raising fast has been held in Britain for five years, "and during that  time we have built up a great deal of loyalty amongst our supporters. This year  an estimated 220,000 people had pledged to take part, of whom 80 percent were  teen-agers. We do not know what will happen," said the executive.  </P> <P> John Swenson, the deputy executive director of Catholic Relief Services in the  United States, said he was not aware of the legal action taken against  Trocaire. He described relations between the U.S. bishops' relief arm and World  Vision U.S. as "cordial."  </P></p>

The State agency shall update the standards annually and submit revised amounts to FCS for approval. State agencies shall submit methodologies used in developing and updating standards to FCS for review every 3 years, when there is a change in the methodology, and upon a request from FCS. State agencies may use a heating or cooling standard, a combined standard, and individual standards. However, they shall not allow households the use of two standards that include the same expense. The State agency may elect to use seasonal standards that include heating or cooling costs or an annual standard that does not have to be adjusted seasonally. The State agency may vary the allowance by factors such as household size or geographical area. Only utility costs identified in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this section shall be used in developing standards. The State agency shall not use a reduced standard for households that receive assistance under the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act (LIHEAA) of 1981. Households shall be allowed to use standards that include heating or cooling costs in accordance with paragraphs (d)(6)(ii), (d)(6)(iii) and (d)(6)(iv) of this section. Households whose only utility expense is for a telephone are entitled to only the separate telephone standard if one has been developed by the State agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

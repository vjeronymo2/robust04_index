			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (h) Property acquired, possessed, or transported unlawfully or in violation of local law or competent regulations or directives. This includes loss or damage to vehicles not properly registered or insured in compliance with local law or competent regulations or directives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Loss of money in any amount during shipment or storage with baggage or household goods. This includes coin collections. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) Property stored at a commercial facility for the convenience of the claimant and at his or her expense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) Substantial fraud. The head of an area claims office may completely deny a claim that he determines to be substantially tainted by fraud.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (l) Not a proper claimant. See &sect;&sect;536.164 and 536.165(a)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.167 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Time prescribed for filing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) No claim may be paid under this subpart unless it is presented in writing within 2 years after it accrues. A claim is presented when it is received at a U.S. military establishment, not when it enters the mails. For purposes of this chapter, a claim accrues at the time of the incident causing the loss or damage, or at such time as the loss or damage is or should have been discovered by the claimant through the exercise of due diligence. In the case of multiple deliveries on the same Government Bill of Lading, the claim accrues for those later received items when they are delivered. The claim filed for the initial damage will be amended to reflect the subsequently claimed items. If personal property remains in storage after the expiration date of legal entitlement to storage at Governmental expense, a claim normally accrues on such expiration date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) If a claim accrues in time of war or armed conflict in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the Armed Forces of the United States are engaged, or if such a war or armed conflict intervenes within 2 years after the claim accrues, and if good cause is shown, then the claim may be presented not later than 2 years after the war or armed conflict is terminated. A claims office may telephonically obtain the authority to grant additional time to file a claim, from the Chief, Personnel Claims and Recovery Division. If good cause for delay in filing is not established, the intervention of war or armed conflict, in itself, will not permit payment of a claim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presented later than 2 years after accrual. Pursuant to the provisions of Public Law 96&hyph;446 (94 Stat 1967), periods of captivity are excluded in computing the 2-year statute of limitations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) If a proper party claimant is notified that his or her personal property in non-temporary storage has sustained partial damage, the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the claimant has an opportunity to ascertain the extent of the loss, or the claimant's entitlement to Government shipment or storage expires, whichever occurs sooner. However, the claimant is expected to exercise due diligence in attempting to ascertain the extent of the loss. Moreover, when a proper party claimant is notified that his or her personal property in non-temporary storage at government expense has sustained complete destruction or loss, the statute of limitations begins to run when this notification is received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

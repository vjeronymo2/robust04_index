			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: Bid paves way for Danish solution - Hilary Barnes and Richard Lapper assess Baltica's plan for survival BALTICA'S bid to buy the insurance and banking operations of Hafnia, its biggest domestic rival, could come to an ironic conclusion. After all, it was Hafnia's efforts to acquire Baltica which contributed significantly to the industry's crisis in Scandinavia. Baltica's move also paves the way for a 'Danish solution', in which Den Danske Bank, Denmark's biggest bank, and other local institutional investors could play a crucial role. Baltica and Hafnia became locked in a bitter struggle in 1990, when Hafnia acquired just over 33 per cent of the shares in Baltica Holding, a blocking minority enabling Hafnia to veto decisions by Baltica's shareholders. Although it was unable to persuade Baltica to join forces with it, Hafnia's acquisition weakened its rival. Hafnia's stranglehold forced Baltica to rely on bank debt rather than new equity capital to finance the DKr4bn acquisition of the former state-controlled life insurance company, Statsanstalten, in 1990, for example. Losses at Baltica's banking subsidiary added to the group's difficulties. Cash-flow problems became acute when property investments in Denmark and Gibraltar went wrong. Meanwhile, Hafnia's own problems mounted when it joined forces with UNI Storebrand, the Norwegian insurer, to launch a raid on Scandinavia's biggest insurer, Skandia. Between them, UNI and Hafnia acquired a 42 per cent stake in the Swedish company, causing uncertainty on local stock markets which hit the market value of the shareholdings and left both companies with heavy investment losses. Hafnia, which owns 14.8 per cent of Skandia, suspended payments to its creditors last August and since then has been seeking to sell off its insurance and banking operations. A stop-gap solution to Baltica's problems was arranged last October, when Den Danske Bank bought 32 per cent of the shares in Baltica Insurance to provide liquidity to Baltica. As these problems came to a head again last week, the sale of Baltica's insurance business to Codan, the Danish insurance company, in which the UK's Sun Alliance holds a 70 per cent stake, was also considered. Mr Nils Wilhjelm, chairman, said that this alternative was not as satisfactory for Baltica Holding as the arrangement *something in here (HP) * that has now been made. Yesterday's events also underlined the role of Den Danske Bank in the Danish financial world. As well as its shareholding in Baltica, Den Danske is owed around DKr600m by Hafnia and is one of the group's biggest creditors. Mr Knud Sorensen, its chief executive, says that Danske does not wish to remain a large shareholder in Baltica in the longer term. Even so, the bank could be one of the main beneficiaries of a deal between Baltica and Hafnia, and appears to have played a crucial role in negotiating yesterday's measures. 'Danske has been trying to organise a Danish solution,' said Mr Mark Cathcart, European insurance analyst with Fox Pitt Kelton in London. 'Danske is in the driving seat.' The likelihood of a Danish solution was welcomed by the government yesterday. Mr Mogens Lykketoft, the finance minister, said that it was satisfactory that the financial institutions had been able to solve the problems themselves without involving the government. 'We have avoided a situation like that in Norway and Sweden, where the state has had to support loss-making banks and insurance companies,' Mr Lykketoft said. However, market reactions were uncertain. There was little trading in Baltica Insurance, an illiquid share, which however put on DKr40 to close at DKr1,150. Analysts said that the complexity of the arrangements has left them uncertain how to price Baltica Insurance. Danske's share price fell by DKr12 to DKr304.</p>

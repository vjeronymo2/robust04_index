			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MOLINA HOLDS OFF NEW WAVE  </P> <P> Despite the ever-increasing presence of younger and better-trained athletes,  29-year-old Scott Molina, one of the grand-daddies of triathlon, made it known  Sunday that he is not yet ready to yield.  </P> <P> Molina -- who, as one of the sport's "Big Four," has been a dominant factor  since 1982 -- won his fourth San Diego Bud Light Triathlon in 1 hour 49 minutes  2 seconds.  </P> <P> But while Molina proved that at least one of triathlon's pioneers can still be  a force, the other story was the emergence of two newcomers.  </P> <P> One, Andrew Carlson, made the San Diego Triathlon his first as a pro. And he  didn't waste any time making his mark, surprising even the public address  announcer by finishing second. As Carlson finished in 1:49:16, just 14 seconds  behind Molina, the announcer roared, "I don't even know who this guy is, and I  know all the top runners."  </P> <P> For the record, Carlson is a 22-year-old valet at the Ritz-Carlton in Laguna  Beach, who is planning a move to Del Mar this week.  </P> <P> In third (1:49:46) was Miles Stewart of Surfers Paradise, Australia. At 18, he  figures to be a factor for years to come.  </P> <P> Pre-race favorite and defending champion Mike Pigg decided at the last minute  to pull out in an effort to prepare for the Ironman in October.  </P> <P> Another non-factor was Scott Tinley, a Del Mar resident and two-time champion.  Tinley entered, but dropped back soon after the start of the bike phase.  </P> <P> The favorite in the women's race also failed to show; the absence of Paula  Newby-Fraser went unexplained. Sylviane Puntous ran away for a victory in  2:02:10. Colleen Cannon was 30 seconds behind in second and Patricia Puntous,  Sylviane's identical twin, was third in 2:04:00.  </P> <P> It was the fourth time this year that Sylviane and Cannon have finished one-two  in a United States Triathlon Series race.  </P> <P> While the top three women finishers were laughing and talking about old times  afterward, the top three men were just trying to get to know one another.  </P> <P> That process actually started earlier, at least for Molina and Carlson, toward  the end of the finishing 10-kilometer run.  </P> <P> At the foot of the last hill, Molina decided to test his surprise opponent.  </P> <P> "I didn't know how well Andrew could run," said Molina, of Boulder, Colo. "So I  decided to go all out and see what happens."  </P> <P> What Molina found was simply that he had more left as he opened a small lead.  </P> <P> The victory was anything but old hat to Molina, a four-time winner of the USTS  National Championship.  </P> <P> "It's just so hard to win because there are so many good guys now," Molina  said. "Winning means a lot more now, I think."  </P> <P> The leader after the 1.5-kilometer ocean swim was Garrett McCarthy, and the  leader after the 40-kilometer bike ride was Encinitas' Mark Montgomery. Neither  finished in the top 10.  </P> <P> Carlson came out of the water in second at 18:35 to McCarthy's 18:32. Stewart  and Molina were right behind Carlson at 18:37 and 18:38.  </P> <P> Stewart was considered the best cycler and was expected to pull away in that  phase. But he instead found himself among a pack of eight jousting for the lead  throughout.  </P> <P> When the riders reached the transition area, Stewart was fourth, seven seconds  ahead of Molina and 11 ahead of Carlson.  </P> <P> So it came down to the run.  </P> <P> "(Midway through), Andrew looked pretty confident and I knew Miles was right  behind, so it was going to go down to the end," Molina said.  </P> <P> It went down, in fact, to that last hill, where Molina's test proved too much  for the rookie.  </P></p>

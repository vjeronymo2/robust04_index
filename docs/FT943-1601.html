			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Property in London's West End (3): Confidence stirs - New Development Options Development proposals are being dusted off as land owners and investors consider whether the time is right to resurrect plans for some of the biggest office projects undertaken in the capital, writes Andrew Taylor. Two of the biggest projects are in Paddington, designated by Westminster City Council in 1982 for large scale office development and where rival development groups are proposing to develop up to 3m sq ft of new office space. Funding institutions, however, remain very nervous after their experiences during the early 1990s when rents and capital values fell sharply. Major schemes, therefore, are unlikely to proceed unless they are pre-let. Planning hurdles also may have still to be overcome as developers seek to turn outline planning approval into detailed consents for their proposals. Some of these construction projects have been around for many years and it could be some time before concrete starts to be poured. Nonetheless the outlook for development has begun to brighten. The balance between supply and demand, at least for new properties, is again favouring the developer. This week, for example, Mr Elliott Bernerd's Chelsfield group announced plans to start work on 120,000 sq ft of office space at Wool House, St James's after selling a 50 per cent stake in the project to AMP Asset management for Pounds 20.5m. City University Business School, which has studied the findings of 10 of the largest commercial agents and chartered surveyors in the capital says: 'There remains significantly less than one year's supply of new accommodation available and, for large occupiers seeking in excess of 100,000 sq ft, there are no new buildings currently available.' As a result, rents for modern high quality accommodation are beginning to rise as the property market comes out of recession. The shortage of new space, described by City University as 'acute', compares with a general oversupply of empty secondary space, much of it poor quality, of 8m sq ft. The take-up by tenants is expected to be about about 3.5m sq ft this year, according to agents Jones Lang Wootton, indicating that there is at least two years supply of ready built accommodation. The extent of this over supply will prevent rent from rising too quickly. Westminster council's long standing policy of maintaining a strong residential community alongside office and retail schemes traditionally has restricted the pace of commercial development. More recently it has required developments involving increased office space to provide equivalent residential space. The council's housing policies are now being investigated by the District Auditor and a retired former County Planning Officer for Shropshire following the votes for homes scandal operated under Westminster's right to buy scheme. The inquiry, however, is not expected to undermine the general thrust of the council's housing policy or threaten outline planning permissions granted for some of the large proposed schemes in Paddington where Westminster is seeking to direct commercial development under its urban renewal policies. It has been aided by the start of construction of the Pounds 300m Heathrow to Paddington rail link designed to provide fast direct rail access to the airport as well as coping with increased passenger numbers if the proposed fifth terminal at Heathrow goes ahead. Beneficiaries could be two of the largest schemes to be undertaken in central London since the massive Broadgate and Ludgate office developments undertaken by the Stanhope/Rosehaugh joint venture. Rosehaugh subsequently went into receivership while Stanhope is still wrestling with its large borrowings. The main Paddington schemes are: Bishopsbridge: a 1.4m sq ft office development with retail and residential elements proposed by Grainhurst, a consortium representing Regalian property development group and the National Freight Consortium. The site is the the former Bishops Bridge railway goods yard. Paddington Basin: a joint development proposed by Trafalgar House, the UK construction, property, shippings and hotels group, and British Waterways. The scheme is to provide up to 1.5m sq ft of offices as well as retail and residential accommodation. Both schemes seem likely to require a significant amount of pre-lets before financing institutions will agree to fund construction. Funds will also need to be convinced that there is the prospect for sufficient rental growth to justify such large investments. Prospective tenants, given the oversupply in the West End may be prepared to look elsewhere rather than bid up rents, notwithstanding the shortage of new space. This initially may lead to a growth in refurbishment rather than new development. Companies are not so long out of recession that they will be prepared to accept a sharp rise in property costs. There is plenty of choice of empty buildings if prospective tenants look further afield. The City of London and the capital's former docklands areas may not have the glamour of a Mayfair or St James's address but might be regarded as preferable to a Paddington address if rents start to appear uncompetitive. The Paddington/Heathrow link promising a 17 minute journey from central London to Europe's biggest airport is an important attraction but may not be enough on its own. The construction of CrossRail, a Pounds 2bn rail project link east and west London, blocked earlier this year by MPs, would have been an even bigger attraction.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Richard Ellis All Buildings Rental Index (% change)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      1990 (year)   1993 (year)   1994 (Jan-June)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mayfair              -5.9          -4.6          +3.7 St James's           -5.1          -7.8          +4.8 Soho                 -8.2         -10.6          +1.9 Covent Gdn/Strand   -10.9          -8.2          +6.5 Victoria/Belgravia   -4.0         -11.0          +6.6 Northern             -9.9         -16.0          +1.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL WEST END       -7.2          -9.6          +4.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Richard Ellis Property Database, August 1994  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

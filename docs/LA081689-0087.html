			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> D.A. DECLINES TO CHARGE MAN WHO SHOT PROWLER  </P> <P> The district attorney's office has decided not to charge an Anaheim man who  fatally shot a teen-age prowler on July 1.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Melvin L. Jensen announced Tuesday that he found no evidence  to justify filing charges against Larry Sampson, who has admitted killing  17-year-old Sangbonn Bunleuth of Long Beach.  </P> <P> Sampson had been awakened in the middle of the night by sounds on the roof of  his Marion Way home, Anaheim Police Sgt. Chet Barry said. A short time later,  Sampson heard someone trying to enter the house through a sliding glass door.  </P> <P> "The door was being rattled," Barry said.  </P> <P> Sampson called police, who responded with a helicopter and at least two squad  cars.  </P> <P> But 10 minutes after the helicopter and squad cars left, Barry said, Sampson  heard more noises in the darkened back yard. Rushing out, he spotted someone  climbing over the fence into the front yard of the home.  </P> <P> Sampson ordered the man to stop, but the man turned toward him, Sampson told  police. Sampson fired one shot.  </P> <P> Barry said police decided not to arrest Sampson, although no weapon was found  on Bunleuth, who died on the sidewalk in front.  </P> <P> "In a situation like this, it was apparent that Mr. Sampson was not a danger to  the community," Barry said.  </P></p>

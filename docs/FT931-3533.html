			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Miners' group wins order MONKTONHALL Mine-workers, the consortium of miners which runs an Edinburgh colliery leased last year from British Coal, has agreed a five-year deal with ScottishPower to supply the electricity company with 100,000 tonnes of coal a year. But it was not clear last night whether the contract, the second big order the company has won, would stave off a severe financial crisis caused mainly by delays in bringing the mine back into production. It emerged at the weekend that the 160 miners, each of whom has invested Pounds 10,000 in the company, had gone without wages for seven weeks after Bank of Scotland refused to advance more loans. At the end of February the company said it was seeking a partner or outside investor to overcome funding problems. Yesterday Caledonian Mining, a firm of mining consultants based in Newark, Notts, confirmed that it had had discussions with Monktonhall Mineworkers and its advisers Price Waterhouse. It said it was interested only in having overall control of the company. The mineworkers are reluctant to cede control to Caledonian Mining, which was their rival in seeking to lease the mine from British Coal. Caledonian said it wanted more information about the production levels achieved by the miners, the problems which had caused the financial crisis and the mine's marketing position. It said it did not agree with the mineworkers' current mining method and questioned their company's 'ability to support the mine as a long-term viable proposition.' Caledonian indicated that it would not buy out the miners for the full amount they had invested, which totals Pounds 1.6m. It would introduce different mining methods. ScottishPower said it had decided to place a long-term order with Monktonhall after a 12,000-tonne test load proved satisfactory. Monktonhall has an 87,000-tonne order to supply domestic coal to British Coal.</p>

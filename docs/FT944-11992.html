			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Welsh Water to buy 20% of Czech utility Welsh Water has agreed to buy a 20 per cent stake in the biggest water and waste disposal operator in the Czech republic. The UK utility is set to pay the Czech privatisation ministry Kcs198.6m (Pounds 4.48m) for the stake in Severoceske Vodovody a Kanalizace, marking its first investment in central Europe. Although no contract has been signed and the agreement must be approved by the Czech government, Mr Graham Hawker, chief executive of Welsh Water, said negotiations were 'at the formalities stage.' Officials of SCVK were not available for comment yesterday. The two companies have been in negotiations for nearly two years. Mr Hawker said Welsh Water intended to take an active management role in SCVK. It was also seeking to buy further shares from local investors who hold 58 per cent of SCVK, to allow it 'to influence management decisions.' He ruled out taking a majority stake in the immediate future. SCVK was privatised in the Czech government's second wave of coupon privatisations this year, and is expected to be listed on the Prague bourse next February when second-wave shares are released to investors. It provides water and waste disposal services to about 1m customers in northern Bohemia, and made profits of Kcs50m last year on turnover of Kcs1.2bn. Welsh Water, which has nearly 3m customers in Wales and western England, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 144.2m on turnover of Pounds 512.1m last year. Mr Hawker said Welsh Water had identified the Czech republic as a key market in central Europe. The investment in SCVK could lead to further expansion in the region, but he said Welsh Water had 'no plans other than to consolidate in the Czech republic' at present.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, May 25 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Human and  Minority Rights Minister Margit Savovic, who has met with the  charge d'affaires at the Hungarian Embassy in Belgrade, Andras  Vincze, hailed the Hungarian proposal that the two countries'  experts meet to exchange experiences on the resolution of the  status of their national minorities. Savovic informed Vincze  about the comprehensive preparation of a federal law on  minorities in Yugoslavia, the Federal Information Ministry  announced.    The two officials also discussed the effects of the  international sanctions on the living conditions and health of  the Yugoslavs and the problems in ferrying humanitarian aid via  Hungary. Vincze said that Hungary, as a member of the United  Nations, is obliged to honour its decisions, but is doing  everything possible to facilitate the transport of relief aid to  Yugoslavia. He said that last year 12,000 trucks carrying  humanitarian aid had passed through Hungary, and that there had  been problems only in four-five cases due to a lack of adequate  documentation.</p>

['Abbas] We began the Arab-Israeli negotiations in Madrid  together. We also moved together in Washington and in the  multilateral talks. Tracks like the Palestinian or Jordanian  tracks made more progress than other tracks. Now it is Syria's  turn. We believe that achieving positive results in negotiations  on the Syrian, Lebanese, and Jordanian tracks will lead to a  comprehensive solution. Therefore, we consider it [the Geneva  summit] a positive and good step toward solving the issue of the  occupied Syrian territories.    [Mansur] Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' had earlier  called for excluding the PLO from Arab coordination. Do you  think the Clinton-al-Asad summit has invalidated this call?    ['Abbas] I do not want to comment on that, but four- or  five-track coordination is necessary. Coordinated Arab  positions and unity are essential. Consequently, I have no  comment on Minister al-Shar's statement. What really concerns  me is that the track has succeeded and this is something good  for us.    [Mansur] How does the PLO view the Palestinian-Syrian  relationship following the success of negotiations on the Syrian  track?    ['Abbas] I think it must be good because both of us are  moving in the same direction. The Palestinians might have been  accused of moving faster or acting unilaterally, but now that  progress has been made, I do not think talk about who advanced  or lagged behind is valid any more. Now we all are supposed to  think about the future and to have good relations with our  brothers in Syria.    [Mansur] What can the Palestinian leadership tell the Syrian  leadership now that progress has been made on the Syrian track?    ['Abbas] The PLO tells the Syrian leadership that what it  did  was good and we hope this process will continue and lead to full  agreement based on complete withdrawal from the Golan and on  full withdrawal for full peace. We hope the Syrian brothers  will pursue this course until peace is attained.    [Mansur] Do you think differences between Syria and the PLO  are over and bridges in Syrian-PLO relations can be  reestablished?    ['Abbas] Bridges between us and Syria have not been broken;  they might have been clouded, but not broken.    [Mansur] An economic agreement similar to the one signed  with  Jordan is expected to be signed with Egypt. Does this agreement  conflict with the one signed with Jordan?    ['Abbas] Absolutely not. We do not accept any contradiction.  It will complement the agreement with Jordan. We studied the  Egyptian agreement very carefully so that there will be no  contradiction or privileges for one at the expense of the other.    [Mansur] How far have you gone in studying this agreement?    ['Abbas] The Palestinian-Egyptian economic agreement is  ready  for signing.    [Mansur] The Palestinian-Israeli economic committee meetings  in Paris have been postponed until further notice. Why?    ['Abbas] They have been postponed for a short period of time  pending the results of the Taba talks. We will resume the Paris  talks once the results of the Taba talks are known.    [Mansur] The U.S. secretary of commerce called on the Arab  states to lift the Arab boycott of Israel. How do you view this  call?    ['Abbas] We said more than once that the Arab boycott is  linked to the Arab position. This is an Arab as well as a  Palestinian position. Hence, any progress in this regard should  be made within an Arab context.    [Mansur] Are your differences with President 'Arafat over?  Have you settled your differences with him or not?    ['Abbas] There are no real differences between us; we are  together in one leadership, one institution, one movement, and  one organization. However, we, within the framework of this  institution, may have differences in opinion. We discuss these  opinions and may agree or disagree. This disagreement will not  reach the stage of a split. Differences in opinion within the  organization do exist.    [Mansur] It was reported that there are differences between  the PLO and Jordan on Jerusalem. What is the truth behind these  differences if indeed they exist?    ['Abbas] There are no differences whatsoever on Jerusalem.  Jerusalem is a Palestinian Arab land. We, Jordan, and both the  Arab and Islamic world demand its return. There are absolutely  no differences with the brothers in Jordan over the issue of  Jerusalem.</p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Money Markets: UK optimism fades AFTER getting very bullish on Tuesday about the prospect of another UK base rate cut, sterling futures dealers were a little less certain about the outlook yesterday, writes James Blitz. Mr Kenneth Clarke's appointment as UK chancellor last week has raised speculation that he might cut UK base rates later this year in a bid to stimulate the economy. Yesterday morning, the enthusiasm which had seen the September contract bid as high as 94.32 on Tuesday dimmed a little. Sterling's weakness against the D-Mark, opening more than a pfennig lower in London at DM2.4645, pushed the contract down to 94.26 at the start of trading yesterday. That mood was compounded a little later, after the Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1bn at the start of its daily operations yesterday, but did not offer a repo in the early round. Some dealers felt this implied that the authorities wanted to keep conditions tight for the time being. However, before lunchtime, the Bank surprised the market by offering wholesale funds to commercial banks at a maturity of 2 weeks. Some dealers expressed surprise that the Bank had not offered funds for the more normal 3 week period, and speculated that a policy change might be in the offing around the time of Mr Clarke's first Mansion House speech. Another factor adding to rate cut speculation was the poorer than expected UK money supply number, which showed a 3.3 per cent increase in Britain's narrow measure of money for May, providing further evidence that the UK recovery is slowing. By the close, the September contract was at 94.29, 4 basis points down on the day. Three month money was up from 5 7/8 per cent to 5 15/16 per cent on the day. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank President, helped short-dated German futures to rise yesterday after saying that Germany's recession could be the worst since the second world war. Mr Schlesinger's comments encouraged dealers to think that the Bundesbank would continue its policy of small cuts in short-dated interest rates, despite its decision to leave the repo rate unchanged at 7.60 per cent. The September Euromark contract closed up 8 basis points on the day at 93.28.</p>

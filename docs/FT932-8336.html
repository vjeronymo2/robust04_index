			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: Daiwa posts first loss since 1964 JAPAN'S leading brokers yesterday reported weak earnings, including the first pre-tax loss at Daiwa Securities since 1964, but confidently declared that the three-year collapse of Tokyo stock prices was over. The stock market recovery boosted commissions in the last weeks of the year ended March. Nomura Securities, the largest house, reported a pre-tax profit of Y2.4bn (Dollars 21.5m), down 94.6 per cent, but managed to avoid the loss that had earlier seemed inevitable. Daiwa, the second largest house, had a pre-tax loss of Y7.3bn, compared to a profit of Y9.3bn. while Yamaichi Securities announced another embarrassing loss, Y37.4bn, following a loss of Y36.5bn in 1991-92. The houses reported a fall in stock commissions and underwriting income, and all had valuation losses on their securities holdings. Japan's 10 second-tier brokers all reported losses for the year, and a sign of the mounting pressure on their balance sheets was the resignation yesterday of 15 executives at Yamatane Securities, under reconstruction by Sakura Bank, a leading commercial bank. However, even Yamatane, which reported a loss of Y10.4bn, expects to return to profits this year on the back of a big recovery in share trading volume. The hope is that the daily turnover of shares on the Tokyo exchange can average at least 400m, compared to 282m last year. The broker with the best news was Nikko Securities, which reported a profit of Y2.5bn, down 19.4 per cent, but topping Nomura. However, only Nomura reported a net profit, turning in Y3.3bn after tax. The net loss of Y6.5bn at Nikko compared with Y25.9bn a year earlier. Nikko's relative success followed a sharp increase in profits on bond dealing, which were Y28.2bn, up from Y1.2bn, and managed to reduce operating expenses by almost 18 per cent. Over the last six months, listed brokers have reduced their offices from 3,150 to 3,000, and cut staff by about 5 per cent. Daily turnover of shares in Tokyo was 662m last month, and brokers are confident that retail investors will return to the stock market in coming months, if only because a fall in interest rates has reduced their investment options. However, there are signs that investor interest in the stock market might have begun to wane, as trading volumes have slipped in the past two weeks. Time running out, Page 35</p>

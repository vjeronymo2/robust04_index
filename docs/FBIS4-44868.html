			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kiyonori Sugihara] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   Gallium-arsenide (GaAs) gate arrays have recently begun to  be  applied to fields requiring high-speed processing, such as those  related to upgrading the telecommunications infrastructure,  supercomputers aimed primarily at research institutions, and the  broadband integrated services digital network (B-ISDN), a  telecommunications network for the high-speed transmission of  huge volumes of data, beginning with image data associated with  multimedia capabilities.    Bipolar emitter-coupled logic (ECL) were the principal  devices used for these purposes in the past, but GaAs  technology, with features such as ultra-high-speed operation,  low power consumption and high integratability, is steadily  replacing bipolar technology in these fields.    Advances in GaAs technology in recent years has made  possible  the mass production of large-scale-integration (LSI) logic  devices, and thanks to enhanced mass producability and lower  costs, GaAs gate arrays are now less expensive to fabricate than  ECL devices, being on a par with bipolar complementary  metal-oxide semiconductors (BiCMOS). GaAs technology is becoming  generally accepted as a commercial technology for use in  manufacturing and consumer industries.    GaAs digital LSI technology consists primarily of 0.8m  feature sizes. But work is pushing ahead to further increase the  operating speed of these devices, and the ``GG11/12'' series of  0.5m GaAs gate arrays announced by Fujitsu Ltd. in June,  1993, together with the ``FX'' series of Vitesse 0.6m gate  arrays, are now world technology leaders. Scaling aimed at  developing devices with yet faster operating speeds and lower  power consumption will continue to advance in future.  <H5>  Expanding Application Fields </H5>   Up until now, GaAs digital ICs have been more or less  limited  to integration levels of several hundred gates for use primarily  as high-speed ATE (automatic measurement tools), and  multiplexers (MUX) and demultiplexers (DEMUX) for 622M-2.4Gb/s  telecommunications.    However, GaAs arrays with tens of thousands of gates have  recently been installed in supercomputers (such as Fujitsu's  supercomputer ``VPP-500'').    Future applications for these devices are expanding into the  fields of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switches for the  growing market for B-ISDN, LSIs for fiberoptic  telecommunications at transmission speeds ranging from  155M-1.5Gb/s, prescalers for mobile communications systems,  HDC/memory controllers, high-speed image processing LSI for  personal computers (PCs) and engineering workstations (EWS), and  LSIs that serve as telecommunication links in local area  networks (LANs) used for computer-to-computer communications  with everything from mainframe computers to PCs.    Because GaAs devices have generally been more expensive to  produce, they have been considered applicable only to high-end  machines and equipment. But thanks to real mass production  fabrication facilities such as Fujitsu's Custom Device plant,  coupled with improved yields and characteristic stability, GaAs  gate arrays are now on a par with BiCMOS devices price-wise, and  are finding applications in more and more familiar machines and  equipment. For example, GaAs LSIs are being used in Intel's  pentium cache controllers. Table 1 provides a list of specific  applications to which GaAs LSIs are being put.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

Comparison of GaAs Gate Arrays with Other Technologies </FIG>  <H5>  1. CMOS </H5>   When it comes to actual working gates, CMOS integration has  advanced to the point where the maximum number of gates possible  is over 150,000 gates, and gate arrays with feature sizes of  0.5m have been practicalized. And CMOS devices that operate  at system speeds of over 100MHz have been commercialized.    Cost-performance-wise, GaAs gate arrays can't begin to  compete with CMOS devices in applications that require less than  100MHz; this is the CMOS domain, and generally speaking, GaAs  applications simply do not exist.    In the over 100MHz range, however, even CMOS power  consumption cannot be ignored.    Figure 2 compares the power consumption of GaAs and CMOS at  the basic gate level. Although CMOS power consumption is smaller  below 50MHz, over 50MHz, GaAs power consumption becomes smaller  than that of CMOS. This is because even though direct coupled  field-effect transistor logic (DCFL), the basic circuit in GaAs  devices, runs at steady-state current and consumes power even  when in a non-operative state, because DCFL feature a low logic  swing of roughly 0.6V, the increase in the amount of power  consumed by capacitive load drive is negligible.     With CMOS, because amplitude swings practically up to the  supply voltage, load drive power consumption increases in  proportion to the frequency. Capacitive load power consumption  (P[.sub]W[/]) can be expressed as follows:    P[.sub]W[/] = fcv[.sup]2[/]    And when CMOS supply voltage is 3.3V, the power consumption  of CMOS compared to that of GaAs is roughly 30-times higher.  This difference is expressed as follows:    GaAs DCFL : P[.sub]W[/] =  fc(0.6)[.sup]2[/]    CMOS : P[.sub]W[/] =  fc(3.3)[.sup]2[/]    Here f is the operating frequency, c is  the drive load capacity and v is the logic swing.    At the chip level, as shown in Figure 3, GaAs power  consumption becomes smaller than CMOS consumption at around  140MHz and above. This indicates that GaAs will have the  advantage over CMOS as system operating frequencies continue to  rise in future.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-24B>      Figure 2. Comparison of Power Consumption of GaAs and CMOS Basic Gates </FIG>  <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-24C>      Figure 3. Comparison of Power Consumption in GaAs and CMOS Chips </FIG>    In the field of new processors such as RISC, the operating  speeds of which will increase even further in future, these  high-speeds are being dealt with using parallel architectures  such as super pipelines and super scalers that become plus or  minus 200MHz CMOS clocks. But it is getting harder and harder to  get around the intricate circuitry and increasing power  consumption.    It is becoming increasingly likely that single architecture  GaAs technology with its high-speed operation and comparatively  low power consumption will find application in these fields as  well.  <H5>  2. ECL </H5>   ECL devices with tens of thousands of gates have been  practicalized. However, circuitry-wise, the ECL approach poses  problems when it comes to increasing integration levels. And as  power consumption increases in line with higher levels of  integration, forced cooling with liquid coolants will become  inevitable. Thus, in addition to LSI costs, extra costs will be  required for these cooling measures and for power supply  capacity.    GaAs devices consume only 1/4 to 1/3 of the power consumed  by  ECL. Therefore, an ECL operating at 1.5W, the limit for natural  air cooling, will only have about 1,000 gates, whereas a GaAs  gate array operating at this same power level could be equipped  with up to 10,000 gates (See Figure 4). Also, the size ratio of  a basic ECL gate is roughly 20-times bigger than that of a GaAs  device, making the ECL device inferior to the GaAs gate array in  terms of degree of integration as well.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-25A>      Figure 4. Comparison of Degree of Integration and Power Consumption Between GaAs and ECL Devices </FIG>    In addition, the fabrication process for ECL devices is more  complicated than that for GaAs arrays and CMOS devices. This  process promises to become even more complex in future as  manufacturers of ECL devices strive to increase operating  speeds, and the higher fabrication costs will prove a drawback  for ECL.    Since GaAs gate arrays consume less power than ECL devices  and are on a par with CMOS when it comes to gate size and  fabrication processes, from the standpoints of integration and  fabrication costs, GaAs arrays are sufficiently competitive with  ECL devices. It is felt this will result in a switch to GaAs  from ECL in future.  <H5>  3. GaAs </H5>   Since GaAs devices are capable of integration levels on a  par  with CMOS, GaAs gate arrays with 150,000 working gates have  already been practicalized.    Speed is a trade off with number of gates, but GaAs gate  arrays with several tens of thousands of gates will be capable  of operating at system speeds of approximately 800MHz. And  scaling should make it possible to increase this speed in future.    GaAs devices operate at low supply voltage. Fujitsu's GG11  gate array strives to lower power consumption by setting  internal supply voltage at 1.2V. Thus, especially when it comes  to increasing the level of integration of large-scale systems,  GaAs gate arrays offer a plus in that their ability to operate  at low supply voltage can reduce power consumption.    Gate delay time hardly changes at all when supply voltage  ranges between 1-2V (see Figure 5). Therefore, the portable  equipment and other fields where advances are being made toward  lowering supply voltage are ideal fields for the application of  GaAs devices capable of operating on a single 1.2V battery.     GaAs devices are also expected to find applications in  mobile  telecommunications, the market for which is growing steadily.  <H5>  Fujitsu's GaAs Gate Arrays </H5>   Table 3 provides detailed information on Fujitsu's GaAs gate  arrays.

Fujitsu's GaAs Gate Arrays </FIG>  <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-26B>      Figure 5. Supply Voltage, Delay Time and Power Consumption Characteristics of GaAs Gate Arrays </FIG>     With its new GG series, development of which commenced in  June 1993, Fujitsu scaled-down gate length to 0.5m in an  attempt to increase operating speed. Figure 6 shows photographs  of a 0.5m GG series 25K-gate chip and packaged device.   <H5>  1. 0.5m GG Series Process </H5>   To suppress the short channel effect, we employed embedded p  layer LDD structures for the basic elements, and achieved gate  lengths of 0.5m.    Our major tasks were enhancing yield as we increased the  degree of integration, and holding down on the dispersion of the  threshold voltage in particular. By employing self-aligning  technology that uses high-heat resistant tungsten silicide in  the gate electrodes we were able to increase the degree of  integration and to achieve favorable Schottky characteristics.  <H5>  2. Mass Production System </H5>   Fabrication capabilities for GaAs gate arrays have posed a  problem in the past, so Fujitsu constructed a dedicated GaAs LSI  fabrication line and commenced mass production of these devices  in earnest in 1991.    This new dedicated GaAs LSI line, the largest of its kind in  the world, has been installed at the Fujitsu Custom Device plant  in Showa-machi, Nakakyoma-gun (phonetic) near Kofu-shi in  Yamanashi Prefecture, and is operating together with other  fabrication lines there that have been turning out compound  semiconductor products such as optical semiconductor elements  and microwave semiconductor elements for some time now.    The full-scale commencement of this mass production line has  enhanced yield, shortened fabrication time and made possible  stable supplies of GaAs LSIs.    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-027L-27A>      Figure 6. Photographs of a 0.5m GG Series Chip and </FIG>  <H5>  3. Cost Performance </H5>   The wafers used to fabricate GaAs LSI are 4-inches in  diameter, which is small compared to the 6- to 8-inch wafers  used for silicon MOS. The manufacturers of these wafers have  already test manufactured 6-inch sizes, and the switch to 6-inch  GaAs LSI wafers will be taking place before to long.    Unlike silicon, which exists in unlimited amounts, gallium  and arsenide are rare materials. At present, stable supplies of  these rare materials are being maintained via refining  processes, but they are expensive compared to silicon material.    Seven masks are used in the fabrication of GaAs LSI using  bulk processing techniques. This is about on a par with the  number of masks used to fabricate silicon MOS devices, but works  out to less than half the masks needed for silicon bipolar  devices. Although the cost of GaAs wafers is rather high, since  manufacturing costs are equal to those for silicon MOS devices,  total costs are not really that much higher.    And if we calculate in the improved yields achieved with  GaAs  LSI, overall costs drop to the level of those for silicon-based  BiCMOS.  <H5>  Future GaAs Trends </H5>   The size of the chip itself makes it nearly impossible to  reduce the cost of producing large-scale gate arrays with over  100,000 gates. Large-scale system LSIs aimed at the  supercomputer market have high value-added, and are in demand  despite their relatively high price tags. However, LSIs aimed at  the manufacturing and consumer products markets must fall into  the category of high-performance, low-cost devices. In the  future, therefore, manufacturers of GaAs LSIs targeting these  markets will focus on productive-size series in the under  40,000-gate class. It isn't possible to keep up with  applications requiring increasingly complicated, high functions  with gate array technology alone.    In particular, it will be necessary to provide high-speed,  large-capacity random access memory (RAM) for the ATM switches  used in B-ISDN so essential for future high-speed,  large-capacity data transmission functions, the PLL technology  imperative for future telecommunications applications, and  high-speed analog technologies such as analog-digital converters  (ADC)/digital-analog converters (DAC) and LDD. Steps must  urgently be taken to create systems for developing custom ICs  and the standard cell technology built-into so-called analog  macros. This cannot be handled simply by the high gate  integration levels capable with GaAs. It will be these other  technologies that determine the extent that GaAs ICs, with their  high-speed, low-voltage operation, are utilized in future in the  high value-added field of mobile communications.  <H5>  Conclusions </H5>   GaAs MESFET technology with 0.5m dimensions has already  been practicalized. Scaling will continue in future in an  attempt to increase operating speeds yet further, but the short  channel effect prevalent in GaAs MESFETs makes scaling down  below the 0.5m level difficult. High electron mobility  transistors (HEMT) and other heterojunction devices will have to  be introduced to enable scaling to proceed to the 0.35m  level.    Technology is now being practicalized that will not only be  able to reduce power consumption during standby like CMOS can,  but should also make it possible to shave almost a whole digit  off the amount of power consumed by CMOS during  operation.[.sup]1)[/] This is a complementary-type circuit  with a metal-insulator-silicon (MIS) structure that employs  heterojunction technology. These technologies should expand  applications of GaAs LSIs in mobile communications equipment,  which are being designed for ever faster operating speeds and  lower power consumption.

			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A WAY TO BUY TIME?;  </P> <P> AN AIDS TREATMENT UNDERGROUND HAS BEEN OPERATING HERE FOR OVER A YEAR. THE  THERAPY IS PROVIDED BY A RESPECTED PHYSICIAN. AIDS PATIENTS JUST HOPE THEY WILL  OUTLAST THE WAITING LIST.  </P> <P> John arrived exactly on time for his Monday morning appointment. Tall,  blue-eyed and slender, he was about to undergo a treatment -- a treatment that  might not make him better and that could theoretically threaten the medical  license of the physician offering it.  </P> <P> But the 41-year-old blond businessman looked refreshed and calm, even eager.  Minutes later, the technician from the doctor's medical laboratory welcomed him  warmly. He ushered John past a bubbling aquarium, down a hall and into an  examination room.  </P> <P> A plastic bag of blood plasma hung beside the bed. The plasma was collected  from anonymous donors, people not as sick as John, but who match his blood  type. As John sat down, the technician gave him a tablet of Benadryl and a tiny  cup of water. "Just in case of an allergic reaction," he explained. John  swallowed the pill and stretched out. The technician swabbed his forearm with  rubbing alcohol, gingerly inserted the intravenous needle and started the  plasma flowing. For the next 20 minutes, John lay still as it dripped into his  body.  </P> <P> John had just undergone passive immunotherapy, an experimental, underground  treatment he fervently hoped would halt the deterioration of his immune system  from AIDS. He tested positive in 1985 for the human immunodeficiency virus  (HIV), and since then has had Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer common in AIDS  patients, removed from his leg. In late 1988, his T-cell count, one medical  barometer of immune system functioning, declined drastically.  </P> <P> The doctor who provides the monthly transfusions is doing so because he  believes the treatment shows promise. John has a more immediate motivation: he  wants to live.  </P> <P> </P> <P> During the last year, 65 other AIDS patients have joined this Los Angeles  underground. Before the treatment -- which does not have the blessing of the  Food and Drug Administration -- almost all had lost weight. Many have had  numerous hospitalizations to treat pneumonia, inflammation of the pancreas,  liver problems and spleen abnormalities.  </P> <P> Each has gone quietly to the same medical laboratory, operated by a prominent  Los Angeles immunologist, who agreed to discuss the treatment and his reasons  for offering it on condition of anonymity.  </P> <P> Developed by an English scientist, the treatment is believed to boost the  immune systems of AIDS patients in declining health, by giving them  antibody-rich plasma from patients who test positive for the human  immunodeficiency virus (HIV) but are still healthy.  </P> <P> All but three of the 66 AIDS patients who have undergone the treatment in Los  Angeles are still alive, according to the physician who offers it, and most  credit their their current state of relative health -- and their improved  T-cell counts -- to the therapy.  </P> <P> The first patient, who has by now received 14 infusions, said he has gone from  sleeping around the clock to a more productive life that includes work and  walking a mile a day. He will speak freely about his progress, but won't allow  his name to be used, since his family has no idea he has AIDS.  </P> <P> His testimonials and those of dozens of other HIV-positive patients -- coupled  with the convictions of a handful of doctors -- have spawned the treatment  underground. Even though it has operated for more than a year, it is still not  well-known, some say, even by AIDS patients. Many hear of it by word of mouth  or through articles in the gay press, just as they have heard of many numerous  other AIDS underground treatments. The waiting list, which now includes 77  people, is unusual. It operates not on a "first-come, first-served" basis but a  "sickest-go-first" order.  </P> <P> The covert network was born of one man's gut-wrenching depression. In the  spring of 1988, Christopher Gerard, a former actor and business manager,  returned home after another funeral, feeling dismal. It was his 45th friend to  die of AIDS. "To say I was depressed is understatement," recalls Gerard. "Bobby  was a gifted artist, a kid I grew up with in New Jersey. To make it worse, his  brother had passed away -- from AIDS -- just six months before." Gerard sat in  the Hollywood Hills condominium he shares with his companion of nine years,  feeling paralyzed.  </P> <P> Some days later, he got a telephone call from a friend, and they talked about  the terrible toll of AIDS, of mutual friends lost to the disease. Then she  mentioned a Cable News Network report about a new AIDS treatment. She  remembered the name -- passive immunotherapy -- and had written down the name  of the scientist and his university.  </P> <P> Gerard spent the next few days thinking. He tracked down Abraham Karpas at the  University of Cambridge. "I asked him, "What's being done in America?' " Karpas  knew only of a study planned by the Bronx Veterans Administration Medical  Center.  </P> <P> Gerard enticed Karpas to fly to the United States in November, 1988. Together  they persuaded the Los Angeles physician to begin offering the treatment to  AIDS patients. Since the first patient was infused 14 months ago, Gerard has  asked 27 other physicians to do the same. One New York doctor is about to begin  offering the treatment, Gerard said, and he's in touch with a Texas doctor who  has expressed interest. Dr. Richard Stiehm, UCLA professor of pediatrics and  co-director of the Los Angeles County Pediatric AIDS Consortium, who already  knew of Karpas' work, plans to give the treatment next week to a child in the  advanced stages of AIDS.  </P> <P> But all the other physicians Gerard asked to provide the therapy have turned  him down. "Without a study, they are terrified," said Gerard, who directs the  underground and serves as president of the L.A. chapter of the Passive  Immunotherapy (PATH) Foundation, a nonprofit educational organization based in  San Francisco.  </P> <P> The plasma used in passive immunotherapy is an unapproved drug and, strictly  speaking, its use is illegal, said Allen Davidson, spokesman for the California  Department of Health Services' Food and Drug Branch. "There is legal opinion  indicating a physician can use new drugs within the confines of their  practices," Davidson added, "but doctors (who do so) do open themselves up to  liability."  </P> <P> The Los Angeles doctor who provides passive immunotherapy is well aware of  those risks but passionate about the effectiveness of the treatment. He says he  can't believe he would ever be penalized for providing what he views as  compassionate care, and has invested "at least six figures" of his own money to  finance treatments for patients who cannot pay. Gerard says he has raised  another $20,000 to fund treatments.  </P> <P> In a way, money may be the easy part. Week after week, Gerard schedules an  information meeting, explaining to a new group of AIDS patients about passive  immunotherapy, about the need to keep the doctor's name confidential, about the  overwhelming need to find more donors and, last but not least, the chances of  getting to the top of the waiting list.  </P> <P> At 45, Gerard is trim, with the kind of solid good looks and passion for his  cause that would seem to make persuasion second nature. But Gerard has not only  been rejected by cautious physicians; he has appealed unsuccessfully to several  AIDS groups for donors, patients and support. "In the beginning," said Gerard,  "I called one AIDS group 30 days in a row." But skepticism and apathy are  almost inevitable, he says, when patients hear about one "miracle" treatment  after another. Some see passive immunotherapy as just another flimsy promise,  another blind alley. "Some people are just 'drug du joured' out," Gerard said.  </P> <P> Even so, the word about passive immunotherapy is spreading, and "Establishment"  medicine is beginning to give it a serious look. The clinical trial at Bronx  Veterans Administration Medical Center has enrolled 70 patients. "The results  seem encouraging," said Elliott Block, president of Medicorp, the  Montreal-based firm funding the study. And now, two other clinical trials of  the treatment may begin this summer. HemaCare, a Sherman Oaks-based provider of  blood-related services and products, will enroll up to 225 patients, said  company spokeswoman Tanya Youvan . Dimension Laboratories, based in Utah, will  start a 40-patient study soon, said James Marshall, president.  </P> <P> Passive immunotherapy for AIDS is simple in concept but not in execution. Blood  plasma from donors is first tested to be sure it meets strict criteria. Donors  who don't qualify may not have high enough concentrations of antibodies  (protective proteins that fight foreign proteins) in their blood; they may have  low levels of "helper cells" (the so-called sentinels of the immune system) or  they may have active HIV virus. If their plasma passes all tests, it is  processed and treated to inactivate any infectious agents before infusion into  AIDS patients. Recipients get plasma that has been taken from several donors  and mixed to ensure a good cross-section of antibodies.  </P> <P> The treatment works, proponents say, because the plasma from the still-healthy  donors contains high levels of antibodies against the virus that boosts the  immune systems of AIDS patients. (It is different than the treatment recently  reported by Atlanta doctors, who diverted an AIDS patient's blood into a heat  exchanger, heated it to 115 degrees Fahrenheit, and reinfused it. They claimed  they found no evidence of the virus three months later.)  </P> <P> Passive immunotherapy is expensive, partly because the process of  plasma-gathering is so painstakingly arduous. The cost per donor is about $400  to run the necessary blood-screening tests. For AIDS patients, the cost of each  treatment ranges from $300 to $700, depending on the number of donors who must  be screened to find enough qualified ones. Many recipients pay nothing for the  treatment; others pay on a sliding scale. "It really has the best potential  right now," the Los Angeles doctor who offers it said recently. "I would love  to find a drug with the same potential."  </P> <P> The doctor and other proponents of the therapy point to British studies that  find it can buy time. In 1985, Karpas began providing the treatment, eventually  infusing 17 patients. Of the nine who remained in follow-up, three are still  alive, he told physicians attending a recent lecture at UCLA, where he was  invited to speak by Stiehm.  </P> <P> With the treatment, he said, "we see a dramatic increase -- about eightfold --  in the levels of antibodies within a month."  </P> <P> Other researchers, reporting in the medical journal, The Lancet, in late 1988  on use of the treatment in six patients with advanced AIDS, said the antibody  effects persisted for up to 11 weeks after a single infusion.  </P> <P> The health of donors does not seem to suffer. Karpas followed one donor for  about a year and found that the donations "didn't affect his T-4 count at all."  Said one Los Angeles man, who began donating six months ago: "My T-4 count has  remained constant." He cites psychological benefits as well. "Being able to  donate my plasma takes me out of my own fears. It's very healing."  </P> <P> Even though some doctors say there is not yet enough science behind passive  immunotherapy, activists counter that treatment is needed now, not after a  dozen studies. Gerard points to the plight of men like Matthew, an AIDS patient  who spoke recently at one of the weekly information meetings, about his first  experience with passive immunotherapy.  </P> <P> Gerard opened the meeting, as usual, by explaining the treatment to newcomers.  Then Matthew, a dark-haired man with the physique of a long-distance runner but  a fraction of the stamina, shuffled to the front of the classroom and half-sat  on the teacher's desk. Like most of the 14 others in the room, he stopped short  of telling his full name, wary of jeopardizing his own privacy and the life of  the underground.  </P> <P> "Statistically, I really shouldn't be here right now," Matthew began. "I was  diagnosed with AIDS in 1985. I tried an experimental treatment . . . and it  just about killed me. I got myself out of the hospital Sunday to start this  therapy Monday. That's how absolutely convinced I was something good would come  out of it. I could barely walk in to the treatment, but I walked out with a  spring in my stride. I will be there next month, no question. I had absolutely  no side effects."  </P> <P> He started to sit down, then added one last comment. "All of this is not done  in some dank, dark basement. I watched MTV while I had this treatment."  </P> <P> Some U.S. AIDS experts agree that the treatment looks promising. "Studies  appear to give some benefit to patients by making them feel better" and  decreasing their viral activity, said Dr. Joel Weisman, UCLA assistant clinical  professor of medicine who cares for many AIDS patients in his Beverly Hills and  Sherman Oaks practices. Weisman, with Dr. Michael Gottlieb, is credited with  writing the first published report describing AIDS in 1981.  </P> <P> "It gives patients a chance to rejuvenate," said Dr. Michael Roth, a Santa  Monica allergist and immunologist who cares for many AIDS patients. "The  earlier it is used, the better. But even if it is used late (in the course of  AIDS), people can feel physically better."  </P> <P> Even so, there are substantial caveats voiced about the treatment and the  underground. "The best way to validate a treatment is to do it (in a) medically  correct (way), which means not underground," said Elliot Block of Medicorp,  which also licensed HemaCare to provide the treatments for the upcoming  clinical trial.  </P> <P> Weisman brings up a worrisome concern. There is some evidence, he said, that  Kaposi's sarcoma is caused by a different organism than HIV. "It's only a  theory, but there's a possibility of transmitting KS (via passive  immunotherapy) to those who don't have it."  </P> <P> Other experts say passive immunotherapy is too complicated to set up in a  doctor's office and are concerned about costs. "It is labor intensive," said  one doctor familiar with the process. "And it's dependent on donors." The blood  must be cleansed properly to eliminate any infectious agents. "All together,"  said one AIDS activist, "it's far more complicated than 'Here, take this pill .  . .' "  </P> <P> Some criticize the treatment on the grounds that the studies in England involve  too few patients. Others believe the treatment may work for only a small  segment of patients. Said Martin Delaney, executive director of Project Inform,  a San Francisco clearinghouse for HIV treatment information, "From the  researchers I talk to, it's a relatively narrow approach that only deals with a  small part of the pathology of AIDS."  </P> <P> Most, including Karpas, see its role as a "buy-time" therapy, a treatment that  could perhaps be used in combination with other treatments. In the future,  Karpas predicted, antibodies will be able to be artificially produced in the  laboratory, eliminating the need for donors. Some AIDS patients cheer the  approval of the two planned studies. But others worry that a patent dispute  simmering between the two companies approved for the clinical trials will delay  the start of the studies.  </P> <P> A sense of humor helps, said Gerard, who says he has heard rumblings of  clinical trials for at least two years. "I've threatened," Gerard joked, "to  make up T-shirts for HemaCare that say, 'Next week, next week.' "  </P> <P> Keeping the underground alive is an uphill battle, even for someone as  hard-driving as Gerard. Some of his fellow activists say he has tunnel vision.  So intent is he on promoting passive immunotherapy that he sees a role for  little else. In his quest for donors and doctors, some say, he can be abrasive.  And he's not above name-calling, said one acquaintance. "Chris is quick to  point fingers. He doesn't like some doctors."  </P> <P> Gerard takes it all with a grain of salt and a shrug of the shoulders. "I've  even been accused," he said with a laugh, "of looking for a political career."  </P> <P> Gerard seems to spend less time worrying about what his detractors say than  about getting burned-out AIDS patients enthused about the treatment. Those who  do come to the weekly information meetings are often coaxed into it, he said,  by friends, lovers, mothers, fathers and others concerned about the patient.  </P> <P> Beyond finding a way to lengthen the life of AIDS patients, Gerard has another  dream. "I would love to create a coalition of terminally ill fighters," Gerard  said. "People with leukemia and Alzheimer's, for instance. People with multiple  sclerosis and Lou Gehrig's disease. We all hear the same thing -- that it will  take five to 10 years more of research (to find a cure)."  </P> <P> Three telephone lines in his condo are devoted to the treatment program. Some  days, the calls seem never to stop. The conversations with AIDS patients --  some of whom have been on the waiting list for months -- can take their toll.  "When the phone rings," Gerard said, "sometimes I say aloud, 'I know, I know.  You're going to die."' Then he does his best to empathize.  </P> <P> Fending off bribes comes with the territory. "One person offered me $10,000 to  be next for treatment," said Gerard, who patiently explained the philosophy of  "sickest go first."  </P> <P> One man knows that all too well. He's been on the "noncritical" waiting list  since February but has been "bumped" 14 times when sicker people needed the  treatment. "I feel disappointed, but I do understand," he said. "I've seen so  many friends die hideous deaths." On another occasion, Gerard said, one hopeful  recipient offered to "barter" donors. "I can get you 10 donors," he told  Gerard, "if you just get me treated."  </P> <P> But Gerard has found some people to depend on. Father Jack Beattie, the pastor  of St. Ambrose Church in West Hollywood where Gerard attends Mass regularly,  provides a school classroom for the weekly information meetings. Gerard says  his religion is a wellspring of comfort as well. That, he said, is largely due  to Father Jack's attitude: "This is the one place," said Beattie, "where  everyone should feel welcome."  </P> <P> Preston Coons, 39, of Silver Lake, serves as volunteer coordinator for the  underground, intent on finding donors. Since February, he has carried around  flyers explaining passive immunotherapy and the donor search. "I have put up  these flyers all over my neighborhood -- in the bookstore, the restaurant, the  laundromat, my dentist's office, the discount pharmacy -- everywhere I thought  there would be healthy, HIV-infected individuals. So far we've had good  response."  </P> <P> Gerard said he gets much support from his long-time companion and from his  mother. And Gerard takes solace from the testimonies of optimists like John.  </P> <P> Since testing positive, John has tried Science of Mind, self-hypnosis,  acupuncture and medication. Nothing worked for long, and he had gotten  discouraged. The opportunity to try passive immunotherapy has given him hope,  he said.  </P> <P> "I feel I am taking control. I know this is only going to buy me time. But I  want to stay where I am -- with an immune system impaired but still working.  When you have AIDS, you really don't have many choices. The time clock is  ticking. If I thought it would do any good, I would eat wooden nickels."  </P></p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Kuwait delays bourse reopening THE reopening of Kuwait's stock exchange, closed since the Iraqi invasion in August 1990, has been delayed until the government finalises an ambitious plan to write off all banking debt in the emirate, writes Mark Nicholson, Middle East Correspondent. Exchange officials indicated in January that the market, which had an annual turnover of around Dollars 3bn before the Gulf war, might open next month. However, they now say that they are still awaiting financial reports from the 56 listed companies - which cannot be prepared until the debt plan is approved. Details of the buy-out are still being discussed by the National Council, Kuwait's interim assembly, and approval is expected by the end of March. The government is proposing to buy KD5.84bn (Dollars 20bn) of debts from the banks and finance houses in return for a special sale of government bonds. Some KD1.9bn of the debt is a residue from the 1982 collapse of the informal Souq al Manakh stock market, the remainder being debts outstanding to banks before the Gulf war. Once the debt scheme is approved, bourse officials say the market could reopen within weeks.</p>

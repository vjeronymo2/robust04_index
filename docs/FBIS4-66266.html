			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Chung T'ing-yao (6988 1656 5069), Researcher, </F> Social Science Research Center, University of Hong Kong]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Several days ago the Social  Science Research Center of the University of Hong Kong published  the results of all previous 1993 marks given to the Hong Kong  governor, legislative councilors and political groups. This was  the first part of a 1993 overall summary. A second section  concerning the degree of trust in the Chinese, British and Hong  Kong governments, and a survey of residents' confidence in the  future will be made public hereafter. To evaluate Hong Kong  Governor Patten, surveys basically were undertaken once per  week; in 1993, 50 surveys were taken in which more than 28,600  people successfully were interviewed. The average grade given to  the Hong Kong governor was 57.99. Regarding legislative  councilors and political groups, a survey was made once every  two months. Some 3,385 people were interviewed for the former  and 3,271 people for the latter. [passage omitted]    Summarizing residents' degree of support for the Hong Kong  governor, as of the latter half of 1993, the degree of support  was fixed at around 57 points, with less fluctuation than in  1992, indicating that residents' appraisal of Hong Kong Governor  Patten himself has begun to finalize. There were two rather  large fluctuations in 1993; in March there was one jump after  publication of the political reform plan statutes. In October  there was a seven percent rise after reading out the second  administrative report. Thereafter a recovery to normal levels  was seen.    An analysis of the grades given to Patten finds them  average.  In 1992, they rose to a height of 65 points, about the same as  before Wei T'u-hsin left office. The highest score given to the  top 10 Legislative Council [Legco] members was around 65 points.  If we compare the marks given to Legco Members to those received  by the Hong Kong governor, Patten only comes in at around sixth  place. From this one can see that evaluations of the Hong Kong  governor himself are only average. [passage omitted]    Regarding residents' appraisals of the 10 most familiar  major  Legco members, Tu Yeh Hsi-en still holds first place, Liu  Hui-ch'ing second, Liu Ch'ien-shih is often in third or fourth.  The others, such as Li Chu-ming, Chou Liang Shu-ch'ia, Si-tu  Hua, Huang Hung-fa and Li P'eng-fei are all on the list. Tu  Yao-tsung has been on the list for nearly one-half a year now.  Regarding degrees of recognition, the top 10 Legco members are  all recognized by about 70 percent to 80 percent of residents,  about 20 percent higher than the political groups, indicating  that more residents recognize Legco members than political  groups.    Analyzing the marks received by various political parties  and  groups, the Hong Kong Alliance still occupies first place, the  Hui Tien second, and for nearly one-half year now the Freedom  Party and Workers Union have vied for third and fourth place.  Fifth place is contended for by the Min-chien Lien and the  Tsu-Min Lien. It is noteworthy that the marks political parties  received were generally lower than those received by Legco  members, indicating that residents still have rather low  knowledge of political parties. However, they are somewhat  better known than at the end of 1993 and the beginning of 1994.  [passage omitted]</p>

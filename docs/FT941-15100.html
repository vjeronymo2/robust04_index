			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / International Company News: Winterthur to expand in Germany Winterthur Insurance, Switzerland's third largest insurer, is set to buy a substantial minority stake in DBV Holding, an insurance unit of Germany's Commerzbank. Both Winterthur and Commerzbank have scheduled press conferences for Monday morning. Commerzbank said last week it hoped to announce during January a restructuring of its non-banking financial activities. Winterthur said yesterday it would announce 'a very important expansion of its insurance business'. DBV, with insurance premium income of approximately DM3.5bn (Dollars 2.03bn), was set up by the King of Prussia in 1871 to provide insurance cover for the German military. It later expanded to cover civil servants, taking on the name Deutsche Beamten Versicherung, and in the 1970s became a general insurance company. The acquisition would be Winterthur's second attempt to establish a strong base in the German market. In 1987, it bought a 38 per cent stake in Nordstern Allgemeine of Cologne with the intention of gradually winning control. However, Colonia, a German affiliate of the French UAP insurance group, retained its majority control of Nordstern, and Winterthur eventually gave up and sold its stake.</p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SUDAN;  </P> <P> RULERS PLANNING TO REVIVE ISLAMIC LAWS  </P> <P> The military rulers of Sudan are planning to revive Islamic sharia laws,  Sudanese and diplomatic sources in Khartoum said. The Islamic laws are fiercely  opposed by non-Muslim rebels fighting a civil war in the south, and their  revival in the mainly Arab and Muslim north would diminish hopes of peace. The  Sudan People's Liberation Army has been fighting a civil war since 1983 in the  Christian and animist south.  </P></p>

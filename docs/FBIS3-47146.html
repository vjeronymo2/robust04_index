This year is the year of a revolutionary upturn in which our  country's socialist construction enters a new stage of  development, as well as the rewarding year of struggle in which  the entire party, the whole country, and all people should be  mobilized to effect a great revolutionary upsurge on all fronts.    To make the New Year 1994 become a historic year of an  upsurge in our country's revolution and construction, all party  members and working people must continue to fight more  strenuously and vigorously than ever before with revolutionary  optimism.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated:  Optimistically living and struggling with a faith in victory is  a noble character of revolutionaries.    Revolutionary optimism is an ideological and spiritual  driving force, enabling the people to endlessly embark upon the  revolutionary road. It is also a firm faith in the justness and  invincibility of the revolutionary cause that the party and the  leader [suryong] are leading, as well as a strong revolutionary  spirit to overcome trials and obstacles with a smile without the  slightest vacillation.    For the people to endlessly carry out revolution, they  should  vigorously fight on with revolutionary optimism. Our people are  the proud and revolutionary people who are creating the  socialist heroic epic with revolutionary optimism under the  leadership of the party and the leader [suryong].    The socialist road on which our people have embarked was the  road of an ardent struggle leading to obstacles and trials.  However, our people have vigorously struggled with a firm faith  that one can surely win victory only if one moves forward under  the leadership of the party and the leader [suryong]. As a  result, they could defeat the strong imperialist enemies who  were proud of their numbers and technologies. Also, they could  establish strong, independent, self-reliant, and self-defensive  socialist country on a lump of ashes in which everything was  destroyed. The spirit of revolutionary optimism became a major  spiritual source in leading the people to win a great victory  and to perform a world-shaking miracle in the socialist  construction.    The more we face the difficult and heavy tasks, the more we  make strenuous efforts to implement them filled with conviction  and optimism. This is a traditional trait of our people.    The spirit of revolutionary optimism, which was created from  the beginning by the first generation revolutionaries of the  Korean revolution, has been handed down to generation after  generation. This spirit is also being displayed more highly in  today's struggle in which socialism of our own style is  consummated under the leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il.    Last year, our people could resolutely smash challenges by  the imperialists; firmly safeguard and adhere to the socialist  cause of our own style; and highly demonstrate the might of  chuche Korea. This is because all people are firmly united  around the party and the leader [suryong] and fight on with full  conviction and optimism.    When the country and the revolution were faced with a stern  trial, our people, without any vacillation, turned out as one to  resolutely smash [chitpusida] the enemies' challenges and  aggressive maneuvers with invincible conviction and roaring  spirits, and brilliantly adorned the final year of the Third  Seven-year Plan by vigorously accelerating the socialist  economic construction.    Through the last year's harsh trials and struggle, our  people  have come to cherish deep in their hearts the firm conviction  that as long as we have the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il who  possesses an iron will and seasoned leadership we wil easily win  victory over any formidable enemy and will triumphantly advance  toward the socialist cause.    We have before us glorious yet heavy tasks of vigorously  accelerating the general onward march of socialism so as to add  luster to the socialism of our own style while upholding the  great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year's address.    We are building socialism in a sharp confrontation with the  enemy. By thoroughly carrying out the revolutionary economic  strategy of our party in this year, we should consolidate the  foundations of the nation's independent economy solid as a rock  and further improve the people's standard of living to meet the  socialist requirements.    Today's situation and enormous tasks lying before us call on  all the party members and working people more than ever before  to stir up themselves in a struggle to advance toward a new  victory with revolutionary optimism. The conviction of victory  and revolutionary optimism are our invincible ideological and  spiritual weapon in the general march of socialism at the  present time.    The key to consolidating and developing the single-minded  unity of our revolutionary ranks around the dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong- il as well as the way to create a history of great  revolutionary upsurge by highly displaying the revolutionary  spirit of self- reliance and arduous struggle lie the fact that  all the people have the conviction of victory and revolutionary  optimism.    "Let us strive harder and advance toward a new victory with  revolutionary optimism," this is an important militant slogan  which our party and people must hold high now. When we strive  harder and work militantly with revolutionary optimism, we can  brilliantly fulfill programmatic tasks set forth in the great  leader Comrade Kim Il-song's New Year address and further  display the might of the socialism of our own style.    What is important in winning a new victory, full of  revolutionary optimism, is that the entire people have the  unshakable will and faith that they will surely win when they  advance under the leadership of our party. For those who do the  revolution, there should a spiritual support. Those who have a  strong will and conviction for their party and people do not  waver in whatever circumstances and do not fear of any  difficulties.    The spiritual support for our people is the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il. All the party members and working people  must always keep in mind the conviction of victory and the  future of the revolution, deeply understanding his greatness.  Loudly singing the song "We Will Win Because You Are Leading  Us," we must have a strong will, fearing no difficulty,  adversity and formidable enemy as long as we have the dear  comrade leader.    All the party members and working people must also be firmly  convinced of the invincibility of the cause of the socialism of  our own style which is vigorously advancing under the banner of  the great chuche idea.    Our cause of socialism is a just cause that fulfills the  most  noble idea of the popular masses and an invincible cause that  has been smoothly adhered to without a hitch by withstanding any  upheaval of history. The fact that our country shines as a  fortress of socialism at a time when socialism has been  frustrated in some countries and anti-socialist foul winds sweep  the world displays the invincibility and justness of our  revolutionary cause.    We should deeply realize the superiority of the popular  masses- centered socialism of our own style which provides a  creative and independent livelihood for the popular masses by  comparing our proud reality with the tragic realities of  countries where socialism has been frustrated.    We must fight resolutely with hope for and confidence in  the bright prospects of our economy, which is being developed  vigorously according to the party's revolutionary economic  strategies, and the future when more bountiful and civilized  lives will blossom.    Having revolutionary optimism is all the more important to  guiding officials who command the revolution. Experience shows  that when officials work with overflowing confidence and  optimism, the masses will become enthusiastic and the entire  country will be filled with confidence in victory.    All guiding officials must thoroughly demonstrate, in their  work and lives, the indomitable revolutionary spirit and  revolutionary optimism of the fallen anti-Japanese  revolutionaries who maintained their fidelity as the great  general's revolutionary warriors, saying that they could see a  revolutionary victory even though their eyes had been plucked  out. Our officials must loudly sing songs of struggle filled  with confidence and optimism when they sing; walk filled with  enthusiasm and high spirits when they walk; and always lead  optimistic lives.    To live and fight with revolutionary optimism, our officials  and workers must learn the ideological and spiritual world of  Comrade Yi In-mo. Comrade Yi In-mo has genuine revolutionary  optimism in that he firmly believed in the victory of our  revolutionary cause led by the party and the leader [suryong],  overcame horrible tortures and punishments and persistent  appeasement, and maintained his fidelity as a revolutionary.    Comrade Yi In-mo's noble spiritual world is fully shown in  his poem dedicated to the dear leader. An idea contained in his  dedicated poem is that the road to which the dear comrade leader  is leading us and which he points is the most correct and just  road on which we can always win. Such confidence and will  signifies revolutionary optimism, which we must possess. Such  devotedness is the philosophy of the revolutionaries and leads  one to the revolutionaries' noble spiritual world.    All party members and workers must live, cherishing deep in  their hearts the idea contained in the poem Comrade Yi In-mo  dedicated to the dear comrade leader with single-minded loyalty.    For party organizations of all levels to strengthen  organizational and political work is important for making all  party members and workers strenuously live and fight filled with  revolutionary optimism and confidence. In step with today's  situation and environment, party organizations must give  priority to strengthening education in revolutionary optimism  and the greatness of the party and the leader [suryong].    Party organizations must positively carry out work to make  party members and workers deeply embody the great leader's New  Year address and the decisions of the 21st Plenary Meeting of  the Sixth Party Central Committee. In this way, they must make  the party members and workers speed up their onward march in the  new year with hope for the future and confidence in the  revolution's future.    Revolutionary optimism sharply contrasts with corrupt and  decadent antisocialist trends. Party organizations must keep  reactionary trends -- which the imperialists and the betrayers  of socialism spread -- from infiltrating into our society, and  fill the entire society with vigorous revolutionary spirit.    The people's struggle today is arduous, the future of the  struggle is bright, and a victory is certain.    At the vanguard of our revolution are the dear leader  Comrade  Kim Chong-il, the invincible great party, the invincible  revolutionary Armed Forces, and the strong self-reliant national  economy.    When all people, filled with revolutionary optimism,  courageously march forward with high spirits, the victory will  eternally be ours.    Let us all resolutely march forward to win a new victory  after cherishing deep in our hearts the revolutionary optimism  that they can win victory when they march under the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il's leadership and more single-mindedly unite  around the party and the leader [suryong].</p>

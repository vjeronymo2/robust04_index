			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / GDP climbs back to pre-recession peak The UK economy passed another milestone on the recovery trail in the first quarter of 1994, with gross domestic product finally reclaiming its pre-recession peak of nearly four years ago. The Central Statistical Office said yesterday that first-quarter GDP, at constant prices, was 0.7 per cent higher than in the fourth quarter of last year, and 2.6 per cent above its level in the first quarter of 1993. The rise keeps the economy well on target for the government's forecast of 2.5 per cent full-year growth. The figures, which were in line with expectations, were seen by analysts as evidence that the government would see no need to cut interest rates in the near term. 'I think there is no chance of a move until after the European elections,' said Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets. Some analysts, however, expect the tax increases, which took effect this month, to slow the pace of recovery. Ms Ruth Lea of Lehman Brothers is forecasting 2 1/4 per cent growth for the whole of 1994. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said in Washington yesterday that his ambition was to deliver a recovery with lasting low inflation. However, he admitted that it would take some time for economic improvements to be appreciated by 'the ordinary Joe in the street'. Mr Clarke also said that a lower-than-expected public sector borrowing requirement, announced last week, would not lead the government to be soft on public spending or to make rapid tax cuts. First-quarter GDP, in real terms, climbed back to its level in the second quarter of 1990, having risen by about 4 per cent since its trough in 1992. A good part of this rebound, however, was due to a surge in North Sea oil and gas production. If oil and gas are excluded, GDP grew by 0.6 per cent in the first quarter, and was 2 per cent higher than in the first quarter of 1993. Non-oil GDP is still below its 1990 peak. Services have contributed more than manufacturing to the recovery. While service sector output is now 2 per cent ahead of the levels reached in 1990, manufacturing sector output is still 4-5 per cent below its peak. The CSO said preliminary figures for the first quarter showed that growth was fairly widespread. There were signs of strengthening growth in the construction sector, and of buoyant conditions in the retail, wholesale, hotels and catering sectors. Other statistics published yesterday showed the visible trade deficit with non-European Union countries widened to Pounds 675m in March, from Pounds 640m in February. For the first quarter, the deficit was Pounds 2.12bn, against Pounds 1.77bn in the fourth quarter of 1993.

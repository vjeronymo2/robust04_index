			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovsky; edited by Vladimir  Shishlin; all quotation marks as received]    [Text] Ukraine's Supreme Soviet has not given its backing  to the proposals of several radical politicians to introduce  direct presidential ruling in Crimea. In accordance with the  resolution adopted by the parliament on Wednesday evening, early  next week President Leonid Kravchuk is to submit a list of  measures which can be used by Ukraine's state bodies in case the  Crimean law-makers refuse to abolish legal acts which contradict  to the Ukrainian Constitution.    The Ukrainian parliamentarians also reconfirmed that their  resolution dated 20 May which suspends the decree of the  Republic of Crimea on the restoration of the Crimean  Constitution dated 6 May 1992 is still in force (This decree  stipulates that the relations between Simferopol and Kiev are to  be built on the basis of agreements; it fixes the right of the  Crimean residents for dual citizenship and for the creation of  their own armed formations -- INTERFAX).    The parliament has set up the commission on legal policy to  work out its proposals on introduction of changes into Ukraine's  legislation, which admit "direct abolition of the legal acts of  Crimea's Supreme Soviet," within two weeks." IF Note: Kravchuk  offered to the parliament to form Ukraine's Constitutional court  as soon as possible which will be authorized to abolish all  "illegal" decisions of the power bodies of the Republic of  Crimea. Kravchuk explained the need of its creation by the  restriction of authorities of the Supreme Soviet which, as  Kravchuk said, "can only suspend but not abolish illegal acts of  this autonomy."    Commenting on the resolution adopted by the Ukrainian  deputies, observers point out that it testifies to the adherence  of the absolute majority of the parliamentarians to political  methods to solve the Crimean problems. To this effect experts  point to a small probability of a sharp worsening of relations  between Kiev and Simferopol before the 26 June presidential  elections.    According to the leader of the parliamentary delegation at  the negotiations with the Republic of Crimea Vladimir Butkevich,  "the Ukrainian party must do its utmost it order to halt the  negative processes in Crimea." "We must do our utmost in order  to accomplish this diplomatically without utilization of force."    At the same time observers indicate that the parliament  majority did not support the initiative of the pro-Russian  oriented parliamentary group Yedinstvo (Unity) which had  proposed to ensure the equality of the Ukrainian and Russian  languages in a legal way and to consider a possibility of  Ukraine's transformation into a federation. It also failed to  take into consideration the proposal of the leader of the  inter-regional deputies group Leonid Kuchma to grant "a special  status" to Crimea.    While forecasting further development of events, experts  draw  attention to the recent statements and restrained position of  Ukraine's Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy who declared that  Ukraine's Defense Ministry has not sent a single soldier to  Crimea over the last period of time."    Meanwhile, circles close to Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov  do not rule out possibility that Kravchuk's team can use a tough  scenario. As the leader of the presidential apparatus and the  Crimean government Viktor Minin asserts, "Kiev maintains a  99-percent readiness to introduce presidential ruling in  Crimea." In his interview with INTERFAX Minin declared that the  situation on the peninsular "is used for a struggle at the  highest political level" in Kiev (in this case Meshkov's  spokesman means the wide spread version about Kravchuk's strive  to take advantage of the tension around Crimea in order to  postpone the presidential elections."    As Minin predicts, introduction of a direct ruling in Crimea  may lead to a tough confrontation between Russia and Ukraine.  "Russia will be forced either "to wash itself" or "to react," he  noted and in case President Yeltsin does not undertake any moves  then "Mr Zhirinovsky (leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia -- INTERFAX) and Russian servicemen will urge either  tough measures from this power or replacement of power."</p>

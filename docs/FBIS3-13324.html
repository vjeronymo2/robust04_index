Many conflicting interests have emerged over the  years of the blockade. After Iraq, Jordan has been harmed the  most. It has been subjected to pressure and accused of  violating the blockade and international resolutions. However,  it has maintained its national line, and at the same time, tried  to end the heavy international embargo on the sisterly Iraq.  Jordan has contacted Washington in this regard, the prime  minister paid a visit to the UN Headquarters, and officials have  held talks on this subject with the U.S. secretary of commerce  in Amman. Jordan's attempts have not stopped.    However, some clouds have been noticed recently in  Jordanian-Iraqi relations. What are the reasons and what is the  nature behind this?    Informed sources told us that the United States has begun to  pave the road to Baghdad for its companies via Jordan and that  contacts have been held between Washington and Amman to this  effect. The sources added that the Americans are playing the  card of besieging al-'Aqabah to obtain exceptional privileges  for their companies at the expense of Jordanian companies.  This, the sources added, is rejected by the Jordanian side.    Our sources added that the Iraqi side felt that special  arrangements are under way through which the Americans are  pressuring Jordan. Therefore, the sources said, the Iraqi side  fabricated a trade crisis with the Jordanian Government to  incorporate it in these arrangements instead of forcing it to  submit to their results. This Iraqi stand was explained by a  senior Iraqi official who met two weeks ago with a Jordanian  party delegation. Our sources said that the Iraqis asked the  Jordanian side to inform them of any Jordanian arrangements  regarding trade with Iraq through official correspondence over  the past two months. This was followed by Iraqi measures such  as returning large quantities of Jordanian commodities because  they did not, according to the Iraqis, completely meet their  specifications.    Meanwhile, Iraqi decisionmakers in the economic field talked  with their counterparts in the Jordanian private sector about  pressures exerted by big Iraqi businessmen on their government  to anticipate any surprises that might face them in the future  because Jordan is the most important trade route to the Iraqis.    This picture, which was drawn by our sources, will certainly  be changed by regional and international factors in the near  future.</p>

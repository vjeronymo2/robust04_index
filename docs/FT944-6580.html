			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Arts: Arkhipova and her protege - Recital Last Thursday was Russian Opera Night in London: while the new production of Khovanshchina unfolded at the Coliseum, the great Russian mezzo Irina Arkhipova was holding her Wigmore Hall audience spellbound in a programme devoted mainly to Rimsky-Korsakov songs. Arkhipova, doyenne of Russian singers, is nearing the end of a performing career that has taken her throughout the world and made her a heroine in her homeland, and Thursday's recital, latest offering in the Kirov-Maryinsky Series, may well turn out to have been her final appearance on the London platform. She was in remarkably good vocal shape: though she of course no longer commands the powers of her prime, every phrase was sung with warmth and dramatic intensity. Arkhipova's programme was also an imaginative contribution to the 150th anniversary this year of Rimsky-Korsakov's birth. The composer's 80-or-so songs are scandalously undervalued, far more neglected even than those of Tchaikovsky or Rakhmaninov, and they form an equally rich body of literature. Spanning most of Rimsky's career, the songs reflect his stylistic attachments and - like artists' sketches to finished paintings - contain the essence of ideas developed in the operas. Above all, with texts drawn from writers including Pushkin, Lermontov and Alexis Tolstoy, many of Rimsky's songs are musico-poetic gems. We heard 17 of them, and Arkhipova's performances made clear their range of expression. With rich tone flowing effortlessly, the mezzo sounded in 'Not a sound from the sea' like the proverbial voice of Mother Russia. Arkhipova traversed a range of feeling, from the melancholia of the 'Hebrew Song' and sultriness of 'Southern Night' to the gentle simplicity of 'Quietly evening falls' and bursting happiness of 'The lark sings louder'. One savoured each equally, yet the exquisite 'The clouds begin to scatter' was a highlight of the evening. Ivari Ilya provided masterfully characterised accompaniments. The programme's scope was widened to include music by two of Rimsky's colleagues, Mussorgsky and Borodin, and to allow Arkhipova to introduce one of her proteges, the Bashkirian bass Askar Abdrasakov. Together they sang the duet for Marfa (one of the mezzo's most celebrated roles) and Dosifey from Khovanshchina, before the spotlight was turned on Abdrasakov in his imposing performances of the Trepak from Songs and Dances of Death, Konchak's aria (Prince Igor) and the Viking Guest's song (Sadko). All revealed an instrument - dark, full-toned and focused - of astonishing maturity for a singer so young. Abdrasakov is undoubtedly a name to watch, and his presence here was an indication of Arkhipova's generosity and dedication to the future of her art. The Maryinsky-Kirov Series is supported by the Regent Hotel (London) and British Airways (St Petersburg).</p>

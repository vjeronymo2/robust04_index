			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / International Company News: Overcapacity is catalyst behind PVC merger - Hoechst's and Wacker-Chemie's venture LAST week's announcement by Hoechst, the German chemicals giant, that it was to merge its PVC business with Wacker-Chemie is likely to be the first in a series of rationalisations within this troubled DM6bn (Dollars 3.7bn) industry. The outlook for European PVC producers is bleak. None is making money due to massive overcapacity. Last year, European demand for PVC, a plastic widely used in the construction industry and in packaging, fell about 4 per cent to 5.3m tonnes, according to Mr Erich Schnitzler, executive vice-president of PVC at Hoechst. But that result was achieved when French and German markets were still buoyant. German demand had been rising fast at about 5 per cent, while in France and Italy it had been about 4 per cent. The German economy, Europe's largest, is now slowing, as demonstrated by the poor third-quarter results posted by the German chemicals groups. Hoechst said there had been no sign of improvement in the market in the short or medium terms. 'This makes it necessary to use all possibilities for reducing costs, especially through rationalisation,' the company added. The collapse in PVC demand has been aggravated by rising levels of imports which, according to chemical industry consultants Tecnon, used to represent 4 per cent of the west European market but have now reached about 12 per cent. Imports were about 515,000 tonnes in 1990 and could be as high as 700,000 tonnes this year. Nearly half of PVC imports are from eastern European suppliers. Western European exports are also falling. Not surprisingly, prices have been under pressure. In Germany, Europe's largest market, the price of pipe-grade PVC slumped last year from about DM1.75 a kilogramme to DM1. Attempts to increase prices by about 30 per cent this year not only failed but led to a cartel investigation by the European Commission. Even that increase, if successful, would not have led to profitability for most manufacturers. The industry reckons it needs prices of about DM1.45 to break even. Mr Mike Stanley at Tecnon estimates prices have now fallen to between DM1.03 and DM1.07, from an average of DM1.17 during the second quarter. Some suppliers are selling below DM1. The position of German producers has been aggravated by the recent appreciation of the D-Mark. In this context, rationalisation and plant closures have become imperative. Hoechst has made the first move. A candidate for disposal is Imperial Chemical Industries' 50 per cent stake in EVC, its PVC joint venture with Enichem of Italy, which is Europe's largest manufacturer. Those clearly committed to the sector include Solvay of Belgium and Atochem of France. Hoechst says the merger of the PVC business with that of Wacker-Chemie will allow it to gain critical mass and save costs. The new 50-50 joint venture company will take over all the PVC activities of both groups, excluding only Hoechst's PVC film business. Wacker-Chemie has annual PVC capacity of 365,000 tonnes a year, compared with Hoechst's 250,000 tonnes. The groups have four PVC plants between them, which in 1991 turned over DM880m and employ 1,400 people. Hoechst, which plans 'three-figure' job cuts next year, gave no indications of how many might go as a result of the merger. According to Mr Wolfgang Hilger, Hoechst chairman, the new company would have a 10 per cent share of west European output and could generate synergistic savings of DM50m a year. Such savings look to be increasingly necessary. Hoechst estimates European demand will grow at only 0.5 per cent a year over the next five years. Clearly, price rises and further rationalisation will be necessary if the market is to move back into the black.  --------------------------------------------            European PVC producers              Estimated capacity  --------------------------------------------                                Tonnes (m)  -------------------------------------------- EVC                              1,175 Solvay                             940 Atochem                            705 LVM                                390 Wacker-Chemie                      365 Norsk Hydro                        340 Huls                               300 VEB Schopau                        300 Hoechst                            250 BASF                               250 Rovin                              215 Shell                              205 Aiscondel                          130  --------------------------------------------</p>

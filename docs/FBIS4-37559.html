			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, chairman of the  Presidential Council; Brother 'Abd-al-Rahman 'Ali al-Jifri,  deputy chairman of the Presidential Council; Brother Anis Hasan  Yahya, speaker of the National Assembly; and Brother Haydar  Abu-Bakr al- Attas, the prime minister, have addressed an appeal  to the secretary general of the United Nations and to all  regional and international organizations and bodies. The appeal  says:    The Sanaa regime, as you know, has launched an attack on the  people of the Democratic Republic of Yemen. It has destroyed  villages, looted public and private property, and pillaged  everything in the areas it has managed to occupy. Not even  hospitals have escaped shelling and the theft of equipment which  is subsequently dispatched to the north. The hospitals are then  converted into weapons and ammunition depots. [Words indistinct]  Ibn Khaldun Hospital donated by the fraternal State of Kuwait.  [passage omitted]    The situation in all the occupied areas, particularly in the  villages and the areas where battles have taken place, shows  signs of a health disaster due to the northern forces'  abandonment of their dead, who are left to rot. Sometimes they  (?bury) them in an inhuman way by using tractors but the wind  removes the sand covering them. Bodies are exposed causing a  great deal of (?distress). The Sanaa regime, which is not  concerned about its own citizens, alive or dead, cannot be  concerned about our citizens and cannot be a regime [word  indistinct] the destiny of our people. [passage omitted]    His Excellency Lakhdar Brahimi came as an envoy of the UN  secretary general and we heard his initiatives with all  seriousness. He did not need to waste his time with us. In  fact he spent no more than 24 hours in the Democratic Republic  of Yemen. He left the country after meeting the Brother  President 'Ali Salim al- Bid, the brother prime minister, and  his deputies in two meetings in which he found responsiveness to  all his initiatives and proposals. He spent five days in Sanaa  but was unable to convince the Sanaa regime to respond in a  practical way to UN Security Council Resolution Number 924 or  any other initiative. In Cairo he also spent two days trying to  convince Sanaa about his initiative but to no avail, whereas he  found from all of us responsiveness and serious [word  indistinct]. [passage omitted]    In view of the foregoing, we appeal to the world,  represented  by the UN secretary general, international organizations, and  all countries to move speedily with the aim of achieving the  following objectives:    1. Stop the barbarous attacks on the residential quarters of  Aden and the destruction of vital installations in which  hundreds have been killed and wounded.    2. Put an end to this crazy war which has no justification  whatsoever according to religion, law, or norms. The Sanaa  regime is challenging the whole world by means of this war.    3. Effect a complete withdrawal from the territory of the  Democratic Republic of Yemen and prevent any troop concentration  on its borders.    4. Force this totalitarian regime to pay compensation for  all the material and human losses it has inflicted on the  people, territory, installations, and equipment of the  Democratic Republic of Yemen. It was this regime which declared  war and launched the aggression. It has continued its  aggression, rejecting all international resolutions and appeals  and challenging international legitimacy.    5. Provide urgent (?medical) treatment and assistance for  our citizens in the areas occupied in the Governorates of Lahij,  Abyan, and Shabwah; protect the citizens there from repressive  measures, looting, and pillaging of their possessions and public  property; and oversee and repair water and electricity services.  It should be stressed that such assistance must not be provided  through the Sanaa regime but under the direct supervision of the  international organizations.    7. [number as heard] We ask the Arab and Muslim countries  and the friendly countries of the world to recognize the  Democratic Republic of Yemen as a sovereign and independent  state and to accept its membership in all organizations and  bodies -- regional, Arab and international -- since the Sanaa  regime lost all lawful, constitutional, and international  legitimacy after declaring war on our Republic and after  rejecting all the resolutions and appeals from the international  community.    The Sanaa regime cannot be trusted any more, even with the  lives, possessions, and destiny of its own people in the north.  How can we trust such a regime with our people in the  Democratic Republic of Yemen? The Democratic Republic of Yemen  is not a new thing, as it was, originally, a sovereign  independent state. It attempted to set up a union with the  Yemen Arab Republic neither committed itself to nor respected.  It has now been confirmed that the Sanaa regime does not respect  or uphold any local or international agreements and rules.  Consequently it has lost all legitimacy and cannot make claims  in the name of a previous unity, which it has itself destroyed,  or under any other pretext.    The Sanaa regime is not the inheritor of any history or  legacy or religion. It has not been mandated with this.  Consequently the declaration of the Democratic Republic of  Yemen is a return to an original position and not a new thing or  an invention.    The Democratic Republic of Yemen is committed to the Arab  League Charter and to the UN Charter as well as to all other  international organizations. It is also committed to all legal  agreements in force concluded during the period of the Yemeni  Republic which apply to the territory and [word indistinct] of  the Democratic Republic of Yemen. We pledge to preserve the  interests of others in our country, and to cooperate and work  seriously to achieve security and stability in the region and  the world.    The international community bears a political and  humanitarian responsibility vis-a-vis the situation in our  country. We are confident that it will assume that  responsibility to achieve and preserve the interests of people  and their political, economic, social, and cultural rights and  ensure security and stability in the region and the world.</p>

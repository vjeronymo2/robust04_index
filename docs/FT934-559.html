			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Paris shrugs off industry gloom The Paris stock market yesterday hit an all-time high despite publication of gloomy economic statistics revealing a steep decline in industrial production during October. The announcement by the Insee state statistics institute that industrial and manufacturing output fell 0.7 per cent and 1.4 per cent respectively during the month had no tangible effect on enthusiasm for French equities. The CAC 40 Index continued its recent bull run by beginning the day's trading with a rise to a record 2,239.7. It rallied again during the afternoon to close at a new high of 2,243,02, an increase of 0.77 per cent over the previous day. However, the franc faltered on the publication of the poor production figures which came on the heels of Wednesday's announcement that household consumption had fallen 1.6 per cent last month. The franc, which earlier this month returned to its old European exchange rate mechanism trading bands for the first time since the summer currency crisis, rose during the morning only to lose momentum. It closed in Paris at FFr3.4079 against the D-Mark, compared with FFr3.4074 on Wednesday. Mr Edmond Alphandery, economy minister, sought to play down the significance of the gloomy economic news by claiming that French economy was in a 'pre-recovery stage'. Mr Alphandery pointed to the strength of the bourse, recent reductions in interest rates and the mildly optimistic tone of some recent business confidence surveys as encouraging omens for the future. The minister said the cabinet would assess next month the general prospects for the economy and decide whether it was necessary to implement special reflationary measures, thereby echoing earlier statements made by Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister. In the meantime, the government has decided to extend its support for small and medium-sized companies by providing a capital injection of FFr500m (Pounds 57m) to Credit d'Equipement des PME (CEPME), an institution that provides credit to the small corporate sector. The government will keep control of monetary policy until a new monetary policy council at the Bank of France is named and installed, Mr Alphandery said, Reuter reports from Paris.</p>

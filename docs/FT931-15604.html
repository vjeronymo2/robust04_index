			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Observer: Refresher If yesterday's stormy Trafalgar House annual meeting is anything to go by, the group should speed up its search for a new chairman to replace poor old Alan Clements who has been left holding the helm. Clements, an ex-ICI finance director, may be jolly good at adding up the figures but he is not the best of persons to control a rowdy AGM and restore the confidence of small shareholders, still smarting from a slashed dividend. His diffident and often defensive performance allowed the meeting to drag on for over two and a half hours - well past lunch time. As any seasoned chairman should know, it is not wise to keep small shareholders waiting such a long time for their customary refreshments.</p>

			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Rapid cable growth expected The UK cable communications industry is entering a period of potentially explosive growth and could be a multi-billion revenue business by the year 2000, say two City studies. Lehman Brothers, which has considerable experience of the industry in the US, believes that, at a cost of Pounds 7bn, cable for television and telecommunications services will be available to 13.5m UK homes by the next century. Given what the investment bank describes as a 'modest expectation' that about 45 per cent of people who can subscribe to cable do so, it says industry revenues should exceed Pounds 5bn a year. Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank that was recently appointed financial adviser to TeleWest, the largest cable operator in Britain, says cable is at last achieving dramatic growth. The improved economics of combined television and telephone network operation are mainly responsible for this. Kleinwort says that, on conservative assumptions, by the year 2000 the television side should produce annual revenues of Pounds 1bn with telecommunications adding a further Pounds 1.6bn. It argues that the UK cable industry presents the world's first opportunity to invest in broadband networks that will act as 'information super-highways'. They will be able to carry a potentially vast range of entertainment, communications, multi-media and interactive services. Lehman notes that so far the local appetite for cable investment has been minimal. The industry was now rapidly gaining credibility and its viability was increasingly demonstrable. 'Those who wait for further evidence and delay investment face the prospect of an entry price that much higher,' it says. The Lehman study says that five leading cable companies are considering equity financing with the prospect of a London listings 'a very real possibility'. The five are TeleWest, a TCI-US West joint venture, Bell Canada, General Cable, Jones Cable and Comcast.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mechyslaw Hryb, chairman of Belarusian </F> Supreme Soviet, by Valeriy Kovalev under "Interlocutor of the  Day" rubric; place and date not given: "We Are Interested in  Union With Russia. We Do Not Conceal This Fact"]    [Text]  <H5>  Visiting Card </H5>   Mechyslaw Ivanavich Hryb, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of  the Republic of Belarus. He was born in the village of Savichi,  Dyatlovskiy Rayon, Grodno Oblast, in 193? [precise date  illegible]. His father died at the front in 1945. He graduated  from the Lvov Fire Technical School of the Ministry of Internal  Affairs. Later he graduated by correspondence from the law  faculty of the Belarusian State University and worked in  internal affairs organs. His last post before being elected a  deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Belarus in 1990  was as chief of Vitebsk Internal Affairs Administration. In  parliament he headed the Standing Commission on National  Security, Defense, and the Fight Against Crime.    He was elected to his present post 28 January 1994. He is a  lieutenant general in the reserve.    [Kovalev] Mechyslaw Ivanavich, your election to the post of  chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Belorusia [Belarus] came as a  surprise to many people. Moreover, you won in a contest with  two other aspirants who had, as they say, a clear advantage....    [Hryb] Quite honestly, the voting results came as a surprise  to me too. I was not burning with a desire to take up the post  of Supreme Soviet chairman, realizing perfectly well what a  heavy burden this would prove to be, given the situation that  had taken shape in the Republic. When my candidacy was proposed  at a session of the Supreme Soviet Presidium, I refused  categorically at first. But members of the Presidium persuaded  me to run, and my deputy colleagues supported me by voting for  me. After that there was no getting out of it, and I had to get  down to work....    [Kovalev] It has to be thought that you are familiar with  the views of certain of the mass media on your election. In  particular, IZVESTIYA viewed the replacement of the Belorusian  parliament's leadership as a "quiet," procommunist, nomenklatura  coup....    [Hryb] These are nothing but journalists' fabrications. We  have had no coups -- neither quiet nor noisy. The majority of  the deputies simply elected in a legal, constitutional manner  the person whom they evidently trust more. In all parliaments  in the world a representative of the majority is elected  speaker, not one of the minority. If he suddenly stops  expressing the opinion of this majority, someone is elected in  his place. Then again, any coup, if one really takes place,  pursues the aim of changing the former course. But we still  abide by all the previously concluded treaties and agreements,  and we still intend to build a market economy and a democratic  state. It is only to be regretted that individual journalists  invent something that does not, in fact, exist.    [Kovalev] All the same, Mechyslaw Ivanavich, how would you  define your position in the political spectrum?    [Hryb] I am not now a member of any parties, movements, or  factions. I adhere to a firm principle: Party membership and  excessive political blinkeredness might affect the objectivity  of judgments and decisionmaking by the state's top official. I  am ready to cooperate -- I say this sincerely -- with  representatives of any trends, ranging from extreme  right-wingers to extreme left-wingers, if they have an equally  sincere wish to work in the name of the Republic's interests.  My aim is to find accord and to reach a consensus, although I  realize that it is a supercomplex task to unite left- and  right-wingers, but it is possible and necessary to seek a  compromise when resolving individual questions -- within the  bounds of what is reasonable, of course.    [Kovalev] The adoption of the Republic's new Constitution  was, to a certain extent, confirmation of the correctness of  your position. Contrary to predictions, the constitutional  process, which had long been marking time, has gotten moving.  Although, as far as I know, both the parliamentary opposition  --the Belorusian People's Front -- and the communists' faction  had serious objections to many points in the Fundamental Law....    [Hryb] Yes, there were many disagreements -- fundamental  ones, too. It is probably immodest to view this as being to the  personal credit of the Supreme Soviet chairman, and yet I  believe that I succeeded in convincing the majority of deputies  that there must be no more delay: The Republic cannot go on  living without clarity in the state system.    [Kovalev] The new Constitution is a very long document, and  it is hard to evaluate it in a few words. And yet....    [Hryb] I believe that we have adopted a normal democratic  constitution of a normal democratic state. It was worked on for  more than two-and-a-half years. During that time it underwent  more than one expert juridical appraisal, including abroad, when  it was confirmed that it complies with international legal  norms. Human rights take pride of place in the Constitution,  the state system of Belorusia as a sovereign, unitary, social,  legal power is clearly defined, and the powers of the  legislature, the executive, and the judiciary are separated. I  believe it is destined to have a long life. Of course, certain  changes might be made -- there are no limits to perfection --  but it will hardly be necessary to alter the spirit of the  Fundamental Law cardinally. It accords with the interests of our  society and with the aims we have set ourselves.    [Kovalev] However, significant and important an event for  Belorussia the adoption of the new Constitution was, it does  not, alas, push into the background the many very acute problems  which the country has encountered. What, in your view, is the  root of the troubles? Why does the Republic, which always stood  firmly on its feet, now find itself in such a complex situation?    [Hryb] The main reason is obvious: the breakup of the former  Union. Name just one Republic where people are prospering  today. There are difficulties everywhere, problems everywhere.  Therefore, I find it hard to agree with the assertion by the  former speaker of our parliament, who declared recently that he  was proud of his involvement in signing the agreement at  Viskuli. I believe, however, that, since the Soviet Union was  fated to die, it was necessary to do everything possible to make  that process less dramatic and less painful. To go our separate  ways with the smallest losses in the economy, to maintain ties,  to adopt clear pledges, not to try to survive at the expense of  others. Unfortunately, it all happened according to the worst  scenario. We have what we have. But what is the point in  grieving? We must seek the way out of the present situation.  Nobody will do this for us.    [Kovalev] On what do you pin hopes of a better future for  the Republic?    [Hryb] Above all, on our people, who are sensible,  competent, calm, industrious, and patient. I very much hope  that they will not have to resolve all their problems on their  own. We do not conceal our vital interest in union with Russia.  Our countries are very closely linked in all spheres, and our  peoples have regarded each other as brothers from time  immemorial. Even if we take a purely pragmatic look at our  ties, then -- and this is a fact -- more than 70 percent of all  the industrial output produced in Belorussia is delivered to the  east. Who, now or in the very near future, could take Russia's  place as our trading partner?    [Kovalev] But Belorusian national radicals are being heard  to say that such a one-sided orientation threatens a loss of  sovereignty for the Republic and its transformation into a  virtual colony of Russia....    [Hryb] This talk is groundless. Let us investigate. Does  the Russian leadership really impose political terms on us? No,  we are talking of an economic union, of which there are many in  the world. Incidentally, those who believe that integration is  advantageous to our country alone are mistaken. Pardon me, but  Russia is also interested in Belorusia in terms of many  parameters. True, we hardly have any of our own energy sources,  and we have few raw materials, but we are in an advantageous  strategic, geopolitical position, and there is transit of gas,  oil, and huge freight flows via our territory. Russia needs the  output of our enterprises, including defense output. So we are  not poor relations, and we build our ties with our eastern  neighbor on an equitable, mutually advantageous basis.  Regarding political unification, which allegedly threatens our  sovereignty, there have been and are no top-level talks on this  topic. Russia does not encroach upon Belorusia's independence  -- I state this unequivocally. The precise conclusion of an  economic union between our states is now on the agenda. The  unification of the monetary systems of Russia and Belorusia must  be the first step toward this. Unfortunately, this is a very  protracted matter.    Finally, it is necessary to decide: What is to be done  now? If it is not possible to sign the treaty in its entirety,  let us bring it into force in sections, on which the sides have  already reached accord. For example, on lifting customs  barriers and on tax policy, if this does not work, it means that  it is necessary to draw up a new text of the agreement. Just  one thing is inadmissible: to sit idly by and watch the  destruction of the age-old ties between our peoples. Our  descendants will never forgive us for that.    [Kovalev] Mechyslaw Ivanavich, with the adoption of the new  Constitution the first presidential election clearly looms  ahead. Who, in your view, might win it?    [Hryb] I believe that the candidate for those forces which  represent the majority in the present parliament is most likely  to win. I will refrain from a more specific prognosis, for the  official registration of candidates is still to come.    [Kovalev] Do you intend to run for the presidency?    [Hryb] I have not yet decided. I must give serious thought  to everything and weigh it up -- it is too crucial a step.    [Kovalev] Do you not exclude the possibility that a  representative of the Belorussian People's Front might attain  presidential power? You will agree that in that case  Belorusia's foreign policy priorities might undergo serious  changes -- the opposition has never concealed its anti-Russian  sentiments....    [Hryb] I do not believe that this will happen. Any  realistically thinking politician must reckon with the fact that  the majority of the republic's population pins its hopes of a  better life on Russia. Therefore, attempts by any of the  contenders to play the anti-Russian card during the election  campaign are doomed to fail. The people will not support such a  politician -- I am sure of this.    [Kovalev] Before being elected to the post of Supreme Soviet  chairman you headed the parliamentary Commission on National  Security, Defense, and the Fight Against Crime. You are now ex  officio chairman of the Republic's Security Council and supreme  commander in chief of the Armed Forces. How would you rate the  condition of the national army today?    [Hryb] In my view we have succeeded in creating perfectly  battle-worthy armed forces. Their reduction and reorganization  have taken place and are taking place strictly according to  plan. The process of reforming the army will be virtually  complete by 1 January 1995, and it will attain its optimum  strength of approximately 100,000. This does not mean, however,  that there are no problems in military organizational  development. The chief problem is the shortage of funds to buy  hardware, arms, fuels and lubricants, spare parts, ammunition,  and much besides that the troops need. The situation is  complicated by the fact that the enterprises that exist on the  Republic's territory are now able to meet only approximately 3  percent of hardware and armament requirements and to repair just  2 percent of the more than 4,000 existing models of these. In  this connection the question of close cooperation with other  countries -- with Russia above all -- in the military sphere is  once again thrown into sharp relief. This is the very reason  why I always advocated Belorussia's subscribing to the CIS  Collective Security Treaty.    And yet, despite the considerable difficulties, I hope that  we will succeed in maintaining the combat potential of the  Belorusian Armed Forces at the proper level. Even under the  present complex conditions we have not allowed the curtailment  of the training process in the armed forces. Measures are being  taken to enhance the prestige of military service and  servicemen's social protection. Work has begun on creating a  military academy in the interests of resolving the Army's  personnel problems.    [Kovalev] But approximately 25,000 servicemen of Russia's  Strategic Forces are also stationed on the Republic's  territory....    [Hryb] I am sure that Russian officers and soldiers do not  feel out of place on Belorusian soil. None of us will ever call  them occupiers. Incidentally, we are not raising the question  of an accelerated Russian troop withdrawal -- here everything is  proceeding according to the agreed schedule, with due regard for  the wishes of the Russian side. The Belorusian Ministry of  Defense has established good, comradely ties with colleagues in  the Russian military department. I hope that this will continue  to be the case.    I would like to take this opportunity to send very best  wishes to KRASNAYA ZVEZDA's readers and to the editorial  collective. Your newspaper seeks to provide objective and  balanced coverage of events occurring in our Republic and in its  Armed Forces. This is valued highly nowadays.</p>

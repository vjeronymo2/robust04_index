			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAVORY PRIZE;  </P> <P> 2 COUPLES DINE A LA OIL TANKER  </P> <P> The Martins and the Utechts arrived at the dock gate in a cream-colored Jaguar,  ready to be whisked aboard the huge, multimillion-dollar ship for their $400  dinner.  </P> <P> They had waited months for this. "I don't know of anyone else who's done it,"  Francis Utecht said.  </P> <P> The menu for this intimate supper for four had been created just that morning.  It featured chicken a la king, steak, pork chops, fried onions, salad with  Wishbone dressing and chocolate chip ice cream.  </P> <P> The dining room's major decorative motif was vinyl. The place mats were red  plastic, which accented the red in the Del Monte ketchup bottle in the middle  of the white table cloth.  </P> <P> The waitress wore slacks, a pullover and a white jacket with frayed, cut-off  sleeves. There was no maitre d' and no sommelier.  </P> <P> But then, this was the Arco Alaska, and Dorothy and Al Martin and Grace and  Francis Utecht, neighbors in Naples, one of Long Beach's posh addresses, were  getting exactly what they had paid for: dinner on an oil tanker.  </P> <P> The Utechts bid for the meal and a tour of the ship at a local Legal Aid  Foundation fund-raising auction last spring, paying $400 for the dinner, which  had been donated to Legal Aid by Arco Transportation Co.  </P> <P> The Arco Alaska is no play ship and the visitors did not play.  </P> <P> The tanker is all muscle, nearly a fifth of a mile long, with enough girth to  haul more than a million gallons of crude oil down the Pacific Coast from  Valdez, Alaska, to Long Beach's refineries.  </P> <P> Activities before dinner included a 90-minute inspection of pumps, pipes, the  decidedly unluxurious living quarters of the 25-member crew, and the bridge.  After dinner, the guests descended to the heat and clamor of the boiler room.  </P> <P> The meal lasted about 30 minutes. The captain had gone ashore to have dinner  with his family before the ship's departure for Alaska in the middle of the  night. There were not even any oil-spill jokes about the Exxon Valdez.  </P> <P> "What do you recommend?" Dorothy Martin inquired of the waitress, a former  office manager from Seattle lured to the Arco Alaska by the 45 paid days off  she gets after 75 days on board.  </P> <P> "Well, the steak looks good. Actually it all does," replied Michelle Campbell,  the waitress, who said the fare on the Alaska "is as good as I eat at home."  </P> <P> "I haven't had a pork chop in ages," Martin remarked. She later declared the  food "delicious." For dessert she ordered cake with chocolate frosting.  Everyone else had ice cream from a selection in the dining room freezer.  </P> <P> As boat lovers, the couples were intrigued by the idea of seeing the inner  workings of one of the huge tankers that dwarf their pleasure craft in Long  Beach Harbor. The Martins have a 53-foot sailboat and the Utechts have several  boats. Al Martin, an architect, had a further interest in the tanker. He has  designed several buildings for Arco, including the company's downtown office  tower.  </P> <P> "It was worth more than my money's worth," Utecht, a patent attorney, said of  his three hours on the ship. "That's something the average person can't buy."  </P></p>

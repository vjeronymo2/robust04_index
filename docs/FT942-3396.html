			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / New Parents' Charter costs Pounds 3m About Pounds 3m is to be spent on producing a revised Parents' Charter and sending it to every household in England and Wales, Mr John Patten, the education secretary, said yesterday. The charter sets out a new 'annual report' which parents will receive in June or July each year, providing local and national benchmarks for surplus places, staying-on rates, and examination performance against which their own children's schools can be judged. The new report, which will be distributed through schools, is added to a series of existing rights to information which the charter gives to parents. These include an annual report from the school about their child's progress, a report about the school once every four years from Ofsted, the government's independent inspectorate, national 'league tables' for schools and local education authorities, and an annual prospectus from each school. The Parents' Charter includes no guarantees for redress, however. Mr Patten said that pupils' ability was so variable that schools could not be required to educate every child to a given level of qualifications. But it sets out parents' rights of appeal if they fail to find a place for their child in their first-choice school, and also sets out voting rights for electing boards of governors. Parent's duties are also included. Mr Patten said: 'Discipline begins at home. Children learn a great deal in their earliest years. This means that parents, relatives and friends have a big responsibility.' Parents' organisations reacted angrily to the expense involved. The National Confederation of Parent-Teacher Associations complained that the government had failed to give parents the right to set up their own association without a headteacher's consent. The Campaign for State Education, a pressure group, launched a rival charter which laid down requirements for educational inputs, as well as outputs. It would limit class sizes to a maximum of 30, and require a guarantee that all buildings were safe. Ms Margaret Tulloch, secretary of Case, said that varying provision between local authorities meant state education was a 'lottery'. 'Parents should be able to know that when they send their child to school, no matter where it is, they can expect the same minimum standards on class sizes and equipment,' she said.</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Pakistan regret on kidnapped Britons: Call to free Kashmiri fighters The Pakistani government yesterday expressed regret that the two Britons, Kim Housego and David Mackie, kidnapped by gunmen in Indian-administered Kashmir last week, had still not been released. A foreign office official in Islamabad also called on the Indian government to release Kashmiri fighters, detained 'in violation of all legal, moral and humanitarian norms'. The relatives of the two captives had earlier approached Pakistani authorities to use their influence. The group holding the hostages, the Harkat-ul-Ansar, has offices in both Indian and Pakistani-administered Kashmir territories. A number of groups of Kashmiri activists, as well as the semi-autonomous government of the Pakistani-administered side, have called on the captors to release the two hostages. Mr Mohammed Farooq Kashmiri, leader of the group, says he has ordered his mujahideen (freedom fighters) to release them. But the group says it is not able to ensure the release due to an Indian military presence in the area where the captives are being kept. Indian officials have assured Mr David Housego, a former Financial Times Journalist and Kim's father, that the gunmen will be given safe passage if they agree to return the two Britons. But it is not clear if such assurances will satisfy the gunmen.</p>

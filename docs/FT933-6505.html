			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Engineering orders look 'uncertain and fragile' SALES and orders figures for the UK engineering industry in the second quarter of the year show little change on the first quarter, reflecting weak home demand and sustained but fragile export growth. Figures from the Central Statistical Office, released yesterday, showed sales for the industry up by half of 1 per cent on the first quarter at constant 1985 prices seasonally adjusted with export sales up 4 per cent and home sales down 2 per cent. Net new orders dropped by half of 1 per cent on the previous quarter. In comparison with the second quarter of last year, sales and net new orders remain sharply up, with sales 6 per cent ahead and orders 7 per cent ahead. Total orders for the industry at the end of June were down 1.5 per cent on the first quarter, but up 2 per cent on the figure for June 1992. Export growth was particularly strong in the electronics sector, with mechanical engineering sales growing less fast. At current prices, electrical and instrument engineering sales were Pounds 10.3bn in the second quarter, 12 per cent up on the same quarter last year. By contrast, mechanical engineering sales were Pounds 7.7bn, only 2 per cent up. Electrical and instrument engineering orders-on-hand were worth Pounds 19.9bn for the second quarter, against Pounds 19.2bn for the second period of 1992. Mechanical engineering orders-on-hand were down from Pounds 11.8bn to Pounds 11.6bn over the same period, although new orders were up from Pounds 7.6bn to Pounds 7.8bn. Mr Ian Thompson, economic adviser to the Engineering Employers' Federation, said: 'The trend is generally upwards, but it is very uncertain and fragile; our major export market is western Europe, but that market is by no means secure.' The electronics sector is continuing to benefit from the surge of sales at the end of last year, although it points to evidence of sales slowing in the motor vehicles sector.</p>

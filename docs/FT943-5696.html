			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Lonrho directors avoid battle with a 'civilised option': Bock v Rowland It was clear that Mr Tiny Rowland had won another remarkable victory over his fellow Lonrho directors when half way through yesterday's boardroom meeting an ambiguous statement was issued to the Stock Exchange. The statement, dismissing so-called speculation about Mr Rowland's future but raising questions over his remuneration package, was put out on the instructions of Mr Robert Dunlop, deputy chairman, and one of Mr Rowland's closet allies. Mr Rowland said nothing at the meeting. He knew he did not have to. He had already heard an hour and half before it started that the three non-executives had decided that a row over his possible premature departure had to be avoided at all costs. Mr Peter Harper, a director of Hanson, Sir John Leahy, a former ambassador to South Africa and Mr Stephen Walls, chairman of Albert Fisher Group, had all been appointed to the Lonrho board by Mr Dieter Bock, the German financier with 18.8 per cent of the shares. Mr Bock had been convinced that the three would support his moves to remove Mr Rowland as joint chief executive. But one of the non-executives said yesterday: 'An orderly and civilised option was preferable to a row which could have damaged the company.' Mr Bock is said to believe that he still achieved an important victory over Mr Rowland, albeit of less significance that he originally planned. The board statement made it clear that the company 'continually has under review the ongoing expense levels at head office'. This was interpreted by those close to Mr Bock as giving the company's remuneration committee the authority to investigate Mr Rowland's expenses. Further details also emerged of the Pounds 5.5m a year which Mr Rowland costs the company in salary, expenses and other charges under his direct control. In the nine months to June 30 1994, just under Pounds 200,000 had been spent from a 'hotels' expenses account on politicians and business contacts. In the same period, there were also so-called 'special payments' in the UK of about Pounds 190,000, Kenyan expenses of Pounds 250,000 and Zimbabwe charges of Pounds 80,000. South African expenses were more than Pounds 80,000 for eight months to May 31. The company was also charged more than Pounds 110,000 for Mr Rowland's domestic staff in 1993. In addition, there are annual charges of about Pounds 200,000 for the education of the dependants of African politicians and business contacts and a contribution of more than Pounds 450,000 to the costs of Mr Rowland's homes in Belgravia and Buckinghamshire. His basic salary exceeds Pounds 1.2m. A Lonrho employee said: 'The company has traditionally been run a bit like a government, in the sense that sums of money were voted for various general purposes to particular directors, who then had considerable discretion over how they were disbursed.' But irrespective of whether the disclosure of Mr Rowland's costs have made his position untenable in the medium term, he has bought time in his battle with Mr Bock. In 1973, Mr Basil Small-peice led a majority on the board which pressed for Mr Rowland's resignation. They were persuaded by Mr Rowland to allow him time to sell his shares - which accounted for about 20 per cent of the company. But instead of resigning Mr Rowland turned the tables on the so-called 'straight eight' whom he ensured were dismissed at a subsequent extraordinary general meeting. More than two decades later, Mr Rowland has only 6.5 per cent of the shares. Mr Bock may still have the upper hand but he has suffered his first defeat in his attempt to wrest control from Mr Rowland. Editorial comment, Page 15</p>

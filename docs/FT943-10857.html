			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Explosion hits PNG gold mine Eleven people were missing last night, following an explosion at the Porgera goldmine in Papua New Guinea's remote Enga Province, Nikki Tait reports from Sydney. The mine, one of the world's largest, is owned jointly by Renison Goldfields, in which Britain's Hanson group holds a large minority stake; Highlands Gold, controlled by Queensland's MIM; Placer Pacific, which is part of Canada's Placer Dome and also manages the mine; and the Papua New Guinea government. Five of those missing were said to be Australians, and others Papua New Guinea nationals. The Porgera partners said the explosion had resulted in a fire in the storage area which was being brought under control. The cause of the blast, they added, was not yet determined. All mining and milling operations were suspended yesterday. The mine produced 1.46m ounces of gold in 1992. But like many mining projects in PNG, Porgera has been controversial, partly because of vigorous local compensation demands, and partly because its higher-than-expected output levels prompted the PNG government to demand a bigger share of the project.</p>

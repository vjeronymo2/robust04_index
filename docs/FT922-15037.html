			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Japanese companies face a legacy of the bull market: The consequences of refinancing Dollars 160bn in warrant and convertible bonds which mature within three years THE protracted weakness of the Tokyo stock market, highlighted by the plunge of the Nikkei index below 18,300 yesterday, means that Japanese companies will have to refinance vast sums of equity-linked debt raised in the late 1980s. The scale of redemptions is immense: Dollars 36bn (Pounds 20bn) warrant and convertible bonds issued by Japanese companies mature this year, Dollars 83.9bn in 1993 and Dollars 40.3bn in 1994. The bonds were issued at the height of the bull market in Japanese equities. Investors were prepared to accept very low interest payments because the bonds were linked to rising share prices. However, with the Nikkei index at around 18,000 almost all outstanding warrant and convertible bonds are 'under water' - the exercise price is above the current share price. Unless share prices stage a dramatic recovery, few of the warrants to buy new shares will be exercised and few convertible bonds will be converted into equity. Instead, the debt will have to be repaid. One option is for companies to issue equity-linked bonds, priced to reflect lower share prices. International appetite for warrant or convertible bonds is tied to the fortunes of the equity market, which shows no signs of recovery. Without a sustained recovery in share prices, even matching the Dollars 26bn equity-linked finance raised last year will be difficult. Moreover, the Japanese authorities are backing moves designed to stimulate the stock market which will block many companies from issuing new convertible or warrant bonds. The Japan Securities Dealers Association recently issued a guideline which prevents companies which pay out less than 30 per cent of profits in dividends from raising equity-linked finance. This will force many Japanese companies either to raise dividends or forgo equity-linked funding. Where new warrant and convertible bond issues cannot be made, companies will have to rely on straight debt, raised either from banks or the international bond market. The ability of Japanese banks to lend is also linked to the stock market: falling share prices erode unrealised gains on banks' large securities portfolios, which count as capital. As share prices fall, the capital resources of banks deteriorates and their incremental capacity to lend is reduced. With the Nikkei index below 20,000, many Japanese banks are close to the 8 per cent capital-to-assets ratio demanded by the Basle Accord, which comes into full effect next year. The bond market may be a more reliable source of debt finance, although the threat of a large number of new issues could depress bond prices in Japan and internationally. There are already signs of this. Mr Richard Grey, bond analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London, said: 'The decision to lift restrictions on corporate bond issuance this week was a major factor behind the weakness of the Japanese government bond market. Investors see the threat of a large supply of corporate bonds.' Against this background, bankers see the need for Japanese companies to tap less obvious sources of capital, such as private placements of 'structured' debt securities with institutional investors. However, while corporate financiers see refinancing of equity-linked debt as a potentially huge source of fee income, economists suggest some companies may not need new finance. Industrial companies such as TDK and Mitsubishi Corporation have said maturing warrant and convertible bond issues will not be refinanced. Redemption payments will be met from operating cash flow and sales of financial assets. Mr Peter Norton, head of research at Baring Securities in Tokyo, said corporate liquidity in Japan remains abnormally high in spite of the economic slow-down. 'Many of the factors which will depress reported profits this year are non-cash charges such as depreciation and investment revaluations,' he said. In addition, many Japanese companies still have hoards of financial assets - equities, bonds and money-market instruments - built up during the late 1980s. Most of these assets are held in tokkin funds, trusts which allow Japanese companies to account separately for investments and convert the capital gain from rising share prices into a cash dividend. By the end of 1989, tokkin funds held Y38,000bn (Pounds 163.8bn) assets, about 40 per cent in equities. This figure has been eroded and now stands at around Y28,000bn. Assets have been sold to raise cash for investment or to repay maturing debt. Further liquidations are expected this year, including Y6,000bn of domestic equities. Selling of equity investments by tokkin funds was a factor behind the falling share prices in March. More selling could depress equity prices, making it more difficult for companies without tokkin assets to raise equity-linked finance and more difficult for Japanese banks to lend. Moreover, as the Japanese economy moves into recession, corporate cash flow will be squeezed. It also remains to be seen how many companies can afford to liquidate financial assets - and crystallise paper losses - to repay debt. In addition, it is clear that the cost of capital for Japanese companies has risen sharply. This could have negative implications for the stock market in the longer term. 'The cost structure of business corporations will be fundamentally changed by higher interest expenses,' said Mr Yuichi Kohashi, deputy general manager of the investment advisory department at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo. 'If this leads to a slower recovery in earnings, it will have a direct impact on the level of the stock market.'</p>

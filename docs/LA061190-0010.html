			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : DAYNE UPGRADES WEAK MATERIAL WITH SOULFUL SINGING  </P> <P> Singer Taylor Dayne had years of operatic training to fine-tune her  mezzo-soprano voice. When she cranks it up, as she did often at the Greek  Theatre on Friday, it's dazzling.  </P> <P> Too often, though, that voice was wasted.  </P> <P> Dayne's problem has always been that her material isn't good enough to provide  an adequate showcase for her glowing voice. Her two albums boast a batch of Top  10 singles -- but none are first-rate songs. Some of her biggest hits have been  ballads sporting schmaltzy lyrics, like "Love Will Lead You Back" and "I'll  Always Love You."  </P> <P> Still, alternating between R&amp;B wailing and Tina Turner-style belting, Dayne  did manage to upgrade some below-average material by singing soulfully and with  sheer ferocity.  </P> <P> The Greek audience seemed indifferent to the limitations of her material.  Supported by a large cast of singers, dancers and musicians, Dayne cannily  manipulated those fans with charm, wit and often-startling raunchiness (she  raised both temperatures and eyebrows with her lascivious moves on the dance  numbers). By the end of the show, she had whipped the crowd into a frenzy.  DENNIS HUNT  </P></p>

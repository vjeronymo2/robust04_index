			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Staff at ITV station given notice Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television last night began issuing dismissal notices to employees who have not unconditionally accepted new terms and conditions designed to cut the company's costs. The company's letter, giving notice of termination of contract, said employees who had not signed their agreement to the new terms were not required to work their notice period, but would be re-instated if they agreed to the new conditions. Unions insisted the company was acting unlawfully and advised members not to be forced into signing. But the company said its actions were consistent with 'eminent legal advice' and wholly within the law. 'More importantly they are designed to secure the future of the company and all those who want to continue working with us. 'Security of employment for staff and a competitive company operation cannot not be achieved without abandoning some of the practices of the eighties.' The issue, it said, was one of realism. 'If after further consideration there are still those who do not accept our proposals to secure the future, we can only look upon their departure with regret.' The company declined to say how many of its 800 employees had signed. The notices of termination sent out last night were to Yorkshire employees. The 200 Tyne Tees employees face a deadline of 4pm today. The company, whose employees work an annualised hours system, wants to scrap premium rate overtime payments, and pay additional hours at flat rate. The unions say this would mean some employees' earnings would drop by up to 40 per cent. They say the changes would also scrap safeguards agreed when annualised hours were introduced. Unions at the company are talking legal advice on their next move. Mr Colin Bourne, the National Union of Journalists' northern region organiser, said the law defined the dismissals as redundancies. 'People now have the right to claim damages for breach of contract, to claim unfair dismissal and payment in lieu of the period for which the company is legally required to consult with the unions,' he said.</p>

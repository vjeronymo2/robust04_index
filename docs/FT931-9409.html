			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Travel: Roll up (and wrap-up) for Nudo Matsuri - Christopher McCooey sees a turbulent shinto festival IT IS mid-February and the temperature is barely above freezing. The crowds lining the approach to the Shinto shrine at Konomiya, in Aichi prefecture in central Japan, are muffled against the cold wind. Wearing down-filled ski-jackets, everyone presses together for warmth, like penguins resisting the cold. From an indistinct murmuring a pattern of sound emerges, a chant growing in urgency as the first group of 100 naked men come into view just before noon. In all, more than 8,000 men and boys will make their way to the shrine during the afternoon to await the climax of the festival which comes just before dusk when the shinotoko (god-man) appears. The shinotoko is completely naked while the others wear fundoshi - cotton loin cloths passed between the legs and wound round their stomachs, a flap of which serves as a convenient pouch for cigarettes. On their feet they wear tabi - white socks split between the big toe and the other toes and fastened on the inner side of the ankle by small metal clasps. Tied around their heads are colourful bands which identify each to his particular group or village. For many, to participate is an act of bravura; for others, especially those around the mid-life-crisis age, it is a necessary act of ritual purification. For this festival to have continued since an edict by the Empress Shotoku in 767 AD is testimony to the Japanese sense of continuity and a need to retain a link with the indigenous religion of Shinto. Despite Japan's apparent wholesale acceptance of western ways, most of its local festivals remain uniquely Japanese, and the participants - salarymen, housewives and children - relish the opportunity to dress up in traditional clothes (or dress down to fundoshi as the case may be), to drink sake freely and to revel in the long cultural pageant that is Japanese history. The date of the festival is determined by reference to the old lunar calendar which Japan adopted from China in 604 AD. This calendar was used, with small modification, until 1872. Because the months were strictly lunar in the Chinese calendar, the beginning of the year varied between January 20 and February 19, according to when the sun entered the sign of the fish. The Shinto priests at Konomiya always fix the festival for the 13th day of the first lunar month of the year, so the date varies between February 1 and March 3, usually the coldest period in the Japanese winter. The Japanese word for 'four' is shi, which also means 'death,' and they believe that the most dangerous age is 41, called honyaku, and that you must be on your guard against misfortune at this time. The festival attracts many in the age range 39-41. They participate as a kind of insurance policy based more on superstition than strong religious conviction. Those who take part are not guaranteed freedom from misfortune - each year the police arrest some who have drunk too much, and the ambulance is always called to take away those suffering from exposure or with broken bones. In the 1970s a 20-year-old girl spectator was trampled and suffocated to death by the frenzied throng. Since that incident police crowd control has been much stricter. Even the shinotoko is not immune. A doctor friend of mine told me, with some amusement, that the god-man of 1980 was treated a few months later by a colleague - for tuberculosis. The priests begin preparing for the festival on the second day of the year (according to the old calendar). The shrine is cleaned and tidied and the shinotoko is chosen from a number of volunteers. Formerly, an itinerant visitor to the town was chosen as he would leave the district in due course and take the community's ill-luck with him. Today, selection is by omi-kuji (numbered sticks) and volunteers are usually in the age group 24-26. Volunteers of other ages may apply, but because of the physical hardship - the exposure to cold and the buffeting by participants - strong and healthy men are preferred. On the 11th day of the new year, the head priest makes naoi mochi. Steamed rice is pounded and a cake (mochi) is made from the glutinous dough. This cake plays an important part in the festival proceedings but it differs from the traditional rice cakes made at New Year in that ash from burnt peach and willow branches is mixed in with it, and the cake is destined to be buried, not eaten. Naoi is the official name of the festival and is a proper name, but in recent years the Japanese have taken to using the English word 'nude,' so the event is popularly known as the Nudo Matsuri (Naked Festival). After preparing the naoi mochi, a special building is constructed on the night of the 12th for the main god of the shrine to reside in as the climax of the festival approaches. The shinotoko-designate stays in the shrine overnight and receives instruction from the priest. All of his hair (head and body) is shaved and he composes himself for the rigours of the morrow. From early on the morning of the festival people start arriving from the surrounding districts. More than 600 stalls have appeared in the streets leading to the shrine and the chill air is redolent with soy and sake, the sizzle of barbecued squid and the slurp of noodles. Around 250,000 visitors are expected during the day and the shrine itself has an extra 200 workers selling charms and talismen. If nothing else, the festival is big business. The roofs of buildings near the shrine have been converted to makeshift stands and seat places are sold for Pounds 10-Pounds 15. Many are taken by amateur photographers who want a good view and some kind of protection for their expensive equipment. In the afternoon, groups of naked men and boys (some as young as five, and carried on shoulders for safety) present themselves in front of the main shrine building. They pass to the priests a talisman that they have brought from their own district for blessing. Usually this is a freshly-cut bamboo pole tied with bright pieces of cloth. In return for the talisman the Shinto priests give benediction by waving green fronds of bamboo above the heads of the crowd. By late afternoon all groups have gathered in front of the shrine and tension rises as the emergence of the shinotoko draws near. When he does appear, surrounded by his protectors, all hell breaks loose as everyone struggles to touch him. The excitement borders on frenzy as the protectors do their best to steer him in reasonable safety through the mob. All this time about a dozen men with wooden pails repeatedly throw ice-cold water over the writhing limbs and torsos from which come cries and incredible amounts of steam. The tide of bodies sweeps the shinotoko backwards and forwards. After about 30 minutes his bodyguards endeavour to return him through the gates of the shrine; in less than an hour he is back in the safety of the inner sanctuary. For the participants, many numb and blue with cold, their tabi filthy and torn, their fundoshi soaked, the festival is over. Hugging themselves for warmth, they quickly make their way home. For the shinotoko, however, the most important part of the festival is approaching, and he must remain in the shrine for another night. He represents the tip of the pyramid of the transference of ill-luck. The participating men brought their family's and community's potential for misfortune with them to the shrine. In touching the shinotoko this was transfered to him and he takes it all upon himself back into the shrine. Once inside, all this misfortune is transferred from the shinotoko to the naoi mochi and, at 3am, the final drama is enacted. The head priest hands the naoi mochi to the shinotoko who runs three times round the main building. Then he is driven out of the shrine with branches of peach and willow which are thrown after him. The shinotoko flees and runs past another shrine in the neighbourhood where he throws away the rice cake. The head priest of this shrine collects it and secretly buries it so that all the misfortune and ill-luck is finally removed and the festival of purification is completed for another year.</p>

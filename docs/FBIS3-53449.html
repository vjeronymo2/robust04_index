Following the meeting, the European official said that his  talk with the president was important and extremely useful and  was characterized by openness, pointing out that this was due to  Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's clear and far-sighted political views  towards Tunisia's relations with the Mediterranean region, in  general, and with the European Union [EU]. He expressed  happiness for the forthcoming start of negotiations with Tunisia  over the new partnership agreement between our country and the  EU, hoping that during the second half of this year, a final  partnership formula would be reached.    Mr. Manuel Marin made clear that technical consultations  will  take place between the two sides in order to look into "the  terms appropriate to the Tunisian economy which we should  respect," saying that "if the final formula is the free exchange  which has great importance to the Tunisian economy and its  future, we should also acknowledge the need for the Tunisian  economy to be adequate to the new framework of cooperation in  the best of ways. In conclusion he expressed confidence for the  partnership agreement between Tunisia and the EU to acquire the  utmost possible importance and use for both sides.</p>

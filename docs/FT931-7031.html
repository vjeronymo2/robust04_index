			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Letter: Income stream Sir, Your editorial, 'Paying for roads' (February 23), referred to 'the lack of any income stream from the roads'. I do not know how much income the government gets from excise duty on petrol and road fund tax, but, as Damon Runyan would have put it, if this is not an income stream from the roads, it will do until an income stream comes along. Given this, any further income should be raised by increasing one or both of these. The marginal cost of collection is nil, so the take is correspondingly maximised.

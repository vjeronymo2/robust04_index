			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Balladur bonds raise FFr110bn: Sign of confidence in government, says French PM FRENCH Prime Minister Edouard Balladur yesterday confirmed that his special bond issue, linked to privatisation and designed to promote economic recovery, had brought in FFr110bn (Pounds 12.8bn), or nearly three times its target. 'A few months ago, the French gave us their votes,' Mr Balladur said in reference to his March election victory, 'and today they are entrusting us with their money.' He claimed that the threefold oversubscription of the loan was 'an exceptional sign of confidence' in the government. But the fact that the 'Balladur bond' issue has brought in far more money than any previous state borrowing is also due to its special advantages. These give subscribers preference in buying shares in companies which are to be privatised from this autumn, and enable them to switch from money market funds into tax-free share savings plans. So, although the four-year Balladur bonds carry an interest rate of 6 per cent a year, the real cost to the state - and corresponding advantage to the bond's subscribers - is put by analysts at 7 per cent or more. The original target for the bond issue had been set at FFr40bn. In an interview yesterday with Journal de Dimanche, the prime minister said he would use the 'surplus' of some FFr70bn to 'support business activity and to reduce the public debt', for example by repaying companies the value added tax refund they are owed by the state more quickly. This speedier VAT refund had already been announced by the government, however. The prime minister said the bond issue's success and the lowering of interest rates had both safeguarded the state's welfare system and held the prospect of lower unemployment in coming months.</p>

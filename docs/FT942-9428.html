			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Hanson's longer horizons Hanson's name is so linked with short-termism that its decision to lengthen its target pay-back period may seem odd. New investments are now to be authorised if they promise to pay for themselves within five or six years rather than the previous target of four years. Nevertheless, the move looks logical. With inflation low and money cheap, it makes sense to accept a lower rate of return. That, at any rate, is what the Bank of England and the Confederation of British Industry have been telling industry in recent months. Whether the stock market views it that way remains to be seen. Sceptics may think Hanson's move signals that it is running short of profitable investment opportunities. For many years, Hanson was able to increase earnings by exploiting the anomalies of acquisition accounting. But that is no longer possible. Investors may fear that Hanson will now turn to poor investments to maintain growth. Another worry could concern dividends, which were frozen last December. Hanson's cash position will become clearer tomorrow when it reports its half-year profits. But the danger is that a longer pay-back period could skew the group's cash flow profile as a result of a higher investment rate and a longer wait for projects to pay off. That, in turn, could undermine Hanson's ability to increase dividends. An extended pay-back looks justified given low inflation and interest rates. Even so, investors will probably need reassuring.</p>

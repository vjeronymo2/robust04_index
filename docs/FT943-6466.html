			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / International Company News: SA engineer beats forecasts Murray and Roberts, the South African construction and engineering group, improved on its forecasts to lift pre-tax earnings 8 per cent to R487m (Dollars 135m) from R452m for the year ending in June, writes Mark Suzman in Johannesburg. Turnover rose 15 per cent to R7.77bn from R6.78bn a year ago. However, a 22 per cent rise in tax paid, to R111m from R91m, meant that attributable earnings rose only 2 per cent to R340m from R333m.</p>

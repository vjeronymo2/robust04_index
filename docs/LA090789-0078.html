			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 2 ALIENS CLAIM CITY POLICE POCKETED THEIR MONEY DURING A RAID  </P> <P> Two undocumented aliens have filed an unprecedented complaint alleging that  uniformed San Diego police officers grabbed more than $500 from then in a raid  last month, then pocketed the cash.  </P> <P> The Police Department's internal affairs office will investigate the complaint,  police spokesman Bill Robinson said, adding that it is the first time to his  knowledge that anyone has accused San Diego police of pocketing money from  migrants.  </P> <P> Roberto L. Martinez, head of the Quaker-sponsored immigration rights group that  handled the formal complaint on behalf of the pair, Pascual Bustos, 24, and  Jaime Andrade, 21, said Wednesday that police told him they expect to contact  the men today for an interview.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Want to See Justice'  </P> <P> Bustos and Andrade "don't think they'll get their money back, but they want to  see justice done," Martinez said.  </P> <P> The complaint alleges that two of the three officers involved in an Aug. 4 raid  in San Diego's Logan Heights neighborhood gave each other the "low five" sign  after taking $532 from Bustos and Andrade. It also alleges that Andrade was  kicked while handcuffed and lying on the floor.  </P> <P> Martinez, who runs the San Diego office of the American Friends Service  Committee, said he had "no doubts whatsoever" about the truth of the pair's  complaint. He translated it and filed it in the name of the Coalition for Law  &amp; Justice, a Chicano civil rights group.  </P> <P> Bustos and Andrade are "very sincere, hard-working young men who are sticking  by their story," Martinez said. "They have not varied one way or the other.  They've been very consistent with what they saw and heard. The fact that they  are willing to stay and identify these officers tells me they're telling the  truth."  </P> <P> Martinez said he sent copies of the complaint to the police internal affairs  office, Police Chief Bob Burgreen and Murray L. Galinson, chairman of the  Citizens' Review Board on Police Practices.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Awaiting Inquiry Results  </P> <P> Galinson said Wednesday that the board will review the case only after the  internal affairs probe is finished in about six weeks.  </P> <P> Bustos and Andrade were not available Wednesday for comment. Bustos is living  in San Diego's Sherman Heights area and Andrade, who briefly went back to  Mexico, is expected to return this week to San Diego, Martinez said.  </P> <P> According to the complaint, which is dated Aug. 22, Bustos and Andrade crossed  the border Aug. 4 and were taken early in the morning to a house near 31st  Street and Imperial Avenue, where eight others, also apparently undocumented  aliens, were inside.  </P> <P> Bustos and Andrade had paid $300 to be taken to Los Angeles, Martinez said. The  house was where they were to be picked up for the ride, he said.  </P> <P> About 10:30 a.m., three San Diego police officers "forced there (sic) way into  the house with guns drawn," the complaint said. The officers demanded to know  "where the 'drugs' were" and "lined us up facing the wall," it said.  </P> <P> While one white female officer stood guard at the door, two white male officers  "began searching us," the complaint said.  </P> <P> "When they came to Jaime and me, they took 52 American dollars from me, and 480  American dollars from Jaime," it said. "When the officers saw how much money  they had, they gave each other the 'low five' sign, then put the money in their  pockets."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Kicked in Stomach'  </P> <P> The officers then "took Jaime aside and body searched him, handcuffed him, and  then put him on the floor. One of the officers then kicked him hard in the  stomach," the complaint said.  </P> <P> One of the officers, the "one with the big ears," then called immigration  authorities, the complaint said. "The police and the Migra (slang for the  Immigration and Naturalization Service) joked and made fun of us," according to  the complaint.  </P> <P> Border Patrol agents took the migrants to the San Ysidro detention center,  where Bustos reported the theft to the "agent in charge, but he just got mad  and yelled at me," the complaint said.  </P></p>

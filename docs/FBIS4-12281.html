			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive report"] </F>   [Text] The U.S. Navy stationed at the entrance of the Gulf  of Aqaba in the Straits of Tiran is not satisfied with just the  siege, the inspections, and the scaring away of ships. Indeed,  the issue has reached the point of laying siege to a Jordan  Television [JTV] crew that was trying to film the ships that  have been intercepted without encroaching on the security  measures required by the Americans.    AL-BILAD's information has confirmed that more than one  military boat circled the JTV crew and seized their cameras. It  was not until a final intervention that the television crew,  their cameras, and the rest of their equipment were released.    Official Jordanian sources kept the report a secret.  However, other reliable sources told AL-BILAD that the case is  not over and that upon the request of the Information Ministry,  the Foreign Ministry took quick measures that could lead to more  tension in the relations between Washington and Amman.    This tension was clear in His Majesty King Husayn's  statements the week before last when he said that Jordan will  not go to the negotiations unless the Americans and their allies  find a suitable solution to the inspection operations, which  have taken a serious course that encroaches on Jordanian  sovereignty.</p>

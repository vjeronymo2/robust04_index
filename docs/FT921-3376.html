			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (The Budget and You): Good news for family firms - Inheritance Tax - II ONE OF the few memorable phrases of John Major's premiership (so far) was his vision of family wealth 'cascading down the generations.' Chancellor Norman Lamont duly took the cue in his Budget by announcing enhanced inheritance tax reliefs for family businesses. The proposals were not included in the Finance Act. But if implemented by a re-elected Conservative government, they would give a considerable boost to the family-owned sector. However, serious tax dilemmas would remain. Business relief reduces the value of certain business interests for IHT purposes. The rate of relief has always depended upon the type of business and the size of the transferor's holding in the company. The current regime gives relief at either 30 per cent or 50 per cent. The proposed levels are 50 per cent and 100 per cent (see table). What would they mean in practice? Consider an entrepreneur who leaves an estate of Pounds 1m comprising a Pounds 250,000 property and a 30 per cent interest in the family company, worth Pounds 750,000. Under the current system, the taxable value of the shareholding would have been reduced by 50 per cent to Pounds 375,000, bringing down the overall estate from Pounds 1m to Pounds 625,000 and the IHT bill from Pounds 344,000 to Pounds 194,000. The proposed changes would drop the shareholding out of the calculation, leaving just Pounds 44,000 tax to pay on the property. Ageing entrepreneurs have faced a dilemma: by holding on to their business for too long, they could saddle their heirs with a tax bill that would threaten the survival of the firm. Advisers have urged them to exploit the exemption for gifts made at least seven years before the donor's death. If the chancellor's plans are implemented, they will be encouraged to keep a grip on the reins into their dotage. If an entrepreneur qualified for the proposed 100 per cent relief, it would make no difference (from an IHT perspective) whether he gave away the shares during his lifetime or still held them when he died. But IHT is not the only tax in the equation. When capital gains tax is taken into account, the balance of advantage tilts against lifetime gifts. A lifetime gift need not trigger an immediate CGT bill. It usually can be 'held over' from donor to donee. But this means the donee inherits the original CGT base cost, which forms the basis for his liability when he sells the shares. If shares are transferred out of an estate the CGT base is uplifted to the value at the date of death. To illustrate this, assume in the earlier example that the entrepreneur's original investment in the company was a nominal Pounds 100; and that his son inherits the Pounds 750,000 shareholding, disposing of it later for Pounds 1.5m. IHT would no longer be an issue under the proposed changes, but the CGT consequences will differ radically if the holding is a lifetime gift. If the son receives it during his father's lifetime, his gain will be Pounds 1,499,900 (Pounds 1.5m less Pounds 100) producing a Pounds 599,960 tax demand. By contrast, if he inherits from his father's estate, the higher base value will trim his taxable profit to Pounds 750,000, leaving a liability of only Pounds 300,000. These calculations ignore indexation, which would further skew the equation against the lifetime route. So that settles it. No lifetime gifts of business property if the proposals go through. Unfortunately, it is not that simple - Labour has made clear that it would impose a tougher IHT regime if it wins on April 9. If Labour does not win, there is still a window of opportunity to take action. Those who have taken advantage of the business relief exemption will not fear a future Labour government. If you trust your children, give them the shares and let them worry about future CGT problems. If you trust the electorate to keep voting Tory, hold on to your assets. The chancellor is proposing only to increase the rates of business relief, not to extend the range of assets to which it applies. So, investment businesses and those dealing in stocks and shares or property will still be excluded.

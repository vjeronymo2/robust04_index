			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Late burst of buying gives Dow sharp boost Wall Street AFTER trading quietly in a narrow range for most of the day, US stock markets posted sharp gains on a burst of late buying yesterday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 24.05 at 3,290.31, its high for the day. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 1.91 at 417.98, while the American SE composite improved 1.29 to 382.73 and the Nasdaq composite rose 5.64 to 571.25. New York SE turnover came to 187.5m shares. Investors were keeping a wary eye on the dollar, which showed a mild improvement against the D-Mark in New York trading yesterday. The fact that the dollar has roughly held its own over the past few days has helped equity sentiment, but the market remains concerned that the US currency's weakness leaves little room for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again. The day's only economic news was a 1.1 per cent decline in July factory orders, mostly accounted for by a fall in transportation orders. Consequently, the data had little effect on share prices, which remained trapped in a narrow trading range until late afternoon, when demand picked up. The late rush of buying was believed to be investors anticipating gains in the market that traditionally occur in the few days before the Labor Day weekend holiday. Investors were also thought to have been encouraged by the market's ability to hold its current levels in spite of continued bad news on the economy. General Motors shed Dollars  1/2 in early trading as industrial strife escalated at its Lordstown metal stamping plant in Ohio, causing further disruptions at numerous plants across the country. GM stopped production at two more assembly plants on Tuesday, bringing the total of idle factories to six. The stock recovered later, however, to finish just Dollars  1/8 off at Dollars 34 1/4 . CBS climbed Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 200 on reports that broking house Smith Barney had raised its rating on the media group to 'buy' from 'hold'. Rollins Environmental Services put on Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 11 3/8 in active trading as investors responded to a buy recommendation from investment bank Kidder Peabody. The stock had fallen after Hurricane Andrew hit Florida and Louisiana, causing the company to temporarily close two of its hazardous waste incineration facilities, but analysts at Kidder believe the decline creates a good buying opportunity. On the Nasdaq market, leading stocks were all firmer, with Apple adding Dollars 2 at Dollars 48 1/2 and Amgen Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 65. Canada TORONTO stocks recovered from what looked like another slow summer session to turn in a strong performance for the day on the back of Wall Street's rise. The TSE 300 index gained 29.1 at 3,436.7 and rises outnumbered falls by 344 to 223 after volume of 34.3m shares.</p>

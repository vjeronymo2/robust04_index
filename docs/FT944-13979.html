			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / International Company News: Higher prices help lift Norsk Hydro Norsk Hydro, Norway's largest stock-listed company, yesterday reported a rise in nine-month pre-tax profit to NKr4.75bn (Dollars 730m) from NKr4.62bn in the same period last year, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. The result was helped by higher prices for most of its products in spite of a weaker third-quarter performance by the oil and gas division. Group nine-month sales rose NKr5.1bn to NKr51.14bn as operating profit rose NKr2bn to NKr5.35bn. Hydro said that it had virtually completed a far-reaching restructuring programme launched three years ago for its magnesium and agriculture business.</p>

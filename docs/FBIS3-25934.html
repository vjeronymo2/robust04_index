Wang Zhongnong, provincial party committee standing  committee  member and propaganda department director, laid down  requirements for the upcoming provincewide crackdown, saying:  Under the new situation, we should heighten understanding of  the importance, urgency, and complexity of the struggle against  pornography and hooliganism. Under no circumstances should we  try to seek economic growth at the expense of cultural growth.  We should properly handle relations between the central task of  economic construction and the struggle against pornography and  hooliganism, between building a socialist market economy and  opposing pornography and hooliganism, as well as between  building two civilizations and opposing pornography and  hooliganism. We should view the publications market from a  high, political, and strategic plane, and strive to push ahead  with the struggle against pornography and hooliganism with  perfect assurance.

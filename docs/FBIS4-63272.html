			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ukrainian Committee for Oil and Gas has decided  to halt gas supplies to 2300 enterprises in the republic which  have failed to settle accounts for supplies received, the  committee's chairman Mikhail Kovalko told a press conference in  Kiev Thursday.    He said that the enterprises' debts for gas ran to 15  trillion karbovantsy, and that was making it difficult for  Ukraine to pay for gas imported from Russia and Turkmenistan.    A spokesman for the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers told  Interfax Ukraine that the republic currently owed the Russian  Gazprom joint stock company around 600 million US dollars.  However, Gazprom was due to pay Ukraine 100 million dlrs for  the transportation of Russian gas through Ukrainian territory.    "A protocol signed by Vice-Premier Valentin Landik in Moscow  in April states that our Russian partners and ourselves will  make a monthly analysis of the repayment of the Ukrainian debt  for gas," Kovalko said.    He also said "despite the difficulties paying, Gazprom is,  for the time being, supplying gas to the agreed volumes."    Kovalko also said that "this will assist with preparations  for next winter in that we can pump around 2 billion cubic  meters of gas into our reservoirs."</p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Practical Traveller: Culture and jelly in Tripoli A YEAR ago I joined a nine-day Swan Hellenic art treasures tour of Tripolitania and Cyrenaica - Libya to you. It was extremely well-run. Occasionally tiring, maybe, for someone like me, whose mind wanders easily and whose visits to archaeological sites have to be strictly rationed if I am not to die of ennui; but it packed a great deal in. The visit was run in association with the British Museum and offered keen value at Pounds 1,675 per person (single room supplement: Pounds 15 per night). Sissie Chan, Swan Hellenic's marketing director, was there to keep a minder's eye on me. Every time I flagged she gave me a book to read or ordered a plate of jelly. And I was constantly startled by the skill of the guest lecturer, Dr Susan Walker, assistant keeper of Greek and Roman Antiquities at the British Museum, in noticing that my attention could generally be revived with a bit of classical statuary or incongruous note-swapping on films and modern novels. In addition, there was the itinerary itself: Tripoli, Sabratha, Leptis Magna, Benghazi, Al Beida, Cyrene, Apollonia, Tripoli - all much enjoyed by the enthusiasts who jostle to join such trips. Swan Hellenic is the UK market leader for cultural tours and cruises. It has nearly 40 years' experience, having organised its first Mediterranean cruise in 1954. It runs a well-rounded programme: cruises to virtually everywhere, including the Nile and European rivers; and land-based art and natural history tours. It even has a brochure of Christmas and winter breaks covering 14 destinations. Examples: eight days in Rome, December 21-28, Pounds 1,390; eight in Madrid, same dates, Pounds 1,275; seven in Prague, December 21-27, Pounds 1,650; and nine in Sri Lanka, February 14-22 1993, Pounds 1,175. The single room supps are Pounds 15 per night (Rome), Pounds 39 per night (Madrid), Pounds 69 per night (Prague) and Pounds 16 per night (Sri Lanka). The company says it has combined new ports and sites with traditional itineraries for next year's Mediterranean cruises. There are 18 different ones, all accompanied by experts in history, art, architecture and archaeology. Prices start from Pounds 1,450, including flights, transfers, accommodation, meals and excursions. There is a no-tipping policy aboard its cruise ship, the Orpheus. One of next year's cruises (June 16-30, from Pounds 1,580) is due to make a one-day stop at Tripoli for excursions to Sabratha or Leptis Magna. And there are two land tours of Libya pencilled in next year (13 days each, May 13-25 and September 16-28, Pounds 2,695). Swan Hellenic's natural history tours next year include Madagascar (14 days, Pounds 2,850), Tanzania (13 days, Pounds 2,450), Patagonia (19 days, Pounds 3,275), and Antarctica and the Falkland Islands (17 days, Pounds 5,495 for an outside twin-bedded cabin on Discoverer Deck of Clipper's World Discoverer; other prices available). London tel: 071-831-1515 for Swan Hellenic Mediterranean and Nile cruises; 071-831-1616 for land tours and European river cruises. The British Museum itself has a division, British Museum Tours (tel: 071-323-8895 or 071-323-1234), which runs a full programme, drawing on curators' expertise and covering art, archaeology, history and ethnography. All tours are accompanied by a museum-appointed lecturer and a tour manager. Examples next year: Easter Island and Tahiti (February 7-21, Pounds 2,930, single supp Pounds 105); Medieval Bohemia (May 12-18, Pounds 1,180, single supp Pounds 195); Indonesia: Sumatra, Java, Bali (July 29-August 18, Pounds 2,304, single supp Pounds 372), and Syria (October 19-November 3, Pounds 1,950, single supp Pounds 342). Among larger operators, many of which try to include cultural jaunts somewhere in their brochures, is Bales Tours, owned and run by the experienced Bales family (George, Molly, Anthony, Joanna, Mandy, Jane), which has a full range of escorted tours. Examples next year: Jordan and the Holy Land, 19 days, Pounds 1,895; Moghul India, 16 days, Pounds 1,695, and China, 10-21 days, with various extensions and prices. All tours have numerous departure dates. Tel: 0306-885991/876881. Two other specialist companies are Prospect (081-995-2151), which also runs opera and music holidays; and Jasmin Tours (0628-850788). Hardened culture vultures can easily organise their own short or long breaks. Among the best city brochures is that of British Airways Holidays (44 cities on three continents; prices from Pounds 149 for two nights in Paris; new additions for 1993: Bruges, Faro and Salzburg, starting from Pounds 177, Pounds 187 and Pounds 279 for two nights respectively; 0293-615353/061-493-3344). Another good city brochure is Travelscene's (081-427-4445). The company reports marked growth this year in short-break travel to less-well-established centres, partly because of boredom with longer summer sun holidays but also because oldies, many of them fairly well insulated by their pensions against recession, have been skipping off on city breaks.</p>

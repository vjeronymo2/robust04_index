A copy of the decision may be obtained in the Authority's Case Control Office at the aforementioned address; a copy will be forwarded (by mail or facsimile) to any interested person who so requests by contacting Alicia Columna at the same address. A brief summary of the case follows. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The union filed clarification of unit (CU) petitions requesting that certain recognized bargaining units be clarified to include employees who it claimed has accreted to the units as a result of a reorganization which (1) disestablished the employing entity in which the units were originally recognized (the previous entity) and (2) created a new entity (the current employing activity) encompassing the previous one as well as others in which no labor organizations held exclusive recognition. The union claimed that the new entity was the successor employer to the one in which recognition previously was granted. The current employing activity filed representative status (RA) petitions challenging the continued appropriateness of the units for which clarification was sought. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applying the factors for determining successorship set forth in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department of Energy, Western Area Power Administration,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3 FLRA 77 (1980) ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DOE <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), the Acting Regional Director (ARD) dismissed the CU petitions and directed that representation elections be conducted. These factors are: (1) The existing unit must be transferred substantially intact to the gaining employer; (2) the appropriateness of the unit must remain unimpaired in the gaining employer; and (3) a question concerning representation (QCR) may not be timely raised as to the representative status of the incumbent union. In the ARD's view, the second  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DOE  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> factor was not met because the reorganization had substantially changed the character and scope of the former units so that the appropriateness of the units was impaired, and the third  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DOE  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> factor was not met because the RA petitions filed by current employing activity raised a QCR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

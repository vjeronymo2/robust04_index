			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Fresh thinking needed on old labour problem - Employment If the more dramatic demographic projections are to be believed, European employers will have to perform a U-turn in their attitude towards older workers in the next 10 to 15 years. Companies which have been trying to persuade 53-year-olds to take early retirement will be trying to persuade 70-year-olds to stay on a few more years. One issue is 'eldercare' - allowing older employees to fit their work around caring for elderly relatives. Others include introducing a 'flexible decade of retirement' (allowing people gradually to reduce their working time) and redesigning jobs for the older worker. Curiously, European companies have been doing little to reform their recruitment and retention practices with a greyer future in mind. The overwhelming trend is still towards early exit for the older worker, according to most analysts of ageing and employment. One exception is the UK Do-It-Yourself retailer B&amp;Q, which has deliberately targetted older people as employees. It has found a big improvement in performance, with better customer service, less time off sick and less pilfering. Eurolink Age, a European network concerned with older people, says that employer thinking about older workers is driven more by short-termism than by ingrained prejudice. When labour markets were tighter in the late 1980s some companies did start to think about holding on to older staff for hard-headed business reasons. 'But that interest went on the back-burner during the recession, when labour supply was not really an issue,' says Ms Dorothy Berry-Lound of the Host Consultancy. As for eldercare policies, Ms Berry-Lound says very few European companies have thought much about them, comparing poorly with large US companies in this respect. Notable exceptions include car companies Ford and Daimler-Benz, which offer career breaks of up to 12 months and flexible working time to carers. In the UK, the BBC has established a support group for employees caring for older relatives, and the big clearing banks are also now offering carer packages. People who have to combine work with caring for an elderly person often suffer from stress which may affect productivity and performance at work. Such employees may also need to take days off work at short notice, leave work early (or arrive late), and may need time during working hours to talk on the telephone. Much of this is a cost to companies, which many feel they do not need to bear at present. On job redesign and career development, continental European companies seem to be leading the way. Madame Francoise Doppler, a personnel manager at France's Aerospatiale, says that the company has analysed its workforce in terms of age, health and career structures. It has redesigned the content of certain jobs and is using more workers in a training/teaching capacity. Renault, where the average age of the workforce has risen recently to nearly 45, is taking a similar initiative. The flexible decade of retirement is more talked about than practised, although the privatised utilities in the UK have been taking some steps in this direction. The inflexibility of pension arrangements, especially with pay-as-you-go pension schemes in countries like Germany, can make this a complex option. There are fewer problems with funded schemes such as employers' pensions in the UK. Despite growing exhortation by government and lobby groups, however, the activity rate of older workers in Europe is likely to continue falling until companies are again hit by a shortage of labour. Early retirement of older employees, often near the top of the earnings ladder, will always look tempting as long as there is a continuing supply of younger, cheaper workers.</p>

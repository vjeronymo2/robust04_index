			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by He Zhenyi (0149 2182 0001) of the Institute of </F> Finance, Trade, and Commodity Economics under the Chinese  Academy of Social Sciences; edited by Lu Wen (7120 2429):  "Analysis of the Effects and Problems of the 1994 Fiscal and  Tax Reform Measures"]    [Text] At the beginning of 1994, our country implemented  three major fiscal and tax reform measures. These measures are  not only major measures involving wide areas, but are basic  reforms adopted in response to deep contradictions in the fiscal  and tax structures. The promulgation of these measures indicates  that the reform of our country's fiscal and tax structures has  entered a strategically decisive stage. Its success or failure  will not only affect whether fiscal and tax reforms can push  through the various obstacles and reach a new stage, but will  also affect whether or not the goal of building a socialist  market economy system can be smoothly realized. Thus, people are  paying very great attention to the results realized by these  fiscal and tax measures and the various problems they may  encounter. This article intends to provide a rough analysis of  these issues.  <H5>  1. Background To, and Contents of the Measures </H5>   Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee, through a series of major efforts, our country's  fiscal and tax structural reforms have achieved obvious results.  On the one hand, reform, opening up and economic development  have been promoted, and, on the other hand, the state's fiscal  power has been strengthened. However, because of the  limitations of subjective and objective conditions, the reforms  have so far been unable to achieve essential change in the  fiscal and tax mechanisms, and basic contradictions still exist  between the existing systems and the goal of building a  socialist market economy structure. These have obstructed the  establishment of a new macroregulatory and control system  necessary for the establishment of a market economy. They have  obstructed the formation of a unified and open domestic market,  obstructed the transformation of enterprise operational  mechanisms, and obstructed the sustained, rapid, and healthy  development of the national economy. Thus, how to speed the  building of a socialist market economy structure, increase the  power of fiscal and tax reform, and quickly realize pioneering  advances in fiscal and tax reform, have become a crucial  question in current reform and development and urgently require  resolution. In response to this situation, the central  authorities are determined to actively promote reform of the  fiscal and tax structures and implemented the following three  reforms in early 1994: 1) The existing local financial  administration contract system is to be changed into a revenue  sharing system between the central financial administration and  local financial administrations. The main element of this is  that, on the basis of rationally dividing the jurisdictional  range of the central and local governments, by dividing the  revenue range between the central financial administration and  the local financial administration based on tax types and  dividing expenditure ranges in accordance with jurisdiction  ranges, a system by which the central authorities transfer  expenditure to local authorities will be established. 2) The  taxation system will be reformed. This includes reform of the  enterprise income tax system and reform of the circulation tax  system. The major element of reform of the enterprise income  tax system is the unification of income tax rates for  domestically funded enterprises. While fixing pre-tax  deductions and expenses standards and unifying the tax base,  through reference to existing enterprise tax burden levels and  in order to facilitate a future merger with the income tax rates  applied to foreign-funded enterprises, tax burdens were reduced  and a rational, unified proportional tax rate was implemented.  The main element in the reform of the circulation tax system is  the establishment of a unified circulation tax system which has  an value-added tax as its main part, and to change the current  practice where there are uncoordinated operational taxes,  value-added taxes, and product taxes. Apart from continuing to  implement an operational tax in the commodity operational  sphere, in all other areas, an overall value-added tax is being  levied. At the same time, the product tax has been changed to a  consumption tax, and this has been coordinated with the  value-added tax to carry out special regulation of some consumer  products. The post-unification circulation tax will be suited  to both domestically funded and foreign-funded enterprises, and  it will be possible to abolish the unified industrial and  commercial tax levied on foreign-invested enterprises. In  addition, in order to accord with the developments and changes  of tax sources, some new taxes will be introduced, including the  value-added land tax, the securities trading tax, the  inheritance tax, and so on. 3) Taking as a principle the  separation of the state's function as the owner of assets and  the government's function as a social manager, the system of  distributing state and state-owned enterprise profits has been  reformed. The main element is that after the unification of  domestically funded enterprises' income tax, the system of  implementing unified income tax and profit contracts for  state-owned enterprises will no longer be practiced. On the  basis of abolishing the levying on state enterprises of key  energy and communications construction project fund charges and  budget regulatory fund charges and allowing enterprises to  include interest on new and accumulated credit in their costs,  the system of enterprises repaying credit before paying taxes  will no longer be practiced, and repayments of enterprises'  credits will be made using funds left after tax has been paid.  As for after-tax profits, the state, as the owner, will have  the right to decide how they should be used. Specific measures  will be decided based on the actual situation of the enterprises.    2. The Effects and Significance of These Measures    These fiscal and tax measures can be said to be essential  breakthroughs in fiscal and tax reform ideology, and they show  that we are escaping from the fetters of the traditional idea of  "handing down power and allowing the retention of profits" and  are truly travelling a road of transforming mechanisms and  innovating systems. This has very great significance both in  terms of fiscal and tax reform itself and in the overall  situation of economic reform. These various measures were all  adopted in response to deep-seated problems in the existing  financial system and tax system and to the major contradictions  between these systems and the establishment of a market economy  structure. Thus, it can be predicted that when the measures are  implemented, that is, when they are able to overcome or  alleviate the various defects produced by the old system, which  obstruct the establishment of a market economy structure, these  new fiscal and tax reform measures will have very positive  effects in terms of overcoming fiscal difficulties,  strengthening the macroeconomic regulatory and control function  of the financial administration, establishing and perfecting  macroeconomic and regulatory and control systems, promoting  transformation of enterprise mechanisms, promoting the formation  of an open and unified national market, and promoting the  sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the economy.    1. Reforming the system of local financial contracts. While  in the new structural plans, it is necessary to maintain some of  the specific practices of the old system, such as base figures,  and, in some respects, it is necessary to adopt revenue and  expenditure ranges based on enterprises' administrative  relationships, the revenue-sharing reform inevitably involves a  comprehensive negation of the contract system. This will  certainly overcome or alleviate in an overall way the various  defects brought by the contract system and which are  disadvantageous to the development of the market economy. The  contradictions between the contract system and the development  of a market economy are seen in many aspects, but mainly in the  following three: First, the contract system greatly weakens  financial macroeconomic regulatory and control powers, and  directly restricts the establishment of a macroeconomic  regulatory and control system. This is because the contract  system restricts the fiscal revenue of the central authorities,  resulting in the growth in central financial income being unable  to keep pace with the development of the national economy and to  keep pace with the growth of overall finances. According to  statistics, since overall contracts were implemented in 1988, of  new income each year, the central financial administration only  obtained a small proportion, and local financial administrations  obtained over 90 percent of this new income. This unnatural  situation where the scale of central financial income has  gradually shrunk has not only resulted in the central financial  administration losing the financial power necessary for  macroeconomic regulation and control, but has also weakened its  capacity to regulate financial strength among regions. This has  exacerbated inequalities between regions in terms of financial  and economic development. In addition, as the majority of local  financial administrations have also implemented financial  contracts level by level, contracts not only firmly fixed the  income of the central financial administration, but also  dispersed local financial strengths, resulting in a highly  dispersed situation for national financial resources. In terms  of the utilization of state financial resources, the central  administration has lost the capacity to gather and distribute  financial resources. This has exacerbated the difficulties of  the financial administration and has resulted in state financial  deficits continuing to climb year after year. It has also  continually exacerbated inflationary pressures. Second, the  tendency towards local protectionism has been strengthened, the  deployment of resources has been harmfully affected, and the  normal development of the market has been disturbed. The  financial contract system adopted the method of dividing the  revenue and expenditure ranges on the basis of the  jurisdictional relationships of enterprises and institutional  units, and enterprises' income situations were tightly tied to  the financial interests of the localities. Thus, localities,  proceeding from the desire to increase financial income,  inevitably deploy the resources they control in a way which is  in accord with the target of maximizing their own financial  income. In addition, in order to protect their own local  resources and enterprise sales interests, they may implement  market blockades, and so on. This not only results in duplicate  construction and structural convergence between regions, but  also greatly obstructs the formation of a unified domestic  market. Third, as the income of enterprises and the financial  revenue situation of localities are bound together excessively  tightly, this results in excessive interference by localities in  enterprise operations. This is not advantageous to the reform  of separating government and enterprise functions and obstructs  the transformation of enterprise mechanisms. After replacing  the contract system with the revenue-sharing system, some of  these problems will be completely eliminated, while some others,  while not being completely solved, will be greatly alleviated:  1) The phenomenon of separate market regimes will be greatly  reduced, and the formation of a unified, open national market  will be promoted. This is because an important element of the  revenue-sharing system is the division of fiscal revenue ranges  between the central authorities and the localities based on tax  types, and the division of existing tax types into three types  -- central taxes, local taxes and taxes shared by the central  and local authorities. In respect to shared taxes, the practice  has been adopted whereby, after the central authorities levy the  tax, a part of it is refunded to the local authorities.    In  this way, while some remnants of jurisdictional divisions are  maintained in terms of enterprise income tax, in overall terms,  the old situation of a division of income based on  administrative jurisdictional relationships has been broken down  and the local authorities, regardless of whether enterprises are  under their jurisdiction, still obtain their due revenue from  the central authorities. Thus, engaging in duplicate  construction and economic blockades by regions, which are  intended to safeguard the interests of enterprises under their  jurisdiction, will lose any real significance. 2) The overall  financial situation will be greatly enlivened, the enthusiasm of  both the central and the local authorities will be stimulated,  and the financial administration's regulatory and control  capacity will be revived and strengthened. Another aspect of the  revenue-sharing system is to strengthen the capacity of the  central financial administration to arrange revenue, and it  expands the volume and range of expenditure which the central  financial administration shifts to the local financial  administrations. Also, diverse but standardized expenditure  transfer forms can be adopted. This is beneficial to further  expanding the scale of financial resources which the local  financial administrations has autonomy in deciding how to  expend, and to expanding the autonomy of local financial  administrations. In addition, it creates a dual financial  source balancing mechanism whereby local financial  administrations rely on both their own financial resources and  those financial resources refunded by the central financial  administration. This changes the old irrational, passive  situation where the central financial administration relied on  funds supplied by the local financial administrations in order  to balance revenue and expenditure. This raises the central  financial administration's capacity to support local financial  administrations, and strengthens the regulatory and control  function of the central financial administration. In  particular, the diversity and the standardization of the forms  by which the central authorities refund income to the local  authorities raises even higher the regulatory and control  capacity which the central financial administration can exercise  over the use of local financial resources.    2. Reforming the tax system. After implementing a unified  income tax for domestically funded enterprises and establishing  a unified circulation tax system which has a value-added tax as  its main part, there will be a fair tax burden. This will be  beneficial to equal competition between enterprises and will  strengthen the regulatory role of taxation. This is because:  1) Implementing a unified income tax system for domestically  funded enterprises will eliminate the existing unfair phenomenon  brought about by the existing enterprise income tax system,  whereby different economic components have different tax  burdens. In particular, this will allow state-owned enterprises  to compete equally, in terms of their tax burdens, with other  nonstate-owned enterprises. 2) The implementation of a  circulation tax system, which has a value-added tax for general  regulation and a consumption tax for supplementary regulation,  will strengthen the flexibility of the regulatory role of  circulation tax, strengthen the focus, and will of course  strengthen the regulatory role of the circulation tax.    3. In the distribution relationship between the state and  state-owned enterprises, we will realize reform by which income  tax is levied in accordance with the law and no longer practice  the method of using contracts, whereby income tax and profits  are tied together. This will ensure that profits and taxes are  streamed separately. This will provide conditions, on the  distribution level, for the comprehensive separation of  government and enterprise functions and will also overcome  defects produced by the contract system, where the regulatory  role of taxation was strangled, and allow the revival of this  regulatory role. In addition, on the basis of abolishing  state-owned enterprises' profit regulatory tax and ending the  levying of energy and communications key project construction  fund charges and budget regulation fund charges, reform by which  the repayment of credit prior to taxation is changed into  repayment of credit from retained profits after payment of tax  will eliminate the defect where enterprises, in their credit  funds use, just ate from the big pot constituted by the central  financial administration. This will allow the strengthening of  enterprise budgets and will be beneficial to the formation of  self-restraint mechanisms in enterprises. Thus, banks will see  a consequent increase in credit risks and this will promote the  development of specialized banks in the direction of enterprise  operations.    In brief, as long as we firmly grasp the spiritual essence  of  these fiscal and tax reforms, firmly and unwaveringly implement  and carry through these reform measures, and achieve the  transition from the old to the new tax system, the basic results  anticipated for the reforms will certainly be realized.  <H5>  3. Problems Which May Occur and Countermeasures </H5>   The results which have been achieved in the three major  fiscal and tax reform measures implemented in 1994 can be  affirmed. However, it must also be recognized that due to  subjective and objective reasons, in the implementation of these  measures, it is inevitable that problems of one sort or another  will arise. Seen from the existing economic structure and the  interests structure in our country, in the implementation of the  three major reforms, if we do not do things well the following  problems will occur:    1. The three major reform measures will involve the  readjustment of interests in many respects. It is impossible  that such reforms will not touch on the vested interests of  every side. Thus, in the implementation of the various  measures, it is inevitable that various obstacles will be  encountered.    In order to carry out the reforms smoothly, we must, in a  way which seeks truth from facts at the same time as upholding  the goals and principles of reform, do all that is possible to  take into consideration the vested interests of all sides to  dissolve these obstacles. Actually, during these reforms, the  central authorities have already given full attention to this  point. In respect to the revenue-sharing system, the central  authorities have, in setting base figures, in the division of  tax types, and in setting revenue distribution proportions,  given very great consideration to the localities. In terms of  tax system reform, not only have they upheld the principle of  stressing mechanism transformation and not generally increasing  the tax burden of enterprises, but they have also adopted  various measures aimed at reducing the tax burden of  enterprises. At the same time as simplifying and merging  enterprise income tax rates and reducing nominal tax rates, the  central authorities have also abolished the state enterprise  profit regulatory tax and have abolished energy and  communications key project construction fund and budgetary  regulatory fund charges, and so on. In addition, with respect  to enterprises with low profit levels, the authorities have  shown concern by setting special transitional income tax rates,  and for two years, these enterprises will be subject to the  temporary income tax rates of 27 percent or 18 percent. In  terms of the reform of the profit distribution relationship  between the state and state enterprises, at the same time as  changing the system of credit repayment from pre-tax to post-tax  repayment, the central authorities have also adopted a series of  flexible measures and implemented a policy of treating new and  old credit differently. Old credit can be handled in the old way  and the new credit can be handled in the new way. At the same  time, a number of other measures have been adopted by which  depreciation rates have been raised and long-term credit  interest payments can be included in costs to strengthen  enterprises' capacity to repay loans. It should be said that,  during reforms, very great concern has been shown for the vested  interests of all sides. However, regardless of conditions,  reform must involve the readjustment of vested interests,  otherwise there would be no reform. Thus, in these reforms,  which are aimed at transforming mechanisms, the concern for  vested interests must be limited to the degree that such  concerns does not harm the transformation of mechanisms. If  this limit is exceeded, then there is a danger that reform will  exist in name only.    2. Revenue-sharing reform cannot be put into place in one  step. In the short-term, we might see poor results, and if  things are not done properly there is the danger that we may see  a resurgence of the defects of the old system in various  respects. The revenue-sharing system reform involves a basic  transformation of the financial operational mechanism. A  complete, standardized revenue-sharing system model will include  reforms in at least five aspects: 1) The scientific delineation  of the scope of functions between the central financial  administration and the local financial administration. 2) The  division, on the basis of tax type, of the range of financial  income of the central and the local financial administrations.  3) The appraisal and fixing, using standardized methods, of  the expenditure needs of the local financial administrations and  of the financial income they should receive. 4) A system where  the majority of financial resources are centered in the central  financial administration and expenditures transferred to the  localities. 5) Separation of the budgets of the central and  local governments and the establishment of separate tax levying  and management organs. These five elements constitute an  organic whole. If one element is missing or if any element is  not implemented in accordance with the standardized  requirements, this will result in it being difficult to bring  into play the overall effects of the revenue-sharing system. It  may even result in a situation where, under a formal  revenue-sharing system, various defects of the old system  resurge. It can be seen that the spirit of the revenue-sharing  system lies in clarifying, standardizing, and legislating  rights, responsibilities, and interests. Because of the limits  of current conditions, at the beginning of the reforms we must  adopt flexible measures and extend the use of some old measures.  Thus, in the operation of the new structure, it is inevitable  that some nonstandard elements will emerge and that these will  restrict bringing into full play the effects of the  revenue-sharing system. This is particularly so given that  administrative reforms in our country are still in progress and  that there still has not been any scientific and concrete  divisions set down in terms of the respective jurisdictional  ranges of the central and local governments. Factoral methods  and standards methods suited to the assessing and fixing of the  revenue and expenditure figures for local financial  administrations in our country still await research. Thus, the  revenue-sharing system which is being implemented cannot yet be  built on a base which rationally divides the jurisdictions of  the central and local financial administrations. If this is not  handled well, there is a danger that we will see a resurgence of  the defects of the old financial system where the rights and  responsibilities of the central and local financial  administrations were not clear and the distribution  relationships was not stable. In order to guard against this,  after the first step of the reforms are implemented, we cannot  halt. We must firmly grasp reforms related to the  revenue-sharing system, actively create conditions, and, without  losing the opportunity, push the revenue-sharing system toward  its target of standardization. First, we must speed the pace of  administrative structure reform, complete as swiftly as possible  reform involving the separation of the two functions of the  government, and, on this basis, scientifically and concretely  divide the functional range of the central and local governments  to provide the basis for the overall standardization of the  revenue-sharing system. Second, we must further deepen reform  of the tax system to provide conditions for the perfection of  the revenue-sharing system.    In 1994, we have implemented reforms involving a unified  income tax for domestically funded enterprises and a unified  circulation tax system which has a value- added tax as its main  part. However, these reforms cannot overcome the defects of the  existing tax system whereby local tax types are too few, their  scale too small, and they cannot accord with the need to  separate tax types under the revenue-sharing system. Thus,  after the implementation of the new income tax and circulation  tax systems, we should continually develop new tax sources and  develop new tax types, particularly local tax types, to provide  full taxation system conditions for accelerating the perfection  of the revenue-sharing system. Finally, we must actively  develop research on standards methods and factoral methods which  are suited to our country for setting local financial  administration revenue and expenditure figures. In the  financial structure, the question of on what to rely on in  setting revenue figures for local financial administrations is a  crucial question which will determine whether the results of the  financial structure reform will be good or bad. For a long time  now, we have used a base figure method. Although this method is  simple and easy to implement, it has many defects, as it is  actually a method which accepts the status quo. Therefore, we  must not ignore reform of the base figures, and, as quickly as  possible, we should use standards methods and factoral methods  to replace the base figure method. In addition, we must  accelerate the pace of reforms by which central and local  budgets are separated and separate tax levying and management  organs are established to facilitate the positive effects of  strengthened graded financial administrations brought about by  the revenue-sharing system.    3. In overall terms, the reform of the tax system will not  increase the burden on enterprises and will not bring about  inflation. However, this does not mean than we can lower our  guard. In a situation where prices have basically been made  subject to the market, taxation changes are a very sensitive  element in pricing. If they are not handled well, there is the  danger that structural inflation will occur. Let us now look at  the two major taxation reform measures. The reform of the  enterprise income tax system is, whether looked at in an overall  way or in specific instances, a reform which will, except for a  few cases, reduce the burden on enterprises. This is because  the reform, at the same time as merging rates, reduces the tax  rate and implements transitional tax rates of 27 percent and 18  percent for enterprises which have low profit levels.  Concurrently, it abolished the profit regulatory tax for large  and medium-sized state-owned enterprises and abolishes tasks in  terms of energy and communications key project construction fund  payments and budget regulatory fund payments. In addition to  state-run enterprises, the tax burden of nonstate enterprises  will also see a reduction. Even income tax for private  enterprises will see a reduction from 35 percent to 33 percent.  As for circulating tax reform, overall it will not increase the  burden on enterprises. According to estimates based on surveys  by relevant departments, the average circulating tax burden on  industrial enterprises will be basically the same before and  after the reforms. Of course, the circulating tax reform is not  purely a reform which expands the levying of value-added tax,  but is also a reform to simplify and merge tax types. For  example, there were originally 13 grades for domestically funded  enterprises' value-added tax, ranging from 8 percent to 45  percent. There were also 21 grades of product tax, ranging from  3 percent to 60 percent. By simplifying these multiple tax  rates into two rates of 17 percent and 13 percent and applying  these as product taxes on every product, there will undoubtedly  be some which will see their rate go up and others which will  see their rate go down. According to a preliminary survey of  282 industrial products, 73, or 26 percent of those surveyed,  saw an increased burden, while 209 products, or 74 percent, saw  a decreased burden. That is to say, for the majority of  industries and products, not only will they not see increased  burdens as a result of the circulation tax reforms, they will  actually see a reduction. As far as enterprises are concerned,  except for those enterprises which manufacture a unitary  product, even if some of the products they produce see an  increase in their burdens, this will be offset by the reduced  burden on other products, and the enterprise will not see an  increase in its tax burden. Thus, seen in overall terms, these  tax system reforms certainly will not increase the tax burden on  enterprises and they will certainly not, as some people are  concerned will happen, give rise to inflation in terms of the  overall level of prices. However, in a situation where there is  a change from an intra-price tax to an extra-price tax, and a  readjustment of circulation tax rates where some rise and some  fall, it is inevitable that there will be some changes in the  market price structure and in the structure of commodity prices.  Thus, in a process where there is an overall and large  transformation of circulation tax rates, it is quite normal that  there will be a structural increase in prices. Obtaining, in  exchange, a fair tax burden and tax mechanism and conditions  where enterprises are pushed toward equal competition in the  market is both worthwhile and necessary. We must view this  phenomenon correctly. What needs to be given attention is that  in the transformation from the old tax system to the new, if  price administration is not well coordinated, it will be  impossible to properly readjust the old tax containing prices,  and there is a danger that there will be artificial price rises.  In this respect, there is a need for price controls to manage  well the readjustment of prices during the transition from the  old tax system to the new tax system. Those industries and  products which see a reduced tax burden should lower their  prices accordingly.    Only individual industries and products  which see an increased tax burden should be allowed to raise  prices accordingly. We must firmly stop those who, after their  tax burden has been reduced, not only do not reduce prices, but  use the opportunity of the tax system reform to raise prices. To  counter this, we must quickly promulgate relevant price policies  and regulations for the transition period and fix methods for  price continuity during the transformation to new system. At  the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the promulgation of  the new tax regulations to remove people's misunderstandings  about the new tax system.    4. After the reform by which the method of pre-tax credit  repayment is turned into post-tax repayment is introduced,  because flexible measures including old repayment arrangements  for old credit and new repayments arrangements for new credit  have been adopted, this reform measure is generally safe.  However, as far as those enterprises which have accumulated  large liabilities over time or are not very efficient are  concerned, there may be some difficulties. These types of  enterprises are not only limited in terms of their credit  repayment capabilities and the fact they will find it difficult  to discard their debt millstones, they will also lose their  capacity to obtain new loans as a result. This is because,  while these enterprises can pay off old debts using pre-tax  profits, because their debts are huge, it will take a long time  to clear them. Not only will they be unable to get new loans,  even if they do, they will be unable to repay them. If good  arrangements are not made for these enterprises, they will sink  into operational difficulties. With respect to these  enterprises, we should adopt more powerful measures to rescue  them. However, we must differentiate between the way in which  we deal with these enterprises, and we should not adopt uniform  measures. For example, with respect to those enterprises which  have poor operations, have experienced losses for consecutive  years and cannot repay their debts, we should firmly implement  bankruptcy measures. With respect to those enterprises whose  products have markets and whose operations can be improved, we  should provide appropriate support. Dealing with old debts as  state investment might we considered so that they can speedily  free themselves from their old debt difficulties, and they could  be required to improve their results within a defined period.  With respect to small and medium-sized state-run enterprises,  we should, in the light of the property rights reform, resolve  their problems through contracts, leases, sales, or mergers. In  sum, the debt problems of these enterprises can only be resolved  through reform of enterprise mechanisms. We certainly cannot  follow the traditional road of eating from the same big pot.</p>

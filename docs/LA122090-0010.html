			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO TEACHERS VOTE FOR A UNION SHOP  </P> <P> More than 73% of San Diego city schools teachers have approved a proposal to  require all of them to pay mandatory union dues beginning next July, increasing  the coffers of their bargaining agent, the San Diego Teachers Assn., by  one-fourth.  </P> <P> Ballots were counted Wednesday by the state Public Employees Relations Board on  the proposal that school district trustees agreed in November 1988 to allow a  vote on, in return for the union assenting to a four-year contract.  </P> <P> Of the 6,418 teachers eligible to vote, 4,194 returned valid ballots, with  3,963 yes votes and 1,131 no votes.  </P> <P> The results for the so-called "closed shop" puts San Diego teachers into the  same position as those in other major urban educational systems in California  -- Oakland, Los Angeles, Long Beach, San Francisco, Fresno, Sacramento and San  Jose -- who pay for representation whether or not they agree with the  philosophy of organized labor.  </P> <P> Up until now, only about 4,100, or 60% of the district's teachers have been  paying members of the union, although all teachers receive the same wages and  benefits negotiated by the union and are entitled to representation in case of  grievances against a principal or other administrator.  </P> <P> The union will lower its $500 annual dues by $20 as a result of being able to  collect from all teachers, Hugh Boyle, SDTA president, said Wednesday. Boyle  estimated that some members will only pay 80% of the annual fees by forgoing  optional services such as group liability insurance and legal benefits.  </P> <P> Both Boyle and union executive director Bill Harju said Wednesday that the  closed shop will allow the union more flexibility in pursuing efforts not  traditionally thought of as within a labor union's purview. Those include the  nascent collaborations under way with the school district on a wide variety of  ways to change classroom instruction and to give teachers more responsibility  for running schools.  </P> <P> "Before, our best membership drive recruiting was when we would point to a bad  principal" and encourage people to join, Harju said. Now, Harju and Boyle said,  they can pursue precedent-breaking avenues without necessarily losing members  who object to closer union-district relations.  </P> <P> Added Frank Graham-Caso, a teacher at Mira Mesa High and longtime union member:  "I think this will result in a more positive working relationship with the  district and less confrontation."  </P> <P> Graham-Caso said the results will eliminate a lot of tension at schools where  some members have felt that non-members "were getting free rides" and where  principals have sometimes used "divide-and-conquer" tactics between those who  belonged to the union and those who did not.  </P> <P> "Some non-members even said that they would vote for this," he said. "They were  looking for a rationale to pay their fair share"  </P> <P> The union will use some of its added funds to hire more staff to handle teacher  complaints and will send more teachers to conferences on developing new ways of  teaching. The union might expand its own small projects to lessen racial  stereotyping by teachers and enhance multicultural instruction, Boyle said.  </P> <P> District Supt. Tom Payzant said Wednesday that the traditional apprehension he  and other administrators might otherwise feel about a more powerfully funded  union are lessened by the new relationship being built between the two sides.  </P> <P> "In the traditional adversarial relationship, the extra resources would go into  fueling conflict, confrontation and contention," Payzant said. "I don't have  the concerns here, assuming the positive, collaborative relationship that we  are developing continues."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by J.B. Akrou] </F>   [Text] Hamed Bakayoko, publishing editor of LE PATRIOTE  newspaper and managing director of Radio-Nostalgie, has been  arrested and placed under police custody for an offense against  the head of state. It is especially in his capacity as  publishing editor of LE PATRIOTE that he was arrested and placed  under custody. LE PATRIOTE, which was initially created to  defend the Democratic Party of Cote d'Ivoire [PDCI] and the  republican institutions, and whose slogan is, "restoring  the terror balance", was meant to serve as a combat  newspaper, attacking the opposition and its leaders at will.    Unfortunately, at some point this newspaper chose,  inordinately, to take the side of former Prime Minister Alassane  Dramane Ouattara against Henri Konan Bedie, who was then speaker  of the National Assembly, and PDCI Secretary General Laurent  Dona-Fologo. Singularly virulent remarks were published in the  columns of LE PATRIOTE against them. When Mr. Bedie succeeded  late President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, LE PATRIOTE, in articles  in each of its issues by its publishing editor and reporters or  readers' letters, made offending, unkind, and even slanderous  remarks against government members and the head of state. Ahmed  Bakayoko clearly indicated in an editorial in December his  intention to continue "the struggle," which was a way of saying  that he would fight the new Ivorian leaders.    Since then, he has not shown any restraint and has become  particularly famous for the "letter to the brothers"  of Kong, which appeared in Issue No. 93 of PATRIOTE EXPRESS in  which President Bedie was insulted and called a  "midget".... By so doing, he ignored the Press Law  voted on 27 December 1991 which makes punishable by law  "any flagrant insult and offense" committed against  the head of state, and even the Ivorian Penal Code, which any  citizen worthy of that name is obliged to respect.</p>

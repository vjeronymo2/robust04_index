			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Trafalgar to allow HK Land one seat TRAFALGAR House, the UK property, construction and engineering group, will today tell Hongkong Land that it is only willing to appoint one of its directors to the board. Hongkong Land, the property and development group which controls 14.9 per cent of Trafalgar, wants to put two directors, Mr Rodney Leach and Sir Charles Powell, on Trafalgar's board. A Trafalgar executive said after talks with institutional shareholders its board yesterday decided it would be 'more appropriate' to appoint one director from Hongkong Land. Trafalgar maintains that its institutional shareholders believe two seats would give Hongkong Land too much weight on the board. Trafalgar's team at today's meeting with Hongkong Land will be lead by Mr Alan Clements, the former ICI finance director who has replaced Sir Nigel Broackes as chairman, and Mr Allan Gormly, formerly in charge of the engineering division, who takes over from Sir Eric Parker as chief executive. Management changes, which include the appointment of a non-executive director unconnected with Hongkong Land, were agreed by Trafalgar's board. The other non-executive directors at Trafalgar are Mr David Howell, a senior Conservative MP and Mr Tony Ryan, chairman of GPA Group, the aircraft leasing company. Mr Clements remains a non-executive chairman. His other directorships include Mirror Group Newspapers and Granada Group. His appointment is an interim measure. Mr Simon Keswick, chairman of Hongkong Land, and Mr Henry Keswick, chairman of Jardine Matheson, which controls a third of Hongkong Land, are likely to argue that Trafalgar's decision to appoint a chairman from within the board underlines the importance of bringing in two independent directors. Trafalgar plans to announce its management changes today. It is expected to confirm that Sir Nigel, who founded Trafalgar more than 30 years ago, has been appointed life president, an honorary consultancy post without a seat on the board. Sir Eric will continue as deputy chairman and keep his seat on the board until his 60th birthday next June. Observer, Page 25</p>

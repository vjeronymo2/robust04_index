			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Ice cream tsar on the streets of Moscow: Michael Kadenacy of Baskin Robbins demonstrates what it takes to succeed in Russia As a Vietnam war veteran with 85 airborne missions under his belt, Michael Kadenacy was not going to let a line of T-80 tanks stop him doing business on the streets of Moscow. Having spent a day in his large, luxurious apartment listening to the sound of gunfire, he broke a promise to his wife Victoria to keep his head down and ventured outside with Slava, his ever-ready driver. The brief excursion, past the burning White House parliament building and across the New Arbat bridge, was to check on the fate of one of the street kiosks which Mr Kadenacy is opening across the Russian capital. Given the limited extent of the fighting between parliamentary rebels and the army, his kiosk was intact and still open for business. The increasingly familiar, purple and white cabins are selling 'America's favourite ice cream' to appreciative Moscovites now eager and able to buy an expensive, creamy treat crammed with nuts or chunks of fruit. Sunshine or snow, Russians have always liked ice cream; now they are buying the 'real thing' from kiosks and stores on Peace Street and Pushkin Square. The tasteless, iced-milk alternative manufactured locally is yesterday's news. 'America's favourite' is made by Baskin Robbins, a subsidiary of Allied-Lyons, the UK food and drink group. As managing director of Baskin Robbins Eastern, Mr Kadenacy - 6ft 6in in his sable fur hat - is Moscow's ice cream king. Since March this year, the 55-year-old English-born, US-trained lawyer who got bored after 20 years in the California fast-lane, has been based in the city where it takes a month to get a delivery truck registered. At present, 100,000 gallons a year of cherry jubilee, tiger tail, almond fudge and three dozen other flavours are being flown in from Canada to be sold from 70 kiosks and stores in Moscow, St Petersburg and Novgorod. When Mr Kadenacy's mission is complete, 2m gallons of ice cream a year should be slipping down the throats of customers at 800 outlets stretching from St Petersburg to Rostov. Eventually, he expects sales of 8m gallons. Since being appointed managing director of the Russian business in 1991, the single-minded corporate lawyer with a passion for good food and baroque music has been tackling a string of daunting logistical, commercial and personal challenges. Colleagues say he was made for the job. According to one: 'He's a tough son of a bitch and hangs on like a bulldog. He gets things done.' Anyone attempting to do business in a market without a commercial infrastructure or the skills needed to create a consumer revolution is likely to share Mr Kadenacy's frustrations. Not all of them will agree with his upbeat philosophy: 'Every problem here means an opportunity. The Russians are seriously under-estimated; the future is going to be good.' He has complaints: 'Most Russians live day-to-day and hope time will take care of everything; it made sense in a country where no one knew what tomorrow would bring but it means there is no long-term view.' Of the countless bureaucrats who still make progress difficult, he adds: 'Some are learning fast but others are rigid and stupid; sorry, arbitrary and capricious. A generation will pass before the bad old ways are forgotten.' Since abandoning efforts to run the business from London, a priority has been the construction of a Dollars 30m ice cream factory close to the Ostankino television centre. To help him he has a Moscow staff of 31, predominantly Russian, although turnover is high because employees are anxious to move on and advance themselves. The ice cream plant - being built in a joint venture partnership with an arm of the Russian ministry of trade, now reborn as the self-financing enterprise Khladokombinat No 9 - is on schedule to open in summer 1995. Local production will mean improved supplies and freedom from import duties, which do not yet exist but which are seen as inevitable. There have been many problems; building plans which failed to match a picture of a state-approved ice-cream factory in a yellowing, official manual were rejected. The joint venture partners ran out of money, leaving Baskin Robbins to raise its investment stake from 50 to 70 per cent. A 'topping out' ceremony took place two weeks ago in a blizzard, attracting Allied-Lyons VIPs from London. Mr Kadenacy slips into expatriate vernacular to dub them 'seagulls': 'They fly in, eat everything, shit on you and fly out.' Not that he objects: 'The more they come, the more they realise what we are up against.' More than once, the 'seagulls' have wondered whether to call off the whole project. But they have stuck with it and with Mr Kadenacy. He has worked closely on the factory with Mr Yuri Abramyan, the stylish, immaculately groomed general director of Khladokombinat No 9 who helped guests demolish an extravagant celebratory lunch at the Rossia hotel. Later, at the Bolshoi theatre for a performance of Giselle, they toasted each other with champagne. 'We have a good working relationship, even though we sometimes shout at each other. He has been invaluable in opening doors and helping us get on,' Mr Kadenacy acknowledges. Whatever the legal requirements, Baskin Robbins believes a significant Russian component is essential if the venture is to succeed. 'It needs to be seen as a partly Russian enterprise and not just a case of foreigners plunging in. We are not here to dictate. The companies who arrive knowing it all don't stand a chance. This is no place for hot-shots.' Also on Mr Kadenacy's plate is the creation of a national sales network, following the collapse of the state stores and distribution system. He has been on regular, investigative visits across a 2,000km swathe of Russia, and in January joins 'very supportive' British embassy officials on another fact-finding tour. Beyond Moscow, St Petersburg and Novgorod, the plan is to expand sales via a franchise network, although much work is still needed on a distribution network in a country where middlemen used to be regarded as criminals. Another huge challenge is maintaining the quality of the product: 'We want to exploit the fact this will be Russian-made ice cream but it must be up to western standards,' Mr Kadenacy stresses. The scale of the task is forcefully underlined by a visit to Mozhaisk, 130km north-west of Moscow, where one of the three dairies which will supply milk to the factory is located. Mr Valery Kozlov, dairy manager, promises high-quality supplies from a shabby, 35-year-old plant now contractually obliged to deliver sweet, clean milk 'free from objectionable flavours and odours'. He wants to keep his customers happy and to be profitable. But he knows his own suppliers will have to alter their ways: 'They must change their thinking, realise they are the owners and that they must help solve their own problems.' He grins and adds: 'In the west, five people look after 500 cows. Here, 500 cows need 500 people.' The farms chosen by Baskin Robbins can expect a 25 per cent premium on milk supplied. Mr Mikhail Ashrapov, the ruddy-faced director of nearby Borisovo farm, which in March converted from state-ownership to become a shareholding society, wears a broad smile. His 3,600 cows have been chosen. In a dark, foul-smelling barn, dozens of cows eat methodically from troughs as women workers continuously clear away the by-product of their appetites. The milking machinery is archaic; hygiene measures appear rudimentary. But improvements are under way and Baskin Robbins is helping its selected farms to win grants from wherever they are available. Bacteria control will even extend to agreement on the maximum number of udders to be cleaned with one rag. Mr Ashrapov complains about lack of finance. Mr Kadenacy is unsympathetic: 'The farmers think the answer to everything lies in more foreign money. But they also have to get off their butts and work.' Is it all worth it?: 'Absolutely. We can take all the hassle because this is going to be one hell of a market and eventually we can make very healthy profits.' One kiosk operator got the message early on. Mr Kadenacy recalls: 'We couldn't work out why his sales were going through the roof. We checked up and found him handing out condoms to customers. With that sort of initiative, how can this place fail?'</p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Arts: Sonny Rollins The endlessly unfolding cadenzas of saxophone colossus Sonny Rollins temporarily displaced the warblings of Joseph and his Technicolor Dreamcoat from the London Palladium on Sunday. Accompanied by his regular, submissive but swinging rhythm section, Rollins is in powerful form and expansive as ever with the rag bag of tunes he always carries with him. From the calypso-esque original 'Duke of Iron', through standards like 'Darn That Dream' to the soft C &amp; W corn of 'Tennessee Waltz', 62 year old Rollins blows a sirocco - small wonder he now needs a day between concerts to recuperate. The formula has remained unchanged over recent years. Rollins - who has the look of an animated Easter Island sculpture in sunglasses - fronts a slavish electric rhythm section of young Jerome Harris on guitar, the undulating bass of Bob Cranshaw and the spartan drumming of Yoron Israel. Mark Soskin, a pianist who combines economy with melody and the rolling trombone of Clifton Anderson complete the line-up. The structure of the band - and arrangements - exists only to to serve Rollins' full bodied horn playing. The flowing improvisation, packed with witty and melodious quotes, is irresistible. Even where he sets out with an apparently unconvincing groove like his own trademark, 'Don't Stop The Carnival', Rollins turns it inside out and back again so seamlessly that only a punning bar dropped in here and there prevents you from swooning. The rest of the team do not get much of a look in, save Anderson whose bubbling solos provide a breathing space for Rollins. Mostly they jog along beside the boss, Cranshaw urging them along with a golden toned and swinging bass line, Harris chipping off chords alongside Soskin. Economical as he is with their talents, Rollins band provides a perfectly sprung setting for his soaring flights. Life and music have not always been so easy on Rollins and it has sometimes taken lengthy sabbaticals for him to find his own way - through bop, free jazz and fusion - to arrive at this essence of improvisation. But, with a new record on the racks, Here's to the people (Milestone), the combination of straight rhythm, obvious hooks and a vital way with strangely familiar material seems to satisfy him now.</p>

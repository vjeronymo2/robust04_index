			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT REJECTS CALIFORNIA APPEAL ON DRUG EVIDENCE  </P> <P> The Supreme Court said Tuesday that California narcotics agents may not use  drug evidence in court that had been legally seized at Ontario International  Airport because they failed to get a search warrant before running lab tests on  the material.  </P> <P> For prosecutors and law enforcement officials, the case provided a classic  illustration of what is wrong with the so-called "exclusionary rule," which  bars the use in court of improperly obtained evidence.  </P> <P> The theory behind the exclusionary rule is that the only effective way to  prevent police from acting illegally is to penalize them when they do. But  California Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp contended that narcotics agents at  the Ontario airport should be permitted to thoroughly search and test the  contents of a package that has been lawfully seized.  </P> <P> In the case decided Tuesday, the Supreme Court rejected without comment Van de  Kamp's appeal of a ruling by a state appellate court in San Bernardino. The  state court had held that agents may examine packages that are handed to them  by airport workers but that they may not do extensive tests on what they are  given.  </P> <P> President Bush hopes that his crime bill, which he announced this month, will  make it easier for such evidence to be used in court. The bill would modify the  exclusionary rule by saying that no evidence would be excluded from court if  the officers acted in "a reasonably objective belief" that they were complying  with the law.  </P> <P> The San Bernardino case involved Stephen E. Leichty, a former college student  from Claremont, who delivered a package to the air freight terminal at the  Ontario airport in September, 1986. The package aroused the suspicions of the  cargo supervisor because it smelled of ether.  </P> <P> Opening the package, the supervisor found several Pepsi bottles filled with an  odd liquid. He notified narcotics agents, who examined the liquid and ran  several spot tests on it. They suspected that the liquid was methamphetamine,  an illegal stimulant.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tested at Police Lab  </P> <P> To confirm their suspicions, the agents took the package to the crime lab at  Los Angeles Police Department headquarters. Armed with evidence from the tests,  agents obtained a search warrant and raided Leichty's apartment in Claremont,  where they found equipment for making the illegal drug.  </P> <P> Leichty pleaded no contest to the drug charges against him and was sentenced to  120 days in jail. But the state appellate court last year threw out all the  evidence against Leichty and dismissed the conviction.  </P> <P> The judges had no objection to the actions of the cargo supervisor, who as a  private citizen is not covered by the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable  searches and seizures. But they reasoned that the narcotics officers, as  government agents, violated the Fourth Amendment because they failed to get a  search warrant before running lab tests on the liquid.  </P> <P> Therefore, they held, all the evidence in this case (People of California vs.  Leichty, 88-1666) "is subject to the exclusionary rule." First the state  Supreme Court and now the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear Van de Kamp's  appeal.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in a second case from Southern California, the justices told the  federal appellate court in Pasadena to take another look at a $152,000 verdict  against Los Angeles County growing out of a jail-cell suicide (Cabrales vs.  County of Los Angeles, 88-1581).  </P> <P> In 1987, a jury concluded that the county failed to provide adequate  psychiatric care to inmate Sergio Cabrales and therefore was responsible for  his death. Cabrales, who was awaiting trial on a burglary charge, tried to kill  himself once in December, 1983. On four occasions, he was interviewed by jail  psychiatrists, who concluded that he was not suicidal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hanged Himself  </P> <P> But after a fight in which he stabbed another inmate, Cabrales was put in an  isolation unit, where he hanged himself on Jan. 3, 1984.  </P> <P> The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the verdict against Los Angeles  County in favor of the inmate's mother, Josephina. The "medical understaffing"  at the Men's Central Jail amounted to a county policy of "deliberate  indifference" to the health and welfare of inmates, the appeals court reasoned.  </P> <P> Acting on an appeal by county lawyers Tuesday, the Supreme Court on a 7-2 vote  told the appellate judges to restudy their conclusion based on a February  ruling in which the justices tried to clarify the meaning of "deliberate  indifference" by city officials.  </P> <P> RELATED STORY: Page 14  </P></p>

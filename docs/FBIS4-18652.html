			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ATSA/SDAA report: "Swiss Blue Helmets; Martin Chevallez </F> Leaves ASIN Vice Presidency"]    [Text] Lausanne, 6 Apr (ATS) -- Colonel Martin Chevallez  has left the vice presidency of Action for an Independent and  Neutral Switzerland (ASIN), whose president is National Council  member Christoph Blocher (UDC [Swiss People's Party]/ZH). He  confirmed the report published on Wednesday [6 April] by the  dailies 24 HEURES and TRIBUNE DE GENEVE.    He had headed the ASIN campaign in French-speaking  Switzerland against the European Economic Area (EEA) during the  federal vote on 6 December 1992. But he now supports, against  his president, the creation of a Swiss UN Blue Helmet corps, on  which a federal vote will be taken on 12 June. Martin  Chevallez, son of former Federal Council Member Georges-Andre  Chevallez, was EMG [expansion unknown] lieutenant colonel and a  professional training officer until 1992. After being granted  leave by the Federal Military Department to devote himself to  his anti-EEA campaign, he became a militia colonel and commander  of the Fifth Mountain Infantry Regiment in 1993.</p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Virgin store wins Paris Sunday trading battle VIRGIN France has won a round in its battle to liberalise France's Sunday trading laws by securing permission to open its Champs-Elysees store in Paris on Sundays for a test period of a year. The store, which sells records, video and cassette tapes and books from a lavishly renovated banking hall, will open this Sunday. Mr Patrick Zelnick, the chairman of Virgin France, described the Paris authorities' decision as 'a triumph for logic and common sense'. Mr Zelnick has campaigned for Sunday trading since Virgin opened its first French store on the Champs-Elyseesthree years ago. Virgin was previously fined for opening illegally on Sundays. The Champs-Elysees store made about one fifth of its weekly turnover on Sundays. Mr Zelnick has used the campaign to generate publicity for Virgin in its battle against FNAC, Virgin's chief competitor in France. FNAC and other retailers have argued against Sunday opening. The Paris authorities' decision comes during a government review of the Sunday opening issue, similar to that of the UK government. The decision only affects Virgin in Paris; its stores in Marseilles and Bordeaux have not obtained permission from local authorities to open on Sunday.</p>

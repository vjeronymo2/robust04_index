His decree published on Tuesday provides for a merger  of the existing State Property Committee and the Finance  Ministry's State Property Fund.    The new body is designed to carry out uniform policies to  create a mixed economy and set out plans and priorities in the  country's denationalization campaign.    The committee is also authorized to protect the individual's  property rights and to use the proceeds from the  denationalization program for the country's economic  restructuring.    The committee's other tasks include defining ways of luring  foreign participation into the privatization campaign and  creation of investment funds, consultancy and auditing services,  realty firms and other market structures.    Under the presidential decree, the new committee's  resolutions will be compulsory for ministries, companies,  factories and offices and local government bodies.</p>

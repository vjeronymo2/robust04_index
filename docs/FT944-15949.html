			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: The week ahead MONDAY: Highland Distilleries, maker of Famous Grouse, the second-largest whisky brand in the UK, is expected to report pre-tax profits of about Pounds 42m for the year to August 31, up from Pounds 38.8m a year earlier. MONDAY: Eurotunnel's results for the first half of 1994 will contain the first real numbers, as opposed to forecasts, in the company's seven-year existence. Even so, delays in the start of services mean there will still be only about five weeks of freight operations by which to judge performance. TUESDAY: Third-quarter figures from drug company SmithKline Beecham will be scanned for clues to the company's progress in integrating DPS, the drug distributor it bought for Dollars 2.3bn in May. The nine-month pre-tax profit figure should nevertheless be well above Pounds 900m, compared with Pounds 841m in the first nine months of 1993. WEDNESDAY: Smiths Industries is expected to post a full-year pre-tax profits advance of about 9 per cent to about Pounds 114.5m, and the dividend is expected to be lifted in line with a forecast 8 per cent growth in earnings. Recent acquisitions have strengthened the company's industrial group, in particular, although the US health-care business has also been bolstered by June's Dollars 150m purchase of Deltec, a US medical equipment manufacturer. THURSDAY: Amstrad, the consumer electronics group run by Alan Sugar, has been affected considerably by the problems of the personal computer industry and indifferent consumer electronics sales in the high street. Full-year pre-tax losses of up to Pounds 5m are expected. FRIDAY: Albert Fisher, the food processing and distribution group, which on Thursday sold its Stratford baked bean canning operation for Pounds 37.1m, is expected to report annual profits of around Pounds 40m, excluding exceptionals.</p>

			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Prescription for takeover Almost everything that could go wrong for Upjohn has gone wrong. Four of its top drugs, generating combined sales of more than Dollars 1bn, have lost US patent protection during the past two years. Its main hope for the non-prescription market, an anti-balding treatment called Rogaine, was refused a licence by the US Food and Drug Administration earlier this year. Now, the most important drug in development, Freedox, a treatment from a class of drugs called Lazaroids - because they are meant to help stroke and head injury victims recover, as if from the dead - has proved a misnomer. Enrolment for a trial has been halted when it was discovered head injury victims were more likely to die taking the drug than an ineffective dummy medicine. At best the Freedox fiasco means a delay in the drug's approval. At worst it may never be launched. Upjohn has a huge hole in its development pipeline, with nothing capable of replacing the sales from the drugs that have lost patent protection. The first inclination of Mr John Zabriskie, the youthful and recently appointed chairman and chief executive, will be to soldier on. But the company is now, more than ever, vulnerable to a takeover from a European drugs group. Much depends on the attitude of the Upjohn family, which still owns a significant stake. If the family has lost confidence in the present management, if it can wring guarantees from a predator about maintaining a substantial presence at the Kalamazoo headquarters, and if it waits for forthcoming US legislation on capital gains tax, Upjohn's future as an independent company is doubtful.</p>

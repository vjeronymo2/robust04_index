			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Gooda Names set to win court case A High Court judge will today deliver judgment in the case brought by more than 3,000 Lloyd's Names against the Gooda Walker insurance syndicates, John Mason writes. It is expected that the judge will rule in favour of the Names. They are suing Gooda Walker, a members' agency and managing agency in the insurance market, for negligence. They are claiming Pounds 629m in the largest civil action ever heard before an English court. Mrs Sarah Gibb, group secretary of the Gooda Walker Action Group, said yesterday: 'We are optimistic about the result of our case.' If Mr Justice Phillips rules in favour of the Names, interest will focus on his comments about the workings of the London insurance market in the mid and late 1980s and the size of the damages he awards. The award would be likely to be the largest ever made in an English court, exceeding the Pounds 172m won in October last year by the liquidators of British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings against the merchant bankers Samuel Montagu. Mr Justice Phillips is not expected to award a specific amount of money to the Names, but to lay down the principles for awarding the damages, which will be calculated from the published accounts of the syndicates. The judgment is likely have a substantial impact on the other Lloyd's cases being brought before the High Court, particularly those relating to the 'spiral' in which Lloyd's syndicates re-insured each other. The losses of Names on spiral syndicates exceed Pounds 2bn. But it is likely to remain unclear for some time how much the Names will actually receive. There is uncertainty about how much insurance cover the agencies that were sued have under their 'errors and omissions' policies. Some of those policies were also underwritten within the Lloyd's market.</p>

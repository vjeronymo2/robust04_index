			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on a news conference by Research and Technology </F> Minister Habibie with unidentified correspondents at Jakarta's  Halim Perdanakusumah Airport on 4 June -- passages within  slantlines published in boldface]    [Text] On the price of the German ships and their  maintenance cost    [Habibie] The 39 ships were originally bought at 25 million  German marks. At this price, the ships were equipped with 5,000  tonnes of ammunition (including 1,550 guided missiles) and spare  parts for five years. The person who held the negotiations with  German authorities was Feisal Tanjung, chief of ABRI [Indonesian  Armed Forces] General Staff at that time and who is now ABRI  commander. After negotiations, the price was reduced to 20  million German marks or U.S. $12.7 million.    The ships had not been used for three years. Just like a car  which is parked in the garage for a long time, the ships first  must be serviced before being used. Their seaworthiness must be  checked for long-distance voyages and this requires  expenditures. Well, we did not know the exact condition of the  ships because we had neither seen the ships nor made any payment.    We looked at the deal only at the macro level, namely with  the purchase of the ships; we need more ports. From  [Indonesia's most western point] Sabang to [Indonesia's most  eastern point] Merauke, there are 26 ports which the Indonesian  Navy says need upgrading, but no funds have ever been allocated.    Now the minimum amount we need is U.S. $482,355,422 and this  figure includes 5,000 tonnes of ammunition, 1,550 guided  missiles, and other ammunition.    On the importance of the ships    [Habibie] The Indonesian Navy has 82 ships, 42 of which are  more than 40 years old and ready to be withdrawn from service.  Therefore, I called on then Finance Minister Sumarlin to  allocate funds for our navy. Earlier, I thought the ceiling  for our allocation was U.S. $3.5 million, but we managed to  raise it to U.S. $12.7 million. We can use the ships for about  20 years. As we were able to reduce their price, we were  granted one-third of the allocation ceiling. Now with the  allocated funds at U.S.$1.1 billion, the amount will also  include the construction of facilities for the ships.    We then visited Germany and tried to adjust our needs to the  available budget. It turned out we had to reduce our budget.  Therefore, we decided to pay special attention to the ships and  construction of ports. However, as the ships were not used for  some time, they had to be examined first before embarking on the  long voyage to Indonesia. Navigation equipment using satellite  technology also had to be installed. As the climate in Germany  is always cold, the ships do not require air conditioning and  they instead required heating systems. This is something  different from our country where air conditioning systems are  badly needed.    Indeed there are many things that need improvement, but as a  combat unit, the ships have a considerable amount of power  capable of keeping the old West German Navy at bay.    Reasons for not purchasing new ships    [Habibie] The price of each new ship may reach U.S. $200  million and this does not include ammunition. We are not so  stupid to increase our budget for nothing. It is noteworthy  that a neighboring country also wants to buy those ships even  though that country does not need them badly. Besides, if we  were late in buying them, the Germans might as well sell them to  us at a higher price.    On Habibie's conflict with Finance Minister Mar'ie  Muhammad    [Habibie] We have confirmed the purchase of the ships and I  dared not make the decision to buy them if there was no approval  issued by the president, who is the mandate holder of the  People's Consultative Assembly. Actually, I knew nothing about  the ships and my duty was to complete the deal. At that time,  suddenly we had two obstacles, namely we had to obtain approval  from the UN Security Council and NATO. The idea was that the  purchase should not lead to regional tension, but I managed to  convince them that if the ships belong to Indonesia, they will  instead benefit the region because they will safeguard the  region's stability and national development. The fact that I  managed to convince them was unusual because the Dili incident  had just broken out at that time.    On the condition of the 29 ships    [Habibie] They are all fine. If you want to test them, you  can do it by computer. Or if you want to have a simulated  crash, the cost, of course, will be very high. However, the  recent accident [in Bay of Biscay] is good proof that the ships'  design is excellent. If it was poorly designed, it would have  sunk in less than five minutes.    I want to remind you that three LSTs [landing ship tank]  have  arrived in Indonesia. One of them also had one of its front  doors open during bad weather, but it was shut again.</p>

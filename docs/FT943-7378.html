			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Body Shop undergoes US federal probe over franchises Body Shop International is under investigation by the US Federal Trade Commission in relation to its franchise operations in North America. Body Shop last night confirmed the investigation, which focuses on disputes between the company and its franchisees in the US. It said: 'We are aware of the FTC inquiries which are routine and about which we have no concerns.' News of the investigation emerged amid continuing controversy within the ethical investment sector about allegations concerning the UK-based cosmetics and toiletries retailer's 'green' and ethical policies. The FTC refused, as part of its normal policy, to comment on whether any investigation was taking place into Body Shop. The US agency said it had undertaken 40 to 50 franchise investigations over the past several years, of which a majority had led to legal action. However, it stressed that each case needed to be judged on its merits and none should be pre-judged. The FTC said its investigations normally considered allegations of unfair or deceptive practices by franchise operators, or more general breaches of US franchise rules. Details of complaints from former Body Shop franchisees in the US form an important part of a forthcoming article in Business Ethics, a Minneapolis-based magazine, and other pieces due to be published in the next few weeks. In a statement Body Shop, which has about 130 US franchise shops, said: 'It is standard practice for franchise organisations to have arguments with franchisees. We have no more arguments in the US than in the UK or any other country. 'Indeed independent analysts note that we have remarkably few such conflicts for a company of our size. Government agencies in the US have accused us of nothing. This is just more scaremongering.' The FTC is believed to have formally launched its investigation in March, and it has since issued a number of subpoenas to require witnesses to testify. Separately, New Consumer, a Newcastle-based organisation which has criticised Body Shop International, yesterday made public a letter to the company calling for information which would allow it to verify the retailer's 'trade not aid' claims and for details of the ingredients in its products. Mr Richard Adams, director of New Consumer, said Body Shop had refused to provide such information. Several of the leading UK ethical funds said yesterday they were considering reviewing their views on Body Shop after details of the allegations became public. Letters, Page 12</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Laying the Blame on Someone </F> Else...."]    [Text] The Military Council of Ukraine's Naval Forces has  expressed a strong protest against the provocative actions and  statements by some officers and admirals of the Black Sea Fleet,  as well as by high-ranking officials and activists of Crimean  pro-Russian public organizations. Convinced of their impunity,  reads the Military Council's statement disseminated on the  occasion, individual military officials of the Black Sea Fleet  declare increasingly aggressively about their readiness to  violate by force the integrity of existing borders. Moreover,  Crimean President Yu. Meshkov accuses, without any  substantiation, the Command of Ukraine's Naval Forces of  allegedly calling for confrontation. Ukrainian servicemen  decisively refute such allegations and confirm their readiness  to maintain friendly relations with the Black Sea Fleet.</p>

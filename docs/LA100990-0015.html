			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OAK TREE;  </P> <P> LITE LIGHT WINS THE OAK LEAF STAKES  </P> <P> Those who thought Beyond Perfection was California's hope to upset Meadow Star  in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies might have to start rethinking their  position.  </P> <P> Badly beaten by Beyond Perfection in the Del Mar Debutante Sept. 2, Lite Light  turned the tables in a big way Monday at Santa Anita.  </P> <P> The 4-1 third choice in the field of four, Lite Light got the lead before a  quarter of a mile had been run, then turned the $242,256 Oak Leaf Stakes into a  one-filly affair.  </P> <P> A Kentucky-bred daughter of Majestic Light, she defeated Garden Gal by four  lengths in 1:42 4/5 for the 1 1/16 miles, the same time Best Pal had while  winning the Norfolk the day before.  </P> <P> The 1-2 favorite, Beyond Perfection was four-wide most of the way and finished  6 1/2 lengths behind Garden Gal. Even though she was beaten by 31 1/2 lengths,  Title Bought earned $14,832 for finishing fourth.  </P> <P> Impressive when beating Beyond Perfection in the seven-furlong Sorrento 18 days  before the Debutante, Lite Light had an excuse for her decisive defeat.  </P> <P> "She was horsing (ovulating) so bad last time I would have had to take her out  of any ordinary race," said trainer Henry Moreno after Lite Light's third  victory in seven starts. "I liked her going in today on account of knowing what  was wrong last time.  </P> <P> "This is a pretty nice filly, that's all I can say. More than likely, we'll go  on to the Breeders' Cup (Oct. 27)."  </P> <P> Last going into the first turn, Lite Light moved to the front when an opening  developed on the fence. A head in front after a :46 half-mile, she started to  draw away midway around the turn and won with something left.  </P> <P> "Going into the first turn, I didn't feel we would have a shot in the middle  with four horses going head to head, so I took back," said Russell Baze after  his first victory of the six day-old Oak Tree meeting. "Then, Garden Gal  drifted out and she pulled me through there. Chris (McCarron) tried to get  (Garden Gal) to drop in, but if anything, she went wider.  </P> <P> "The first time I rode her (in the Sorrento), she ran similar to what she did  today. Last time, she came into heat real bad the day of the race. Henry told  me in the paddock that day we'd be lucky to get any part of it. She was not in  top form at all. The real Lite Light showed up today."  </P> <P> Whether that would be good enough to beat Meadow Star, who remained unbeaten  with a 14-length victory in Saturday's Frizette at Belmont Park, is an entirely  different question.  </P> <P> "It's apparent both of them are quality fillies," Baze said. "We'll never know  until we hook her."  </P> <P> The Breeders' Cup also seems the probable destination for Garden Gal, who was  making her first start around two turns.  </P> <P> "I was pleased with her race,' said trainer Brian Mayberry. "She finished well  for her first time longer than six furlongs."  </P> <P> Beyond Perfection acted as though she might be tired. The Oak Leaf was her  fourth race since Aug. 15 and her third in five weeks.  </P> <P> "It was one of those races that you hate to have, but that you're going to  get," jockey Alex Solis said. "I got caught four wide, but she didn't really  fire when I asked her."  </P> <P> Sensational Star, who won the Bing Crosby and Pat O'Brien Handicaps at Del Mar,  will have nine opponents Wednesday when he starts in the $108,625 Ancient Title  Breeders' Cup Handicap at Santa Anita.  </P> <P> A $32,000 claim more than two years ago by Bill Spawr, the 6-year-old gelding  drew the outside post in the six-furlong race. He will again be ridden by  Rafael Meza. Sensational Star, who is preparing for the California Cup Nov. 3,  worked six furlongs in a bullet 1:13 1/5 Friday.  </P> <P> A quality colt overseas, Corwyn Bay was impressive in his main track debut  Sept. 10 at Del Mar. Under Eddie Delahoussaye, the 4-year-old son of Caerleon  beat allowance rivals by 6 1/2 lengths and ran the 6 1/2 furlongs in 1:14 3/5.  </P> <P> Others in the field include multiple-stakes winner Prospectors Gamble;  Snipledo, who has has won six consecutive races in Washington, including the  Longacres Mile; the Vladimir Cerin-trained entry of Yes I'm Blue, who captured  the Aprisa and Governor's Cup at Fairplex Park; Hollywood Reporter; On A Roll;  Ambessa; Astro, who won his last three starts at Arlington Park, and Gallant  Sailor.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Ruhlmann, who disappointed when heavily favored in the Del Mar Budweiser  Breeders' Cup, is expected to start in Saturday's Goodwood Handicap. Other  possiblies include his stablemate, Lively One; Miserden, who worked six  furlongs in 1:13 2/5 Monday morning; Asia; Festin, and Edipo Rey. . . . Lite  Light paid $10.60 to win and the victory was worth $148,320 to owner Jack  Finley. . . . For the second consecutive day, no one was able to isolate all  the Pick Six winners, so there wil be a carryover of more than $198,000. . . .  Kent Desormeaux and Julio Garcia each won twice Monday.  </P></p>

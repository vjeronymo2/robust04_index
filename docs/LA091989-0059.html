			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRAVDA ASSAILS YELTSIN OVER U.S. VISIT  </P> <P> Opposition lawmaker Boris N. Yeltsin shopped and drank until he dropped on his  tour of the United States, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda told its  readers Monday.  </P> <P> The Communist Party maverick "leaves behind him a wake of catastrophic  prophecies, insane expenses, interviews and above all the perfume of Jack  Daniels Black Label," the left-leaning Italian newspaper La Repubblica said in  a Page 5 article translated into Russian and printed on the front page of  Pravda.  </P> <P> Pravda did not comment on the article, which said Yeltsin found the United  States "a holiday, a stage, a bar 5,000 kilometers long."  </P> <P> Yeltsin, who arrived back in Moscow late Monday, denied the report. "It's  garbage," he told the Associated Press, flushing with anger. "It's a simple  lie, slander, and revenge for the fact that Americans received us with  admiration."  </P> <P> The article is potentially very damaging to the silver-haired, 58-year-old  populist who has become a hero to many Soviets by criticizing special  privileges for party and government officials and urging that President Mikhail  S. Gorbachev speed up his reforms.  </P> <P> But previous attacks on Yeltsin have been regarded by his supporters as an  effort by powerful Kremlin figures to discredit him, and Yeltsin has turned  that deep-rooted suspicion of central authority to his advantage.  </P></p>

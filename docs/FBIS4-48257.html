			<p>BFN     [Text] Workers of the Niger Electric Power Company  [NIGELEC] began a 48-hour strike this morning. Their main  grievance concerns the rate of increase applicable to  electricity. The strike notice provided for minimum services,  but this has not been not complied with so far. Saidu Mossi has  a report.    [Mossi] It is not easy to have a clear picture. What is  certain is that NIGELEC, in view of the financial problems  confronting it, needs to increase the kilowatt per hour rate.  However, the management and National Electricity Workers Union  [SYNATREN] have been unable to agree on an acceptable increase.  Management is said to have proposed a rate that is not  satisfactory to the NIGELEC workers. There is talk of a 30 to  40-percent increase while the SYNATREN is asking for more. The  various rounds of negotiations have not succeeded in easing the  situation, hence the 48-hour strike notice issued by the  SYNATREN on 5 May.    The strike notice stated that there will be temporary power  cuts, however since this morning, there has been no electricity  at all. The arrangements stated in the strike notice are no  longer being implemented and there is a general power cut. The  NIGELEC workers have adopted a harder stand because the NIGELEC  management in the meantime requisitioned some of the workers,  hence the SYNATREN's anger. At the moment, a meeting is being  held between the union leaders and management but we do not have  any details on it.    Meanwhile, NIGELEC's 46,000 customers do not have any  electricity at all. Many offices and businesses are blocked  because of the power cut and people are wondering why the  NIGELEC workers are asking for increases in electricity rates  when the devaluation is making the cost of living increasingly  unbearable. Besides, today's 40 degrees in the shade in Niamey  is not going to cheer people up.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We now join our correspondent Philippe Lefebvre.  Philippe, you are near the prefecture building? Is French Prime  Minister Edouard Balladur still inside?    [Lefebvre] Yes, I am behind the gates of the prefecture  building. Edouard Balladur is inside the regional council  building, but the situation has for an hour now been very tense  around the prefecture building. Police and the demonstrators  are clashing with Molotov cocktails and teargas bombs. The gas  smoke can be seen reaching the windows of the prefecture. It  was in this climate that Edouard Balladur met the delegates of  the fishermen for 10 minutes or so. He confirmed to them that  he will take the necessary measures at the national level to  support this industry even if Brussels refuses to back down on  the minimum price issue.    This is the information that Dominique Lapart, the leader of  the Committee for the Survival of the Fisheries Industry, wanted  to communicate to the demonstrators but could not because of  teargas bombs, which are making any movement between the  prefecture and the Rennes city center, where the situation is  very tense, impossible.    The fact that Dominique Lapart has not managed to make this  announcement will not calm the situation in the next few  minutes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, June 22 (CTK) -- The National  Democratic Party (NDS) and the Democratic Union of Slovakia (DU)  may merge after the autumn parliamentary elections, NDS Chairman  Ludovit Cernak told journalists today.    The June polls gave three percent to the NDS (5 deputies in  the 150-seat Slovak parliament) and six percent to Premier Jozef  Moravcik's DU (14 deputies).    Two weeks ago Moravcik offered the NDS to run on the DU  slate  and to get three seats in parliament provided the parties  succeed in the elections, Cernak said.    On Saturday [18 June] the NDS central council approved a  decision of its executive committee to join the DU list of  candidates. This is the best way for the party how to "appeal  to non-left-orientated and non-Meciarite" voters, Cernak said.    The decision is subject to approval by the DU national  council which will take place on Saturday. Although it had  opted for a separate candidature in the elections, it is likely  to change the tack.    Two weeks ago Cernak said that the "NDS is almost certain to  run the elections on the KDH (Christian Democratic Movement)  list." At present, the offers from the DU and KDH are "of about  the same quality," Cernak stated.</p>

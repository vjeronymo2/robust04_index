			<p>941201 FT  01 DEC 94 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1994 (8): Broad range of entries The number of entries rose once again in the fourth year of the Business Software Challenge '90s design competition for higher education students. This time the judges were challenged even in deciding on a shortlist from among such widely differing projects. Sponsored and funded by Computer Associates, with Pounds 20,000 worth of cash, hardware and software prizes, Business Software Challenge '90s is supported by FT Software At Work, the British Computer Society, the Institute of Management and Coopers and Lybrand. The projects described (in no particular order) are taken from the shortlist of eight that provided the eventual winners in two categories: Overall Winner and Best Business Solution. Judges had to bear in mind the wide differences between the authors of the submissions. These ranged from teams of HND students, (who had sometimes produced a prototype system within a short deadline) to highly specialised entries from individual postgraduate and PhD students. The panel also used a broad definition of 'business solution', allowing any well-defined problem well-researched, analysed and resolved to qualify, even if it did not have widespread commercial potential. Some had a broad 'horizontal application' for almost any business, (Brainbox, Word-of-Mouth), whereas others were tightly-focused on a specific business area, or even a specific user-company. Nevertheless, as in 1993, the commercial potential of some of the systems was obvious and a few of the entries produced professional documentation. Some of them even presented some live implementations.

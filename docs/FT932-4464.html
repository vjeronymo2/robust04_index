			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Letter: Bottleneck Sir, The retail profits of BAA, the privatised UK airports operator ('Retail fillip helps BAA to 49 per cent advance', June 8), are certainly being achieved at the expense of passenger seating and circulation at certain terminals. At Heathrow Terminal One, for example, passenger flow is so constricted by the cramming of retail units into a restricted area that there is always a bottleneck after passport clearance. Is this not an aspect of BAA's activities that the Civil Aviation Authority should be reviewing. Gideon Nellen, Nellen &amp; Co, Solicitors, 19 Albemarle Street, London W1X 3HA</p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Weathering the storm  -Boat builders must pay closer attention to customers Sailing and the sea may course through the British bloodstream, but UK attempts to build and sell boats to the mass market have been anaemic at best. That is the opinion of Tony Beechey, the new executive chairman of the British Marine Industries Federation, the trade group representing the Pounds 1bn a year industry. Beechey's own recent experiences of shopping for a middle-sized yacht at last autumn's Southampton Boat Show have only reinforced his opinions. The first boat he liked was all teak and brass fittings. But it cost three times what Beechey wanted to pay. The second was plainer but was over-specified and cost twice what he wanted to spend. The third was well-designed, functional, just right for price - and imported from the US. Beechey is passionate in arguing that Britain's high international reputation in the marine field must be grafted on to volume production of affordable products. Specialising in profitable niche markets as bespoke boat builder to the world's wealthy does not appeal to this plain-spoken Midlander. 'All this Burberry and Jaguar approach doesn't employ many people, does it?' he asks rhetorically. 'It's peripheral. As a nation we're wearing Pakamacs not Burberrys. Since coming home six months ago, I've seen Britain as an outsider and I don't like a lot of what I see in industry. 'We tend in Britain to build products that go beyond what is necessary. It's very visible with cars. The last really good high-volume vehicle we produced was the Mini,' said Beechey. 'We need to educate ourselves about what things are really used for as opposed to what they stand for.' He speaks as a businessman who has spent most of the past decade in American industry. In 1980 he became managing director of Ward White Retail in the UK and in 1986 was appointed president of Hofheimer, its largest US subsidiary. Beechey's early career, after graduating in economics from Hull University, was spent as a graduate trainee with Procter &amp; Gamble. Living on the edge of the Chesapeake Bay at Norfolk, Virginia, it was virtually inevitable that Beechey would buy a boat - a small Bayliner, the Ford Escort of the floating world. Within a few years he was hooked, changing vessels every few years. 'People scoff at the Bayliner but if you're a beginner you don't want to spend big money on something complex in a hobby you might not take to,' says Beechey. 'I don't yet see anyone building that entry-level boat in this country.' Overall, the BMIF's members have suffered a fall in turnover of close to 25 per cent since the recession began. Workboats and commercial craft have, understandably, held up far better than the leisure sector. Yet there are bright spots. In the waterless area around of Kidderminster, Beechey recently stumbled across a small company working flat out on small motor cruisers. 'That owner doesn't want to talk about being a boat builder. He's got a production line that must build efficiently and cheaply,' enthuses Beechey. 'Britain has become deficient at understanding the relationship between production and volume.' Yet the BMIF's 1,400 members range from one-man brokerages to public companies building multi-million pound motor yachts. The industry has always attracted more than its quota of dreamers and escapists. What man capable of holding a power-drill hasn't once dreamed of escaping the rat-race to run a boatyard up some sun-dappled creek? 'It's certainly a very fragmented industry,' agrees Beechey tactfully. 'Some of the smaller members, perhaps with a family business building a couple of boats a year, don't want growth.' His philosophy will be simply to offer resources to those that do. These will range from offering additional export advice to new in-house technical certification staff who should be able to help members get their products through the official process more quickly. One problem the BMIF does not have is the wretched situation of trying to grow out of its members' pockets. Subscription income is matched two-fold by revenue from leading boat shows - including London and Southampton - which the Federation owns via its National Boat Shows subsidiary. 'Someone back in the 1950s made a first-class decision to keep these assets within the industry. Its our major shop-window as well as being profitable,' explained Beechey. The BMIF's own annual turnover is around Pounds 7.5m. This year will see the first boat show dedicated to inland waterways, held at Nottingham. Trade stand bookings have begun to outstrip supply, indicating the enormous growth of the canal and river sector - despite the recession. If it overturns the preconceptions of the 'blazeraati' as they sip pink gins at Cowes and dream of varnished mahogany, Beechey could not be happier. 'It's way overdue and its going to be a huge success,' he chortles. 'We've got to get the boats out of the south of England.'</p>

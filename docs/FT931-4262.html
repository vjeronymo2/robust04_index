			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (24): And the moral of the story is .. - Project Management THE REVIEW of project management packages in this issue of Software At Work looked at a dozen or so packages, interviewing several users of each. Most of the stories are to do with the management of an event of some sort - either one-off, like the planning of an exhibition, or an event likely to be repeated at different times in different places. Predictably, all users faced the same problem: the scheduling of resources to bring projects in on time and within budget. It was surprising to discover the wide range of uses to which project management systems are put, many of them well outside the traditional uses of construction and IT projects. At the design house Frank Usher, which creates and manufactures ladies' wear for special occasions (pages 8-9), a project management system was used in a truly one-off, haute couture style. The traditional tools of Gantt charts and resource scheduling were used for analysis and presentation, to persuade the design team that they had to change their ways to cut down overheads. At the other end of the scale, project management (PM) is used day in, day out at BT, to monitor the progress of an enormous number of jobs, as many as 15,000 jobs, of 250 different sorts, covering 2,000 locations, (pages 12-13). BT is attempting to improve its efficiency and bring down costs by standardising on a project management system. Rockwell Graphics, a manufacturer of printing presses, has a PM system now used to solve a similar long-distance problem, when commissioning presses all over the world. Over dozens of interviews, one comment was made over and again: the expense comes up front, and very often there is a long gap between the initial investment in training, and any discernible benefits. On the other hand, as was discovered by Britannia Airlines, (page 4), the benefits are far-reaching. Procedures and work practices developed during a project can have far-reaching effects which reward the initial effort in unforeseen ways. Because PM often affects the way a company works, it needs top-level ownership and interest. If the person at the top won't make a decision, it doesn't matter if you have the best PM system in the world. Likewise, if no-one has established at the very start just what it is you are trying to achieve, then results will be minimal. For details of the next issue, see page 10</p>

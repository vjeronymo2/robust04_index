			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. COUNTY'S REDISTRICTING PLAN PUTS EDELMAN IN LATINO DISTRICT  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County supervisors' map, redistricting the county's five  supervisorial districts, is an undisguised disgrace ("Edelman Put in Latino  District by Board Plan," Part A, June 28). If the previous map constituted a  devious and contrived violation of the federal Voting Rights Act, this one has  to be worse!  </P> <P> The supervisors seem to be under the impression that all they have to do is  shuffle things around in such a way as to create a new, heavily Latino district  without rocking anybody's boat. Other aspects of fair representation or  geographical integrity can be disregarded.  </P> <P> Supervisor Deane Dana unabashedly admits that his goal was to maintain  conservative control of the board. So his district, the biggest gerrymander on  the map, is unfazed.  </P> <P> The long doglegs which would include Supervisor Ed Edelman's Westside home and  the city of San Fernando in the new Latino district are outrageous on their  face.  </P> <P> Proposals intended to "guarantee" the outcome of future elections should not  even be considered.  </P> <P> It appears that our selfish incumbent supervisors have dumped on Judge David  Kenyon the task of giving us an honest realignment of our country's district  boundaries.  </P> <P> EUGENE K. ANDREASEN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

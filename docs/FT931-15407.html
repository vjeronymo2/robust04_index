			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Personal View: The missing link in Britain's economy Industrial strategy is the vital missing component of the UK's market economy. It is not possible for market forces to allocate resources efficiently unless the markets know and understand what they are doing. Macroeconomic and financial policy alone are not enough. Industrial strategy means developing a common understanding about the role of industry in the economy and the direction of technological and industrial progress. Despite Britain's success in improving productivity during the 1980s, there is an urgent need to rebuild confidence in UK industry. The nation has a chronic trade deficit, a persistent recession and rising unemployment. There is not enough productive capacity in UK manufacturing and too much capacity in financial services. The country has expectations for living standards which the economy will be unable to deliver in the immediate future. It will be unable to deliver them at all unless industry is rebuilt. The UK is reaping the results of 20 years of myopic complacency. Too many political and business leaders were misled into believing that manufacturing industry had become unimportant. In truth, prosperity depends more than ever on technology and industry. Service industries are rarely able to improve their productivity or service quality by their own efforts alone. They usually need new and improved - or more affordable - equipment. Many people seem to think that 'technology' means machines and equipment. But machines and equipment - and the software for their operation - are only the products of technology. Technology is the practical capability to produce goods or services. It is therefore about people, their skills and knowledge and the ways they are organised. 'High technology' businesses are the ones which require high levels of specialised skill, knowledge and organisation. It takes time for industry to accumulate expertise, to build cohesive teams and to establish a strong market position. Therefore, to achieve industrial competitiveness normally requires decades of persistent activity, not just a few years. Strategic vision and consistency of policy by companies, by their financial investors and by government are crucial. This cannot be achieved by macroeconomic policy alone. Hence the need for a coherent and sustained industrial strategy. Achieving it, though, will require a new approach by industry, government, education and the financial world. That is why the Engineering Employers' Federation published its industrial strategy proposals in late November. The federation argues that industry must develop its own strategic thinking and look for organic growth, not just acquisitions. Government must stimulate and co-ordinate strategic thinking and take the lead in developing a 'vision' of how technology can be developed to national advantage. Neither the ideas nor the action to develop them need originate with government, but it has an essential role as catalyst and stimulant. The government's active role must include shifting the policy emphasis from scientific research to technological development; and maintaining support for technology through to full commercial development. This involves not only government-funded R&amp;D but also many other governmental activity, including public purchasing; the regulation of telecommunications, energy and transport industries; provision of infrastructure; and provision of education and training. These needs are not met by existing government policy and departmental structure. There is much to welcome in the detail of recent government actions, but as yet there is no sign of strategic thinking. There needs to be a powerful unit with overall responsibility for industrial strategy, backed by the willing and active co-operation of all government departments. Otherwise, the present over-emphasis of the short term and fragmentation of policy will continue. The federation hopes that the Department of Trade and Industry's competitiveness unit is now 'benchmarking' the UK's performance, including that of government, against its successful competitors. Merely gathering information on what other countries do is not in itself a strategy. This, and much other information, must be used for industry and government jointly to develop strategic thinking in the context of the country's own situation and its own creative energies. Only then would it have the essential background of knowledge and understanding for market forces to function effectively. The author is director-general of the Engineering Employers' Federation</p>

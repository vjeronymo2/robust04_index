			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gleb Cherkasov under the "Hard Work at Harvest </F> Time" rubric: "Zaveryukha Is Against Grain Imports. He Needs  Money To Provide Country With Grain"]    [Text] Russian Vice Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha, speaking  in a press conference yesterday, voiced the hope this year's  grain production will be 90 or 95 million tonnes. While this  year's production is less than last year's (99 million tonnes),  the vice premier is convinced that Russia may virtually do  without grain imports. Everyone, however, will have to work  hard to achieve this goal -- those who gather in the harvest,  and those who support the process financially and technically.    The government will supposedly earmark 5.2 trillion rubles  in  centralized credits and 4.6 trillion rubles in a budget loan to  get ready for and to gather in the harvest. In the vice  premier's words, 90 percent of the money will be going out to  the regions with the aim of forming regional grain funds.  Besides, the grain growers will be provided with an opportunity  to lease the necessary equipment or buy it on an installment  plan. Mr. Zaveryukha stressed: The money should be made  available in the shortest possible time, otherwise a successful  grain harvest may be disrupted. At any rate, the vice premier  was not prepared to give approximate prices of the grain to be  gathered in, remarking only that prices should include all  labor, material, and technical inputs.    Touching on the food production situation on the whole,  Aleksandr Zaveryukha sadly noted that the situation remains  difficult and that production is declining. He pointed out,  however, that production in the private sector grew somewhat.  Minutes later, however, Mr. Zaveryukha stated that most of the  agricultural producers are joint-stock companies, that is to  say, private enterprises. This makes people wonder as to where  production is declining.</p>

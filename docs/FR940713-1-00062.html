			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Critical Habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary propose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat at the time the species is proposed to be endangered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or threatened. The Service finds that designation of critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat is not presently prudent or determinable for this species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specific habitat used by jaguars in the United States is unknown. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be possible to delineate some general areas that the species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be most likely to use. However, the lack of knowledge on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species' habitat use makes critical habitat undeterminable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service's regulations (50 CFR 424.12(a)(1)) state that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designation of critical habitat is not prudent when one or both of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the following situations exist: (1) The species is threatened by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taking or other human activity, and identification of critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat can be expected to increase the degree of such threat to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species; or (2) such designation of critical habitat would not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beneficial to the species. As discussed in factor ``B'' above, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jaguar is highly threatened by taking. Jaguars are still in demand  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for hunts and as trophies and pelts. The last verified jaguar in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Arizona was hunted and killed in 1986 approximately one year after it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was known to be in the area. Publication of detailed critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat maps and descriptions in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  would likely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make the species more vulnerable to activities prohibited under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 9 of the Act. In addition, since the primary threat to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species in the United States is direct taking rather than habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destruction, designation of critical habitat would not lessen, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may increase, the primary threat to the jaguar. Therefore, it would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be prudent to propose critical habitat for the jaguar at this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Available Conservation Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or threatened under the Act include recognition, recovery actions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practices. Recognition through listing encourages and results in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooperation with the States and authorizes recovery plans for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed species. The protection required of Federal agencies and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibitions against taking and harm are discussed, in part, below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requires Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat. If a species is listed subsequently, Section 7(a)(2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fund or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely modify its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formal consultation with the Service. Federal actions that may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affect the jaguar include clearing of habitat, destruction of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> riparian areas, fragmentation or blocking of corridors that jaguars  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may use to cross from Mexico to the United States, and any trapping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or animal control activities designed to target the jaguar or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> large predators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to all endangered wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States to take (includes harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kill, trap, or collect, or to attempt any of these), import or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> export, ship in interstate commerce in the course of commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any listed species. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> illegally. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State conservation agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities involving endangered wildlife species under certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances. Regulations governing permits are at 50 CFR 17.22 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17.23. Such permits are available for scientific purposes, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enhance the propagation or survival of the species, and/or for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incidental take in connection with otherwise lawful activities. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some instances, permits may be issued for a specified time to relieve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undue economic hardship that would be suffered if such relief were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not available. Permits may be sought since there are some zoos that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have jaguars on display.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 1, 1975, the jaguar was included in Appendix I of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Flora (CITES). The effect of this listing is that both export  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and import permits are generally required before international  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shipment may occur. Such shipment is strictly regulated by CITES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> party nations to prevent effects that may be detrimental to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species' survival. Generally, import or export cannot be allowed if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it is for primarily commercial purposes. Requests for copies of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations on protected wildlife and inquiries regarding them may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed to the Office of Management Authority, U.S. Fish and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wildlife Service, 4401 North Fairfax Drive, room 420C, Arlington,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Virginia 22203&hyph;3507 (703/358&hyph;2104).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comments Solicited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service intends that any final action resulting from this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal will be as accurate and as effective as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, comments or suggestions from the public, other concerned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governmental agencies, the scientific community, industry, or any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other interested party concerning this proposed rule are hereby  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solicited. Comments particularly are sought concerning:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning any threat (or lack thereof) to this species;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

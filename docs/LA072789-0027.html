			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SANTEE COUNCILMAN PUSHES PROPOSAL TO PROTECT THE ATMOSPHERE  </P> <P> Santee, the East County community that has, perhaps unfairly, earned a  reputation for being a rough and raw cowboy town, is considering a move that  could put it on the cutting edge of environmental law.  </P> <P> Under a proposal by Councilman James Bartell, this city of 51,000 people could  be the first in San Diego County to enact an ordinance to restrict compounds  that are destroying the Earth's protective ozone layer. On Wednesday, the City  Council postponed taking any direct action on the proposal, saying it wants  more time to study the idea.  </P> <P> Bartell had wanted the council to ask the city staff to draft a measure within  60 days that would restrict the use and production of chlorofluorocarbons -- or  CFCs.  </P> <P> Bartell, who described himself as a "longtime environmentalist," said that he  wants Santee to pattern its ordinance after a measure approved earlier this  month by the Irvine City Council. The Irvine ordinance is said to be the most  comprehensive of its kind in the nation and will become effective on July 1,  1990.  </P> <P> But Santee council members said Wednesday night that they wanted to analyze  Irvine's innovative ordinance in more detail before taking any action.  </P> <P> Besides fast-food restaurants that use some Styrofoam food containers, the  measure would affect the construction, manufacturing, refrigeration and  air-conditioning industries. The ordinance would prohibit the use and sale of  some insulation products. Refrigeration and air-conditioning repair shops would  also be required to recycle Freon and prevent its release into the atmosphere.  </P> <P> According to Bartell, the depletion of the ozone layer has been a personal  concern for a long time. As a staff aide to Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego),  Bartell said, he has worked on several environmental issues and legislation  supported by the congressman.  </P> <P> Bartell conceded that he does not know how many businesses in Santee would be  affected by the proposed ordinance, and he acknowledged that the proposal has  so far received a lukewarm response from other council members.  </P> <P> "The feedback I'm getting is that this is a federal issue, and we should let  the federal government deal with it," said Bartell. "I don't buy that. What the  federal government has done is to set standards for industry in general and for  regions and cities to meet. It's going to be local government's role to ensure  that clean air standards are met."  </P> <P> He said that his detractors have shown "a lack of understanding of the issue."  "It's not going to harm anyone," said Bartell. "It's intended to improve  everyone's quality of life."  </P> <P> But Teresa McTighe, executive director of the Santee Chamber of Commerce,  argued that "you need the broadest jurisdiction available" in order for the  ordinance to be effective. The federal government is in a better position to  protect the ozone layer and should conduct further studies, she said.  </P> <P> "We feel that it's such a significant issue the federal government should be  the appropriate agency to implement a law. Depletion of the ozone layer is an  issue that has worldwide impact. . . . If it's bad, it's bad for everybody, not  just Santee," said McTighe.  </P> <P> Bartell's proposal has not received much response from the merchants who run  the estimated 2,000 businesses in Santee, McTighe said. "Not very many  merchants are aware of it," she said.  </P> <P> Both McTighe and Cynthia Vicknair, executive assistant to San Diego City  Councilwoman Judy McCarty, noted that there already are some foam containers  made from compounds that are not harmful to the environment. However, both  women and Bartell said that finding safe alternatives for fluorocarbons  presents a problem.  </P> <P> "For example, there are no alternatives to Freon for air conditioning," said  Bartell. "Hopefully, the industry will find alternatives to Freon and other  dangerous fluorocarbons."  </P> <P> Vicknair said that McCarty and other San Diego council members have asked the  city manager to work with the Air Pollution Control District and industry  representatives to prepare a plan to reduce emissions of CFCs in San Diego.  </P> <P> Jurisdictional boundaries make enforcement of ordinances like the one enacted  in Irvine almost impossible, said Vicknair. "What we need is federal and state  conformity here in order to put teeth in these laws. . . . If we enacted a  similar ordinance in San Diego, what would stop somebody from El Cajon from  bringing a harmful foam container to the beach? Enforcement would be very, very  difficult," she said.  </P></p>

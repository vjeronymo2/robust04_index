			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] La Paz, 10 Feb (LOS TIEMPOS) -- Army General  Staff senior officers said on 9 February in La Paz that the  budget cutback in the drug-trafficking interdiction programs in  the coca-producing countries announced by the U.S. Government  "is immaterial to the Bolivian Armed Forces."    The military sources told LOS TIEMPOS that this attitude is  to be understood to the extent that "the Army, the Navy, and the  Air Force have never actually received these funds."    The military sources supported their opinions by pointing  out  that the U.S. Army spent more than $5 million in the name of  Bolivia under the excuse of carrying out civic actions in the  town of Santa Ana del Yacuma in Beni Department in 1992.    The sources noted: "In fact, barely $250,000 was invested in  building a school that year."    In the opinion of our country's military authorities, the  cutbacks in this year's interdiction programs announced by U.S.  President Bill Clinton's administration "are a result of the  U.S. Army's mismanagement of economic resources over the past  few years."

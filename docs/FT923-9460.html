			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / International Company News: Sharp rise at Toronto metals producer FALCONBRIDGE, the metals producer jointly owned by Noranda of Canada and Sweden's Trelleborg group, boosted second-quarter earnings by almost 40 per cent, despite sharply lower nickel prices. The Toronto-based company said net income rose to CDollars 13.8m (USDollars 11.6m) from CDollars 9.9m a year earlier. The latest figure includes a CDollars 5.2m charge for an early retirement programme at the Kidd Creek mine in northern Ontario. Mr Lars-Eric Johansson, chief financial officer, ascribed the improvement to lower interest rates, a higher zinc price and lower unit costs. Operating income tumbled to CDollars 14.4m from CDollars 59.9m, while revenues fell to CDollars 412.5m from CDollars 463.5m. Nickel sales fell to 14,400 tonnes in the second quarter at an average price of Dollars 3.43 per lb, from 14,600 tonnes at an average of Dollars 4.07 per lb a year earlier. The company sold 6,600 tonnes of ferro-nickel at an average price of Dollars 3.35 per lb, compared with 8,000 tonnes at Dollars 3.99 per lb last year. The weak nickel market has led Falconbridge to close both furnaces of its facility in the Dominican Republic during August. In addition, the Sudbury division in Ontario will take an extended five-week summer shutdown.</p>

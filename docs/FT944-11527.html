			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool The wool market, which was accelerating very close to a new seasonal peaks under the lead of finer merinos in Australia, turned easier this week. The merinos which previously had risen so strongly eased most sharply, while broader types maintained steadiness. The week closed with some uncertainty about whether the worst was over or not. The market indicator in Australia fell from 802 to 781c/kg. Many in the trade still express long-term confidence in the supply/demand outlook as a basis for firm prices, but when it comes to day-to-day trading everyone agrees that price rises in recent months have been very difficult to pass on. There is also talk of increasing use of man-made fibres in blends, as wool gets dearer. The spices report was not available for this edition.</p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ROBERTI AND NOLAN ARE BIG SPENDERS IN THE OFFICE;  </P> <P> LEGISLATURE: EXPENSE REPORTS SHOW ASSEMBLYMAN BANE SPENT ALMOST $40,000 ON  POSTAGE, BUT OVERALL HE WAS THRIFTY.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Tom Bane could be considered one of the U.S. Postal Service's best  friends in the Legislature.  </P> <P> Based on recent reports for a variety of legislative office expenses, the  Tarzana Democrat in 1989 spent nearly $40,000 in taxpayer funds, one of the top  expenditures in the Assembly for postage.  </P> <P> "I know my postage is high . . .but my other expenses are not," said Bane,  whose overall office tab of $225,758 ranked him as the Assembly's second-most  thrifty member.  </P> <P> The Assembly's overall No. 1 spender in office expenses was Frank Hill  (R-Whittier) with $322,380. The average for the Assembly was almost $275,000.  In the Senate, Dan McCorquodale (D-San Jose) spent the most, running up a tab  of $626,286. The Senate average was $477,003.  </P> <P> Among San Fernando Valley-area lawmakers, the top spender in the Assembly was  Pat Nolan (R-Glendale), with expenses of $306,596, while in the Senate, David  Roberti (D-Los Angeles) topped the list at $575,037. Nolan could not be reached  for comment.  </P> <P> Robert Forsythe, Roberti's spokesman, cited Roberti's position as president pro  tem of the Senate -- the top leadership job in the upper chamber -- as a major  reason for his higher expenses. "The demands of him as leader go beyond just  serving the 23rd Senate District," Forsythe said.  </P> <P> The expense reports cover about 20 categories, including staff salaries,  travel, cars, district office expenses, postage, telephones, furniture,  equipment, supplies, subscriptions and photocopying. It generally costs more to  run a Senate office than an Assembly office because senators represent larger  constituencies.  </P> <P> The lion's share of the expenses is for employee salaries and benefits,  according to the reports prepared annually by the Assembly and Senate rules  committees. The latest reports cover Dec. 1, 1988, through Nov. 30, 1989.  </P> <P> Cliff Berg, Senate Rules Committee executive officer, said many factors  influence the bottom line of a legislator's expenses. For example, office rents  in Newport Beach are considerably higher than rents in South-Central Los  Angeles. Also, he said some lawmakers who represent several counties are  allocated more staff or may need to rent multiple district offices.  </P> <P> Other Valley-area highlights:  </P> <P> * Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles), the Assembly's top spender in  1988 with $332,552, reduced his expenses to $277,719. "I was as frugal as  possible," Friedman said, noting that one reason for his No. 1 spot in 1988 was  that some expenses from 1987 were not paid by the state controller's office  until 1988. Friedman's district includes Studio City, Encino and Sherman Oaks.  </P> <P> * Telephone bills for Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) and Assemblyman Richard  Katz (D-Sylmar) were higher than their Valley colleagues'. Robbins reported  $35,144 for his office calls. Katz listed $25,349, followed among Valley  Assembly members by Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) at $22,395.  </P> <P> Aide Teri Burns said Robbins' staff responds to many constituents via the  telephone and returns calls from people throughout the state seeking to discuss  issues related to Robbins' chairmanship of the Senate Insurance Claims and  Corporations Committee or membership on the annual Budget Conference Committee.  </P> <P> Katz, chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee, cited his role in  formulating statewide transportation measures as one reason for his telephone  bill. Katz also said an increasing amount of telephone time is used to telecopy  documents around the state. "Phone and Fax is the way a lot of business is done  these days," Katz said.  </P> <P> * Retiring Assemblywoman Marian W. LaFollette (R-Northridge) was among the  Assembly's top spenders, running up a tab of $305,581. The assemblywoman could  not be reached for comment, but an aide, Rob Wilcox, cited several reasons  including the size of her district which stretches from Mt. Wilson to Malibu  Canyon and staff duties for a task force studying the breakup of the Los  Angeles Unified School District.  </P> <P> Wilcox contended that the accounting system was designed to hide the true  number of staffers employed by Democrats in the Assembly who control committee  assignments.  </P> <P> Said Wilcox: "Often these staff members who are hired for a job for a committee  often don't handle any committee business." The expense totals, in fact, do not  reflect staff and other costs associated with committee assignments.  </P> <P> Said one Democratic staffer, who asked not to be identified: "If someone has a  major committee chairmanship, expenses are defrayed into the committees."  </P> <P> But Robert Connelly, chief administrative officer of the Assembly Rules  Committee, dismissed the criticism as partisan, saying GOP lawmakers are upset  because some of them "have spent a lot of money."  </P> <P> Connelly defended the system, saying that the 20 or so categories listed "are  the same for all 80 members." He pointed out, for instance, that while Assembly  Speaker Willie Brown's office expenses were listed as $269,392, the expense  report also showed that the San Francisco Democrat spent another $2 million to  run the speaker's office.  </P> <P> Overall, Assembly member expenses increased about 4%, Connelly said.  </P> <P> In the Senate, Berg said member spending dipped 2% in the legislative year that  began in December 1988 and ran until through last November.  </P> <P> "We've just not been spending money, conscious of the public's concern," Berg  said.  </P> <P> Next year, cutbacks are expected to be much deeper because passage earlier this  month of Proposition 140 is expected to force an almost 50% reduction in the  Legislature's operating budget.  </P> <P> Bane, chairman of the Assembly Rules Committee, which is expected to weigh how  to make the cuts, said one way to reduce costs would be to eliminate committee  hearings when the Legislature is not in session.  </P> <P> Another possibility, he suggested, is to shut down district offices. In fact,  Bane said he believes so much in his constituent mail program that he would  "rather eliminate my district office" than his correspondence.  </P> <P> Bane estimated that a large part of his postage stamp bill paid for letters to  people in his district. "I've always been a great believer in communication  between elected officials and constituents. The cheapest way to do that is  through the mail," said Bane.  </P> <P> But in 1988, voters approved Proposition 73, which included a prohibition on  lawmakers sending out mass mailings at taxpayer expense. Under prevailing  interpretations of the law, legislators cannot send "substantially similar"  letters to 200 or more people.  </P> <P> That has forced lawmakers to be more creative in the way they communicate with  constituents. Bane -- in a practice followed by a number of lawmakers -- said  most of his computerized letters are sent in batches of fewer than 200, which  does not violate the mass mailing ban.  </P> <P> In the past year, Bane's letters have touched on a wide variety of subjects,  including alcohol and drug problems, and obscure legislation to require  cardiopulmonary resuscitation training for teachers.  </P> <P> "I'd be surprised if there were any constituents in my district who didn't get  a communication from me of this kind," Bane said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> OFFICE EXPENSES FOR VALLEY LEGISLATORS  </P> <P> Office-related expenses reported by the Legislature's 120 members recently were  released for the 1989 session. Included in the reports are staff salaries, as  well as spending on such items as postage and telephones. In the Senate, Dan  McCorquodale (D-San Jose) was the top spender at $626,286. In the Assembly,  Frank Hill (R-Whittier) topped the field, having spent $322,380.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The state of health of Czech President Vaclav Havel  has improved. However, his agenda will continue to depend on  the progress of his convalescence to make sure that he will  fully recover by the meeting of Central European presidents on  15-16 April in the east Bohemian town of Litomysl.    President Havel had a medical examination on 7 April that  showed his lung infection was receding.</p>

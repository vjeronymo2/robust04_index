			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Stepanov under the "Political Zodiac" </F> rubric: "Stop the Aggression in Yugoslavia!"]    [Text] A rally protesting the armed intervention of the  United States and other NATO countries in the internal affairs  of Yugoslavia has been held at the U.S. Embassy in the Republic  of Belarus. The rally was organized and held by the Belarusian  Committee of Solidarity with Serbs and Montenegrins, as well as  the Minsk City Council of the Movement for Democracy, Social  Progress, and Justice.    Participants in the rally submitted to the Supreme Soviet  and  the government a proposal to condemn intervention in the affairs  of other nations, to use the authority of Belarus in the  international arena to arrange collective activities for  resolving all of Yugoslavia's problems at the negotiating table  and excluding the use of force by any side, as well as to  dissociate Belarus from the unfounded UN sanctions imposed  against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Tatyana Akkuratova: "Will Journalists Become </F> Shareholders at Last?"]    [Text] A Russian Federation Government decree has been  adopted on "Providing Printing Products for the Publication and  Distribution of the Media." The document envisages suspending  Government Decree No. 1233 on the revaluation of fixed capital  at national economic enterprises for three months in the  printing industry sphere.    As is known, the revaluation and resultant major increase in  the value of printing enterprises' fixed capital will mean  approximately a sixfold (according to PRESSA and IZVESTIYA  publishing houses' experts) increase in the prices of printing  services. It is doubtful whether even the richest and most  prosperous publication would be able to stand a such a price  rise. To protect their rights, the collectives of the major  Moscow and a number of local newspapers were even prepared to  declare a strike. Although the strike was averted when, at a  meeting with the chief editors of newspapers and the leaders of  journalists' organizations, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin  promised to give the journalists' demands rapid consideration.    The promise was carried out within the agreed period. But  what position will the papers be in in three months' time? By  then, Vladimir Kapelkin, general director of the Association of  Publishers and Chief Editors, believes, a mechanism for  compensating press organs for extra costs will be in place. It  is to be devised by the Finance Ministry, the Economy Ministry,  and the Committee on the Press. The new decree instructs the  Committee on the Press to join interested ministries,  departments, and organizations in preparing proposals on tax  concessions for the printed media and also for publications  printing children's, academic, and other socially significant  literature. The Communications Ministry is to joint interested  organizations in preparing proposals within a month on improving  the system for the delivery and distribution of newspapers and  journals.    But perhaps the most important element in the government  decree is the point which gives the Russian Federation State  Property Management Committee and the Committee on the Press, in  conjunction with interested ministries, departments, and  organizations, two months to submit to the government proposals  on the procedure for privatizing printing enterprises, including  those that are members of publishing and printing complexes --  proposals connected with the participation of media and book  publishers' editorial board collectives in their flotation and  privatization. If these additions are adopted, the editorial  boards' collectives, that is those who produce the papers, will  be able to participate in the flotation and privatization of  printing works and, consequently, also end up owning them.  Hitherto, the journalists responsible for the end product, the  news, which the printing base was created to print, have been  entirely dependent on the latter. Suffice it to say that our  paper in particular has had to make a difficult choice on  several occasions: either pay large fines for being forced to  miss the deadline for making up the pages, when an important  event occurs in the country and the time when the news comes in  does not fit the deadline, or report the event 24 hours late.    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI has written more than once of the need for  journalists to participate in the flotation and privatization of  printing works. Journalists managed to get this provision  included in the privatization program for 1993. Unfortunately,  it was not implemented. Is this going to happen again?</p>

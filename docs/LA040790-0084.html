			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPERPOWERS URGE ISRAEL TO BAR SOVIET EMIGRES FROM WEST BANK  </P> <P> U.S. and Soviet officials pressed Israel on Friday to guarantee that Soviet  Jewish immigrants will not be settled in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.  </P> <P> The statements marked the first time that the two superpowers have acted in  apparent concert on the question, although each was already on the record as  opposing settlement of Soviet Jews in Israeli-occupied territories.  </P> <P> After meeting with President Bush at the White House, Soviet Foreign Minister  Eduard A. Shevardnadze told reporters that the Soviet Union is prepared to  operate direct flights from Moscow to Tel Aviv if Israel will "give us  assurances that people will not settle in occupied territories."  </P> <P> Asked a few minutes later if the Administration also believes that Israel  should give such assurances, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, "Of  course." He added: "We oppose settlements in the occupied territories."  </P> <P> The United States has long insisted that the Soviets allow free emigration of  Jews, and officials said Bush raised that issue with Shevardnadze again during  their 2-hour, 20-minute meeting. But in recent months, the emigration issue has  been complicated by the plans of the current Israeli government to allow  immigrants to swell the population of West Bank settlements.  </P> <P> Although the Soviets had made plans for direct flights to Israel, those plans  were canceled in February after Arab groups protested that the steady increase  in Soviet emigration was leading to a major expansion in the Jewish population  of the West Bank.  </P> <P> Other nations have offered flights that would bring Soviet Jews to Israel, but  terrorist groups have threatened to bomb airplanes carrying the emigres.  </P> <P> The U.S. government would like to see direct Moscow-Tel Aviv flights. At the  same time, American policy holds that to reach a final peace settlement, Israel  eventually will have to give up at least some of the land captured from its  Arab neighbors in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.  </P> <P> American officials who oppose the settlements and Israeli leaders who build  them agree that the more the settlements grow, the more difficult it will be  for Israel to give them up.  </P> <P> Last month, Secretary of State James A. Baker III set off a controversy by  suggesting that the United States might withhold some aid to Israel unless the  Israeli government could guarantee that the money would not be used for  settlements in the occupied lands. Although Baker later appeared to back off  that position, the issue remains a contentious one.  </P> <P> Speaking to the American Society of Newspaper Editors on Friday, Bush said "I  have no intention of tying aid" to Israeli policy decisions.  </P> <P> Bush also denied that the Administration is pressing Israel to open talks with  members of the Palestine Liberation Organization.  </P> <P> "One of Israel's fears was that they would be compelled to talk to the PLO,"  Bush said. "We have made very clear to them, in detailed negotiations, that  that was not the case."  </P> <P> Bush also denied that former President Jimmy Carter was carrying any message  from the White House when he met earlier this week with PLO chief Yasser Arafat  in Paris.  </P> <P> "He was not acting with the blessing of or the disapproval of or anything else  of the Administration," Bush said. "A former President should be free to do his  own thing, and that's exactly what he's doing."  </P></p>

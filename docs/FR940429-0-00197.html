Several commenters believed that a single instance or even a few instances of late payments would not necessarily be indicative of financial problems. Many commenters believed that an institution should be considered current, despite not having made scheduled payments, if the institution is currently involved in negotiations with creditors to restructure or reschedule outstanding debt. A number of commenters suggested that a pattern of late payments on the part of an institution would be a more reliable indicator of financial difficulty than would a single instance of failure to pay. Many of the commenters suggested that the Secretary rely on the judgement of the institution's independent auditor in determining whether or not such a pattern of late payment exists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In general, the Secretary believes that an institution's ability to meet its financial obligations when due is indicative of financial health. However, the Secretary recognizes that over the normal course of a business cycle an institution may occasionally delay payment to certain trade creditors as a result of contractual disputes. Alternatively, the Secretary recognizes that an institution that is experiencing cash flow problems will typically delay payment to creditors in an effort to conserve cash. Clearly, if the cause of an institution's delay in making payment is contractual in nature, than the Secretary expects that this would occur infrequently. If the cause is related to insufficient cash flow, then the Secretary would expect to observe a recurring pattern of late payments to creditors. The Secretary believes that payments related to long term liabilities such as term loans from financial institutions, bonds, debentures, or notes payable which become due beyond one year are of significant importance because the institution's assets are typically pledged, encumbered, or assigned to collateralize such obligations. The Secretary agrees with the commenters that an institution is current, despite having failed to make scheduled payments, if the institution has reached an acceptable agreement with creditors to substantially reschedule or restructure the outstanding debt. However, the Secretary believes that a failure, on the part of the institution, to reach an agreement with creditors after a reasonable period of time exposes the institution to potential financial and legal problems that may adversely affect the quality of the institution's educational program. Information about the institution's outstanding debt is already provided by the institution in its audited financial statement. Furthermore, the institution's independent auditor has a responsibility to disclose any failure, on the part of the institution, to be in compliance with loan agreements in existence on the date the institution's balance sheet was prepared. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

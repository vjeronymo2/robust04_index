			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HERSHISER STILL CAUTIOUS AFTER THROWING;  </P> <P> DODGERS: HE TAKES STEP FORWARD IN WORKOUT BUT SAYS HE WON'T PRESSURE HIMSELF TO  PITCH BY OPENING DAY.  </P> <P> The faces plastered against windows of the Dodgers' executive offices were  smiling. On the field below, after catching another hard throw from this town's  most watched right arm, Chris Gwynn was wincing.  </P> <P> "Dang," Gwynn said. "His pitches feel pretty good to me."  </P> <P> But Orel Hershiser was not fooled. After taking another strong step in the  rehabilitation of his reconstructed right shoulder Friday, Hershiser issued an  equally strong warning.  </P> <P> "I will not consider it a setback if I am not ready to pitch opening day," he  said after 90 long tosses with teammate Gwynn at Dodger Stadium. "My ultimate  goal is to pitch again, I don't care if it's not until the All-Star break or  until the last day of next season."  </P> <P> Hershiser said that his short-term goal is to be ready for the Dodgers' opener  April 9 in Atlanta but that it is no more than a goal.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to put that goal out there and say, 'If I don't get it, the  surgery didn't work,' " he said. "Sure, if I was ready by the start of the  season, that would be a great script, wouldn't it? But I have no idea if the  surgery is going to go by that script."  </P> <P> Hershiser added that, although his recovery continues to proceed nicely, he  hopes Dodger management will not consider him a member of the rotation when  carrying out its winter game plan.  </P> <P> "This is not a reflection on my rehabilitation, but I think it would be great  if the Dodgers would not plan on me being here," he said. "That way, when I am  healthy, we will have all these extra cards to play. That way, we will get even  stronger.  </P> <P> "It's the cliche of cliches that you can never have enough pitching. But  really, I would like to see us get more pitching."  </P> <P> Beginning today at the annual winter meetings, Dodger Vice President Fred  Claire will be following Hershiser's advice. Expect the Dodgers to make bids  for remaining free-agent starters Zane Smith and Kevin Gross, then listen to  offers of starting pitchers for outfielder Kal Daniels.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, back at Dodger Stadium, Hershiser will continue to work with team  therapist Pat Screnar three days a week, nearly three hours a day.  </P> <P> As if the rehabilitation weren't difficult enough, they are essentially doing  it blindfolded. Because Hershiser's shoulder operation involved a landmark  procedure, there are no case histories they can follow.  </P> <P> "Orel being the first pitcher at this level to have that procedure, we're  basically going through uncharted waters," Screnar said. "Everything is going  extremely well to this point, but we can't predict opening day, it is just too  far away."  </P> <P> Hershiser began throwing Wednesday for the first time since the end of the  season. He hopes to be throwing off a mound by the middle of December.  </P> <P> Then, at the Dodgers' mid-January workouts, he hopes to reach the first real  milestone of his comeback: facing live hitters in batting practice for the  first time since the surgery on April 27.  </P> <P> If he is to have any chance of making the opening-day roster as a starter, he  should be throwing batting practice by the start of spring training.  </P> <P> "If I want to break camp with the team, I've got to be able to get my  competitive legs against other teams during spring training . . . it can't just  start happening during the season," Hershiser said.  </P> <P> While Hershiser threw several balls very hard Friday, he wonders if or when he  can throw every ball hard.  </P> <P> "Yes, I might have thrown 10 balls in the mid-80s (m.p.h.) today," he said.  "But the question is, can I throw 90 of those pitches with just a three-five  minute break between 12 of them. And can I do it 35 days a summer?  </P> <P> "I just don't know. Nobody knows."  </P></p>

The two events mark a major step toward a new stage of trade  and economic cooperation between the two countries, observers  here said.    Despite frequent frictions in Sino-U.S. trade and economic  ties, their cooperation in the field has been developing at a  encouraging pace in recent years.    China's customs statistics show that the trade volume  between  the two countries reached 27.65 billion U.S. dollars in 1993,  registering an increase of more than 10 billion U.S. dollars  over the previous year.    Last year, both countries saw a great increase in their  exports to each other. The U.S. export of machinery and  electronic products, airplanes, and complete sets of equipment  to China rose more rapidly.    The United States has maintained its status of China's third  largest trade partner and China has also become a major trade  partner of the United States.    China is the purchaser of one fifth of the U.S. total export  of wheat and one sixth of its exported phosphate fertilizer.    Besides, as a major buyer of the U.S. airplanes, China has  bought more than 200 Boeing airplanes with a total value of over  10 billion U.S. dollars.    Meanwhile, China has approved about 8,000 U.S.-funded  projects with a total contractual investment of 10.8 billion  U.S. dollars, and the United States has become one of the  largest foreign investors in China.    An outstanding feature for last year's U.S. investment in  China is that more and more transnational corporations have  showed great enthusiasm in investing in China. Up to now, many  of the 500 U.S. leading firms have launched large-sized joint  ventures with China.    The Clinton administration has made the revitalization of  the  economy and the enhancement of the competitiveness of the U.S.  products as one of its major tasks, while China, with a  sustained high-growth of economy, is formulating and  implementing its overall economic development program.    Therefore, trade between China and the U.S. are strongly  complementary in many ways and the two may enjoy each other's  huge potential markets, thus increasing the competitiveness of  their products through cooperation.    Moreover, China imports a large number of products from the  U.S. every year, such as wheat, aircraft, fertilizer, paper,  machines and electronics.    With the development of China's national economy, the demand  of its domestic market will be further enhanced. Its targeted  import volume between 1991-1995 is estimated to be more than 400  billion U.S. dollars, which involves the construction of  airports, power stations, energy and telecommunication projects.  And the power station projects only will cost over 10 billion  U.S. dollars, which will surely intrigue foreign enterprises,  including the U.S. ones.    Despite of the sound grounds for the further development of  the Sino-U.S. trade and economic ties, the annual discussion on  China's most favored nation (MFN) status in the U.S. has been  casting a shadow on them. Chinese trade officials said that a  smooth development of bilateral trade and economic ties needs a  permanent solution of the MFN issue.    Trade deficit is another factor that has affected bilateral  trade relations. The reason lies in different methods of  statistics and some U.S. export limitations to China.    According to sources, China and the U.S. have agreed to set  up a working group to solve the difference in counting between  the two sides.    People here believed that if the U.S. rescinds its  limitations in export to China, China's import from the U.S.  will surely see a remarkable increase.    They said that as long as the foresighted politicians and  entrepreneurs of both sides can grasp the opportunity, face the  challenge together and continue their fruitful cooperation, the  spring of a new era for the Sino-U.S. trade and economic  relations will come soon.</p>

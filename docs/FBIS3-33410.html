			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Peruvian Javier Perez de Cuellar, former UN  secretary general, yesterday said that the international  community's contribution is important to the solution of a  conflict or the strengthening of peace.    Nevertheless, he added that internal efforts should also  exist, such as the strengthening of civilian society through the  mobilization of intellectuals, the establishment of independent  and impartial media, associated networks for education in human  rights, and the formation of democratic citizens.    At the outstanding congress "International Contribution for  the Culture of Peace," Perez noted that foreign contributions  should not only be through the sending of peacekeeping forces,  rather it should also include assistance to the communities for  economic, social, and cultural development. Last Wednesday Dr.  Perez, who was honored with the "Jose Matias Delgado" order by  President Alfredo Cristiani for his contributions to peace in El  Salvador, said: "True peace can only be based on the  elimination of the injustice that unleashed and later fueled  violence."    During his speech, the Peruvian recalled the occasion when  the government and the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation  Front] concluded their negotiations in New York on 31 December,  20 minutes after his mandate as UN secretary general expired.  Several weeks later, this led to the signing of the Peace  Agreements in Chapultepec, Mexico. Perez explained: "What is  currently needed is for El Salvador to immediately become the  spokesperson for peace beyond its borders and to use the painful  memories of its own sufferings to help other nations avoid or  remedy the same. It is not a matter of denying the existence of  or the unavoidability of differences. Rather, it is a matter of  showing the bloody world of the former Yugoslavia, or the Middle  East, or Africa, that peace is the sole viable solution; not the  peace of the cemeteries nor of tyrants."    The former UN secretary general noted that the true  international contribution to the culture of peace is the one  that shows respect for human rights founded on justice, liberty,  coexistence, and civil cooperation.    The First International Forum on the Culture of Peace held  in  the country between 16-18 February, assembled 14 nations that  are currently engaged in armed conflicts as protagonists, 80  nations as observers in addition to local and foreign  organizations. The event -- organized by the government and  UNESCO -- was a success despite the inconveniences, Cecilia  Gallardo de Cano, education minister said yesterday. "In  education and culture one cannot be totally satisfied, but we  are excited because it surpassed all expectations. What is  important is that a culture of peace be created," she added.    The forum was criticized by some opposition political  parties  as they considered the date on which it was held was not timely  as the elections are at the doorstep and because of the  limitations imposed on the media.</p>

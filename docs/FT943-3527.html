			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Mitterrand's 'clarification' adds to confusion: After 14 years in power, the man and his image are crumbling fast Think of all those between the ages of 15 and 20. Ever since they became conscious of the political life of their country, all they have ever seen is me. Two months since saying this, and in the 14th year of his presidency, President Francois Mitterrand and his image seem to be crumbling fast. On Monday night, the French president underwent 90 minutes of questioning on television, ostensibly to clarify comments he had made about his health and his political past. Yet, still, he raised more questions than he answered. This was probably inevitable in the case of his health, given that the precise pace of Mr Mitterrand's prostate cancer is unknown. But what he has done is plunge French politicians into an early race to take his place in the Elysee next May - or earlier. The revelations could prove a setback for his own Socialist party - and perhaps give a boost to the far right. Immediate reactions to Mr Mitterrand's TV interview were mixed. Some praised the president's courage in talking about his cancer, and his candour in tracing his move from the political right to the left; from his pre-war conservative upbringing eventually to socialism. Others said they were moved, but used the word 'pathetic'. Mr Rene Monory, the centrist president of the Senate who would take over as interim head of state if the president died in office or resigned, said: 'I was a little sorry to see the president explain himself in such a way . . . it does not usually end this way'. Others complained that Mr Mitterrand was over-stretching their credulity in asserting that, when he went to work for the Vichy collaborationist government in 1942, he knew nothing of the anti-semitic laws it had passed in 1940; and that only in 1986 did he have cause to break off contact with Mr Rene Bousquet, the ex-Vichy police chief. But even yesterday Mr Mitterrand had a Jewish defender in Mr George Kiejman, his former justice minister, who came to his aid against sharp criticism from Mr Serge Klarsfeld, France's best-known Nazi hunter. But much of the French right believes the left has walked into its own trap in identifying itself so strongly with the resistance. Certainly, some Socialists - though not those at the very top - were yesterday expressing their 'disgust and bitterness' at Mr Mitterrand, and calling for 'a break with Mitterrandism'. This is defined as a form of persistent 'ambiguity' in personal and political relations. The fact that this ambiguity seems to have persisted right into the Mitterrand presidency appears most to upset the French Communist party, which was only allowed by Stalin to enter the anti-German resistance after 1941. In a new book on the president entitled 'The Right Hand of God', three French journalists claim Mr Mitterrand has consistently sought to divide the right by promoting and wooing Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front. In 1982, they claim, President Mitterrand arranged for the NF to get increased coverage on state television; and between the two rounds of the 1988 election, asked Mr Le Pen to swing his vote behind him rather than the gaullist candidate, Mr Jacques Chirac. These claims are denied by close Mitterrand associates. But it is true that the introduction of proportional representation in the 1986 parliamentary elections, designed primarily to minimise Socialist losses, had the side effect of helping the NF. Yesterday a senior NF party official suggested that 'if Francois Mitterrand was elected despite his real flirt with Vichy, then Jean-Marie Le Pen can be elected despite his false image as a Vichyist'. This, too, stretches belief. But it is likely that Mr Le Pen, who is due next Sunday to become the first declared candidate for the 1995 presidential race, will try to turn Mr Mitterrand's revelations to his own benefit. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur will try to keep his government ticking over until early 1995 when he intends to announce his own presidential candidacy, against, among others, that of Mr Chirac. But the weekly cabinet meetings on Wednesdays, over which Mr Mitterrand presides, will become even more curious affairs. The president will be watching for divisions in the government which he might divulge publicly, as he did last week to Le Figaro newspaper. Among his ministers, the rival Balladur and Chirac clans will be on the lookout for any sign of increasing presidential infirmity to send them to the hustings.</p>

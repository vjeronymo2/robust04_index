			<p><P> February 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRADLEY CHOOSES EX-HUD OFFICIAL AS HOUSING CHIEF  </P> <P> Carl D. Covitz, undersecretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban  Development in the Reagan Administration, was appointed Tuesday by Mayor Tom  Bradley to head the Los Angeles City Housing Authority Board of Commissioners.  </P> <P> Bradley chose Covitz, 49, to replace former Chairman Alvin Greene, who was  forced to resign in December after he missed commission meetings for six  months. At the time, Bradley relieved Deputy Mayor Grace Davis of duties as  liaison to the Housing Authority and reprimanded his chief of staff, Mike Gage,  for failing to keep him informed of Greene's repeated absences.  </P> <P> The City Council is expected to easily confirm Covitz's appointment. He  returned to Los Angeles last month to run Landmark Communities Inc., his  Beverly Hills development firm, and continues to work on solutions to the  savings and loan crisis as chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board of San  Francisco.  </P> <P> "He has a good background in dealing with issues of public housing," Bradley  said at a City Hall press conference.  </P> <P> "We believe this will strengthen the commission and will give us the kind of  experience that I think is going to be very helpful as we deal with the  problems that face that authority in the months to come," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Ideal Partner'  </P> <P> City Councilman Robert Farrell praised the selection.  </P> <P> "If one were to ask for a more ideal partner in helping us to deal with the  housing crisis in the city, the mayor could not have found a more capable  person," said Farrell, chairman of the council's Grants Committee.  </P> <P> The seven-member commission sets policy and provides oversight for the Housing  Authority. The agency maintains 33,000 residential units in 21 projects and  several rent-subsidy programs in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Federal conflict-of-interest regulations may prevent Covitz from making direct  appeals to HUD officials in Washington for additional subsidies, Bradley  acknowledged.  </P> <P> Covitz had been HUD undersecretary since 1987. He was responsible for the  day-to-day activities of HUD and was involved in taking over operations of the  troubled Chicago Housing Authority. He said he is not familiar with housing  needs in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "I think I need a little bit of time to research, understand and be briefed on  the issues," Covitz said. "I know the overall objective as it relates to  providing a helpful, safe, sanitary living environment for the tenants."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Departure From Policy  </P> <P> In an unusual move, Bradley said he advised several commissioners of his plans  to name Covitz chairman. In most cases, the mayor lets his commissioners select  the chairman of city boards.  </P> <P> "It is no reflection on anyone else sitting on the commission," Gage said. "It  is that this guy . . . obviously knows a great deal about the system and the  process and will be an enormous asset to the Housing Authority."  </P> <P> Acting Chairman Louis Janicich said he had not been informed of Bradley's  plans.  </P> <P> "I don't have any problem with it," Janicich said. "He is qualified and has  great HUD experience. At this point in time . . . I will go along with it."  </P></p>

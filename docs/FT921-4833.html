			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow falls sharply in the wake of bond yields rise Wall Street US SHARE prices fell sharply yesterday in the wake of another rise in bond yields and rumours that a major property developer was in trouble, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 27.06 at 3,241.50, having spent the day in negative territory. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended lower, down 2.81 at 406.52, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks dropped 8.32 to 621.97. Turnover on the NYSE was 208m. The day's economic news - a 21,000 fall in weekly jobless claims - provided little comfort, and once again the bond market, and another rise in bond yields, set the tone for equity sentiment. The day's trading was also cautious with investors wary, ahead of today's employment figures for February which could decide whether the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates again to get the economy moving. Bank stocks were harmed by rumours of financial distress at Olympia &amp; York, the big Candian property developer, which denied the rumours. Chase Manhattan fell Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 22 1/2 , Chemical lost Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 31 1/2 and J P Morgan slipped Dollars 1 to Dollars Dollars 59. Retailers were in the spotlight following the release of February sales figures that showed increases across the board, although the data were distorted by the extra leap-year day. Wal-Mart jumped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 53 1/4 after reporting a 20 per cent gain in sales, JC Penney rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 62 7/8 (sales up 10.5 per cent) and Woolworth fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 29 1/8 (sales rose 3.1 per cent). After a delayed opening due to an imbalance of sell orders, Gap fell Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 45 3/4 in turnover of 3m shares after the clothing retailer reported fourth quarter profits of 59 cents-a-share, and full-year profits of Dollars 1.62-a-share. Although the results were no worse than expected, the latest sales figures for February were below some analysts' forecasts. Baltimore Bancorp plunged Dollars 1 to Dollars 6 3/8 it restated its 1991 fourth quarter loss to Dollars 7.42-a-share because of an increase in loan loss provisions. Canada TORONTO real estate and financial shares led a broad market decline as rumours spread of financial difficulties facing real estate giant Olympia &amp; York Developments. Based on preliminary data, the composite index tumbled 42.09 points, or 1.17 per cent, to 3,545.55, with declining issues trampling advances 405 to 207. Volume was 27.4m shares worth CDollars 337.7m against the previous day's 25.5m shares valued at CDollars 279.3m.</p>

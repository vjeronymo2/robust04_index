			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Money supply grows faster JAPANESE money supply increased its growth rate slightly last month, adding weight to banking industry claims that there is no credit shortage. The broadly defined aggregate of M2 (cash in circulation and time and demand deposits) plus certificates of deposit rose 2 per cent in September, against the same month last year, having risen 1.7 per cent in August, the Bank of Japan said yesterday. It attributed the September rise, the sixth monthly increase in a row, to greater corporate fund raising in the capital markets, rather than more bank lending. This coincided with an announcement from the Federation of Bankers' Associations of Japan, the main industry body, that it had asked members to back the government's recent economic stimulation package by maintaining 'smooth lending'. Outstanding loans by the 11 top commercial banks fell 0.5 per cent to Y222,260bn (Pounds 1,365bn)in the six months to the end of September, the first half-yearly fall since the survey began 39 years ago. Mr Tadashi Okura, federation chairman, said banks would continue to try to help business through the recession.</p>

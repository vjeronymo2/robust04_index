			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Short-termism a political fault Sir, A future Labour government 'would seek to reform companies law to counter the culture of City short-termism which the party believes is harming industry', according to David Owen's article, 'Labour vows to combat City 'short-termism'' (May 3). The Conservatives, too, it seems, have identified 'short-termism' in the City as a weakness. Is this not a case of the pot calling the kettle black? All too often, politicians' horizons seem to be limited to the next election. Expenditure commitments made to court short-term popularity lead to an excessive tax burden in the future. Cheese paring today to keep the expenditure numbers down only results in higher spending later. What is seen as short-termism by company managements is often a response to their owners' wishes. Is this such a bad thing? It is certainly better than allowing managements to become unaccountable, as the record of the public sector shows. If investors seem to place too much emphasis on the short term, this is in part unavoidable: after all, the near future is more foreseeable than the distant future. Managements can help the many investors who do try to take a longer view by taking care to keep them properly informed of future plans. For both managements and investors, long-term planning is more difficult than it should be because of constant changes in government policy: the stop-go economy and the ever-shifting taxation rules. Major, Smith and Co should deal with their own short-termism before they blame the City. Philip Turner, deputy chief executive, Wassall, 39 Victoria Street, London SW1H 0EE</p>

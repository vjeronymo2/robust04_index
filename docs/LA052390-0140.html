			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 5-A BASEBALL;  </P> <P> SCHULTZ'S GAME IS COMPLETE AS MARINA UPSETS ESPERANZA  </P> <P> David Schultz, pitching his second complete game of the season for Marina High  School, led the Vikings to a 3-1 upset of Esperanza in the second round of the  Southern Section 5-A baseball playoffs Tuesday at Marina.  </P> <P> It was the first time Marina (14-12-1) has advanced past the first round of the  playoffs since losing to Lakewood in the 1976 semifinals.  </P> <P> Schultz (6-2), a senior right-hander, allowed one run and five hits while  striking out four and walking three.  </P> <P> "It was the best game I've ever pitched," Schultz said.  </P> <P> Marina next plays host to Mater Dei in a quarterfinal game Friday.  </P> <P> Marina jumped on Esperanza starter Joe Foss (7-1) in the second inning to take  a 2-0 lead.  </P> <P> Keith Martin doubled down the right-field line and scored on Brad Barton's  single. One out later, Barton scored on Jeremy Preall's double down the  right-field line.  </P> <P> Marina increased its lead to 3-0 in the third, when first baseman Marc Newfield  hit a home run, his fifth of the season.  </P> <P> "We were really relaxed today," Viking Coach Paul Renfrow said. "There was no  pressure on us. Everyone counted us out in the beginning. The pressure was on  Esperanza. It's exciting to play a team like Esperanza and come out on top."  </P> <P> Esperanza scored in the fourth, when Jason Hodges singled in Rich Hills. With  two outs and runners on first and third, Esperanza tried a double steal, but  catcher Robin Lindsey made the play at the plate.  </P> <P> Esperanza had another chance in the sixth. After Keith McDonald apparently  grounded out to second for the third out, the first base umpire ruled that the  ball went foul after hitting McDonald's foot. McDonald then singled to center,  putting runners on first and third.  </P> <P> But Schultz struck out Esperanza's top hitter, Dan Redington, to end the  threat.  </P> <P> "It felt like that was the old Marina when we didn't get that call," Schultz  said. "In years before, we would have folded, but I thought if we could get the  next batter, we'd go the rest of the way."  </P></p>

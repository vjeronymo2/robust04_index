The past year has been one in which we have comprehensively  implemented the instructions of the 14th CPC National Congress  and one in which we have advanced victoriously along Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theoy of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics.

Macrocontrol and regulation have strengthened and improved.  Marked achievements have been made in opening the market.  Foreign economic relations and trade have developed strongly.  The people's lives have continued to improve. New progress has  been made in the formation of the socialist legal system and  spiritual civilization. In particular, Fujian Province has  built closer ties with Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao compatriots,  as well as with overseas Chinese and friendly personalities  abroad. Their foreign economic and trade cooperation has entered  a new period of stability and development.

Seizing the  opportunity, deepening reform, widening the scope of opening up,  promoting development, and maintaining stability are the main  aspects of this year's work. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theoy of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line, and under the  leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang  Zemin as the core, we will hold high the banner of great  solidarity and great alliance, focus on development and reform,  preserve our political stability, bring about overall social  progress, and lay a good foundation for the materialization of  moderate prosperity in Fujian ahead of schedule.    The materialization of our objectives requires the hard work  of the people throughout the province, as well as the common  efforts of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao compatriots, and of  overseas Chinese and Chinese residing abroad.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Han Chong-ho] </F>   [Text] Recently the Japanese Foreign Ministry issued a  report entitled, "Looking Back on the International Situation  and Its Prospects." This report sums up the diplomacy of 1993  and elucidates diplomatic goals for 1994. This report says that  the greatest diplomatic tasks for this year are improving  U.S.-Japan relations and dealing with North Korea's nuclear  issue. In particular, if North Korea agrees to accept the  International Atomic Energy Agency's complete inspection at the  U.S.-North Korea negotiations, Japan and North Korea will resume  working-level contacts in Beijing which was suspended since the  eighth Japan-North Korea negotiations in November 1992.    The Japan-North Korea talks which started in January 1991  discussed issues including the issue of compensation for the war  crimes committed by Japan. These issues were discussed prior to  discussing the establishment of diplomatic relations. When the  Japanese side brought up the issue of Yi Un-hye (the Japanese  instructor to former North Korean terrorist Kim Hyon-hui who was  responsible for the bombing of the Korean Air Lines plane in  1983), the North Korean side left the negotiating table and  talks have been suspended since. Japan proposed resuming talks  on many occasions, but the North Koreans rejected it each time.  A Japanese source in Seoul said: "The Japanese Embassy in  Beijing frequently telephones the North Korean Embassy in  Beijing on meeting, but the North Korean side continues to  reject our proposal."    A Japanese diplomat who assumed office in Beijing in July  1993 has not yet exchanged greetings with the North Korean side.  North Korea only recognizes the United States as a counterpart  to dialogue and has even left out the ROK. Therefore, the  Japanese Government is not hastening to resume the Japan-North  Korea talks and is maintaining a position of observing  U.S.-North Korea negotiations.    However, the Japanese side is becoming active again. On 28  December 1993, Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata revealed a  desire to resume negotiations with North Korea by using the  issue of compensation as a starting point. Also on 9 January,  on his way home from visiting China he held a news conference  and openly proposed to the North Korean side that negotiations  be resumed. Compensation is an issue because North Korea demands  compensation for Japan's illegal colonialization of Korea which  Japan insists that the Japanese annexation of Korea was  legitimate and will only recognize property rights and claims of  unpaid wages.    Japan has been experiencing difficulties in the talks  because  of North Korea's nuclear issue. It also revealed that if North  Korea is willing, talks with North Korea may be resumed at  anytime. However there are doubts on whether Japan truly wants  to achieve talks to establish diplomatic relations with North  Korea.    Kim Pong-chin, professor at Japan's North Kyushu University,  is in agreement with this claim. In a paper written for a  scientific journal published at the National Unification  Research Institute, he analyzed: "The greatest agenda in the  Japan-North Korea negotiations to establish diplomatic relations  is the issue of liquidating the past. The reason that North  Korea is rejecting the talks is that Japan is intentionally  neglecting internal tasks such as the issue of compensation by  putting forth external elements such as the nuclear issue."  Professor Kim continued: "Based on the Cold War era way of  thinking, Japan is playing the role of proxy for the U.S. policy  toward North Korea and is trying to advance its own interests to  the utmost by taking advantage of the weak points and  limitations of the ROK's North Korea policy."    Japan's situation on the issue of North Korea's nuclear  issue  is summarized as 'accepting reality as it is to establish  countermeasures.' This theory is that a countermeasure must be  provided to prevent nuclear development since a war may break  out if sanctions are carried out toward North Korea. More than  any other country, Japan is a country that generates the most  rumors of danger on the Korean peninsula. Therefore, it is  peculiar for Japan to reach such a leisurely conclusion. What  Japan is promoting from the level of 'taking measures' for  nuclear development is the Theater Missile Defense plan. Japan  claims that this is the interceptor system of North Korea's  NODONG No. 1 missile, but the ROK experts think that Japan is  using North Korea's threat to form a nuclear weapons  transportation system.    With North Korea's nuclear problem an issue, Japan is able  to  favorably lead the Japan-North Korea negotiations towards  establishing diplomatic relations and is using the nuclear issue  to promote arms proliferation. Once the nuclear issue moves  toward settlement, Japan will once again resort to liquidating  the past to promote economic relations. Thus, Japan is showing  flexibility in adapting to reality. This is the true nature of  Japan's practical diplomacy toward the Korean peninsula.    The National Unification Board presented a report  entitled "Current Situation and Prospect of Economic Relations  Between Japan and North Korea" during parliamentary inspections  of government offices last year. According to this report,  Japan's post-war policy toward the Korean peninsula was fixed  within the framework of U.S. policy on Korea. Since the  mid-eighties, however, Japan has pursued practical diplomacy  based on a policy of maintaining equal distance towards both  South and North Korea under the pretext of the slogan, "Post-war  liquidation with North Korea." This report assesses that Japan's  strategy toward the Korean peninsula has two parts -- the first  aims at expanding political influence on the Korean peninsula by  normalizing relations with North Korea, and the second aims at  promoting economic infiltration with capital and technology in  the initiative to reorganize order in Northeast Asia.    North Korea and Japan have virtually restored relations  although they have yet to formally establish diplomatic  relations. In 1992, a government inspection team presented a  surprising report after visiting various places in Japan to  inspect cooperative relations between Japan and North Korea.  This report reads: "Japanese businesses have already completed  the planning and survey stage and have gained an understanding  of North Korea's industrial situation, examined main projects  for important areas of North Korea, and studied conditions for  investment in North Korea. They are believed to have  established personal relations with leading figures in North  Korea -- influential figures, provincial party officials, and  managers of local industrial complexes. It is a matter of  concern that the North Korean economy may become subject to that  of Japan once diplomatic relations between the two are  established.  <H5>  Japan's Foreign Ministry Concerned About Information Leakage </H5>   Japan's East Asian Trade Institute and the Japan-North  Korean  Trade Association visited Pyongyang together on two occasions in  April 1991 and July 1992 to discuss items that North Korea may  want to develop and import. Experts are saying that the  "tripartite trade route" connecting North Korea and Japan  through the former Soviet Union and Hong Kong in the fifties and  the sixties has been revived as the "tripartite investment  route."    Likewise, Japan is disregarding the nuclear issue and  steadily pushing ahead with work to expand its own interests in  North Korea. The United States and the ROK will not intervene in  Japan's affairs as long as Japan cooperates in the resolution of  the nuclear issue and the improvement of South-North relations.  In the beginning of the new year, ROK Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu said that he would establish various diplomatic  measures in preparation for the North Korean establishment of  diplomatic ties with the United States and Japan. Regarding  this, a ROK diplomat in Seoul said, "Japan must obtain ROK and  U.S. consent before establishing diplomatic ties with North  Korea. North Korea is well aware of this. Minister Han's  remarks on ROK support in the establishment of diplomatic ties  between the two means that the ROK is willing to conciliate  North Korea with the Japan card in the last stage of  negotiations for resolving the nuclear issue, and not that it  will actually help in the establishment of North Korea-Japan  diplomatic relations."    Reaching a resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue  means  the beginning of a new diplomatic war. Japan is preparing for a  new strategy towards the Korean peninsula while ROK leaders  dream sweet dreams of South-North dialogue, whose resumption  remains distant.    On 28 December 1993, a visit to North Korea by a delegation  of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDP] led by dietman  Hajime Hukata, director of the Organizational Department of the  SDP Central Committee and executive officer of the Japan-DPRK  Friendship Promotion League at the request of the Workers Party  of Korea [WPK] generated interest from diplomatic circles.  Hukata is a typical pro-North Korea politician who had visited  North Korea on 28 September 1990 with Kanemaru, then-vice  president of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, to realize  the joint tripartite declaration. He met Hwang Chang-yop,  secretary of the WPK and chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, on 30 December.  Hwang Chang-yop leads the work to establish diplomatic ties  with Japan as the head of a special agency recently established  by North Korea on re-establishing diplomatic relations with  Japan.    Hukata's visit to North Korea, however, failed to interest  ROK and Japanese media because an SDP dietman's visit to North  Korea is not meaningful under the situation, in which the  coalition ruling party's future is unclear. An official of the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, "I observed Hukata's visit to  North Korea with interest, but didn't find anything worth  noticing."    Ever since the pro-North Korean SDP became the ruling party,  the Japanese Foreign Ministry has become deep suspicious of the  coalition ruling party's policy toward North Korea. An  influential dietman of the Japan Renewal Party, Hajime Isihi,  was the executive officer of the team to visit North Korea in  1990, and Chief Cabinet Secretary Kajimura, who controls key  departments of the cabinet such as the Intelligence Office, the  Foreign Policy Deliberation Office, and the Security Office, was  the deputy executive officer of the delegation to North Korea.  An unidentified Japanese foreign ministry official told the  Japanese press that "It [the Foreign Ministry] cannot help but  worry about possible information leakage since most of the  Hosokawa regime's members are pro-North Korea."    Japan's diplomatic policy is influenced by government  officials. Regarding this, an observer well-versed in Japanese  affairs, said to keep an eye on Yutaca Kawashima, minister at  the Japanese Embassy in the ROK from July 1992 until November  1993, when he was appointed director of the Foreign Ministry's  Asia Department, the hub of Japan's foreign policy.</p>

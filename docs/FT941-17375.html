			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Red Adair retires from the fires 'Red' Adair, whom oil producers turned to for decades to fight the world's worst oil well fires, said yesterday he had sold his business and was retiring from active duty, Reuter reports from Houston. Global Industries of Louisiana bought his company, Red Adair Co Inc of Houston, for undisclosed terms. Pressed on the price, he said: 'I can't count that high.' Mr Adair, 78, is retiring from day-to-day operations but Global said he would provide public relations and business development services to Global under a personal service contract. Born in Houston, he won a reputation for fearlessness by fighting oil and gas well fires and blowouts around the globe in a career that began in 1938 and was capped by his success in bringing 119 burning Kuwaiti wells under control after the Gulf war.</p>

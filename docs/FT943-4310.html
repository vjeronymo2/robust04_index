			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Unions today This week's Trades Union Congress has been a subdued affair. But through the haze of rhetoric it has been possible to detect the shape of a reformed trade union movement. Further reform may not be sufficient to ensure unions a dynamic future. But they can still enjoy significant if lesser roles as lobbyists for employee rights and providers of assistance to individual members. Re-legitimised by ballots, the unions are more representative than they have been for decades. Thanks to the campaign to sign up members for the automatic 'check-off' of union subscriptions, it is also possible to state that membership is real and voluntary. Moreover, unions carry a far smaller part of the blame for the UK's labour market problems than they used to. Much of the credit for this transformation belongs to successive Conservative governments, but Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, could prove the main beneficiary. Earlier this week, he shrewdly used the signal workers' strike to loosen further the union hold over his party. However it is premature to imply, as Mr Blair does, that the unions are merely a pressure group with the same access to Labour as business. Mr Blair cannot wriggle out of union-inspired policy commitments - such as a national minimum wage. And at a private dinner on Tuesday he assured union leaders that he still needs them to win an election. Nevertheless, both Mr Blair and Mr John Monks, general secretary of the TUC, do share a sensible vision of modest, non-partisan trade unionism, supporting individual employees in a rapidly changing labour market and providing a voice for employee-stakeholders in larger organisations and an expert view on employment and training at national level. That view may prove more popular than the dismissive attitudes of Conservative ministers. This is not enough, however, to ensure unions a healthy future. There are signs - from Mr Monks's relaunch of the TUC to union use of shareholder forums to lobby for employee interests - that unions are becoming more effective. But collective bargaining and union membership are likely to continue to decline, albeit at a slower pace than in the recent past. Such a decline would not necessarily be stemmed by worker-friendly European legislation, based on employee not union rights, or by the election of a Labour government. But unions are not ends in themselves. What is needed is a balanced framework of employment law. Contrary to much union rhetoric, employees are not without rights at the workplace, but that framework does need clarification. A clearer right to union representation in individual grievance cases, which Mr Blair would introduce, is a case in point. It would also offer unions a new role in providing professional and legal support to individuals. If they are to thrive, these are the opportunities they must seize.</p>

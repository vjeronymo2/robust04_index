			<p>940414 FT  14 APR 94 / Buddhist group to be probed The South Korean government has agreed to a parliamentary investigation of allegations that the Chogye order, the country's main Buddhist group, was involved in illegal financing of President Kim Young-sam's 1992 election campaign. At the same time the administrative head of the Chogye order resigned yesterday, yielding to pressure from reformist monks who have staged violent protests. The Rev Suh Eui-hyun has been criticised by reformers for abusing his office by allegedly accepting bribes from monks who sought appointments to head some of the Chogye order's 1,700 temples. The Chogye order claims 90 per cent of the nation's 20m Buddhists, who account for almost half South Korea's population. Reformist monks attacked the Chogye temple headquarters in central Seoul at the weekend after Rev Suh was elected for a third term. Intervention by riot police to quell the protest provoked opposition charges that government was supporting Rev Suh because he was allegedly involved in financing President Kim's election campaign.</p>

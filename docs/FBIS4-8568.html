			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by James Hider: "Skoda To Produce Cars in Poland"] </F>   [Text] The Mlada Boleslav automaker Skoda announced March  18 that it will produce automobiles abroad for the first time in  its history. It intends to open a plant in the Polish city of  Poznan that will turn out an estimated 5,000 cars this year,  with a capacity for expansion in the future. Ludvik Kalma,  director of the factory in Mlada Boleslav, explained that this  is the only way to avoid restrictive tariffs on exporting Czech  cars to Poland. Skoda has negotiated unsuccessfully with Polish  officials to reduce these duties, which could increase car  prices by as much as 41 percent.</p>

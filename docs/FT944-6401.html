			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Moscow share offering Red October, a Moscow-based confectionery company, yesterday launched Russia's biggest public share offering for cash as part of a broader government-sponsored effort to encourage industry to raise equity finance. The issue, which has been underwritten by Russian companies and financial institutions, will raise Rbs70bn (Pounds 13.8m) for new investment. Red October, or Krasny Oktyabr, is one of the best known companies in Moscow, occupying an imposing red-brick site on an island opposite the Kremlin. Its 250 confectionery lines, including Clumsy Bear chocolates and Lobster Tail sweets, have been popular with generations of Russians. The issue is being part-financed by the UK government's Know-How fund. Mr Richard Wilson, adviser to the fund, said the first stage of the Russian privatisation programme had created a large secondary market for trading shares but had not established a primary market for companies wishing to raise equity finance. Of the 3.5m shares being offered, 1m will be allocated to Russian retail investors, 1.5m to local institutional investors, with the rest being marketed to international investors in London. Unlike most Russian companies, Krasny Oktyabr has maintained stable production levels in the past few years and made profits of Rbs16.6bn on turnover of Rbs71.2bn in the first six months of 1994.</p>

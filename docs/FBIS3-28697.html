			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 8 KYODO -- Public support for the  cabinet of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has plummeted to  52.5 percent from 64.7 percent in December following the  political crisis sparked by his announcement last week of a new  7 percent indirect tax, the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reported  Tuesday [8 February]. It was the lowest since Hosokawa formed  the coalition cabinet last August, the business daily said.    Of those questioned, 65.4 percent opposed the "national  welfare tax," compared with 32.2 percent who supported it.    On Monday, TV ASAHI reported that its opinion survey  indicated a significant 21.1 percentage point decline in the  cabinet's approval rating to 56.3 percent, down from 77.4  percent on January 30 after Hosokawa succeeded in getting  political reform enacted by the Diet.    The NIHON KEIZAI's telephone poll, conducted between Friday  and Sunday, covered 3,000 out of Japan's 94 million voters, of  whom 1,868 gave valid responses.    The poll showed 27.2 percent did not support the cabinet, up  from December's 14.9 percent. Those who made no clear answer  reached 20.3 percent, up from 20.5 percent.    It said 40.3 percent were dissatisfied that Hosokawa decided  on the new tax "without full debate" and 37.3 percent opposed  the process of decision-making in which "an abrupt decision" was  reached "in closed-door sessions."    The poll indicated 19.0 percent voiced full-fledged or  qualified support for the decision-making process.    The opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) was the most  popular among political parties at 28.0 percent, up from 23.2  percent in December, followed by the Social Democratic Party at  12.8 percent, up from 11.2 percent, Shinseito at 10.3 percent,  down from 12.1 percent, and the Japan New Party at 9.4 percent,  down from 14.6 percent.    Asked who they support most among nine leading politicians,  17.5 percent said former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, 14.4  percent House of Representatives speaker Takako Doi, 12.6  percent LDP Policy Affairs Research Council chairman Ryutaro  Hashimoto, and 11.1 percent Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata.  Hosokawa was not among the nine.</p>

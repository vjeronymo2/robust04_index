			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Observer: Right arms Who would dare cross the threshold of Maggie's Den or brace themselves for a stiff one with The Iron Lady? Much of British history is celebrated in pub signs; the Saracen's Head recalls the Crusades, John of Gaunt is remembered as the Red Lion, and Richard III as the White Boar. So the Brewers' Society decided to ask the publicans of today for their opinion of contemporary history. What facets of modern life did they think likely to be commemorated on the pub signs of tomorrow? Not surprisingly, of all the people and events that have made their marks on the 1900s, the two nominated for similar immortality are Margaret Thatcher and the computer. The Thatcher, in her usual fashion, dominated the political entries. Only two others merited suggestions - Norman Lamont (Lamont's Lament) and David Mellor (The Mellor Drama). But The Silicon Chip, The Bit and Byte, The Computer and Mouse, et al, according to the licensees, was likely to be honoured long after that other phenomenon of our times, the Euro-Sceptic, was forgotten.</p>

			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / US leading indicators rise sharply: Administration officials hint at Dollars 31bn economic stimulus THE BIGGEST increase in the US index of leading indicators in nearly a decade and a sharp rise in new home sales yesterday provided further evidence of an accelerating economic recovery. The figures were released as officials hinted that the Clinton administration may be planning a short-term economic stimulus of about Dollars 31bn (Pounds 20.5bn), rather than the Dollars 15bn-Dollars 20bn mentioned by aides last week. The Commerce Department said the leading index rose 1.9 per cent in December, the largest increase since December 1983. Separate figures showed a 6.3 per cent increase in new home sales in December and a large upward revision for figures for November. New home sales rose 19.4 per cent in 1992 as a whole - the largest annual increase for nearly a decade. A White House spokeswoman said President Bill Clinton was encouraged by the improved tone of recent economic statistics but remained very concerned about the lack of job growth. 'We've got to find a way to put people back to work,' Mr Clinton said on Monday night. The Dollars 31bn stimulus package under consideration would include an immediate increase of about Dollars 15bn in federal spending, to take effect this fiscal year, with the remainder devoted to an investment tax credit. No final decisions, however, have yet been made. The administration is continuing to search for ways to cut the budget deficit by Dollars 145bn by fiscal 1997. Some senior advisers fear that mooted tax increases - such as a broad-based energy tax - would represent a politically damaging repudiation of Mr Clinton's pledge to lower the tax burden on middle-income families. Mr Clinton will spell out his economic strategy in his State of the Union address on February 17 and deliver a full budget on March 23. Federal Reserve governors and regional presidents met in Washington yesterday to chart a monetary strategy for 1993. The Fed has signalled it will co-operate with the administration by holding short-term interest rates at current levels for the forseeable future. Target ranges for M2, the broad measure of money, may be lowered this year, but this will be a technical adjustment, reflecting distortions in the monetary data, rather than a deliberate tightening of policy. The rise in the leading index was led by a surge in consumer confidence, a drop in weekly claims for unemployment insurance and an increase in corporate order books; only two of the 11 components of the index failed to contribute to the overall increase - real monetary growth and commodity prices.</p>

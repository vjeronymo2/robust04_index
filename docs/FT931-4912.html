			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Footloose across Europe's frontiers: Recession and the single market are prompting industry to reorganise and relocate A US maker of vacuum cleaners moves production from Dijon to Glasgow. A Swiss chocolate maker does the reverse. A US computer giant shuts a plant in Galway. Another builds one in Barcelona. The industrial map of Europe is being redrawn, some say for the next 30 years. Political passions run high and nations abuse each other. But who is actually winning? There are different pressures at work. The most obvious is the European recession, the worst for a decade. Others have nothing to do with the economic cycle. The single market is forcing companies to rationalise production. The opening of eastern Europe offers cheap labour and makes Germany more central than before. The continuing shift in working methods sets a premium on skilled and flexible workers. Mr David Rees, a location specialist with Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, says: 'Ten years ago, the key factor for a manufacturing plant was the size of the national market. Now it's a question of the European market, or at least the northern or southern European market. Previously, companies might make products in three countries to cater for national standards and tastes. Now, the point is that economies of scale can actually be achieved.' Service functions are being rationalised as well. 'Companies are increasingly looking to putting things like customer care in one centre for Europe. One US white goods manufacturer is doing that right now. Another US company has its accounting function in seven countries and is putting it into one,' says Mr Rees. And manufacturing techniques are changing. Mr Jonathan Wilmot, an economist with Credit Suisse First Boston, says: 'The reason the issue gets so emotive is that, if you look at new technologies such as lean production, the whole spirit is based on continuous innovation, in which managers use the workforce as part of the process on the Japanese model. If people are prepared to do whatever job comes, that makes a huge difference on the location decision.' These various pressures can work in opposing directions. The point can be simply illustrated in the case of the UK. Hoover's decision to close its Dijon plant and put all its production of vacuum cleaners in Scotland caused uproar in France last month. And the Hoover case is far from unique. Bowater, the UK-based packaging group, recently shifted production of some of its cosmetic packaging to the UK from France and Italy. The company has calculated national ratios for average employment costs at its plants, from managing director down to apprentice. If the UK is 100, says Mr Michael Hartnall, Bowater's finance director, Italy is 130, France 140 and Germany 170. IMI, the Birmingham-based engineering company, last year switched production of drinks dispensing machines from Germany to the UK. Mr Gary Allen, managing director, says: 'Even before sterling devalued, the UK was a very good place to invest relative to continental Europe. It has a very co-operative and flexible workforce. While we have to consult, we can make changes based on management decisions much faster than elsewhere. The social costs are significantly lower in the UK as well.' But there are pressures the other way. Mr Rees says: 'Our strengths are the English language, very good telecommunications and air communications. But the problem is the UK's image as a poor European. I can think of six or eight companies now headquartered in the UK which are moving out, and that's one of the reasons. I think it's doing us a serious amount of harm.' This might seem at odds with the fact that the UK has taken the lion's share of inward investment into Europe in recent years, whether from Japanese carmakers or US computer companies. But that, says Mr Rees, might now prove a handicap. 'In the case of Japan, there is a sense of gentle political pressure from Miti (the Ministry of International Trade and Industry) on Japanese companies not to favour Britain as much as in the past. In terms of Japanese-EC relations, that also follows from the image of the UK as a poor European. And while the UK has the advantage of language for a first location, there is often a tendency to be a bit bolder the next time.' Similar conflicting pressures can be seen in the case of Germany. Mr David Barnes, chief executive of Zeneca, the drugs and agrochemicals company about to be floated off from ICI, lists some drawbacks. 'If you're looking at building a new plant, the time taken for planning approval matters a lot. The Germans have got terribly bureaucratic, and that could start to work against them. You want a system which gives you a yes or no fairly fast. And I wouldn't put any product into German manufacture now involving any kind of genetic engineering. Hoechst has had an insulin plant ready for five years, and hasn't been allowed to operate it because of delays and appeals from the green movement.' Some German companies, at least, see it slightly differently. Mr Volker Jung, a director of electronics group Siemens, says: 'Even though it will be more and more difficult to manufacture in Germany, I have to admit it has many advantages. The labour force is experienced, Germany is central to Europe, and there are many products where automation is so far advanced that labour is not an important issue any more.' One country that is emerging as a winner is France, partly because of increased efforts by the French authorities to attract inward investment. Mr Rees of Ernst &amp; Young says: 'I believe France ought to be doing best, even if the noise they're making over Hoover may not help. France is dearer than Spain, but it's towards the lower end of the range. And it's a big country, with lots of good sites.' This seems borne out by the statistics. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has just published figures for inward investment in the first half of 1992. While investment in the UK fell almost 30 per cent from the year before and in Germany rose by just 7 per cent, in France it rose 31 per cent. For the first time, says the OECD, foreign direct investment in France is bigger than French investment abroad. But in one sense, generalising about countries is to miss the point. For many industries, the choice on location is not to do with nations but with regions within them. Mr Wilfried Vossen of Plant Location International, a Brussels-based consultant, says: 'There is more difference between French regions like the Ile de France and Lorraine, or between Dutch regions like North Holland and Amsterdam, than there is between Amsterdam and the Ile de France.' The point is borne out by Mr Hartnall of Bowater. When the company switched production to the UK, he says, 'we did it from the north of Italy and the Paris area to Portsmouth, which is cheap. If it had been the south of Italy instead of the north, or the M4 corridor instead of Portsmouth, it might have been different.' And as Mr Jung of Siemens remarks, a lot of purchasing decisions are political. 'Don't forget that all politics are local politics. Politicians will always find a way not to buy non-local products. For a guy seeking election in northern Spain, Hamburg is outside, whatever the EC says.' But if there are factors working against rationalisation within Europe, there are wider issues which go beyond Europe altogether. 'Bear in mind,' says Mr Allen of IMI, 'that we're up against Japanese competition. The overlay to all this is whether we should be making things in the Far East or the US.' Mr Jung puts the point more strongly. 'The real question for me is where production will be 10 years from now in world terms. The answer is east Asia, especially greater China - Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China. There you have the market plus low labour costs. Growth there will be much greater than in Europe, in terms not just of production but of product development.' But there will be enough upheaval in Europe to be getting on with. As Mr Wilmot of Credit Suisse First Boston puts it: 'The single market story is overlapping with the changing work methods story. The point is that no one knows what the end result will look like. That's political dynamite.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Investment on the move Direct investment flows in EC  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Dollars million          1989      1990     1991      1991      1992                                                     Jan-Jun   Jan-Jun  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium/Luxembourg      6,731     8,162        -         -         - Denmark                 1,084     1,207    1,459       547       669 France                  9,552     9,231   11,109     5,849     7,660 Germany                 6,997     2,313    2,200     1,474     1,573 Greece                    752     1,005        -         -         - Ireland                    85        99        -         -         - Italy                   2,529     6,316    2,542     1,226     1,727 Netherlands             6,772     8,234    3,700     1,069     2,977 Portugal                1,740     2,133    2,022         -         - Spain                   8,433    13,681   11,100     4,198     3,775 UK                     28,043    33,804   21,100    13,696     9,694  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: OECD  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

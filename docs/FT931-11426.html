			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / UK banks defend decision to withdraw support THREE major UK banks, which between them were being asked to provide Pounds 4m in new short-term finance for Daf, yesterday defended their decision to withdraw financial support for the truckmaker. National Westminster, Lloyds and Barclays said that they were presented with an unacceptable ultimatum on Monday afternoon by the Dutch government and the Flemish regional authorities, which were also involved in attempts to rescue Daf. Their decision not to support the refinancing plan was justified, they said, because they were being asked in effect to provide an open-ended commitment to support Daf. Their actions were defended by the Bank of England, which over the past week kept in close contact with the banks. The three banks are members of Daf's main banking syndicate, which consists of 10 international banks, led by ABN Amro, the Dutch banking group. Daf has drawn Pounds 300m from this syndicate, of which around Pounds 140m came from ABN, Pounds 25m each from NatWest and Lloyds, plus Pounds 10m from Barclays. Last week, the syndicate, including the UK banks, agreed to provide a short term bridging loan to Daf of Fl 50m (Pounds 18.5m) so long as the Dutch government and Flemish regional authorities also contributed Fl 50m each. The UK banks said they could not, at that stage, give a commitment to supporting Daf's medium-term rescue plan until this plan had been scrutinised by a firm of outside reporting accountants. This had first been made plain to ABN Amro last November, they said. Two days ago, the Dutch government and Flemish regional authorities told the banks that they were not prepared to wait for the result of another accountant's investigation. They wanted the banks to give a firm commitment immediately to both the bridging loan and the medium-term rescue plan. Last month, Daf received reports on the medium-term plan's viability by two firms it had been employing, AD Little, the management consultant, and Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the accountants. Mr Cor Baan, chairman of the Daf management board, said yesterday that a new accountant's study would take at least 10 weeks. As soon as the banks learned of the new condition, they informed Mr Pen Kent and Mr Mike Smith, two Bank of England executives. The Bank of England then told officials at the DTI. 'We were being asked to give a commitment to provide a very significant sum (around Pounds 100m, most of it by swapping existing debt for equity) on top of the bridging loan,' said a banker. 'And we had been given almost no information on which to make a rational decision about whether to participate.' Two members of Daf's supervisory board, Sir Adrian Cadbury and Mr George Simpson, said yesterday they felt that the Coopers and Little reports were of a high quality. Neither could understand why the banks wanted a separate report.</p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Media Futures: Where soft touch meets hard sell - America's strong push towards interactive advertising The coming year will be a vital one for interactive advertising, as dozens of magazines and newspapers go on-line and fibre-optic cable television trials are run in the US. Interactive advertising allows consumers to control the amount of information they receive about a product. Anyone who has scratched-and-sniffed a perfume advertisement has used interactive advertising, albeit in its most basic form. At the other end of the spectrum, advertisers envision customers digitalising an image of themselves and trying on clothes on a TV screen, or test-driving a new car model through virtual reality. Interactive advertising, in its truest form, provides layers of information to draw in the consumer. For instance, J Walter Thompson, the advertising agency, has developed an interactive advertisement for Ford, which is now available on Prodigy Online. The Prodigy user is invited to explore the Ford automobile by clicking on different parts of the car. Click the mouse on the hood, for instance, and a model of the engine appears. Click on the engine, and a full description of its mechanics is made available. Now interactive advertising is poised to move from an experimental phase to a defined medium. 'By this time next year, we should have a lot better idea of which direction we're going in and how fast we'll get there,' says Robert Berenson, president of the advertising agency Grey New York. 'The Time Warner TV trial, (which will contain an interactive capability), will be in place by May next year, and we'll have a lot more magazines and newspapers on the Internet.' The borders between entertainment, information services and home shopping networks get blurred in the interactive advertising mix. Nintendo, for instance, has a game out called Cool Spot, based on the red dot on a can of 7-up soda. Where fun ends and advertising begins is difficult to say. Interactive advertising will also offer chances to buy products through a personal computer or TV set. The ultimate goal of interactive advertising is to lead consumers from the initial arousal of interest to the point of sale. The New York Times, for instance, plans to offer a service allowing on-line readers to access theatre reviews, then make a reservation for a certain show. The telecommunications group US West is launching a number of TV-based interactive advertising services. One, City Key, is available at a number of hotels, and lets users 'take a tour of the city' on TV. The hotel guest can click on different cinemas, restaurants and museums shown on the screen in order to obtain more information. Technology is the main limiting factor for interactive advertising right now. 'We have so many ideas, but the technology isn't there yet,' says Jean Pool, senior vice president of J Walter Thompson. 'Since most places are not hooked up to the Internet, in most cases, the user still has to reach for a phone. An on-line reader cannot look at a restaurant review and make a reservation for a table, because not many restaurants are hooked up to an on-line service.' Technology is advancing rapidly, though. Last week Cybercash Inc, formed by executives from the Internet and the electronic payment industries, announced plans to develop a system giving on-line browsers the chance to pay for an item by credit card or bank transfers. Until the fibre-optic TV stations take off, the main experimenting ground for interactive will be the on-line services. 'The Internet is the only place right now where you can access a relatively large audience and try some of these strategies out,' says Clifford Friedman, senior managing director of the media and technology group at Bear Stearns, the investment bank. One reason companies and agencies are so excited about interactive advertising is that they believe it will be much more effective than passive advertising. 'Studies show that when people have to respond physically to an advertisement, it's much more likely to result in a sale,' says Norman Lehoullier, head of Grey Interactive. With the technology rapidly falling into place, interactive advertising looks set to occupy a significant portion of the advertising mix at many companies. 'It's not even a question of years, but of months,' predicts Marc Andressen, vice-president of technology at Mosaic, the software group. 'Interactive will be a prevalent form of advertising by the beginning of 1995.'</p>

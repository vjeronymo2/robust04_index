			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Nolan may probe private funds for political parties The Nolan committee on standards of conduct in public life may investigate the funding of political parties by private organisations - in spite of the prime minister's insistence that this should be outside its remit. Lord Nolan, a leading law lord, yesterday clearly indicated that the committee, which had its first meeting yesterday, would conduct the widest possible examination of rules for public servants. He said political donations would come within his committee's remit. The committee could also make recommendations on whether MPs should have paid interests outside their parliamentary work. He confirmed that the committee would not investigate any of the specific allegations of 'sleaze' that have been made against members of Mr John Major's government. But it appeared likely that former cabinet ministers who accepted paid directorships at companies with which they had been officially involved would be cross-examined in televised sessions. Asked whether the funding of political parties would fall within the committee's remit, Lord Nolan said: 'I would be very surprised if it did not, in this sense: that if party political funding was associated with some preference to the person providing the funds, some official preference, some government preference, then it would plainly come within our terms of reference.' This was in contrast to a statement by the prime minister in the Commons last week that the committee's investigation would have 'nothing to do with the financing of political parties, which has been dealt with by the Home Affairs Select Committee'. On the subject of whether MPs can hold outside interests Lord Nolan said the committee could not dictate to the Commons what rules it should have. But the committee would examine submissions from political groups on whether MPs should be allowed to have any paid outside interests. The committee has been asked to submit a first report within six months. In the early stages its work will be divided into four groups. These will examine the question of gifts in cash or kind to ministers, payments to MPs for parliamentary services, appointments to quangos, and paid appointments of recently retired ministers.</p>

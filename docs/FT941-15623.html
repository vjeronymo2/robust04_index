			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / World Trade News: EU turns screw in banana row - Latin Americans divided over what Brussels says is its 'last' offer Latin American banana exporters meeting in Costa Rica were yesterday divided over whether to bow to intense European Union pressure to accept Europe's proposed new banana import regime. Acceptance would end a two-and-a-half year row that has sullied relations between Latin America and Europe. The row has also embarrassed the EU by exposing its preferential trading arrangements with former colonies as illegal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It would offer several Latin American exporters improved quotas in Europe's protected banana market, but would legitimise a quota-based regime at a time when the Uruguay Round agreement on global trade liberalisation, finalised a month ago, has demanded all quotas be converted to tariffs as a first step to elimination of protection. The issue has come to a head this weekend because of the imminent release of a Gatt panel report on a complaint from five Latin American countries attacking Europe's banana regime as illegal. A hard-hitting first panel report, released in July last year, upheld the Latin American complaints and ruled that the Lome convention of preferential trading arrangements between EU members and their former colonies could not be defended as a free trade agreement, or customs union. In a letter to the trade ministers of Colombia, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Guatemala and Nicaragua, unprecedentedly signed jointly by three EU commissioners - Mr Manuel Marn, commissioner for developing countries, Sir Leon Brittan, trade commissioner, and Mr Rene Steichen, agriculture commissioner - the Latin Americans were warned that the new quota offer tabled on December 14 in the final stages of the Uruguay Round negotiation would not be improved, and would be withdrawn if it was not accepted before the Gatt panel report is published. 'A decision  .. is now very urgent,' the letter says. 'Once the draft panel report is sent to the parties involved  .. the offer of December 14 could not be maintained.' Main beneficiaries of the new quota offer would be Costa Rica, which would see its share of the 2.1m tonne quota for 1994 rise to 23.4 per cent from 19 per cent in 1992, Colombia, which would see a 0.8 per cent rise to 22 per cent over the same period, and Nicaragua, its 1992 share of 1.1 per cent rising to 1.9 per cent. The main casualty would be Ecuador, which strategically drove its exports up to a peak of 27.7 per cent of EU imports in 1992, in the hope of capturing a larger quota. Its share would be 20.2 per cent. Of the five Gatt complainants, Guatemala chose to be absent from the meeting in Costa Rica yesterday and appears reluctant to accept the EU ultimatum. A Brussels-based Latin American ambassador said yesterday: 'The deal is not perfect, but it goes a long way to meeting our objectives of better market access.' The EC Banana Trade Association condemned the EU ultimatum as limiting commercial choice, imposing higher costs, and encouraging over-production in Central America.</p>

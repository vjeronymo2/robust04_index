			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / The gamble pays off: South Africa's 'yes' marks a political point of no return After 40 years caught in the time-warp of apartheid, South African whites have finally opted to join the modern world. Within months, the white government will have abandoned the exclusive hegemony of centuries, and blacks will enjoy political power for the first time. For yesterday's unequivocal 'yes' vote for political reform takes the country past a point of no return on the road to multi-racial democracy. President F W de Klerk declared yesterday: 'Today is the real birthday of the new South African nation. We have closed the book on apartheid.' Mr de Klerk - who gambled his political future on Tuesday's whites-only referendum - could not have been more delighted at a vote which was both surprisingly large and overwhelmingly positive (and came on his 56th birthday). Defeat in the referendum would have been a disaster for the National party, and for South Africa. Instead, the landslide win will propel the country towards early agreement on a multi-racial interim government, and the international acceptability that such a move will bring. The breadth of support for Mr de Klerk - from rural Afrikaner communities to urban English-speakers - will have surprised even the most sanguine party official. Only hours before the poll, National party organisers were predicting at best a 55 per cent 'yes' majority, well below the eventual 68.7 per cent victory. In the end, only one of the country's 15 regions voted 'no': the northern Transvaal, the last refuge of the ultra-right, where border farmers have fought for years against real or threatened terrorist incursions, where drought and poverty have radicalised whites. But even in more liberal areas, informal exit polls suggest that relatively few 'yes' voters were inspired by the glorious vision of racial justice and equality proclaimed so eloquently by Mr de Klerk in his victory press conference. Many voted for largely negative reasons: to prevent the white supremacist Conservative party (CP) from taking power, and to stave off the race war and economic collapse which a CP victory would almost certainly have brought. But they voted 'yes' all the same: as Mr de Klerk put it, they 'rose above themselves'. Now he can claim their mandate to force the pace in constitutional negotiations with the African National Congress (ANC) and other non-white political groups in the multi-party forum, the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa). The outlines of a deal have been sketched in already during bilateral talks between the ANC and the government. An interim executive could be appointed by Codesa as early as June, with committees to oversee the security forces, local government, the budget and foreign affairs, as well as independent commissions to control broadcast media and multi-party elections. Within a year from then, elections would be held to a unicameral legislature which would both replace the current parliament and draw up a new constitution. This represents a significant concession by the Nationalists, who have always insisted on a second chamber, a sort of 'house of minorities', to protect whites. Such a legislature would meet the ANC's main demand: that an elected constituent assembly draw up a post-apartheid constitution, with decisions taken by a two-thirds majority. This body would sit for about a year until elections were held under a new constitution which would enforce power-sharing for a further five years. The new parliament would be bicameral, with disproportionately large representation in the upper house for minority political parties, apportioned by region. And, crucially, many powers would be devolved from central government to the regions. For this is the key to the National party's plan for preventing black domination: the ANC could dominate central government, but many of its powers would have been removed. In several regions, whites would continue to have a large say in areas such as education and fiscal policy. The plan could change - especially if the big 'yes' vote inspires Mr de Klerk to take a tougher line in Codesa on the ground that he can strike a harder bargain backed by such a large majority of whites. Conversely, the ANC might decide to be tougher, now that Mr de Klerk can no longer raise the bogey of the right wing to force concessions from it on minority rights. Either way, an interim government should be quickly in place. Many 'yes' voters are likely to be dismayed when the outlines of the draft constitutional settlement emerge in public. For the referendum campaign focused largely on other issues: the threat that CP policies would provoke international sanctions, and keep South Africans out of world sporting events; the spectre of socialism from the ANC. They knew they were voting for reform - but not at the breakneck speed now likely from Codesa. Unless the proposed constitutional deal is substantially altered in weeks to come, Mr de Klerk will be left with no choice but to reverse some referendum promises. Voters may feel betrayed, but with no further referendum planned to seek their approval for a final constitution, they will have little chance to show it. Herein lies the risk that the ultra-right - left with no legal outlet for opposition after yesterday's resounding defeat - will turn to violence. For the future of the newly united right must be tenuous at best. The Conservative party may struggle on for weeks or months making a show of unity where none truly exists. But eventually, the young moderates who argue for a more pragmatic form of 'self-determination' - and who might eventually settle for strong regional autonomy rather than a geographical homeland - must either hijack the party or break away from it. The radical rump, along with the paramilitary Afrikaner Resistance Movement (AWB), can be expected to destabilise negotiations with bombs or bullets. The risk of radicalism from the left is equally worrisome: as referendum results were being announced yesterday in a government office building in Cape Town, thousands of ANC supporters demonstrated noisily outside. They were not objecting to the referendum - indeed, the ANC did all it could to ensure a 'yes' vote, clearly terrified of the prospect of negotiating with the racists of the CP. They were protesting against the national budget presented yesterday by Finance Minister Mr Barend du Plessis. The hammer and sickle of the South African Communist party was much in evidence, and posters demanded 'jobs for all'. The demonstration illustrated the point often forgotten during the whirlwind referendum campaign: that successful political transition will be difficult against the background of South Africa's chronic unemployment (as many as 55 per cent of blacks are estimated to be unemployed) and three-year recession. For Mr de Klerk must now turn away from the sideshow of white politics and tackle the country's biggest problem: the economy. Recent figures from the South African Reserve Bank, the central bank, highlight the problem: real gross national product per capita has fallen from R3,905 (Pounds 781) in 1981 to only R3,275 last year. Unemployment continues to rise, the distribution of income is seriously skewed, inflation is in double figures, skills are short and labour and capital productivity low. For while business yesterday welcomed the referendum outcome - which could lead to the lifting of further international sanctions, with some nations likely to argue even for the lifting of the United Nations oil embargo - they know that only new investment can rescue South Africa's economy. And though Mr de Klerk promised, during the election campaign, that a landslide 'yes' vote would bring new foreign investment, he must have known that to be an unlikely prospect. Foreigners have not failed to invest because they feared the right-wing threat which has now been defused: they fear the ANC and the socialist bent of its economic policies. The ANC is due to hold an economic policy conference next month, at which the vexed issue of nationalisation will be debated. Though Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC president, has recently said he is reconsidering the issue, it remains immensely popular with the ANC rank and file, and with other ANC leaders. Politics has no answer for the problems of South Africa's economy. That is where the real battle will be joined between white and black: over the economic legacy of apartheid, over how to guarantee the prosperity Mr de Klerk has promised to all his constituents in the new South Africa.</p>

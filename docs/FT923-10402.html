			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / International Company News: Paribas to restructure domestic branch network PARIBAS, one of France's leading banks, is to restructure its domestic branch network involving 10 branch closures and the loss of 123 jobs. The move reflects the general trend in the big French banks to rationalise their networks. The aim is to improve profitability in an intensely competitive market, where margins have been under pressure for several years. The rationalisation comes at a time when industrial relations in the French financial sector are becoming strained. There have been disputes at banks and insurance groups as trade unions try to resist cost-cutting programmes. The Paribas job losses, the first in the company's history, have provoked union criticism. The rationalisation of the branch network forms part of the strategy developed by Mr Andre Levy-Lang, chairman, to refocus Paribas on its core interests in international investment banking. Paribas plans to close 10 branches in Paris and the provinces and to rationalise six other provincial branches. This will involve reducing the workforce in the branch network from 740 to 607. Paribas employs 3,400 people in France and 9,000 world-wide.</p>

			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VIDEO DISCOVERY: MORE VIDEOS:  </P> <P> "Cutter's Way" (1981), director by Ivan Passer. 109 minutes. Rated R. The story  of a crippled veteran, his best friend and their efforts to solve a murder,  this is also one of the best introspective character studies to come along in  years, a welcomed island of reality in Hollywood's sea of fantasy.  </P> <P> "Orphans" (1987), directed by Alan J. Pakula. 120 minutes. Rated R. Albert  Finney as a blustery Chicago gangster who is abducted by a crazed, third-rate  thief and held in the dilapidated house the thief shares with his younger,  backward brother. With his Midwestern gangster slang and alcohol-tainted good  manners, Finney parodies both American films and American values, uproariously.  </P> <P> "The Killing" (1956), directed by Stanley Kubrick. 83 minutes. No rating. A  band of very serious thugs plan the biggest score of their careers. An urgent,  no-nonsense, unrelenting film by the man who went on to direct "Dr.  Strangelove," "2001" and "A Clockwork Orange." DOUG LIST  </P></p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Trafalgar House in Pounds 204.5m rights issue TRAFALGAR House yesterday announced a one-for-two rights issue at 60p to raise Pounds 204.5m, and warned of further property write-downs. The ordinary and A shares of the construction, property and shipping group fell by 12p and 11p to close at 76 1/2 p and 75p respectively. Only months after the group unveiled massive write-downs for 1992 it warned that another Pounds 120m of exceptional losses and write-downs may be required by the year ending September 30. The total dividend is to be cut from 6p to 3.25p. Since the year-end net borrowings have risen from Pounds 352.6m to Pounds 580.3m, reflecting the effect of the devaluation of sterling on the translation of US borrowings. Mr Allan Gormly, chief executive, denied that Trafalgar had been 'forced' to raise cash. He said the group had decided to take advantage of the support of its biggest shareholder, Hongkong Land, the Jardine Matheson-controlled property company, which recently lifed its stake to 20.1 per cent and has pledged to take up its rights. Robert Fleming, the merchant bank advising Hongkong Land, is underwriting the balance of the issue, after putting the idea to Trafalgar. Under the terms of the issue, Hongkong Land has the right to increase its holding to 27.2 per cent. It plans to take it to 29.9 per cent. But in the absence of a bid from a third party it has agreed until April 1, 1994, not to make a full offer for the company. A second of its directors, Sir Charles Powell, will be appointed to Trafalgar's board at the beginning of April. Trafalgar will accelerate its withdrawal from the US commercial property market and reschedule the development of its principal UK commercial property projects. It recently realised Pounds 21m from the sale of properties. The group's borrowing covenants require it to maintain adjusted share capital and reserves of at least Pounds 500m. Following the rights issue and taking account of the expected property write-downs, pro-forma adjusted share capital and reserves would be Pounds 612.6m. Trafalgar has renegotiated the ratio of adjusted profits it is required to meet under the US notes, which have a nominal value of Dollars 225m (Pounds 149m), to allow it to borrow more.

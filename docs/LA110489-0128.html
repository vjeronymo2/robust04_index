			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> KEARNY'S SCOTT UPENDS MISSION BAY  </P> <P> Mission Bay's Big D -- its county-leading defense and proudest accomplishment  this season -- ran head on into a Big D of another kind Friday night at Mesa  College.  </P> <P> Kearny's Darnay Scott, a transfer student from St. Louis, had four catches for  55 yards and two touchdowns, one on a 92-yard kickoff return, to help silence  Mission Bay, 30-10, in a pivotal City Western League football game.  </P> <P> "There's no substitute for speed," said Mission Bay Coach Dennis Pugh. "And he  (Scott) obviously has it."  </P> <P> Scott's explosive kickoff return had a stunning effect on the Buccaneers who,  with less than a minute to play in the second quarter, trailed the Komets by  just 7-3.  </P> <P> "That touchdown before the half really hurt us," said Pugh, who had enough  problems with his top utility player -- running back/receiver/defensive back  Pat Betancourt -- out of the game with a bad ankle.  </P> <P> "They relied a lot on (quarterback Andy) Guyader's arm," said Kearny Coach  Willie Matson, whose Komets improved to 8-1, 4-0 and have only University City  to play next week. "Dennis told me before the game that Betancourt was out. I  thought he was kidding. With someone like him out, that hurt them a lot."  </P> <P> Guyader, a sophomore, was four for 18 for 74 yards and threw three  interceptions, two of which Kearny was able to capitalize on. Derrick Hardwick  intercepted a Guyader pass in the third quarter, and the Komets took over on  their own 28 with just over six minutes remaining. Eight plays later, Larry  Thurman kicked an 18-yard field goal to make it 24-3.  </P> <P> In the fourth quarter, Munchie Brown picked off a pass intended for Caprece  Pressley to set up Kearny's final touchdown. Quarterback Tommy Rawlins (10 of  15, 107 yards, three touchdowns) found Scott wide open and lobbed him a 10-yard  pass to make it 30-10. The extra point failed.  </P> <P> "I just found a lot of holes," Scott said, "I'm very happy, but this wasn't my  best game."  </P> <P> Mission Bay's only touchdown came early in the final period, when Schearon  Stewart ran 16 yards up the middle. Brent Kirsten's kick made it 24-10.  </P> <P> Rawlins hopes the victory, coupled with a victory next week against University  City, will give the unranked Komets some credibility when playoff seeding time  comes.  </P> <P> "There aren't too many teams in the county that are 8-1 with a one-point loss  (to Serra)," Rawlins said.  </P></p>

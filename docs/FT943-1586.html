			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Arts: The Mortal Ash - Theatre Richard Cameron's new play at the Bush Theatre - his third to be premiered there - is a dialect drama about life on a council estate in South Yorkshire and hence, by all too ready extension, about the state of Britain, the demoralising effects of unemployment. Actually the private and public themes of The Mortal Ash tend to pull apart, just as its tragic and comic impulses often seem at odds. Billed as a comedy, the play impresses first as a melodrama in which a working-class family confront calamity from every corner but keep cracking jokes in the best down-to-earth, hard-bitten, North of England manner. Feuds, vendettas, hooliganism, estrangement of father (Tom) and eldest son (Chris), imprisonment of another son for GBH, unruliness of a third (Duane), cynical disaffection of daughter (Rainy) - these are just some of the Wheatley family problems. The aviary in their backyard has been smashed up as the play begins, and a brick been hurled through the window while Rainy (Jane Hazlegrove) was watching telly. Throughout the evening one expects further hurled bricks and calamities; but all we actually see of trouble are the bare legs and torso of Duane (James Hooton) covered with nettle stings and Calamine after a gang-fight on Mortal Ash. Mortal Ash is an area of ponds that has been unpopularly filled in by a tough local businessman, and by hard-up Tom Wheatley as one of his labourers. A young girl died during a protest there, which leaves Tom conscience-stricken in ways he can barely express and which baffle and alienate the principled Chris, who has left home to live impecuniously with his now pregnant girlfriend, Linda (Colleen Prendergast), scion of an enemy family. Much, therefore, has to be sorted out during the play, but there is always someone on hand to make tea when things get too difficult, in the best Northern tradition. Screaming fits - Mrs Wheatley is particularly prone to them - and one-liners jostle each other in a way that is truer to the theatre than life. Each act devolves into a long set-piece in which mother and father respectively disburden themselves, conceding with wry humour in the one case, and bitter anguish in the other, that parents do not know much more than their children about the way things are. One realises that the intended thrust of the play is not so much comical, tragical or political as lyrical-pastoral. There is much talk of fishing and birds. At the end, Tom sets out to reconstruct his garden, building a pond and planting an ash. Director Simon Usher finds a leisurely pace for the action which seems mostly right and at times even poetical. Paul Copley is crisply convincing as the neo-Lawrentian muck-stained father home from work and delivering apophthegms like 'Thiy either will or thiy won't' when asked if Chris and Linda will cope with their child. Richard Standing makes a sympathetic Chris and Jane Cox is robustly entertaining as his soft-hard, wise-cracking mother. Bush Theatre, W12 (081 743 3388)</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Democrats lose the one that counted: Jurek Martin on the lessons of regional US elections IF THERE was one constant message emanating from the White House and from national Democratic party strategists in the weeks before the off-year elections on Tuesday it was that the only truly representative contest was for the New Jersey governorship. New York and Virginia were special cases, they all said, while mayoral races and other public policy issues on ballots across the country merely proved that all politics are local. Their contention was based on the confidence, reflected in opinion polls, that New Jersey Governor James Florio, the Democratic incumbent, would win and thereby demonstrate that pursuing tough, tax-raising policies did not necessarily translate into defeat. Governor Florio lost. He did not go down by much to Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican challenger, but his defeat, combined with the victories of Rudolph Giuliani in New York and George Allen in Virginia, meant Republicans swept Democrats out of office in the three most widely watched and partisan confrontations. This means the Democrats have lost all the six big races since Mr Clinton was elected last November - Tuesday's three, plus the Los Angeles mayoralty and Senate contests in Georgia and Texas. More than that, voters in Maine, in New York City and in two New York counties showed their displeasure with incumbents by approving limitations on the number of years or terms their elected representatives may serve in office. In New Jersey a proposition subjecting politicians to recall also won approval. Term limits is a popular cause among Republicans, who remain the minority party in most of the country. So is law and order, which again was vindicated in Washington state, where an initiative mandating life imprisonment for felons convicted three times was approved, and in Texas, which backed a Dollars 1bn bond issue to build more prisons. Not everything on the conservative/Republican wish list was granted. In California, Proposition 174 was defeated by 70-30 per cent. It would have issued state vouchers, worth Dollars 2,600 a child, for parents to use at schools, state or private, of their choice. It had been vigorously opposed by Mr Pete Wilson, the Republican governor, and President Bill Clinton. In Washington state, one drastic anti-tax initiative to roll back most of a recent Dollars 1.2bn tax increase went down by 56-44 per cent. The fate of a more modest alternative, tying future tax increases to rises in state personal income, hung in the balance yesterday. The significance of these Republican gains can be over-emphasised. Both off-year elections and those that take place in the middle of a presidential term, more often than not go against the 'in' party, though the latter elections, encompassing all the House, a third of the Senate and a majority of governorships, are much the more important. Nevertheless, it is possible that incumbents facing elections next year will construe the results on Tuesday as a warning not to buck local opinion if it does not like presidential or national party policies. This may make it harder for some Democratic congressmen to come off the fence and support the North American Free Trade Agreement later this month. In New Jersey and in Virginia it was apparent the quality of campaigns mattered a lot. Mrs Whitman's critical decision was to shake-up her staff operation last month and vest full authority in Mr Ed Rollins, the veteran Republican consultant. He cast her image in a far more positive light and induced her to attack more directly Mr Florio, who, under the guidance of Mr James Carville, President Clinton's election mastermind of last year, had turned a big deficit into a measurable lead with two weeks to go. In Virginia, Ms Mary Sue Terry, a former Democratic state attorney general, ran what is universally agreed to have been a truly terrible and mostly negative campaign against Mr Allen, converting a 30-point summer lead into an 18 point loss. In a significant sub-plot of the campaign, Mr Michael Farris, the Republican, lost his bid to become lieutenant governor by 54-46 per cent. A pure product of the religious far right, he was sufficiently encouraged by his showing to announce that he would run again. This was immediately taken as evidence that ultra-conservatives are thinking of splitting from the national Republican party three years from now. If Lt Col Oliver North, of Iran-Contra notoriety, wins the Senate race in Virginia next year, now a distinct possibility, the state will become the centre of this movement. At least Mrs Whitman's victory gave the lie to one of the more popular pre-election theories - that the advance of women to elected offices so evident last year was going to come to a juddering halt. Mrs Whitman seems to have run at least as well among New Jersey male voters as its women.</p>

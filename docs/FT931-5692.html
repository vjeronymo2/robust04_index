			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: German issues advance as rate cut hopes gain ground GERMAN government bonds advanced again yesterday on renewed confidence that official interest rates were about to head lower. This was despite a setback in the bond market on Tuesday, caused by the Bundesbank's decision not to lower money market rates through its regular repurchase agreement (or repo) auction. The March bund futures contract on Liffe moved ahead from 95.47 to 95.82 late in the day on moderate trading of around 50,000 contracts, while the June contract advanced from 95.89 to 96.20. Traders said that the fixed-rate repo on Tuesday at 8.49 per cent did not necessarily mean that the Bundesbank would not cut rates after its council meeting today, despite earlier disappointment in the market. Views seemed finely balanced, with some analysts arguing that the Bundesbank would not act for another two weeks, until after the so-called Solidarity Pact to stimulate economic growth in eastern Germany had been finalised. Others said a cut at that time, just ahead of the French election, could look too much like a panic measure, prompting the authorities to move today instead. On balance, a majority of analysts were still predicting a 50 basis-point cut in both the official Lombard and Discount rates would come today. LONG-DATED UK government bonds moved ahead by as much as one-third of a point on the German rate cut hopes, leading to a further flattening of the gilt yield curve. The spread between three-year and 15-year gilts fell to almost 150 basis points, having stood at 200 basis points a month ago. As the market moved ahead, two Pounds 250m of tranches of new stock issued on Monday were sold out. These were the 9 3/4 per cent gilts due 2002 and the 8 3/4 per cent gilts due 2017. In quiet trading, the June gilts contract on Liffe moved ahead from 106 1/4 to 106 1/2 . FRENCH government bonds reacted strongly yesterday to the prospects of lower rates in Germany, pushing the yield premium on French bonds to its lowest level for a month. The spread over the yield on 10-year German bonds slipped to 75 basis points, having started the week at around 90 basis points. The advance came despite the prospect of today's auction of FFr18bn to FFr20bn of government bonds, with the bulk expected in the 10-year area. TECHNICAL factors and central bank demand helped US Treasury prices rally strongly at the long end of the maturity range yesterday, sending the 30-year yield to record lows. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  25/32 at 104 13/32 , yielding 6.774 per cent, the lowest point since the issue was launched in 1977. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was 3/32 at 100 1/8 , to yield 3.789 per cent. Traders said there was no single reason for the strong gains at the long end. Some of the rise was attributed to expectations that the Federal Reserve would soon be buying large amounts of government securities to meet seasonal needs related to the end of the tax year. Other factors at play included: buying by unidentified central banks, which forced some short-covering by dealers; hopes for lower German interest rates; weaker-than-expected car sales figures; investors switching into bonds out of lower-yielding mortgage-backed securities; and municipal defeasance programmes, where municipal funds buy Treasuries and use the cash flow from them to pay off old debt obligations.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Fall in new funds at venture groups FUNDS raised by independent UK venture capital companies fell further last year to Pounds 300m, fuelling fears that there will be a shortage of money to invest in the late 1990s, Charles Batchelor writes. The drop from the Pounds 368m raised in 1991 is the third in a row since the peak in 1989, according to the British Venture Capital Association. In spite of the sharp decline in fund-raising in recent years, independent groups - those not part of a larger financial or banking group - had un-invested resources of Pounds 1.64bn at the start of 1992. Mr Robert Drummond, association chairman, said the recession meant few venture companies had attempted to raise money in 1992, but keeping money flowing in was one of the greatest challenges facing the industry, Liquidity among independent companies was concentrated in the hands of a few companies, he said, and concern was increasing that there will be a dearth of money in the late 1990s. Independent funds account for 45 per cent of UK venture capital investments, with the remainder coming from 'captive' funds owned by banks or pension funds and 3i, the large group owned by the clearing banks and the Bank of England.</p>

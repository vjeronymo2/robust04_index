Exclusions in such instances will be effective 5 days after receipt of the ALJ decision in the OIG headquarters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6)(i) After notice of a timely request for a preliminary hearing, the OIG may determine that the practitioner's or other person's continued program participation during the appeal before the ALJ will not program beneficiaries at serious risk and waive the preliminary hearing. Under these circumstances, the exclusion will be stayed pending the decision of the ALJ after a full hearing. The hearing must be held, and a decision reached, within 6 months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) If the OIG decides to waive the preliminary hearing, the request for the preliminary hearing will be considered a request for a hearing before the ALJ in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Right to administrative review.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) A practitioner of other person dissatisfied with an OIG determination, or an exclusion that results from a determination not being made within 120 days, is entitled to appeal such sanction in accordance with part 1005 of this chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Due to the 120-day statutory requirement specified in &sect;1004.100(e), the following limitations apply_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The period of time for submitting additional information will not be extended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Any material received by the HHS after the 30-day period allowed will not be considered by the ALJ or the DAB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The OIG's determination continues in effect unless reversed by a hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rights to judicial review.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any practitioner or other person dissatisfied with a final decision of the Secretary may file a civil action in accordance with the provisions of section 205(g) of the Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: October 18, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Bryan B.

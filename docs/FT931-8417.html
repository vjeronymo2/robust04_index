			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government wrestles with problem at 'top of agenda' / A look at how Conservatives view the issue UNEMPLOYMENT as an issue in the Conservative party is a pervasive force, long-standing and rarely forgotten - but frequently overshadowed as Westminster's goldfish-bowl mentality flips excitedly between one political furore and the next. Yesterday was an exception. The jobless figures were raised by all but one of the MPs called at a particularly fractious prime minister's questions. Others briefed themselves on the plethora of government schemes as they prepared to leave for the weekend. 'It is an issue which is of top concern for my constituents,' said Mr David Lidington, the new Conservative for generally prosperous Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, as he left the chamber. He had just asked Mr John Major to ensure British industry created jobs through greater competitiveness, not meddling bureaucracy. Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, spent much of yesterday in broadcast studios. She had rehearsed her lines, telling the BBC: 'Unemployment is right on the top of the political agenda.' More usually, unemployment rests lower in Conservative MPs conscience - beneath, say, Europe or the future of the coal industry as immediate concerns. The relentless rises make each month's figures unsurprising. 'Whats up? Apart from 3m unemployed, I mean,' said one, without thinking, as he stepped from his car at the Commons' entrance, only for a guilty expression to fall over his face. Unemployment does not feature heavily in mail bags. 'If the TV shows a tortured hedgehog I get 50 letters, they are pouring in on Sunday trading, but, curiously, I get very few on unemployment,' said one Tory from a south-east seat. Tory messages about government's impotence, drummed in by a decade of ministers since Mr Norman (now Lord) Tebbit, was employment secretary, have taken root. 'People have got a realistic view of how much the government can do in the short term - very little,' says Mr John Watts, Conservative chairman of the Commons' Treasury select committee. 'They have seen all the quick fixes under previous governments and they don't work.' Tories have won the last three general elections with high unemployment. Many Conservative MPs are confident that it will not be a huge electoral liability next time, so long as the trend by then is downwards. A Galbraith-like interpretation, based on the 'contented majority' in well-paid work who, if constantly wooed, can keep the Tories in power, would not be volunteered by many Tories. But, after winning last year against the odds, the Tory vote is seen as robust. 'People do worry about the unemployable sub-classes - but not enough to make them vote Labour,' said one senior Conservative. But the average Tory MP knows the debate is not that straight forward. In the minds of an increasing number of the party's MPs, fears about rising unemployment have become entangled with concern over escalating crime figures. Unemployment is also hitting harder than in the early 1980s in Conservative heartlands - and among white-collar, home-owning workers. Since the election, Mr John Major has put the importance of community and society back onto the Tory agenda, stressing the importance of training and creating opportunities for those entering the workforce. 'One-nation' Conservatism is back in fashion. Whereas Mrs Margaret (now Lady) Thatcher could blame past Labour governments, the benchmark by which the current prime minister will be judged against the criteria he himself has set. Much as the right-wing of the Tory party may try to dominate the agenda with ideas for privatisation and choice, Mr Major is also listening to ideas from the party's wetter wings. Mr Nigel Forman, the widely respected former education minister and MP for Carshalton and Wallington, wants changes to benefit eligibility for the unemployed who start education or training courses. The prime minister agrees. An announcement is expected near the time of the Budget. Only a brave Tory would be complacent. One political ally of the prime minister was gloomy yesterday afternoon after the shouting in the Commons chamber had abated: 'You can get get away with governing over high unemployment once or twice, but three times . . ?'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The honorable minister of foreign affairs, Mr.  Molapo Qhobela, gave a wide ranging review of Lesotho's foreign  policy when he introduced [as heard] his vote to the Committee  of Supply in the National Assembly this afternoon. The minister  announced the closure of the embassy in Maputo and the opening  of a new mission in Cairo, and the closure of the High  Commission in Nairobi, and the opening of a new one in Addis  Ababa, Ethiopia.    The Mozambican mission was opened at the time when Lesotho  needed a sea outlet, when relations between Lesotho and South  Africa were unfavorable. It had now served its purpose.    Mr. Qhobela said the High Commission in Kenya had been  established for political reasons and had also served its  purpose. This mission will be transferred to Addis Ababa, which  is the headquarters of the Organization of African Unity, and  several specialized agencies of the United Nations. The  relocation of the Nairobi mission will benefit Lesotho in many  ways because of the importance of Addis Ababa as a center of  African diplomacy and international relations through the United  Nations system.    On relations with Taiwan, the minister said the Government  of  Lesotho was compelled to sever relations with the country after  a visiting Taiwanese Government mission offered bribes to four  Lesotho cabinet ministers. The mission was also requested to  leave Lesotho.    Mr. Qhobela announced that Lesotho had established  diplomatic  ties with the People's Republic of China during his visit to  Beijing last month. Agreement was arranged between the  governments of Lesotho and China for financial and technical  assistance for Lesotho.    The minister also announced that major changes in the  diplomatic service will take place soon when officials of the  Lesotho missions abroad will be recalled at the end of their  service abroad. This was a routine exercise in the diplomatic  service. Mr. Qhobela said much money would be required to  effect the transfers of the diplomatic staff concerned.</p>

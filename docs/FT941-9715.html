			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Arts: Scots hung up over gallery A delphic statement by the trustees of the National Galleries of Scotland over its controversal plans to create a new gallery of Scottish art has received a wary response. There has been outcry in Edinburgh over plans to establish the new gallery in Glasgow, using pictures from two Edinburgh collections; the National Portrait Gallery, which would close, and the National Gallery. A recent House of Lords debate ended with a ministerial statement that the final decision was the government's. This week the trustees said they remained committed to the idea of the new gallery, but were 'conducting a further detailed appraisal to consider how, consistent with that objective,' the portrait gallery could remain in its present building. That could signal a reprieve for the portrait gallery. But since it's collection was supposed to have been the nucleus of the new gallery, sceptics ask if the trustees now intend taking more Scottish masterpieces from the National Gallery to bolster pictures currently in storage. Others think the whole project is a dead duck.</p>

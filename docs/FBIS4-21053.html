			<p>Maluf,   Others   <F P=102> PY0804015994 Rio de Janeiro Rede Globo Television in  Portuguese 2300 GMT 7 Apr 94 </F>  <F P=103> PY0804015994 </F> <F P=104>  Rio de Janeiro Rede Globo Television </F> <F P=105>  Portuguese </F> BFN     [Excerpts] Rio de Janeiro district attorney Antonio Carlos  Biscaia has released an official list of 150 people charged with  having received bribes from numbers game operators. Former  President Fernando Collor de Mello and Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo  Maluf are included on the list. [passage omitted]    In addition to Collor and Maluf, the list includes Rio de  Janeiro Governor Nilo Batista and Deputy Cleto Falcao. Written  next to the names of Collor and Maluf are entries indicating  that they received donations for their 1989 electoral campaign.  There are also documents indicating that donations were made  for a rally of then candidate Paulo Maluf in Rio de Janeiro.    Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf has denied the charge that the  numbers game operators made donations for his electoral  campaign. He vowed to press charges against Biscaia.    [Begin recording] This is an individual who is hysterically  trying to get into the limelight. He is just a hasty,  irresponsible rascal. His charge is a lie. I have never  received any help from anyone. I have put the case in the hands  of criminal lawyer Enio de Bastos Barros, who will bring this  irresponsible individual to court. [end recording]    In a statement, Collor also denied any donation to his  campaign by kingpins of the numbers game. The former president  contends that he fought the numbers game during his tenure as  governor of Alagoas State. He adds that he was already found  not guilty in the inquiries made of his accounts during the  impeachment process. He concludes by stating that his  executioners have already testified to the fact that he has  never received one single cent from the illegal game he  tenaciously fought as governor. [passage omitted]    Federal prosecutors who are participating in the Rio de  Janeiro district attorney's investigations are increasingly  convinced that the numbers game was nothing but a front for  other much more lucrative businesses, such as arms smuggling and  the international drug trade.    The prosecutors were quite impressed by the volume of  transactions maintained by numbers game operators with some  South American countries, such as the ties numbers game kingpin  Rodomiro Garcia maintained with one of the most notorious  Paraguayan smugglers: Carlos Barreto Sarubbi [governor of Alto  Parana Department].    Rodomiro Garcia and Barreto Sarubbi own a casino in Ciudad  del Este, Paraguay, across the border from Foz do Iguacu.  Garcia also owns a large estate in Paraguay, approximately 10  km from the Brazilian border. Barreto also owns an airstrip.  He has been charged by U.S. police with having used the  airstrip for many years for arms smuggling and drug trafficking  operations.</p>

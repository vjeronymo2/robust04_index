The judicial scandal provoked by this clever decision will  have continental repercussions, he added. The statements were  given within the context of a meeting among various parties to  consider the measures and actions that will be adopted when the  unfair and absurd ruling occurs; and it will undoubtedly  threaten the elections scheduled for 8 May.    Padilla Beliz has explained he attended most of the  sessions,  which were extended for two weeks, and no documents or any other  evidence were presented to prove Mayor Mayin Correa had  committed the electoral crimes with which she was charged. The  only thing done was to present depositions signed by her sworn  enemies, without any proof or evidence, and it was proved most  of them lied. This was personally admitted in public by  Magistrate Guillermo Marquez Amado (Pico), who was in charge of  the proceedings.    Padilla Beliz continued: "Despite all this, Magistrate  Marquez Amado insists on sentencing her, and he has prepared a  ruling of approximately 32 pages, sentencing and disqualifying  her for public posts for several years. He also suspended her  prison sentence, given the lack of a criminal record, as was  done in the case of former Attorney General Rogelio Cruz."    No decent person in the country will accept such a  monstrosity, Padilla Beliz has said. "This is a country where  lowly feelings and shameful cowardice abound. Politicians know  Mayin is right, and she is already the city's mayor-elect with  74 percent of the votes, according to the latest poll.  Nevertheless, they do not dare protest because they are afraid  of the Electoral Tribunal, and they state cunningly: "They are  the judges, and you cannot go against them."    They are also the ones who will tally the votes, and they  can  really screw us if we oppose them in Mayin's case." That is the  reasoning used by men who have no courage, honor, pride. I  would rather die defending the truth and reason then to  humiliate myself and kneel before the powerful."    It is known a magistrate had stated he will not sign the  document, because he attended the trial and no one proved Mayin  was guilty of anything."    Padilla Beliz asked: How, then, can Mayin be sentenced? It  was learned the president of the Republic has personally  threatened one of the magistrates, saying he will fire the  magistrate's wife from a position to which she was recently  appointed, if he rules in favor of Mayin. This happens because  a degenerate midget who was one of General Manuel Antonio  Noriega's intimate friends and who changed sides when he  realized the gringos would oust him has become director of First  Lady Ana Mae Diaz de Endara's campaign for mayor. He recently  fabricated a poll that shows the president's wife leads in the  polls.    Consequently, the president believes his wife will be mayor  of the capital if he eliminates Mayin.    Padilla Beliz concluded: "They are toying with the people's  patience, however, and anything -- for example, the Christian  Democratic magistrate's ruling -- could unleash violence and the  cancellation of the elections.    "I ask the Supreme Electoral Tribunal magistrates to  meditate  well what they can do. Set aside personal and partisan hate and  lead the country to honest and clean elections."</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service is still gathering and reviewing information on the life history needs of the Kootenai River population of the white sturgeon and the potential economic consequences of designating critical habitat. Additional biological information that may be useful in designating critical habitat for Kootenai River white sturgeon may include identification of specific river areas necessary for spawning, reproduction, and rearing of offspring; and water quantity, temperatures, and velocity in the Kootenai River required to meet some life history need (e.g., spawning and early rearing). Economic considerations in critical habitat designations are only the economic costs and benefits of additional requirements or management measures likely to result from the designation that are above the economic effects attributable to listing the population.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service concludes that the threats to the Kootenai River white sturgeon population and the benefits associated with listing justify taking action now, rather that waiting until a full analysis of critical habitat is completed. Protection of the sturgeon's habitat will be addressed through the recovery process and through section 7 consultations to determine whether Federal actions are likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Available Conservation Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities. Recognition through listing results in public awareness and conservation actions by Federal, State, and local agencies, private organizations, and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. Such actions may be initiated following listing. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against taking and harm are discussed, in part, below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(4) of the Act requires Federal agencies to confer with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed species or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. If a species is listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to insure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal actions that may be affected by this listing include the continued operation of Libby Dam and Kootenai River flow management by the Corps. The Corps would be required to consult with the Service on the previously mentioned Libby Dam operations. Bonneville Power Administration would be required to consult with the Service regarding the Kootenai River white sturgeon research program authorized by the Northwest Power Planning Council (1987) and funded by BPA. In addition, consultation by the Corps, BPA, and Reclamation may be necessary if the SOR process results in a change in the operation or reauthorization of the Joint Coordination Columbia River System.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangered wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to take (including harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, collect, or attempt any such conduct), import or export, transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listed species. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

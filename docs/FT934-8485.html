			<p>931115 FT  15 NOV 93 / Status quo for Puerto Rico PUERTO Rico's pro-statehood Governor Pedro Rossello last night conceded defeat in the island's plebiscite on whether to become the 51st US state, Reuter reports from San Juan. The concession came four hours after the polls closed and with about half the vote counted. In a high turnout of the 2.3m voters, about 46 per cent backed statehood while more than 48 per cent voted for the Caribbean island to remain a US commonwealth. About four per cent were in favour of becoming an independent country.</p>

			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> TEACHERS PRESS BID FOR BRITTON OUSTER  </P> <P> A petition drive aimed at getting Los Angeles Unified School District Supt.  Leonard Britton fired has prompted an "overwhelming response" from the  district's teachers, a spokesman for their union said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The United Teachers of Los Angeles, in bitter negotiations with the district  over a new contract and already authorized by its members to prepare for a  strike, accused Britton of having a "union-busting, anti-teacher record" and  published the "Taxpayers Petition to Terminate the Services of Superintendent  Britton" in the latest issue of the union newspaper.  </P> <P> Charging Britton with "a frightening insensitivity" to teachers and contending  that his presence "threatens the district," the petition asks the board of  education to fire him "effective immediately."  </P> <P> Diana Munatones, spokeswoman for the district, called the move a "campaign of  personal vilification" and called on UTLA President Wayne Johnson and the union  to help resolve the salary issue "rather than shooting the messenger."  </P> <P> It was the board, not Britton, she pointed out, that offered to raise salaries  at least 20% over three years. The offer was rejected by the teachers.  </P></p>

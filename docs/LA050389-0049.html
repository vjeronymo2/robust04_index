			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Ringo Starr will make his first U.S. concert tour this summer, with a Los  Angelesappearance likely in August, sources have confirmed. Exact dates and  sites are still being determined, but speculation is centering on the Universal  Amphitheatre, the Greek Theatre, the Forum and the Sports Arena. The tour, for  which the former Beatles drummer will be backed by guitarist Peter Frampton and  former Cream bassist Jack Bruce, is reportedly being produced by David Fishof,  who put together the Monkees reunion tours, the "Dirty Dancing" concert tour  and several other oldies package shows. Fishof was unavailable for comment.  Fellow ex-Beatle Paul McCartney, whose "Flowers in the Dirt" album is scheduled  for June 6 release, is also considering a U.S. tour in the summer.

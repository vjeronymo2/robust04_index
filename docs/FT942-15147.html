			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Howard moves to protect confidential information Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, is to introduce legislation that will crack down on industrial espionage and private surveillance by making it an offence to gain information by deception. The legislation, which could be introduced in the next session of parliament, seeks to tighten the law covering the release of confidential information, such as bank account, credit card and salary details, to members of the public. The new law would try to end a spate of recent events in which newspapers and some private investigators have tried to embarrass public figures by obtaining confidential details about them. In most cases, the information is revealed because the investigator pretends to be someone else when approaching banks or organisations. A Home Office official said last night that Mr Howard was not planning to insert the legislation in the Criminal Justice Bill that is going through parliament, but would raise it later this year. 'The aim is to make it clear that if you gain access to private information by deceiving someone, then you are guilty of an offence,' the official said. Under current law, it is an offence to offer someone money in return for confidential information on a third party. However, officials felt more action was needed, bearing in mind how easy it can be to obtain personal financial details of a third party. Details of a bank statement, for example, can often be obtained over the telephone simply by citing the address of the account holder. Home Office officials said Mr Howard had recently been concerned by the activities of an investigations agency that tried to investigate Lord Ferrers, the Home Office minister. The agency was asked to conduct its inquiries by a Sunday newspaper. Earlier this year, Baroness Nicoll, a Labour peer, raised concerns that several members of the House of Lords had received an offer to supply an agency with 'details of personal telephone calls, of mortgage repayments, of bank balances and of arrears on electricity and other bills'. Last year, the Sun newspaper managed to obtain details of the credit card account of Mr Norman Lamont, the then chancellor of the exchequer. However, the way details were leaked has never been made clear.</p>

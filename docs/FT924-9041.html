			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets: Emerging markets face up to new challenges - Investment media are evolving after five years of sometimes spectacular growth For the last several years, emerging markets as a group have outperformed the developed markets of the OECD, often by spectacular margins. Over the past five years, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) emerging market indices show that returns of markets in Latin America and Asia, measured in US dollars, have risen by 245 per cent and 41 per cent respectively, compared with 34 per cent in the United States and minus 20 per cent in Japan. The value traded on these developing exchanges in 1991 was nearly 39 times the level of 1980. The total capitalisation of the 20 largest emerging markets increased sevenfold and the number of listed companies doubled. Capitalisation of these markets has risen from 6 per cent of their GDP in 1980 to over 25 per cent of their GDP at the end of the decade. This growth can be traced to several inter-related factors. The macroeconomic environment in many developing countries has improved dramatically as governments have turned towards market-oriented policies, often prompting increased foreign investment and repatriation of flight capital. Furthermore, as corporate performance improved, both local and foreign investors recognised that stock prices were undervalued on an international basis. Institutional investors and portfolio managers have begun considering emerging markets as an entirely new asset category. They have channelled more than Dollars 50bn of portfolio investment into these markets in the past four years. It is now considered prudent to include them in global investment allocation strategies - a truly significant financial development. Their performance in the past 10 years should be seen in the context of a global trend - away from government control of economies and toward market-oriented policies which encourage the private sector as the driving force of economic growth. Last year alone, more than 450 companies in these markets raised more than Dollars 28bn from share offerings. The IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, has been working to develop these markets since 1971. IFC's mandate is to promote economic growth in its developing member countries. Unlike the World Bank, IFC focuses exclusively on the private sector in these countries; it does not accept government guarantees to protect its investments, and its financing is offered at market rates. In the capital markets arena, IFC's objectives include the enhancement of financial institutions in developing countries, to give domestic savings more mobility and to allocate them efficiently to productive investments. IFC has invested in a wide range of companies, including commercial banks, housing banks, leasing, factoring and brokerage companies, as well as 'contractual savings institutions' such as pension funds and insurance companies. Often, the financial institutions financed by IFC are the first of their kind in the host country. After recent sweeping political and economic changes, the emerging markets face new different challenges. Exchanges and their regulators are rapidly gaining in sophistication. From Mexico to India to Egypt, markets are implementing more effective regulatory environments, better accounting and disclosure systems, advanced trading operations, and streamlined central clearing and settlement procedures. Emerging markets will still have crashes and scandals from time to time  - as do their counterparts in developed countries. The key for developing countries is to learn from mistakes and to continually make improvements in trading and regulatory systems. In the 1980s, collective investment vehicles such as country funds served as a major private source of external finance, and IFC promoted more than two dozen such funds. In contrast, the 1990s will see increasing numbers of individual emerging market companies directly tapping the international markets for capital, issuing both debt and equity to foreign investors. Privatisation programmes are being adopted by many countries and are at different stages of implementation. Once under way, they usually add quickly to the size and liquidity of local markets. This could prove especially important in Eastern and Central Europe, where the newly-privatised companies are expected to become the core listings of emerging stock markets. What investors look for in emerging market companies is no secret; the same rules apply in all stock markets. Among the most important criteria for company selection are strong, competent and professional management; a history of earnings growth or the clear potential for it; well defined strategic and investment plans; liquidity in the stock market; and transparent financial disclosure on a timely basis.

			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Britannia mortgage offer - At a Glance Britannia is offering first-time buyers an eye-catching 3.99 per cent mortgage (8.1 APR). However the new rate, available from Monday, is fixed for only six months before reverting to the standard variable rate, currently 7.99 per cent. Alternatively, potential buyers can opt for 5.99 per cent (8.3 APR) fixed for the first year. To qualify for these rates potential buyers have to put down a 10 per cent deposit. Higher rates are available for those who can only put down 5 per cent. The rates apply to all types of mortgage but two insurance related products must be taken out from the society.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by station commentator Yun Pyong-son: </F> "Deliberate Maneuvers To Aggravate Tension"]    [Text] The South Korean puppets continue, in the new year,  to conduct daily war exercises with the U.S. imperialists  against the North, thus straining the situation on the Korean  peninsula.    As was reported, on 9 January, the U.S. imperialists  conducted electronic jamming by flying electronic intercept  planes in the skies above Suwon, Hoengsong, Chunchon, Paju, and  Pochon and conducted an aerial electronic war exercise against  the North with a huge number of combat planes mobilized from  overseas bases and air corps belonging to the U.S. occupation  Air Force based in South Korea.    Since the beginning of the new year, South Korean puppets  have conducted joint aerial war exercises against the North with  the U.S. imperialists, and on ground, have conducted night  attack operation exercises aimed at breaking through the  Military Demarcation Line [MDL]. On 6 and 7 January, they drew  hundreds of armed rascals in an area near the MDL and the DMZ  and fired hundreds of shots from large-caliber machine guns and  automatic rifles, thus agitating us extremely.    They then mobilized squadrons of the puppet army's combat  planes to support ground-attack units and squadrons of armed  helicopters flying at very low altitudes to conduct  missile-firing convergence exercises aimed at striking targets  in the area along the coast of the northern half of the Republic  and frantically engaged in war exercises. All this is a  deliberate and planned game of playing with fire [puljangnan]  aimed at driving the situation to the brink of war by  aggravating tensions on the Korean peninsula. It is a very  alarming move.    As has already been reported, the puppet defense minister  said on 3 January that the Army, Navy, and Air Force should  maintain a strong combat posture this year, too. The chairman  of the Joint Chiefs of Staff also made bellicose remarks that  the military should adopt a posture ready to cope with someone's  war threat, to assume prompt counteraction, and the like.  Meanwhile, in a so-called New Year's press conference, traitor  Kim Yong-sam noisily talked about modernization of the puppet  army and establishment of a security posture. Judging from the  recent series of warmongers' bellicose outbursts and war  exercises from South Korea, we can clearly predict that the  puppet Kim Yong-sam clique will dash even harder this year, into  a war provocation against the North.    A year remains before our people face the 50th anniversary  of  national division by outside forces. This sorrowful reality  urgently demands that our people unite firmly as one by  overcoming differences of ideology and systems to launch  ourselves onto the road of reunification and patriotism. In  response to this urgent demand of the times and the national  aspiration, all fellow countrymen in the North, the South, and  overseas are vigorously advancing toward unity and  reunification, not confrontation and division.    The situation around us is also developing in a favorable  way  for fatherland reunification as a breakthrough for resolving the  nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula has been found through  DPRK-U.S. contacts.    At this time, the South Korean puppets are aggravating  tensions by conducting war exercises against the North in an  obsolete way. Again this clearly shows that they pursue  South-North confrontation without any interest in peace or  reunification. This also intolerably challenges the national  aspiration for peace and reunification. The South Korean  puppets conduct war exercises against the North like fools  rushing in where angels fear to tread. Their maneuvers are  nothing more than thoughtless and foolish acts. If they dare to  provoke us, we will sternly punish the provokers.    The puppet Kim Yong-sam clique will gain nothing by driving  the tensions on the Korean peninsula into a state of acute  confrontation. The only thing it can gain is its ruin. The  South Korean puppets should look straight at the situation and  had better not run wild recklessly.</p>

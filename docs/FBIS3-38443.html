			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed ni: "Yasir 'Arafat: First Time in Bern -- </F> PLO Leader Counting on Swiss Aid"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA  database]    [Text] Bern, 31 January (ATS) -- Yasir 'Arafat is counting  on Switzerland to help rebuild infrastructures in the occupied  territories "destroyed by the occupation." In Bern on Monday  [31 January], the PLO leader thanked Confederation President  Otto Stich and Federal Council Member Flavio Cotti for their  hospitality and for the support Switzerland has already given in  the peace process. He said during a news conference that a  lasting peace in the Near East was a necessity "for all."    This was the Palestinian leader's first official meeting  with  members of the Swiss Government. Yasir 'Arafat arrived in Bern  by helicopter from Davos around 1230 on Monday. The PLO leader  had just ended a series of meetings with Israeli Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres on the sidelines of the Davos Forum.  Despite a final meeting at night, the two men did not reach  agreement on the implementation of Palestinian autonomy, for  which the PLO-Israeli agreement signed in Washington last  September makes provision.  <H5>  "Very Close" to an Agreement </H5>   At the end of his talks with Mr. Stich and Mr. Cotti, a  smiling Palestinian leader appeared before the press at the  Bellevue Hotel, dressed in his khaki uniform and wearing his  usual keffiyah. Speaking in halting English, Yasir 'Arafat said  he had come "very close" to an agreement with Shim'on Peres in  Davos. According to him, the Palestinian side was ready, but  the Israelis asked for a few more days to consider it. "And, it  takes two to tango."    "I am a pragmatist, but I have strong hopes that this  agreement will be signed in Cairo in a few days. If that is the  case, it will still be called the `Davos agreement.'" Yasir  'Arafat and Shim'on Peres will meet again in Cairo on Sunday to  try to finalize this agreement, which is encountering problems  on three main points: the area of Jericho, the control of border  crossing points, and the security of Israeli settlers. Israeli  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, who is rather optimistic, said on  Monday that the draft agreement drawn up in Davos was  "positive." When signed, it would make possible the gradual  withdrawal of the Israeli army from those areas.  <H5>  PLO Office in Bern: Status Not Clear </H5>   Yasir 'Arafat also asked Switzerland to play an active part  in the rebuilding of the infrastructure "destroyed by the  occupation" in the territories. "We need your support and your  experts," he said. According to Mr. Stich, in addition to the  financial aid (60 million francs) planned by Switzerland,  discussions related in particular to technological cooperation  and cooperation in the field of tourism.    Referring to the forthcoming opening of a PLO office in  Bern,  Yasir 'Arafat explained in French that it would be the "General  Delegation of Palestine." This title seems to contradict the  status Bern intends to give that office, which, in its view,  cannot represent the "Palestinian state" self-proclaimed in  1988. In accordance with international law, Bern only  recognizes states defined by the three criteria of international  law. These criteria, which must be recognized by the  international community, include the notions of people,  territory, and government.  <H5>  "An Open Man" </H5>   "I have had a meeting with an open man, and it was a warm  encounter," Otto Stich said in an initial news conference with  Flavio Cotti. According to him, Mr. 'Arafat thanked Switzerland  for having recognized "very early" that Israel's right to  existence and to security within internationally recognized  borders was inseparable from the Palestinian people's right to  self-determination.    Mr. Stich congratulated the Palestinian leader for his  "courage" in daring to take a step toward peace and for sitting  down at the same table as his former enemies. According to  Flavio Cotti, talks with Yasir 'Arafat have made it possible to  verify that preliminary bilateral talks (Israel-PLO,  Israel-Jordan, Israel-Syria, and so forth) were a "more  realistic" approach than multilateral negotiations.</p>

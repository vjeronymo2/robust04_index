			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: RETAILING  </P> <P> With American Stores Co.'s purchase of Lucky Stores still entangled in a legal  mire, a retail specialist's report this week cautions that its stock offers  little potential to appreciate in price.  </P> <P> The analyst, Edward F. Comeau of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York, cites  American's stalled purchase of Lucky as one reason why the supermarket and drug  company's earnings are likely to lag.  </P> <P> American, which is moving its headquarters from Irvine to Salt Lake City,  agreed to pay $2.5 billion last year to acquire Lucky. The plan was to combine  Lucky and American's Alpha Beta chain under the Lucky banner. That move has  been held up since September, when a federal court blocked the combination of  the two chains -- a temporary ruling that is on appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit  Court of Appeals.  </P> <P> Until the merger problem is resolved, Comeau writes, American "will lose $60  million to $70 million in synergistic benefits." If the merger takes place,  Comeau says, "the synergistic benefits initially would be offset by the  lowering of Alpha Beta's gross margin to conform with Lucky's 'Everyday Low  Price' program."  </P> <P> Therefore, he predicts, "a meaningful contribution to earnings would not be  likely until 1990 at the earliest. Our 1990 earnings estimate of $5.50-$6 per  share . . . is based on somewhat optimistic assumptions."  </P> <P> Despite American's high leverage and spotty earnings over the past several  years, however, Comeau noted that the stock price is receiving some support  from the company's strong cash flow -- estimated at $16 per share in 1989 --  and high estimated private-market value of $80 to $110 per share.  </P> <P> American's shares, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, closed Wednesday at  $56.50 each.  </P> <P> "We believe the shares are more fairly valued in the $45-$50 range, given the  company's earnings outlook and associated risks," the analyst concludes.  </P></p>

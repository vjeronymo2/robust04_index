			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / US concern over Argentine missile links to Baghdad THE US is finding it difficult to obtain from Argentina key information about its Condor missile project, raising concern about the extent of transfers made to a sister-project in Baghdad that was part of Iraq's nuclear-capable missile development programme. In a widely-publicised move last month, the Argentine government handed over control of the project to the National Commission on Space Affairs, which reports directly to President Carlos Menem. At the same time, the Argentine Government made a public commitment that 'all projects with warlike purposes or goals to obtain armaments of mass destruction' had been 'totally abandoned'. While Argentina's commitment to non-proliferation does not appear now in doubt, Western observers believe that the more crucial issue of the Condor's wider use to Iraq remains unresolved. The US is understood to have been seeking detailed information about solid-fuel motors and guidance technology developed at the Condor's production plant in Falda del Carmen, near Cordoba, and which are thought to have been shipped to Iraq. The Falda del Carmen site included a parabolic antenna for the transmission of point-to-point microwave signals that the US believes carried data between Argentina and Iraqi procurement agents working in a network of front companies in Austria and Switzerland. Washington's request for details about Argentina's plans for the Condor project has been conveyed to Buenos Aires in a series of communications from officials in the State Department and from others in the Bush Administration. Officials in Washington say the Argentine air force has thus far provided only sketchy information about the project. The original plans for the project have mysteriously disappeared from Air Force archives over the past 18 months. In the words of one western observer: 'The Argentine civilian government doesn't have records of what went out from the project'. A State Department official said yesterday that the US had 'an ongoing dialogue with Buenos Aires' about the Condor missile project. But a US investigator tracking one portion of the Condor project disclosed yesterday that 'parts of the US Government have had very good information on the Agentine-Iraqi links because the US had a deep cover agent working in the Condor procurement network in Switzerland and Austria'. The Condor project is thought to have cost Iraq, Argentina and Egypt a total of Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.2bn)-Dollars 5bn between 1984 and 1991, with funding coming mainly from Baghdad, technology flows going through Egypt and Jordan, and Argentina being used as a site for the development of a prototype and testing. The Argentine side of the project, which cost an estimated Dollars 800m (Pounds 454.5m) between 1985 and 1989, officially ran out of steam two years ago because of lack of additional funds.</p>

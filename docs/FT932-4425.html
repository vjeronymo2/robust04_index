			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Carpetright to float with Pounds 113.6m value CARPETRIGHT, Sir Phil Harris's carpet retail chain, has set its flotation price at 148p, valuing the group at Pounds 113.6m. MFI Furniture Group, which has a 20 per cent stake, will sell all its shares in the float, raising Pounds 21.5m. The sale price was at the top end of expectations with the shares being sold on a pro forma historic p/e of 21.8, a premium to the retail sector which itself is rated above the market average. The yield is 3.37 per cent, on an indicated dividend of 3.89p covered 1.75 times by the pro forma earnings per share for the year to May 1 of 6.8p. The float involves a placing of 39.16m shares with institutions and a public offer of 13.7m shares. Of the shares being sold, 32.4m come from existing shareholders. As well as MFI, directors and connected parties are selling 4.7m shares and venture capital backers are also selling. The company is issuing 6.76m new shares, raising Pounds 8.9m which will repay its preference shares. Mr John Randall, MFI finance director, said it was not considered appropriate for MFI to hold shares in another public company. He said the cash would be used to cut debt of Pounds 75m on which MFI was paying interest at about 7.5 per cent. However, it had treated Carpetright as an associate, and the share sale would be dilutive until the money was reinvested. The public offer closes on June 16 and first dealings start on June 23. COMMENT Although the price looks high, Carpetright's fast growth rate will bring the p/e down, and the flotation should go well. Analysts are looking for about Pounds 10.5m pre-tax in the current year, up from Pounds 7.8m, cutting the p/e to 16. But there are doubts, not least the high level of selling by existing holders. Carpetright is essentially a clean, debt free, one-product business - all points in its favour. But growth in the UK runs out in three years. It must then find a new avenue for expansion or become an income stock. Then Sir Phil's determination to resist the temptations that led him astray last time will be tested.</p>

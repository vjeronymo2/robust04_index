			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / The Group of Seven Summit: Pressure stepped up over Bosnia The foreign ministers of Britain and France will head to former Yugoslavia tomorrow with a mission to put 'massive pressure' on the warring parties in Bosnia to accept the current peace proposals or face dire consequences. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, and his French counterpart, Mr Alain Juppe, will be carrying a message from the Naples summit that the warring sides must accept the peace plan by the deadline of July 19. 'If the opportunity is not seized, there is a grave risk of a renewal of war on a larger scale,' Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister and summit host, said yesterday on behalf of the eight world leaders who gathered in Naples. Mr John Major, UK prime minister, warned: 'The consequences of not reaching a settlement will be very serious.' There was general agreement at the summit that particularly strong pressure must be put on the Bosnian Serbs, who have kept an open position on the peace proposals while their adversaries in the Moslem-Croat coalition have sent more positive signals. Western diplomats said the need to put pressure on the Serbs was implicitly acknowledged by President Boris Yeltsin despite Russia's traditional sympathy with the Serbs. Under the peace initiative in Geneva last week, the warring parties can expect intensification of international sanctions if they fail to comply with the plan, and generous economic aid if they fall into line. As Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl said yesterday: 'There will be no help for anybody who resists.' British officials said there was a danger that the Serbs would formally agree to the plan while failing to comply in practice. They would be told that only full compliance would earn them relief from economic sanctions. Mr Hurd and Mr Juppe, travelling with the blessing of the leaders who met in Naples but not as their formal emissaries, will have a blunt message for the Serbs. They will say that if the Serbs fail to adhere to the plan there will be no chance of stopping the US and perhaps others from ending the arms embargo against the Bosnian government. In the mayhem that could ensue, the UN peacekeeping force, in which Britain and France play a leading role, would have to be withdrawn. 'Things are not too bad now, but the present situation is unstable and it will start to slide back downhill quite fast if the plan fails,' a British official said.</p>

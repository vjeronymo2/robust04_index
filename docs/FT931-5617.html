			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Doubts over dividing Argentina's oil giant: A privatisation controversy JUST as the dust began settling in Argentina after last year's battle over the privatisation of YPF, the national oil company, some Argentines are having second thoughts about its sale. Except for a fringe of left-wing and ultra-nationalist extremists, nobody is opposing the principle of privatising YPF, the oldest state oil company in the world. The debate is whether it is right to sell as a single unit Argentina's largest company, which has an estimated value of Dollars 8bn and controls half the oil industry. The government is trying to avoid a reopened debate. It has already given up privatising all of YPF, Congress having made it keep 20 per cent of the shares. Officials do not want the privatisation, due to begin this year, disrupted further. But critics say selling YPF as a single company could allow buyers to build an oligopoly. YPF still controls over half Argentina's oil production, refinery and retail sectors, despite a radical scaling down over the past two years which has reduced its workforce to about 10,000 from a peak of 52,000 in August 1990. Mr Daniel Montamat, a former president of YPF under the previous Radical government and now an energy consultant, says: 'You need (to create) competition and establish the new role of YPF before it is privatised.' YPF's president, Mr Jose Estenssoro - who refused to be interviewed for this article - would retort that the government completely deregulated the market in January 1991. Concern about market concentration is not just an opposition bugbear. Mr Agustn Castano, principal at US management consultants Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton's office in Buenos Aires, warns: 'It could be very difficult to support a competitive environment by privatising YPF as a single, integrated company with a very large share of the market. It is not impossible, but it is difficult.' Furthermore, Argentina has a history of strong cartels, inoperative anti-trust policies and a weak judiciary that does not enforce existing competition laws. The government plans to float 70 per cent of YPF gradually on local and international equity markets, spreading share ownership broadly, in imitation of international corporations. But last year's mixed reception of privatisation stocks could mean that future issues will meet insufficient retail demand, leading to YPF's transfer to one of Argentina's big family-owned conglomerates, not renowned for fiercely efficient management. These groups have grown even stronger during Argentina's privatisation process, buying up significant assets that were previously state-owned, and could win control of YPF. Effective control could be bought for about Dollars 2.5bn-Dollars 4bn (Pounds 1.8bn-Pounds 2.8bn). Many of these groups, such as Compana Naviera Perez Companc, a holding company heavily involved in the energy business, have already bought up YPF assets. Buying into YPF itself would fit neatly with their new operations. Alternatively, ownership could become so diffuse that YPF's management would become a law unto itself. Argentina has little experience of accountability or shareholder rights. Moreover, with 20 per cent of equity held by the government and 10 per cent by the unions, YPF could remain under effective public sector control. This might make it less efficient, more vulnerable to political interference and thus less attractive to investors. However, the government has yet to announce YPF's flotation mechanism, which could include safeguards against these problems. One possible solution would be to split YPF. Mr Montamat says two or three integrated oil companies could be carved out of YPF. However, Mr Matas Bourdieu, of the government's privatisation team, says: 'Operationally, it is not possible to divide YPF. The scheme we used was to spin off surplus areas and reorganise YPF, (making it) very efficient. This is (feasible) only under one company. YPF cannot be divided into different units.' The government is now re-examining its plans: one official said yesterday that Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, might revise some aspects of the privatisation in coming weeks. The official did not expect the revisions to be extensive, but Mr Cavallo was reviewing 'the composition of assets that make up YPF' with a view to further reducing its size. The amount and timing of the initial offering - until now 20 per cent of the company's equity was to have been offered in the third quarter of this year on local and international markets - may also be revised. A larger offering was a possibility, the official said. The strategy up to date is regarded as successful. With US consultants McKinsey &amp; Co, YPF identified superfluous activities such as its tanker fleet, drilling crews and pipelines and began selling them off. This process financed its restructuring - designed by consultants Arthur D Little - and increased profitability by focusing on production, refining and retailing, thereby raising the value of the company. Since 1990, YPF has raised about Dollars 2bn from asset sales and has turned the losses made through much of the 1980s into profits: profit after tax in 1991 was Dollars 245m on sales of Dollars 4.03bn, compared with profits of just Dollars 41m in 1990. Still, there are some who advocate simply selling YPF's assets and winding up the company. This would eliminate the threat to competition, and might even raise more money for the government. However, if there is little chance of YPF being broken up, there is practically no chance of closing it down: winning public opinion and the politicians over to YPF's privatisation in the first place was difficult enough.</p>

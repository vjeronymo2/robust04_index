			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Jacques Bihozagara, member of the </F> Rwandan Patriotic Front Political Bureau, by Dominique de  Courcelles on 23 May, place not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] Fierce exchanges of fire broke out early this  morning in certain districts of Kigali, the capital of Rwanda,  according to a Reuter report we have just received. [passage  omitted] In theory, a cease-fire -- or rather a truce -- should  have started in Kigali half an hour ago, at 0800 local time, at  the initiative of the United Nations. [passage omitted] Here is  one of the main officials of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, whom  Dominique de Courcelles has just contacted in Geneva. He is  Jacques Bihozagara, member of the political bureau of the  organization:    [Bihozagara] I think we have to make a distinction between a  truce and a cease-fire. We have never refused a truce for a  specific action, for example consultations between the United  Nations and the forces on the ground.    As for a cease-fire, we are saying that first you have to  get  a cease-fire between those who are butchering the people and the  people themselves, but there is no question of speaking of a  cease- fire between the fighters of the Patriotic Front and this  routed army.    [De Courcelles] So after the truce we should expect the  fighting to begin again?    [Bihozagara] Of course.    [De Courcelles] So this truce is to get an explanation of  the  UN mandate, because a priori you rather tend to be against a  reinforcement of the UN troops?    [Bihozagara] You know, we are not formally against it, but  we  weren't there when the UN Security Council resolution was  adopted in New York, so we are expecting further clarifications  from the United Nations about its make-up, its deployment, and  its numbers.

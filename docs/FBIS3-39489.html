Japanese and Dutch sources in Belgrade also said Wednesday  that the two countries were considering evacuations.    The move follows similar steps already taken by the British,  U.S. and Dutch embassies there ahead of the Sunday midnight GMT  deadline for possible air strikes against Bosnian Serbs  surrounding Sarajevo.    In Paris, foreign ministry spokeswoman Catherine Colonna  said: "The decision was taken to evacuate families of state  employees in Belgrade.... The French embassy in Belgrade has  also urged the whole French community in the city to take care  in current circumstances."    Officials here said the evacuation is to take place over the  next two or three days, and will affect about 40 people of the  107-strong French contingent of diplomats, embassy staff and  families.    Meanwhile Western diplomats in Belgrade said Brussels had  "strongly recommended" that families of diplomats and staff  leave before Friday -- two days ahead of the NATO deadline.    "We are not particularly worried, but the Belgian government  is of the view that our security in Belgrade cannot be  guaranteed in the coming days," said a Belgian diplomat, asking  not to be named.    A Japanese embassy spokesman, who also requested anonymity,  said: "We are examining a number of solutions concerning the  families, although evacuating diplomats at the moment is out of  the question."    He gave no figure for the number of people who could be  involved, or a date. "Perhaps even next week, after the  ultimatum expires if there have been NATO strikes in Bosnia," he  added.    So far a total of 40 family members have been evacuated from  the other three diplomatic missions -- U.S., Dutch and British  -- already sending their families out of the country.    Other Western diplomats here are still playing down the  consequences of air strikes on the lives of expatriates. "There  is no reason to leave at the moment," one senior Western  diplomat told AFP.    "Evacuating now would seem more like putting psychological  pressure on the Serbs than taking security measures," he said.</p>

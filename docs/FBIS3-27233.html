It is no easy job, however,  to truly put an end to this tendency. In these years -- though  the central authorities have made repeated injunctions demanding  cadres at all levels be practical and realistic and have  vigorously encouraged a realistic style -- boastfulness and  exaggeration have remained, despite prohibitions over a long  period of time, and have shown themselves to be quite serious in  some places.    Some people are suspicious of the economic figures submitted  to higher authorities by certain localities. This suspicion is  not unfounded, nor is this because the figures are too high. If  high figures have substance and show good cost-effectiveness,  they are acceptable. The problem, however, lies in the source  of the figures and how they are computed. I was told by private  sources that the statistics in some localities are obtained by  way of top-down breakdown, which means some very high economic  targets are set at the beginning of a year and are broken down  and assigned to subordinate units or areas, which, at the end of  the year, are to submit to the higher authorities figures that  are somewhat higher than the targets. If the targets are too  high and beyond reach, and really are impossible to achieve with  available resources, they will puff themselves up and make sure  that the figures submitted are always higher than the targets.  And this is not the worst. What is more outrageous is that  some authorities bide their time and watch their neighbors  toward the end of a year. When others have submitted their  figures, they hold a meeting to set a figure that is higher than  others'. If this figure is unrealistic, it will be broken down  and assigned to subordinate units until the desired amount is  made up.    Naturally, this phenomenon is not the mainstream. Since the  reform and opening up began, seeking truth from facts has  prevailed in all respects of our life. Nevertheless, we have to  pay serious attention to nonprevailing problems; not only can  such bogus figures seriously undermine the normal operation of  our economy, they also can make it difficult for us to correctly  assess and grasp our economic development. Furthermore, once it  develops into a common practice, it will poison society  tremendously. The lessons of history should remain fresh in our  memories.    Spiraling emulation is one of the direct causes of the  propensity to boast and exaggerate. If your "achievements" are  great, mine are greater; no matter how much your figures have  grown, mine have to exceed yours. We do encourage ambition and  the spirit of not acknowledging defeat, but we should compare  only genuine figures, not false ones. Some comrades ignore the  subjective and objective conditions of their localities and try  to compare with others by way of making up figures. They may  receive "honor" and even a promotion as a result, but the masses  definitely will suffer and the cause will be undermined.    Leaders must take the lead in eliminating boastfulness and  exaggeration. It is of vital importance how the criteria for  appraising cadres are set. A jingle circulating among the  masses in some places says that those who seek truth from facts  are criticized, while those who make false statistical reports  get generous awards and promotions. What those above are fond  of, those below will be addicted to. Therefore, cadres at all  levels must set an example.</p>

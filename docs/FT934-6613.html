			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Levitt trial ends with guilty plea The trial of Mr Roger Levitt and three other former directors of the Levitt Group, the collapsed financial services company, ended yesterday after a second defendant changed his plea and admitted he was guilty of fraud. Mr Mark Reed, the former managing director of the company, joined Mr Levitt in changing his plea and admitting to the single charge of fraudulent trading. Mr Levitt changed his plea from innocent to guilty on Monday. Both men will be sentenced on Friday and were released on bail until then. The charge of fraudulent trading, an offence under the Companies Act 1985, carries a maximum sentence of seven years' imprisonment. A similar charge against a third defendant, Mr Robert Price, the former finance director of the Levitt Group, was dismissed and he was formally acquitted. The fourth defendant, Mr Alan McNamara, the company's former commercial director, is still charged with one count of fraudulent trading and will face a fresh trial in front of a new jury. Mr Levitt and Mr Reed pleaded guilty to fraudulently misleading Fimbra, the regulator for independent financial advisers, by presenting false and misleading documents. These documents purported to show that fees of almost Pounds 21m had been received by the company as a result of personal advisory work performed by Mr Levitt. The two men had also been variously charged with a total of 21 other offences, including false accounting, forgery, obtaining property and services by deception, making misleading statements to induce investors and falsifying company documents. These charges, which had been scheduled to form the basis of a second trial, will lie on the file and not be acted upon further. The prosecution originally alleged that Mr Levitt and Mr Reed were the main protagonists in a fraud which was wider than that they eventually admitted to. Mr David Cocks QC, for the Serious Fraud Office, alleged that they had illegally injected the Pounds 21m into the company to save it from collapse and produced false accounts to overstate its profits as well as deceived Fimbra. Mr Levitt had been the 'architect' of the fraud and Mr Reed his 'right-hand man'. The two men denied any wrongdoing beyond the deceit of Fimbra. Before his change of plea lawyers for Mr Reed had told the jury he was too incompetent at his job to be guilty of fraud. He was so inept he spent most of his time writing memos about sandwiches and other equally routine matters, the court was told. After the acquittal of Mr Price his solicitor said there had never been any evidence of any dishonesty on the part of the former finance director. The main activities the prosecution had complained about had taken place after Mr Price had resigned from the company in mid-1990, he said.</p>

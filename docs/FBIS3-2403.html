He said: The year 1994 is an extremely important one for  China to deepen reform. The number of destablizing factors will  continue to increase due to the readjustment of the relationship  of interests and due to various reasons existing at home and  abroad. We must truly carry out judicial, procuratorial, and  public security work under the new situation of our effort to  meet the needs of reform and opening up; we must spend time and  effort on implementation; we must persist in and carry forward  the fine tradition of integrating special organs with the mass  line; we must catch up with the pace of our times by reforming  ourselves.    Chairman Gyaincain Norbu of the Tibet Autonomous Regional  People's Government delivered a speech at the closing ceremony.  He called on those who are engaged in judicial, procuratorial,  and public security work to have a clear understanding of the  situation; to seek unity of thinking; to persist in the  principle of attaching equal importance to two types of work  [promote reform and opening up and, at the same time, crack down  on various criminal activities], and to persist in taking a  tough stand on both so as to provide a stable environment for  reform, opening up, and economic construction; to vigorously  wage struggle against splittism in a bid to ensure stability in  the whole region; to persist in the principle of dealing a harsh  blow to criminals and to step up the crackdown; to further  mobilize the forces from all walks of life to vigorously improve  comprehensive management of public security; to successfully  carry out self-construction by the contingents of personnel for  judicial, procuratorial, and public security work in a  down-to-earth manner; and to strengthen the party's leadership  over judicial, procuratorial, and public security work.</p>

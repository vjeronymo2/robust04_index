During the meeting many steps were  taken to ensure a return to peace.    [Begin Kanyenkiko recording] Following the meeting chaired  by  the minister of defense on 5 March and the meeting chaired by  the head of state on 6 March and 8 March, I chaired a meeting of  security officials from Bujumbura and from up-country to discuss  the ever-deteriorating security situation in Bujumbura and the  events that took place in Musenyi, Tangara Commune, and Ngozi  Province on 7 March. [passage omitted]    Before countrywide discussions on security and defense  policy  can lead to any concrete results, it is necessary to take the  following immediate measures:    1. Security forces should work in cooperation with  administration officials. They will operate from zone  headquarters and other areas agreed upon with administrative  authorities such as governors and communal heads.    2. If security agents need to rescue citizens in danger,  they must inform the administrative authorities as soon as  possible.    3. Security agents must rescue attacked citizens within the  rule of law. Whoever does not respect the rule of law will be  punished severely.    4. Wherever shots are heard, security personnel will have to  identify quickly the location so that those who used the arms  without permission can be arrested immediately so that people  can see justice in action.    5. Roadblocks will be set up at night to prevent the  movement of potential attackers.    6. The office of the state prosecutor has been called to  investigate the recent killings in Kamenge, Musenyi, and Tangara  as soon as possible so that the culprits can be identified and  punished.    7. Administrative authorities are called to set up as soon  possible security committees composed of men and women known for  their impartiality who will work with the security officials in  the suburbs and up-country areas.

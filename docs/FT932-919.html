			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Futures related buying helps Dow to advance Wall Street AFTER TWO days of losses, equities turned higher yesterday, helped by a round of futures-related programme buying, writes Karen Zagor in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 23.80 at 3,490.61. The Stan-dard &amp; Poor's 500 finished 3.43 ahead at 446.62, while the Nasdaq composite gained 3.93 at 688.72. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled 267.4m shares and rises outnumbered declines by 1,124 to 764. The stock market, which had been depressed by Wednesday's bearish economic data, shrugged off the morning's report that initial jobless claims for the week ended June 19 had risen 8,000. Most analysts had expected claims to fall by about 1,000. Shares in Goodyear Tire, the last of the big US-owned tyre companies, moved forward Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 40 3/4 in active trading on the back of encouraging second-quarter net earnings predictions of Dollars 130m to Dollars 140m, compared with Dollars 106.9m a year earlier. In the last year, the stock has traded in a range of Dollars 27 7/8 to Dollars 41 3/4 . A number of pharmaceutical issues were actively traded. Glaxo Holdings eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 16 1/2 , Johnson &amp; Johnson firmed Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 41 5/8 , Merck put on Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 36 3/8 and Schering-Plough rose Dollars 2 1/4 to a 52-week high of Dollars 70 1/2 . USX-US Steel Group tumbled Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 41 1/8 after the company filed for an offering of 9m common shares. Athletic shoe maker Nike eased Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 54 1/8 , a 52-week low. The stock took a battering earlier this week after the company issued a profits warning. Motorola gained Dollars 1 at Dollars 83 5/8 after the company's advertising supplement in the Wall Street Journal raised hopes that its new PowerPC chips would pose a threat to other semiconductor manufacturers. In the Nasdaq market, Digital Microwave plunged Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 8 1/2 on warnings of a possible first-quarter deficit. Merrill Lynch cut its investment rating on the stock to short-term neutral from above average. Sun Microsystems advanced Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 28 5/8 after the company said it plans to repurchase about 9.5 per cent of its common stock in a buy-back funded from available working capital. Shares in two semiconductor companies, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, lost ground after the stocks were downgraded by a PaineWebber analyst. Advanced Micro fell initially but recovered to finish unchanged at Dollars 21 1/8 , but Intel lost Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 53 3/4 . Canada TORONTO remained on its recent upward path in continued heavy trading, the TSE 300 index ending 27.9 stronger at a high for the year of 3,979.6. Advancing issues outpaced declines by 437 to 301 after a volume of 79.9m shares valued at CDollars 919m. Among the sub-groups, 11 of the 14 were higher. The gold shares index again recorded the day's biggest change, rising 2.53 per cent. The banking sector was up 1.22 per cent. Rampart Mercantile, which added 26 cents at CDollars 2.86, posted a six-month net profit from continuing operations against a year-ago loss.</p>

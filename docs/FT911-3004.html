			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (15): London's advance is part of a global re-rating of markets - Equities FOR THOSE investors who got it right, the first quarter of 1991 has joined the London stock market's roll of honour. Total returns on equities for the three months have been bettered on only four occasions in the past decade, according to Barclays de Zoete Wedd. A combination of lower UK interest rates, reduced pessimism over recessionary pressures and the swift ending of the Gulf war proved very favourable for investors. The FT Actuaries All-Share Index returned 16.9 per cent for the quarter, the FT-SE 100 Index 16 per cent. As the period drew to its close, the Footsie was reaching forward daily to new all-time peaks, and retail investment interest in UK equities was maintaining the welcome return to levels regarded as viable, if not necessarily hugely profitable, for the London securities industry. However, as the quarter ended, the FT-A All-Share index was still about two points below its peak and, in sterling terms, the UK underperformed the rest of the world by about 4.5 per cent. This focus on the broader-based market index, and on sterling values, has much to say about the performance of UK equities. The advance in London was part of a global re-rating of equity markets, reflecting a number of factors, including the speedy end to the fighting in the Gulf and the powerful rise in the dollar towards the end of the quarter. The shift in currency values was a double-handed boon to the UK stock market. The strength of the US currency boosted prospects for the big dollar-earners which provide about a quarter of the aggregate earnings of the Footsie list. At the same time, sterling's improvement within the ERM currency table enhanced the opportunities for cutting UK base rates. Base rates were cut three times during the quarter, to bring UK rates down to 12.5 per cent by the end of March, with the equity market clamouring for further cuts. The half-point cut in base rates just after Budget day overshadowed the Budget itself, which was seen as neutral for the stock market. All equity sectors achieved positive returns over the period. But lower base rates failed to inspire property shares, which underperformed the All-Share by 9.9 per cent. Weakest of all were oil shares, which underperformed the All-Share by 10.4 per cent - not, strangely, because of the Gulf conflict, but rather because of negative views on crude-oil prices. The successes ranged across the dollar-earning stocks, with Glaxo, Hanson, BAT Industries, RTZ and Reuters Holdings prominent, to sectors recovering from previous misfortune, such as engineering, textile and even contracting and construction stocks. As the market moved into the second quarter of 1991, some murmurs of uncertainty could be heard in the City of London. The outlook for the US dollar was less clear, and the Gulf war was now history. On the home front, another half-point cut in UK base rates was expected, but 'the next move down may be several months in coming,' commented the strategy team at BZW. And there was a question-mark over German interest rates. Institutions successful in equities in the first quarter may find other opportunities ahead. More rights issues are likely to follow the Pounds 2bn of the first three months, and the estimated Pounds 8bn public sector borrowing requirement implies significant gilt-edged funding. Mr Ian Harnett, at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, notes that if institutions now switch into cash, they will effectively secure the return on a FT-SE level of 2,650 for the year-end without needing to risk further investment in equities.</p>

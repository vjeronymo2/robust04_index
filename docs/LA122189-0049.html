			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Crandall Lobbies for Airline Deal: American Airlines Chairman Robert L.  Crandall said his deal to buy foreign routes and other assets of Eastern  Airlines should be approved by government regulators "in the national  interest." Failure to allow the deal would invite greater control of  international air travel by foreign carriers, Crandall said at a press  conference called to discuss details of the $471-million purchase. The complex  deal with Eastern's parent, Texas Air Corp., gives American control of  Eastern's prized Latin Anerican routes and would greatly enhance American's  presence in foreign markets. The purchase is subject to review by the Justice  and Transportation departments and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court overseeing  Eastern's Chapter 11 reorganization.  </P></p>

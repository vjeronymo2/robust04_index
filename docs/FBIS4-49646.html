			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Yeung] </F>   [Text] Lu Ping's official remarks that late premier Zhou  Enlai intervened to stop the Gang of Four sending troops to Hong  Kong in 1967 was received by veteran left-wingers with surprise.    "I've never heard that before," a senior mainland cadre  involved with Hong Kong affairs said.    Another left-winger who was involved in the 1967 riots said  he had been told "internally" that "we must stop the military  confrontation with the British colonial authorities".    "We understand that the order came from Chairman Mao Zedong  and premier Zhou Enlai at that time. But I don't think that has  been mentioned in official media," he recalled.    Mr. Lu said in his speech yesterday: "Back in 1967, it was  Premier Zhou Enlai who at the very last minute stopped the 'Gang  of Four' sending troops to Hong Kong."</p>

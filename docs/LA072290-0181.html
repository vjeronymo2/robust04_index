			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONDO VS. TOWNHOUSE  </P> <P> As an appraiser, I know I'm not the only one who finds some of Robert J. Bruss'  opinions annoying and somewhat self-serving. But, when he gave out  misinformation in the July 8 column item "Townhouse or Condo: Which Is Wiser  Buy?" I felt I should write to clear up a common misconception.  </P> <P> The difference between a condominium and a townhouse is that a condominium is a  type of ownership and a townhouse is a type of architectural style. A  condominium unit could be a variety of styles, including townhouses. A  townhouse can be either a condominium or a planned unit development, or PUD.  </P> <P> Condominium ownership is ownership of the airspace of the unit only, along with  an undivided interest in the land for the entire project, which includes any  common areas.  </P> <P> PUD ownership includes ownership of the unit, the lot it stands on, and an  undivided interest in the common area. Condos and PUDs can even be fully  detached units. In the case of a detached condo, the "unit" is the land around  and under the building. Since the ownership is of the airspace over this  particular parcel, the dwelling is included.  </P> <P> CAROL S. HOSKINS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

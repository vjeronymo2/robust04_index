			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (19): A help in reducing the risks - Quality Programmes The British Standards Institute (BSI) has a lot to answer for. When BS5750 was introduced as a national standard for quality management systems in 1979 it launched a whole raft of management trends, with associated jargon. Attaining BS5750 became a significant totem in the burgeoning religion of Total Quality Management (TQM). Quality itself is no bad thing but BS5750 certification appears to generate enthusiasm for the number as much as the ethos it represents. Mark Churchward is an Oxford-based independent technology consultant who greets the rise of the quality culture: 'I've been an evangelist for quality. BS5750 is a bit like a creed. When you say you're going to do things a certain way, you have to do it that way.' But he concedes that getting a quality stamp is no panacea - 'there isn't any inherent yardstick which ensures that staff work towards a better quality company.' In other words, without a tool to measure your quality process, the whole affair degenerates into yet another exercise in nebulous management jargon. A company applies for BSI accreditation. The BSI or an approved outside body works with the applicant to ensure that its quality principles are applied rigorously across the board. Registration, costing upwards of Pounds 990 (for the smallest firm) is then awarded, after which the company can expect at least two booked inspections a year from the BSI or the outside body. So measurement is an extremely practical step; it keeps the inspectors happy. Can software meet this need for measurement? Ajay Sood was advising on technology requirements at Peterhead Polytechnic when he realised 'that quality assessment management had problems.' Sood believed that BS5750 was 'becoming a paper exercise.' His answer was to defect from academe and enter the commercial fray with a Peterhead colleague. Their company, Orchid, is a small software house based in Newcastle-upon-Tyne dedicated to writing programs that put BS5750 into practice. Orchid was launched on the back of thorough research: 'We picked the top 200 companies in the north-east and booked an hour to talk with the quality managers.' Apparently these people feel themselves to be a neglected and misunderstood species and Sood's survey offered them some much appreciated therapy. It emerged that quality managers are finding the much-vaunted quality standard a bit of a bind. Over 84 per cent of the quality managers questioned described themselves as 'computer novices,' although the vast majority used some form of computer records. But the reports generated from quality management activity varied from site to site. Without a fixed format the national standard was being monitored in an imprecise way. 'The trouble with BS5750 is that it really is one big headache in terms of paper,' says Sood. Not that this deters the rush to quality certification - 'there are companies going for it for its own sake.' Orchid's balm for the hard-pressed and isolated quality manager is a progam called Computerised Quality Management (CQM). Written for the IBM-PC and costing between Pounds 750 and Pounds 7,000, CQM controls the documentation spawned by BS5750. CQM lists the staff responsible for quality assurance and assigns relevant documents to them. It sets up an internal audit trail that allows the quality manager to review procedures, note achievements and isolate failures of quality. Among practical benefits claimed by Orchid is a diary generated automatically by CQM to outline the quality manager's future activities in any given week. Dunlop Hydraulic Hose at Gateshead is a CQM site. Quality assurance manager Alan Donnelly points out that BS5750 amounts to a good operating procedure 'that you'd expect to find in any successful company.' But a dedicated quality program formalises his task. That in turn keeps BSI certification on board. CQM proves to the inspectors that the job is being done. Software development is a notoriously risky business. Projects fall hopelessly behind schedule and run over budget. Praxis is a Bath-based software house set up in 1983. Chairman Martyn Thomas has always felt that software could benefit from a strict regime of quality control. Praxis achieved BS5750 registration in 1986. According to Mr Thomas, this meant much more than another certificate to hang on the boardroom wall - 'we put in place a quality management system that has saved us a huge amount of money. We have standards for notation, how plans are signed off, who has final approval. The whole principle is that we think about how to assure quality to begin with.' Praxis feels confident bidding for fixed-price contracts - 'the running costs of quality assurance add no more than 1 per cent to the cost of a project. But it takes the risk out of the system. Our average variance from cost estimates is 10 per cent. Before we started to apply quality management it was 20 per cent.' For Praxis, quality means knowing a contract will bring home a profit.</p>

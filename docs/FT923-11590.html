			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Survey of Turkey's South East Anatolian Project (5): A home-grown achievement - The Ataturk Dam drew heavily on Ankara's financial resources WHEN Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani declined to pay his respects at the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, Turkey's secular founder, the Iranian leader was taken to the next best thing - the Ataturk Dam. Inaugurated in October 1981, this huge rock-filled structure is more than just a sight for visiting heads of state. The Ataturk Dam is the most important project in Turkey. It is also the most costly. Designed by Turks, the dam was constructed by Turkish contractors and financed with Turkish funds. Apart from the foreign suppliers' credits, the Turkish government budget bore the brunt of the Dollars 4bn investment. From an observation point high in the project's headquarters the main landmarks can be seen: the mammoth 169m high embankment; the eight penstocks which carry the water to the power turbines housed below the reservoir stretching into the distance. The statistics are impressive. The dam's 180m high clay core, with rock-filled wall, will impound a volume of 48.7bn cubic metres of water, making it the fifth largest dam in the world. The design is said to be able to withstand an earthquake measuring 8 on the Richter scale. 'It would take a nuclear bomb to dent it,' said Mr Ferruh Anik of DSI, the state hydraulics department, during the Gulf War when asked about his fears that Iraq might attack the site. When completed, the dam's total installed capacity from eight Swiss-built turbines will produce 2,400MW, with generating capacity of 9bn kilowatt hours - almost half Turkey's current hydro output. The reservoir will provide irrigation for about 730,000 hectares, with the first 40,000ha scheduled to come into operation next summer. The system comprises a twin bore 24.6km tunnel which will take water from the reservoir to irrigate the Harran and Mardin Ceylanpinar plains. This will make it the second largest single source irrigation scheme in the world, and it will increase Turkey's irrigated land by a third. The value of the food surpluses resulting from such large-scale irrigated farming is estimated at Dollars 5bn. Since 1983 the government has spent TL11,100bn (Dollars 1.6bn) constructing the dam, and a further TL5,600bn on electro-mechanical equipment. The completed cost is projected at almost half of what has so far been spent on the South East Anatolian Project as a whole. President Turgut Ozal once claimed that earnings from the electricity revenues from the Ataturk Dam would repay the cost of installing the irrigation network within four years. According to Mr Anik, it still requires two or three good years with heavy snows to fill the dam to the required maximum elevation of 542 metres. But at a height of 526m the twin Urfa tunnels come into play. Depending on the next year's snow-melt, this could be as early as next summer. Officials say there is even an option to raise the maximum water level further, although this would involve additional flooding, taking more land out of cultivation. It would also increase evaporation - involving, as it would, an increase in surface area. According to initial calculations, the current water level of the reservoir, at an elevation of 507m, should have been too low for power generation to begin. However, Mr Olcay Unver, head of the Gap authority, revealed there had been a few last-minute adjustments to allow Mr Suleyman Demirel, the prime minister, and his countless guests, to witness tomorrow the first two power units come into operation. 'There have been times when we have squeezed the government, and times when the government has squeezed us. But there were no serious delays. That's the real achievement,' says Mr Asaf Guven of Ata-Insaat, the main contractor for the dam. Ata-Insaat, a consortium of three Turkish contractors, was formed specially to bid for the dam construction work, winning the tender largely through a cunning financing package. 'The only demand we made was that a foreign exchange portion should be paid in advance to buy the machinery,' says Mr Guven. With the government in agreement Ata-Insaat used a Dollars 200m credit, including a US Eximbank loan of Dollars 110m, to import US Caterpillars to start the site clearance. From the start, many economists have contested the financial good sense of such a colossal undertaking. Gap, as a whole, is said by officials to consume Dollars 2m a day, with the Ataturk development taking the lion's share. Some economists estimate that these expenditures account for one third of Turkey's 70 per cent inflation rate. Mr Guven takes a different view. 'When the full electricity capacity is in operation, the government will earn between Dollars 800m and Dollars 900m every year, while still offering the consumer power at three cents per kilowatt hour. That's extremely cheap.' Asea Brown Boveri supplied the eight turbines - which each comprise 700 tonnes of generator rotor. For each turbine there are three transformers - supplied by Brown Boveri before the company joined the Swedish Asea. The dam is also a remarkable achievement for homegrown Turkish engineering. The design and civil works, done by Ata-Insaat, have given the company invaluable experience. Mr Anik, head of DSI, says the original plans made no provision for the difficult task of closing off the bottom outlet, to allow the water level to rise sufficiently to cover the turbines. If the job had not been handled correctly, it could have created what engineers call a vortex, putting the base of the dam under dangerous pressure. With its task all but complete, Ata-Insaat now has its sights on contracts further afield - particularly, it says, in the former Soviet states, where there is a growing demand for power plants.</p>

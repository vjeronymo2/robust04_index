			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Strike ends at Austrian Airlines PILOTS and cabin crews at Austrian Airlines yesterday voted overwhelmingly to end their strike, which had crippled the national carrier for five days, writes Patrick Blum from Vienna. The decision follows a compromise giving the unions a say in any future restructuring plans. The militant flight employees' union abandoned its initial demand for the resignation of the management board. The strike was called in protest at plans to cut the 4,500 workforce by 500 in an effort to trim expected loses of Sch830m (Pounds 49m) this year. Services are expected to return to normal today.</p>

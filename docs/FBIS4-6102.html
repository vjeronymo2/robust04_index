			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tomohiko Hayashi, SHUKAN ASAHI reporter: "SP: </F> Removal of Former Prime Ministers From List of Those Guarded Has  Begun; `VIP's Increase Because of Political Realignment, Finally  Kaifu, Too...."]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted]The realignment of the  political map is also making itself felt in unexpected places.  Information has come from a police-related source that because  of the increase in new parties, the shortage of SP (security  police) has been aggravated, and as result SP who had been  assigned to former prime ministers have been removed. One of  them is former prime minister Toshiki Kaifu. What is different  about him when there are persons who are assigned guards even  now?

Institute Director Noboru Suzuki of Nippon Secret Service, a  private-sector personal-security company, explains the  arrangement in that area:    A former member of the Metropolitan Police Department,  Suzuki  devoted himself to guarding for about 20 years, from the time  when SP were still called "bodyguards" and retired from  government service in 1986. At Nippon Secret Service, he is  called "the very spirit of guarding" and is the kind of person  who embodies the history of the security police, so to speak.    He says, "The National Police Agency in the guarding of  VIP's, and the Metropolitan Police Department in regard to  successive prime ministers, consider by their own judgment such  things as political influence, and assign security police to  those persons for whom they think it necessary from the  standpoint of safety."    In the case of Nakasone and Takeshita, it is probably judged  that they are persons for whom there is fear of their being  harmed.

                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      [Text] [passage omitted]    [Text] As a general rule security police are 175  centimeters or  taller, have attained the third rank or higher in either judo or  kendo, and are famous as men of valor even for the Metropolitan  Police Department. The hard part of the job is that it is not  enough to just be on guard; one must constantly strain one's  nerves. Words of advice like this are said to have been handed  down among them in the past. "Never fall down even if you are  hit by five bullets," "Be devoted to your partners," and "Don't  look at your watch."    "It means that security police must be prepared to lay down  their lives by becoming a bullet shield for the person they are  guarding, should the occasion arise. Furthermore, they must  anticipate the course along which the person they are guarding  will travel and confirm beforehand that it will be safe;  therefore, they must have good communication with their  partners. In addition, never relax your guard" (Suzuki).    I don't believe that all those guarded by the SP appreciate  this kind of arduous work....</p>

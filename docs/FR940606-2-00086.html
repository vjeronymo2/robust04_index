			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds that the trading of options on the Indexes, including full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS, will permit investors to participate in the price movements of the securities on which the respective Indexes are based. Further, trading of options on each Index will allow investors holding positions in some or all of the securities underlying that Index to hedge the risks associated with their portfolios. Accordingly, the Commission, believes options on the Growth and Value Indexes will provide investors with an important trading and hedging mechanism that should reflect accurately the overall movement of the securities contained in this partition of the S&amp;P 500 Index. By broadening the hedging and investment opportunities of investors, the Commission believes that the trading of options on the Growth and Value Indexes will serve to protect investors, promote the public interest, and contribute to the maintenance of fair and orderly markets. <FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 6(b)(5) of the Act, the Commission must predicate approval of any new option or warrant proposal upon a finding that the introduction of such new derivative instrument is in the public interest. Such a finding would be difficult for a derivative instrument that served no hedging or other economic function, because any benefits that might be derived by market participants likely would be outweighed by the potential for manipulation, diminished public confidence in the integrity of the markets, and other valid regulatory concerns. In this regard, the trading of listed options on the Growth and Value Indexes will provide investors with a hedging vehicle that should reflect the overall movement of securities contained in the Indexes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The trading of options on the Growth and Value Indexes, including the trading of full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS, however, raises several concerns, namely issues related to index design, customer protection, surveillance, and market impact. The Commission believes, for the reasons discussed below, that the DBOE has addressed these concerns adequately. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Index Design and Structure <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds that the Indexes are broad-based indexes, <FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>  and thus it is appropriate to permit Exchange rules applicable to the trading of broad-based index options to apply to options on the Indexes, including Index LEAPS. Specifically, the Commission believes the Indexes are broad-based because they (1) are a partition of the S&amp;P 500 Index, which is a broad-based index on which options have been approved for trading since 1983, <FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>  and (2) reflect a substantial segment of the U.S. equities market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The reduced-value Growth and Value Indexes, which are composed of the same components as the Growth and Value Indexes, respectively, and calculated by dividing the full-value Index values by 10, are identical to the full-value Growth and Value Indexes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 19907 (June 24, 1983), 48 FR 30814 (July 5, 1983). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission also finds that the large capitalizations, liquid markets, and relative weightings of the component stocks of each Index significantly minimize the potential for manipulation of either Index. First, the Indexes collectively represent and consist of the common stock values of 500 actively traded U.S. companies. Second, no one particular stock or group of stocks dominates either Index. Specifically, as of May 3, 1994, no one stock comprised more than 4.65% of the Value Index's total value or 5.12% of the Growth Index's total value, and the percentage weighting of the five largest issues in the Indexes accounted for 15.19% of the Value Index's value and 19.47% of the Growth Index's value. Third, the market capitalizations of the stocks in the Indexes are very large. Specifically, the market capitalizations (1) for the Value Index ranged from a high of $76.05 billion to a low of $97.23 million as of May 3, 1994, with the mean and median being $5.27 billion and $2.96 billion, respectively, and (2) for the Growth Index ranged from a high of $82.09 billion to a low of $506.63 million as of that date, with the mean and median being $8.43 billion and $4.28 billion, respectively. Fifth, each Index is comprised of stocks representing a diverse group of industries, including, among others, pharmaceuticals, communications, entertainment, various consumer and computer products and services. Sixth, an overwhelming proportion of the component stocks in each Index currently are eligible for options trading. <FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>  Finally, the Commission believes that, as discussed below, existing mechanisms to monitor trading activity in those securities will help deter as well as detect illegal trading activity involving options on the Indexes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The CBOE's options listing standards, which are uniform among the options exchanges, provide that a security underlying an option must, among other things, meet the following requirements: (1) The public float must be at least 7,000,000; (2) there must be a minimum of 2,000 stockholders; (3) trading volume must have been at least 2.4 million over the preceding twelve months; and (4) the market price must have been at least $7.50 for a majority of the business days during the preceding three calendar months.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> CBOE Rule 5.3, Interpretation .01. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Customer Protection <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that a regulatory system designed to protect public customers must be in place before the trading of sophisticated financial instruments, such as options on the Growth and Value Indexes (including full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS), can commence on a national securities exchange. The Commission notes that the trading of standardized exchange-traded options occurs in an environment that is designed to ensure, among other things; that: (1) The special risks of options are disclosed to public customers; (2) only investors capable of evaluating and bearing the risks of options trading are engaged in such trading; and (3) special compliance procedures are applicable to options accounts. Accordingly, because the options and Index LEAPS on the Growth and Value Indexes will be subject to the same regulatory regime as the other standardized options currently traded on the CBOE, the Commission believes that adequate safeguards are in place to ensure the protection of investors in options and Index LEAPS on the Indexes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Surveillance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission generally believes that a surveillance sharing agreement between an exchange proposing to list a stock index derivative product and the exchanges trading the stocks underlying the derivative product is an important measure for the surveillance of the derivatives and underlying securities markets. Such agreements ensure the availability of information necessary to detect and deter potential manipulations and other trading abuses, thereby making the stock index product less readily susceptible to manipulation. <FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>  In this regard, the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotation system (``NASDAQ''), which currently are the primary markets for all of the component securities in the Indexes, are members of the ISG, which provides for the exchange of all necessary surveillance information. <FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 26 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31243 (September 28, 1992), 57 FR 45849 (October 5, 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> note 21. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

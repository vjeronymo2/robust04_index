			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yonghong: "State Puts More Money Into Farm </F> Production"]    [Text] The Chinese Government is set to pour more money  into agriculture this year to boost grain and cotton output,  according to official sources.    More investment will be channeled to leading grain and  cotton-producing areas and the less developed central and  western regions, said Wang Xinjian, an official from the State  Office for Comprehensive Agricultural Development Programme  (CADP), yesterday.    The government has decided to pour 1.9 billion yuan ($219  million) into CADP projects, including grain and cotton  development. This figure is 200 million yuan ($23 million) more  than last year, according to Wang.    But the official did not reveal how much of this money would  be used for grain and cotton development projects.    The central government will also set aside another 1 billion  yuan ($115 million) as special fund to provide work for the  poverty stricken population from this year to 2000, said the  official.    A total of 25 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) has been injected  into the programme from the central and local governments and  other sector since the programme was launched six years ago.    Seventy-five per cent of the fund was used for developing  facilities aimed at bolstering the production of grain, cotton  and edible oil, 15 per cent for meat, eggs and aquatic products,  and 10 percent for forest and grassland construction.    Most of the fund was used for infrastructure construction  for  agricultural production, while the rest has been poured into  biological development projects and scientific and technological  promotions, said Wang.    The development of low- or medium-yield farmland into  high-yield plots is the most important part of the programme.  Usually the per-unit yield would double after the land is  improved.    A total of 8 million hectares of low- or medium-yield  farmland has been transformed since 1988 and 1 million hectares  of wasteland have been reclaimed.    In addition, 1.2 million hectares of new forest farms have  been planted and 350,000 hectares of grassland improved.    These efforts have turned out an additional 18 billion kg of  grain, 252 million kg of cotton, 700,000 tons of edible oil, 10  million kg of sugar, and 650,000 tons of meat during the last  six years.    The country inaugurated the CADP projects in 1988 by  concentrating massive investment on selected agricultural areas  and projects in a bid to tackle rural problems comprehensively.    The thrust of the projects is the attempt to increase  production of grain, cotton, edible oil, meat, and sugar, while  ensuring an all-round, coordinated development of farming,  forestry, animal husbandry, side-line production, and fishery.    The first batch of the programme covered 10 provinces and  autonomous regions, including the Three-River  (Heilong-Wusuli-Songhua rivers) Plain in Northeast China, plains  along the Yellow River, Huaihe River, and Haihe River, and the  middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.</p>

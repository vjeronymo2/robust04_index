			<p>BFN     [Text] Madrid, 11 May (EFE) -- Spanish Deputy Prime  Minister Narciso Serra today denied he asked former Civil Guard  Director Luis Roldan to investigate Mario Conde in 1992 when he  headed the Spanish Credit Bank (Banesto), as reported by the  daily EL MUNDO.    In a statement to the SER radio network, Serra said the  report published by EL MUNDO is completely false, adding that  the only knowledge he had about the alleged investigation is  what he read today in that newspaper.    Serra, however, did not rule out the possibility that such  an  inquiry could have existed as implied in the newspaper, but he  denied ordering the investigation, reiterating: "I did not order  that or any other inquiry."    According to EL MUNDO, Serra asked Roldan to investigate  Mario Conde's financial and personal activities in view of the  banker's alleged intentions of participating in politics, citing  Roldan himself, who is currently at large.    With regard to his possible appearance before the  parliamentary commission probing Roldan's actions -- which four  parliamentary groups viewed as unnecessary last week -- Serra  said he is willing to appear if summoned.    Today, representatives from the Popular Party (PP,  conservative), United Left (IU, pro-Communist), and the Mixed  Group reiterated their request for Deputy Prime Minister Serra  to appear before the commission to explain his relation with  Conde's actions. They added that this is more necessary now in  view of the report published by EL MUNDO.    In his statement to the radio, Serra stressed he is "the  most  interested in showing" that reports that he requested an  investigation on Mario Conde "are false."    Serra noted that he would like Roldan to "make an appearance  to say what he has to say. In this way, others would have the  opportunity to completely refute all charges."    Roldan, who is under investigation for serious corruption  charges, escaped early this month and, in an interview published  by EL MUNDO, threatened to reveal political maneuvers and  secrets about corruption in Spain if he does not receive  favorable treatment from the government.    Conde was Banesto president until December 1993, when the  Bank of Spain intervened in the institution because of its grave  financial situation. He was removed from his post.  Subsequently, Banesto's financial situation improved, and the  Bank of Santander purchased most of its capital.</p>

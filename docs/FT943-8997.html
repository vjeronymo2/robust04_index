			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Games that build teams You could be forgiven for thinking that Guy Baker is an Australian beach bum taking a short break from the stresses and strains of windsurfing. But while this does number among his many hobbies, the sun-bleached hair and tanned skin are deceptive. At 34, Baker is the managing director of Catalyst Event Management, an unusual team-building company which has experienced enormous growth over its near five-year existence. Baker is a communication studies graduate with a PhD in recreational management. He began work at the sports council in London. He moved from there to Catalyst in the Lake District to run the outdoor team-building project, Loophole, an adaptation of the BBC TV programme, Now Get Out of That. At that time, there were many companies coming up to the Lakes to get involved with similar projects with Catalyst's competitors. 'We thought that rather than the companies coming up here, we would go to them,' says Baker. 'That way we could reach the people with bigger budgets, such as the sales and marketing departments.' Catalyst is based just outside Kendal in a large house. Sales director John Bird has an office in the Midlands. There are also small franchises in Washington and Cyprus. Catalyst has a staff of eight at Kendal but, for large events, it recruits experts to teach specific skills needed in the teambuilding activities. Events have been carried out in locations ranging from Brighton and Nottingham to Slovakia and Cyprus. The games include Fifteen Famous Minutes, where teams produce their own Hollywood movie. Gone With the Wind and The Three Musketeers are two typical examples for which the filming equipment, full costume, make-up and such crucial accessories as Havana cigars, are provided to get into the spirit of the game. A typical film would cost companies around Pounds 1,000 for a team of 15. Other team-building skills might include conquering the wild west or playing at being a hot-shot reporter. Catalyst does run games that encompass the more traditional forms of team-building, with an emphasis on physical competitiveness and stamina. But, says Baker: 'We have steered away from anything traditional, which is why clients find it fun. We help people to use the right-hand side of the brain, the creative side, which is all too often untapped.' Catalyst was started as a venture capital project in 1989 by Beacon Broadcasting Communications. Beacon bore most of the start-up costs of about Pounds 100,000, and not everything has been rosy. Turnover in the first year was Pounds 80,000. It rose to Pounds 500,000 in 1992. Then Baker and fellow team-builder Martin Ruby decided to go it alone. They raised Pounds 50,000 from shares and arranged a Pounds 10,000 overdraft facility from the bank. It was not easy to convince the banks that an independent Catalyst would be feasible. Last year, their first since independence, turnover reached almost Pounds 1m and profits were about Pounds 50,000. But again, there have been setbacks. The company was surprised by a Pounds 12,000 tax bill. 'I've never been in a business before which made money so it was a bit of a shock when we had to pay this much tax,' says Baker. Cumbria is not the most fashionable location for a business dealing with multi-national clients, but Baker is not deterred by what he calls the company's geographical snob problem. Expansion plans are constantly considered, but Guy is not too worried if they do not come off in the end. 'There's no need for us to grow as long as we maintain our present business,' he says.

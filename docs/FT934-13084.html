			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Tokyo prepares ground for upturn THERE is no sign of an imminent Japanese economic recovery, but the grounds for an upturn are being laid, the Japanese central bank said yesterday. The Bank of Japan's assessment, in its latest quarterly review, coincides with growing signs that the government will cut income tax to try to stimulate sluggish consumption. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, is planning to ask his coalition partners to agree to a Y5,000bn (Pounds 31,250m) tax cut, to take effect next April, according to widely leaked reports to the press. It would be financed by stop-gap government bonds, until April 1995, when consumption tax would be increased from 3 per cent to possibly 7 per cent. Mr Hosokawa is awaiting proposals from a panel on tax reform, due on November 16, before drawing up a bill to be tabled in parliament early next year, according to the reports. Government officials would not comment, but a tax cut is already reflected in equity prices, say stock market observers. Yesterday's assessment provides further evidence that three government spending packages and seven cuts in the official discount rate over the past two years have failed to stimulate the economy. Public sector investment and private house building is growing, but this is not enough to make up for the weakness in corporate investment and consumer consumption, according to the survey. The main uncertainties the bank sees ahead are the impact of the yen's rise on company profits and business sentiment; the influence of the weak job market on consumer consumption; and balance sheet adjustments by banks and other lending institutions as they dispose of bad loans. Commercial bank lending continues to be slow, despite record low interest rates. This is partly because of slack corporate demand for credit and cautious lending by banks. More companies are turning to the capital markets and finance corporations have increased lending, said the bank. Money supply, M2 plus certificates of deposits, rose by 1.8 per cent in the second and third quarters and is expected to rise by 2 per cent for the year.</p>

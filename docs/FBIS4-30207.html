			<p>BFN     [Text] Kasem Suwannakun, chairman of the executive board  of Thai Airways International Co. Ltd., has announced that from  July 1994 the company will open new flying routes, both domestic  and international.    The new domestic route will be Bangkok-Sakon Nakhon-Nakhon  Phanom-Bangkok. A Boeing 737-400 aircraft will be used to  operate three flights a week on this route. The main reasons for  opening this route are to introduce a new market and to expand  domestic transportation.    Regarding foreign routes, the company will open a direct  route from Bangkok to Lahore, Pakistan, and back, using an  Air-bus B-4 for the operation of three flights a week. The other  route will be Bangkok-New Delhi-Amsterdam with a Boeing 747-200  being used to operate two flights a week.    The aforementioned three routes will begin operations from 1  July.</p>

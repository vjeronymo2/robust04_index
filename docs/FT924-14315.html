			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Gorbachev Foundation accused over earnings A RUSSIAN government audit has accused ex-Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev's non-profit foundation of illegally raking in hundreds of thousands of dollars by subletting the premises Mr Gorbachev was allotted last December. Details of the audit report, published yesterday by the Moscow city newspaper Kurant and confirmed by the Ministry of Finance, allege that the Gorbachev Foundation, a non-profit think-tank, illegally earned Dollars 306,000 (Pounds 170,000) by leasing out its spacious premises, which include an office complex, a villa outside Moscow and a sanatorium. Coming on top of two court summons, the financial allegations could trigger a witch-hunt aimed at the outspoken ex-president. In what appeared to be a concerted effort to prepare the ground for further action against Mr Gorbachev, Mr Mikhail Poltaranin, the Russian minister for information, said Mr Gorbachev was seeking a 'Bolshevik-style' political comeback. 'When Gorbachev created the foundation and was given huge premises in Moscow he said that he would gather brains to produce ideas for Russia,' Mr Poltaranin said. 'Instead the foundation piled up hard currency.' Mr Poltaranin said at a Confederation of Independent States meeting in Bishkek: 'Gorbachev has set up a second Zurich, a Bolshevik centre from which he watches to see how he can start firing the Aurora guns (which fired the shots which sparked the Bolshevik revolution in 1917) at the present authorities to launch another coup.' The former Kremlin boss was unceremoniously evicted from the buildings in a dawn raid on Thursday when Russian President Boris Yeltsin raised the stakes in the increasingly acrimonious and petty battle between the two Russian leaders. Mr Gorbachev had previously been deprived of his limousines and has been forbidden to travel abroad for refusing to answer the summons of Russia's Constitutional Court. Yesterday France formally complained to the Russian government about the eviction, and the Italian government on Tuesday protested against the travel ban. The newest allegations could spark more international anger. The audit alleges that the foundation's hard-currency earnings, together with big foreign donations, were used to furnish it with perks such as cars, garages and foreign travel, subsidise ex-Communist newspapers, including Pravda, and provide medical care abroad for one of Mr Gorbachev's associates. An official from the auditing department of the Russian Ministry of Finance said investigations began in August. He insisted the audit was routine and not politically motivated, and the Russian government was likely to decide on its next move within a week. However, he said Mr Yeltsin was directly involved in the investigation through a special presidential auditing department.</p>

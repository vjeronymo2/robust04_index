Our Industry Yesterday, Today,  Tomorrow"]    [Text] The past year added many bitter pages to  Georgia's history. This must not happen this year. Whatever it  takes, we must restore our economy to health and turn people  back to the economy. This is the aim of the head of state's 18  December 1993 edict directing the various ministries, state  committees, departments, concerns, and other structures to work  out programs and plans to be activated in their departments and  systems in order to solve the crisis and restore stability.    What is the republic's industry doing in this regard?  It is, after all, a key sector of the nation's economy,  accounting for a third of our national income and over half of  the gross social product. The Industry Ministry today supervises  mining and metallurgy, chemicals, machine-building, light  industry, lumber and woodworking, the medical industry, and  other multisector complexes, and takes part in formulating and  implementing unified policies to develop them. It must play a  crucial role in inplementing programs to solve the country's  crisis and restore stability. That is the subject of this  article.    The social-economic processes taking place in industry today  show that the sector is firmly on its way to market relations in  the economy. Still, the results of the activity show that the  transition is proceeding painfully under difficult political and  economic conditions. Output is falling, and hyperinflation is  rampant.    Like the other economic sectors, industry is in a deep  crisis. Even year before last (to say nothing of 1992 [as  published]), production volume declined precipitously. The  causes are many, but the main ones have been the country's  political instability, banditry and lack of roads, the breakdown  of money and credit relations, and the breaking of traditional  economic ties. Due to the inefficiency of our customs service,  stocks of hides, wool, timber, and other essential raw materials  are being taken out of the country. The sector suffers from  acute shortages of fuel, electricity, supplies and raw  materials, so that a big part of our industrial potential is out  of circulation (and resulting losses add up to tens of  billions). In addition, privatization has been hampered while  the state sector is not functioning well.    For the past three years, industry has been operating by  inertia, without any advance plans or programs, thus creating an  atmosphere of irresponsibility and laxity. Unsound policies have  generated certain difficulties between production and the  ministries and left their mark on the whole economy.  Unfortunately, some high officials are still acting that way.    Over the years, enterprises under all-Union jurisdiction  went  unsupervised. The lack of state orders has forced them to lay  off mass numbers of engineering-technical personnel and  specialists. Through disuse, many installations have broken  down, and much equipment has been sold off improperly. In  addition, privatization has often been carried out illogically  and harmfully.    We could go on listing the objective and subjective causes  of  industry's failures, but the Ministry cannot afford a policy of  whining and blaming others.    Sad to say, the crisis has reached the pathetic stage; there  is no room to retreat. What we need now is in-depth analysis,  measures to correct mistakes and find our proper way--especially  now that we have Head of State Eduard Shevardnadze's edict "On a  Program To Overcome the Crisis and Restore Stability" to guide  us.    The ministry is doing intensive, fruitful work in this  regard. We are encouraged not only by our economic potential and  irreversible reform processes but also by vitally important  changes due to the restoration of traditional ties with former  Soviet republics in all industrial sectors. We are also  encouraged by contacts with other foreign countries.    The first steps have been taken in this regard. We have  signed documents with the Russian Federation's Military Industry  Committee and Machine-Building Committee, also an agreement with  its Metallurgy Committee and with the appropriate departments of  other republics. We have an intergovernmental agreement in the  military industry sector (on technical-economic, scientific, and  cooperative relations) which exempts organizations in this  sphere from all quota-allocation [Russian kvotirovaniye],  licensing, and customs fees.    The ministry is firmly on its way to a market economy. We  are  doing everything we can to create the organizational and program  base to implement radical reforms as quickly as possible. For  this purpose we have set up an actively functioning Reform  Headquarters. Our task is:    --to achieve a certain level of balance and regulation in  sectors of industry;    --to stabilize the production level of traditional products  and to turn out world-standard, advanced products on the basis  of structural transformations of the economy;    --to organize the production of strategically-important  goods, to diminish state influence on other sectors and  enterprises, and to privatize them in an expedient and timely  manner;    --to foster the development of promising programs of  industry  in all approved and lawful forms and give the green light to  market structures;    --to enhance the competitiveness of leading industrial  sectors and, on this basis, put them into the orbit of world  markets and integrative processes;    --to make optimal use of the country's geopolitical factor,  adopt leading foreign and domestic technologies, effectively  exploit local resources, and meet the demands of the domestic  market.    Industry cannot develop properly unless regulating  parameters  are made part of production management. This refers to  indicative planning and other market mechanisms which have  considerable mobilizing power. Soon we will have a  specific-action, integrated inter-departmental and  intersectorial program and comprehensive plans to be created  jointly with the Saknavtobi, Sakenergo, and Sakgazi departments.    For the first time in recent years, the ministry,  enterprises, and organizations have jointly worked out a  specific-action program (for 1994) designed to halt production  decline and take comprehensive measures to stabilize production.  It is not a plan imposed from above but a program conceived by  the enterprises themselves to generate optimism and exert  mobilizing power. We think the republic's industry can double  its output over the 1993 level, which will be reflected in the  overall end results, especially increased contributions to the  budget.    This alone, however, is not enough to achieve a real  turnaround in the economy, which cannot be done solely with  present resources and reserves. We need to attract foreign  investment, which requires a favorable political and economic  atmosphere and real, concrete efforts to interest investors.    During the time of transition to the market, when many  enterprises face the threat of bankruptcy, it is the ministry's  crucial task to look realistically at their prospects in  boosting the republic's economy. We want to set up an investment  fund for industrial reconstruction and development--that is, a  strategic transformation fund designed first to stabilize the  work and then to foster accelerated development of priority  directions.    We are pursuing a vigorous policy of structural  transformations. The ministry (whose apparatus includes 16  scientists) is working to perfect industrial sectors in  accordance with their existing situation and prospects. I have  in mind the enterprises' technical base and their cadres'  ability to turn out high-quality, competitive goods, prospects  of supplies of raw materials and manufactured components,  anticipating sales and market conditions and meeting domestic  market demands, and ecological, social and other factors.    Still, our main problem this year is to speed up  privatization. A state privatization program is being formulated  and implemented, which calls for the phased privatization of  systems, enterprises and organizations in three main directions:  converting a certain number of state enterprises into stock  companies; buying out leased property for collective ownership;  and selling enterprises by competition or auction.    The ministry is involved in the work of privatization  commissions; it examines and approves privatization plans and  monitors their implementation.    True, joint-stock company formation is proceeding slowly,  but  that cannot be blamed on the ministry's position. In fact, the  ministry is encouraging effective privatization and joint-stock  company formation efforts. We are convinced that the prime task  is to convert inefficient state properties into efficient  private properties. This will result, of course, in a diminution  of the state's role in management. It does not, however, entail  any corresponding weakening of state control. Transition to the  new structure must be made in a way that preserves the  production potential. This is what is most vital and important  now. Probably, moreover, the laws and statutes on privatization  need to be overhauled. We think, for example, that we need to  make a timely decision on procedures for distributing funds  generated by privatization. These funds must be used to remodel  and develop fixed assets at the ministry's disposal which are  not subject to privatization. Otherwise it will be too hard,  given the unprecedented budget deficit, to assure the necessary  investments in the economy. We think this approach is a  realistic way to get out of the crisis. Privatization must not  result in the loss of our accumulated industrial and scientific  potential.    The state privatization program will create a new stage in  the republic's economy. It will certainly result in shaping  subjects adapted to the market environment, and in addition to  boosting economic activity they will take responsibility for the  end results. Naturally, the ministry's organizational activity  will take on new content and should be reflected in overall  efforts to boost the economy.    In addition, the ministry is paying close attention to the  care of defense industry factories and problems of their  conversion. We are trying to activate research institutes in the  sector and supply the Georgian army's military equipment needs  by means of technical cooperation with the enterprises.    It is gratifying to note that the UN's Industrial  Organization has complied with our ministry's request and has  allocated 150,000 dollars for the development of operating  enterprises.    Investment brochures for every sector in the system have  been  developed and published in English for foreign partners, giving  specific proposals. Relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran  are being developed. Preliminary talks on future cooperation  have been held with business representatives of Australia,  Austria, Germany, Ethiopia, Turkey, Italy, and a number of other  countries.    Another thing. In order to assure radical reforms in  industrial management, the implementation of the country's  accelerated socio-economic development, appropriate activation  of commodity-money relations, and major strengthening of the  role of credit and money circulation, we think it is advisable  to create a specialized state commercial bank for industrial  reconstruction and development. We are also counting on the  International Machine-Building Bank that is now being formed  (our Ministry is one of its founders). It will take care of  clearings between countries and do much to foster economic ties  with foreign countries.    Hence, the problems of industry are not the concern of the  Ministry alone, although under the right conditions it can take  the lead role in the national economy. Indeed, industry's  priority in solving the country's most important tasks is  unlimited, and we hope our ministry, through joint efforts, can  successfuly cope with the tasks it faces.</p>

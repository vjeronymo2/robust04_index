			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Dividend worries hit Lasmo OIL and gas exploration company Lasmo suffered a sharp setback in its share price yesterday after securities house Hoare Govett slashed earnings forecasts for the group and argued that it would have to pass its final dividend. The stock was off 17 at worst but closed a net 9 lower at 156p with unusually heavy turnover of 14m shares. Hoare said Lasmo would be hit by a high advanced corporation tax charge and a larger than expected depreciation charge. As a result, Hoare's oils team cut earnings per share forecasts for 1992 and 1993 to 3.7p and 4.9p from 5.6p and 8.6p. Analyst Mr Brendan Wilders said; 'When your net gearing is at 100 per cent and the dividend is uncovered for at least two years payment of the dividend should be seen as financially imprudent.' The shares were under further pressure from Lehman Brothers which cut its asset valuations for a number of exploration and production stocks. DIY groups suffer The revelation by Boots that the Do-It-All chain, which it co-owns with WH Smith, had suffered declining sales in the third quarter hit shares in both companies and dragged down other groups with DIY interests. It also led to a welter of downgrades. Most analysts had expected flat sales at Do-It-All and pencilled in losses this year of around Pounds 20m. The 5 per cent fall in sales announced by Boots saw loss forecasts for the subsidiary increased by some Pounds 5m and forecasts for the group as a whole chopped back into a range of Pounds 400 to Pounds 410m. What worried stores specialists was that Do-It-All had been involved in deep discounting for a sustained period, thus suffering declines in both margins and sales. While Boots other divisions peformed satisfactorily, the DIY buisness is worrying the City, with some analysts questioning the parent companies' strategy. Mr Andy Hughes at Nomura said: 'Boots and Smiths need to decide whether they will commit sufficient funds for store refurbishment and for a new central distribution centre.' Another analyst predicted pressure on Boots to buy control of Do-It-All and speed up the rationalisation programme. WH Smith and Kingfisher, which runs the B&amp;Q chain, were also the subject of downgrades. Boots shares slumped 26 to 509p in turnover of 5m, with some analysts predicting further weakness as the rating remains high. However, the decline in the other two DIY groups was considered somewhat overdone. Kingfisher dived 18 to 571p, and WH Smith 'A' fell 19 to 469p, the 'B' shares 4 to 91 1/2 p. Ladbroke firm One group with DIY interests to survive the savaging was Ladbroke, which after an initial fall rallied to a gain of 4 at 194p. Rumours in the market suggested that Ladbroke had been successful over the last month in making a number of property disposals, possibly worth around Pounds 80m. These were thought to mostly consist of UK retail sites. Analysts also suggested that Ladbroke's problems at its Texas DIY concern had been well heralded and discounted into the shares. The battle for the UK holiday market continued to excite interest with one large institution deciding to exit from the predatory Airtours to be replaced by another hoping that its Pounds 225m bid for Owners Abroad is successful. Equitable Life was reported to have sold 5.9m Airtours shares, around 7 per cent of the company, on Wednesday at 260p, which was around 30p below the then market price. It was immediately picked up by Morgan Grenfell. Yesterday, Airtours shares slipped 3 to 288p. Owners slid the same to 119p. A large buyer of Forte sent the shares racing forward to 197p, a rise of 8. Friendly Hotels continued to attract speculative interest and the shares added 21 to 199p. Resurgent reports that Rank Organisation would sell its film making business found little support among analysts. The company also issued a denial. While a consortium has been brought together to make an offer, observers said such a sale would be detrimental to Rank's interests. The shares rose 12 to 716p. Adhesives maker Evode jumped 13p to 119 on news that it had agreed a Pounds 135.5m bid by Laporte, the UK's largest independent chemicals group. It was also the most heavily traded stock in London with 26m shares dealt. Evode has been under siege since November from mini-conglomerate Wassall which made a Pounds 113m increased hostile offer on Monday. Laporte, which is also raising Pounds 84.4m via a placing and a one-for-10 open offer at 560p per share, saw its shares drop 27 to 583p. Wassall was unchanged at 209p. HSBC Holdings rose 23 to 519p on reports in a Chinese newspaper that China wants a meeting with Britain, scheduled for March, to go ahead. Recent comments casting doubt on whether the meeting would take place had undermined market sentiment. However, the remainder of the banking sector was hampered by continuing debt worries. Abbey National, heavily exposed to domestic mortgages, fell 12 1/2 to 358 1/2 p. Nomura Research added weight to the pressure on the pharmaceuticals sector and contributed to weakness in Wellcome, off 10 at 934p, and Glaxo, down a further 5 at 732p. The UK arm of the Japanese stockbroker focused on the large number of patents due to expire over the next 18 months. The house says invalidation of the US patent Nolvadex, ICI's best-selling cancer drug, would 'imperil 10 per cent of Zeneca's drug profits'. ICI slipped 7 to 1101p. SmithKline Beecham was actively traded as selling from the US was countered by UK buying. Salomon Brothers was bidding aggressively for the stock which closed steady at 468p with 4.3m shares traded. British Bio-Technology firmed 2 to 340p responding to a Kleinwort Benson buy note. Carlton Communications edged ahead 5 to 800p with Lehman Brothers discussing the prospects for the company at the orning meeting. Media agency More O Farrell jumped 28 to 223 following favourable New Year share tipping. Banknote printer De La Rue added 9 at 657p on buying in a thin market. Second liners among engineering stocks outshone the sector leaders, the latter seeing a bout of profit-taking. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992/93 NEW HIGHS (184).

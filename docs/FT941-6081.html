			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: All in the national interest? Sir, With reference to your article 'Greek disgrace' (Editorial comment: February 18), imagine, for a moment, that the UK is not an island. Imagine also the neighbouring non-ethnic state, in search of an identity calls itself Scotland, uses the St Andrew's Cross on its flag and, in a preamble to its constitution, states that the unification of the Scottish peoples is a national goal. Add to all this racial and religious differences and try to swallow national interest in favour of community convention and solidarity. Yannis S Costopoulos, 40 Stadiou Street, 102 52 Athens, Greece</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (A) The purchaser has an obligation to contribute to the plan with respect to the operations for substantially the same number of contribution base units for which the seller was obligated to contribute; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The purchaser obtains a bond or places an amount in escrow, for a period of five plan years after the sale, in an amount equal to the greater of the seller's average required annual contribution to the plan for the three plan years preceding the year in which the sale occurred or the seller's required annual contribution for the plan year preceding the year in which the sale occurred (the amount of the bond or escrow is doubled if the plan is in reorganization in the year in which the sale occurred); and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The contract of sale provides that if the purchaser withdraws from the plan within the first five plan years beginning after the sale and fails to pay any of its liability to the plan, the seller shall be secondarily liable for the liability it (the seller) would have had but for section 4204. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The bond or escrow described above would be paid to the plan if the purchaser withdraws from the plan or fails to make any required contributions to the plan within the first five plan years beginning after the sale. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, section 4204(b)(1) provides that if a sale of assets is covered by section 4204, the purchaser assumes by operation of law the contribution record of the seller for the plan year in which the sale occurred and the preceding four plan years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4204(c) of ERISA authorizes the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') to grant individual or class variances or exemptions from the purchaser's bond/escrow requirement of section 4204(a)(1)(B) when warranted. The legislative history of section 4204 indicates a Congressional intent that the sales rules be administered in a manner that assures protection of the plan with the least practicable intrusion into normal business transactions. Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, 96th Cong., 2nd Sess.,  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> &blank;S. 1076, The Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980: Summary and Analysis of Considerations 16 (Comm. Print, April 1980); 128 Cong. Rec. S10117 (July 29, 1980). The granting of an exemption or variance from the bond/escrow requirement does not constitute a finding by the PBGC that a particular transaction satisfies the other requirements of section 4204(a)(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the PBGC's regulation on variances for sales of assets (29 CFR part 2643), a request for a variance or waiver of the bond/escrow requirement under any of the tests established in the regulation (&sect;&sect;2643.12&hyph;2643.14) is to be made to the plan in question. The PBGC will consider waiver requests only when the request is not based on satisfaction of one of the four regulatory tests or when the parties assert that the financial information necessary to show satisfaction of one of the regulatory tests is privileged or confidential financial information within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) (the Freedom of Information Act). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under &sect;2643.3 of the regulation, the PBGC shall approve a request for a variance or exemption if it determines that approval of the request is warranted, in that it_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Would more effectively or equitably carry out the purposes of Title IV of the Act; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Would not significantly increase the risk of financial loss to the plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4204(c) of ERISA and &sect;2643.3(b) of the regulation require the PBGC to publish a notice of the pendency of a request for a variance or exemption in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and to provide interested parties with an opportunity to comment on the proposed variance or exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 28 (CNA) -- Taiwan's efforts to  promote industrial upgrading have paid off as heavy industry  exports reached a record high in the first quarter, the Ministry  of Economic Affairs reported Thursday [28 April].    Ministry tallies show that Taiwan exported US$108.30 billion  worth of heavy industry products in the first three months of  1994, accounting for 53.8 percent of its aggregate exports,  which totaled US$201.3 billion.    The ratio of heavy industry exports to Taiwan's total  outbound shipments represented a 2.5 percent growth from the  same period of last year, while total exports increased only 0.4  percent, officials said.</p>

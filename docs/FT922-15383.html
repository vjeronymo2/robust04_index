			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Observer: Yogi Park If the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's Natural Law Party fails to win a seat in Britain's general election, his transcendental meditating supporters can at least look forward to a break in their very own theme park, soon to be built  -barring acts of God, presumably  - on the banks of Niagara Falls. Well-founded reports suggest that the Yogi is teaming up with a Canadian magician, Doug Henning, to construct a 1,400 acre theme park, costing CDollars 690m and ready to open in three years' time. The main promise of the park is to provide 'enlightenment, knowledge and entertainment', though with a planned 6m visitors annually and an entrance fee of some Dollars 20, more mercenary motives might be suspected. Today the House of Commons, tomorrow the White House?</p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART DONATIONS AND THE TAX CODE  </P> <P> Your impassioned appeal (editorial, June 4) to "bring back the tax break for  art," while well-intentioned, is both naive and misleading. In effect what you  are suggesting is that the tax rate should go back up to 50% or more so that  the public can have the benefit of admiring works of art in museums. Do you  really think this will fly with Congress? Or are you advocating a revolt of the  rich?  </P> <P> The editorial is misleading because of the statement that the 1986 tax code  "effectively abolished that subsidy by eliminating taxpayers' ability to deduct  the full appreciated value of their gifts to art museums." It did nothing of  the sort for the ordinary taxpayers, who can still make their deduction based  on the full appreciated value of their gift at the time they make the gift.  </P> <P> It is only when a taxpayer has reduced his tax liability to zero as a result of  other deductions that the principle of "alternate minimum tax" applies, and the  taxpayer can then deduct only what he originally paid for the work of art.  </P> <P> In any event, this is a very complicated issue that is not well understood even  by accountants or lawyers. Your naivete therefore is understandable but rather  irresponsible.  </P> <P> PRATAPADITYA PAL  </P> <P> Senior Curator  </P> <P> Indian and Southeast Asian Art  </P> <P> L.A.

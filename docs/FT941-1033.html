			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / How to Spend It: There's room for growth in the shaving market - Ralph Atkins reports from the cutting edge of cosmetics It must be fun working as a marketing executive for a fancy cosmetics company: big budgets; a chance to put the imagination into overdrive and create new fashions for the workaday to aspire to. Riveting, absolutely fabulous. Experts at Chanel, the Paris-based perfumery, have enjoyed preparing for the May 2 UK relaunch of Pour Monsieur, the range of shaving products dating from 1955. Their aim, says the glossy artwork, is to revive 'the art of shaving . . . to a whisker'. In their terribly a la mode minds are images of traditional, grey-flannelled English gents, luxuriating on chrome barbers' chairs; of silken-faced chaps who have rejected 1980s designer stubble and, yet, are sufficiently modern to be happy with dabbing a little scented moisturiser on their faces. So journalists, including yours truly from the Financial Times, have been invited for a complimentary shave at Claridges, a pot of coffee afterwards, a spiel from fresh-faced, French-speaking mistresses of public relations on the importance of silicon derivatives to the adhering properties of shaving cream, and a complimentary package of Pour Monsieur products. Such stunts are common. The 1990 launch of Chanel's successful L'Egoiste range - aimed at the mysterious, amorously-inclined male - included slap-up romantic dinners for fashion writers and spouses (come to think of it, the life of a fashion writer is pretty fun too, once you swallow the ignominy of being manipulated by the marketing teams). Of course, not everyone is taken in. Shaving is, in essence, a chore. No amount of expensive perfume or imagery is going to remove the drudgery. There are just three aims of shaving: to be rid of any trace of beard, to smell nice (particularly to the female of the species) and to avoid bits lying at the bottom of the sink when your partner next uses the bathroom. If any cosmetics company could make a product that achieved all three, and sold it in plain containers, I would buy a vat-full. So, against such down-to-earth criteria, is the Pour Monsieur promotion all piffle? I'm not sure if I rave about the barber's shop. Shaving is a practice reserved for a pre-breakfast scramble to look respectable - a time when the mind has not yet downloaded communication skills. But it makes a change to have someone else tending to all the inaccessible places of the face, and to cleaning the sink afterwards. There is also an art to shaving, albeit quickly acquired: the use of hot towels to soften the bristle; the use of the cut-throat razor along the grain of the beard, avoiding major arteries. Chanel has its work cut out, however, if it believes it can revive the generation of Sweeney Todd. So far has demand for a shaving service fallen that Claridges only trims about four people a week, at Pounds 10 a head. Rival luxury hotel The Waldorf, though offering a full male hairdressing salon, does not provide such a service at all. More obviously, the re-launch of Pour Monsieur is intended to throw off the product's slightly old-man image and boost sales to chaps willing to pay Pounds 10.50 for a can of shaving foam or Pounds 21 for a 100ml bottle of aftershave. To achieve this it has been reformulated - all those extra silicon derivatives - and repackaged. It is now going to be sold in clouded, not clear, glass bottles; the grey used for the shaving foam's container is lighter. Wow. There is plenty of room for growth; so far Pour Monsieur is only a follicle on the face of the cosmetics market. Chanel sells six times as much of its ladies' perfume No 5. But the company must reckon it cannot be too long before as many men as women care about how they smell. And in the smell stakes, Pour Monsieur fares well. I thought of trying a proper consumer test, but a sniff along the shelves of Boots the Chemist proved the only challengers are the equally expensive products from other perfume houses. In comparison, standard pre-electric lotion or aftershaves smell like white spirit. When it comes to the top-notch products, the differences are a matter of taste. (Incidentally, Claridges uses its own brand when not running promotions for Chanel.) Pour Monsieur is described as combining Sicilian lemons, cardamom, oak moss and Virginian cedar. It is certainly lemony, as in tarte au citron rather than washing-up liquid. 'Prooooor,' said my wife, but I think she liked it really.</p>

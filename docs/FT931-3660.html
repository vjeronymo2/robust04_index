			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Truck and van sales fall 7.5% REGISTRATIONS of new commercial vehicles fell by 7.49 per cent last month, compared with February last year, figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show. The rapid plunge of Leyland Daf from leadership of the truck market in the wake of its collapse is also highlighted. Its rivals, led by Iveco Ford, have moved swiftly to capitalise on the market opportunities presented by the halt in Leyland Daf truck and van production last month. The receivers have restored production at both the Leyland truck plant and the Birmingham van plant, with separate management buy-outs of each now under discussion. However, the collapse meant that last month Leyland Daf's truck sales fell by more than a third, to 373 from 584 in February last year. The Fiat-controlled Iveco group, which includes Iveco Ford, small UK truckmaker Seddon Atkinson and imports of Iveco-built trucks from the continent, saw its truck registrations leap last month by 54.7 per cent to 874 against February last year. Sharp rises were also recorded by Mercedes, up 20 per cent, Volvo (23 per cent) and Scania (20 per cent). The intensified market struggle has, however, left ERF, the UK's last publicly quoted independent heavy truckmaker, caught in the crossfire. Its registrations were down by a third to 65. In spite of the big changes in individual company sales, total sales of trucks - vehicles of 3.5 tonnes and over - were only 3.7 per cent higher last month at 2,585. This gives substance to concern about a slower-than-hoped recovery from the worst commercial vehicle recession since the second world war. Indeed, registrations of heavy trucks over 15 tonnes - the mainstay of the UK's haulage industry and a good barometer of economic activity - are running so far this year at nearly 2 per cent below the levels of a year ago. The contrast between the 7.5 per cent drop in total commercial vehicles registrations, to 15,085 from 16,307 in February last year, and the 16 per cent rise in car registrations is a sharp one. However, some industry analysts believe that around six percentage points of the car rise may be accounted for by dealers or manufacturers registering cars for which there are, as yet, no final buyers in an effort to boost apparent market share and to keep assembly lines busy.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK COMMERCIAL VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS JANUARY-FEBRUARY 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    Volume          Volume        Share (%)    Share (%)                   (Units)***   Change (%)****   Jan-Feb 93   Jan-Feb 92  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Market*      32,503           -1.46           100.00       100.00 Imports            12,965           +8.77            39.89        36.14 Small vans (up to 1.8 tonnes) Total              11,998           +9.37           100.00       100.00 Imports             4,378          +96.94            36.49        20.26 Ford                5,624          +32.14            46.87        38.80 Vauxhall (GM)       4,265          +10.49            35.55        35.19 Peugeot (incl.

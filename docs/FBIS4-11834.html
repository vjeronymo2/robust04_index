			<p>BFN     [Text] The government has backed down on its decision to  allow Israel to participate in the Cairo International Fair  scheduled to open on 9 April because of the overwhelming anger  that swept through Egypt after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre  in Hebron.    Engineer Hamid 'Atwah, director of the fair authority, said  Israel will not participate in the fair through its own pavilion  or through the U.S. pavilion. Israel has not participated in  the fair since 1986, following the attack that the "Egypt's  Revolution" organization launched on the Israeli pavilion in  1985.    Two weeks ago AL-'ARABI quoted diplomatic sources, as well  as  fair sources, as saying that the government was inclined to  allow Israel to participate in the fair by allocating space for  it in the U.S. pavilion.</p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR STAMPS: FOREIGN COLLECTORS ARE KEEN FOR MINT ISSUES  </P> <P> Question: We are not stamp collectors, but a friend in the Soviet Union is. He  requested some colorful U.S. stamps to add to his collection. I told my wife to  go to the post office and buy a few representative issues and suggested that  she send them on in uncancelled mint condition. But a friend told me that  stamps are of little value when sent that way (in an envelope, mint). Can you  straighten us out? -- M.S.  </P> <P> Answer: Mint stamps are probably preferred by your Soviet friend. While many  collectors like to study cancellations and other postal markings, most  collectors in foreign countries would prefer to receive unblemished mint stamps  because these show the full stamp design. They also tend to retain their market  value better than used versions.  </P> <P> For a couple of years I traded stamps with a gentleman in the Ukraine. We sent  each other mint regulars and commemoratives of our respective countries; we  also swapped information about our lives. I had no problem then getting mail  out of the Soviet Union, although I lost a few letters going there, presumably  to government censors or other curious officials. With Mikhail Gorbachev in  power, I think that you will have even less trouble getting collectible stamps  to your Soviet philatelist.  </P> <P> Stamp collecting, by the way, is extremely popular in the Soviet Union, and  collectors there have difficulty obtaining some foreign issues. So whether you  send them new or old mint U.S. stamps, they are certain to appreciate them.  </P> <P> Q: My envelope was delivered "by Overland Mail via St. Joseph, Missouri,"  according to a handwritten notation on it, then was delivered to a family  member in Brooklyn, Alameda County, Calif. There is no year in the postmark,  which is from St. Joseph, Mich. (there was a St. Joseph in both states). The  stamp, which was slightly damaged on the right side (part of the perforation  cut off), appears to be Scott No. 57 or 58 (circa 1860). Regrettably the stamp  was cut off of this envelope and then pasted back on years ago, when I was a  very inexperienced collector (11 years old).  </P> <P> My questions are: (1) Does this represent a memento of mail delivered by Pony  Express, and (2) if so, would it have any value to others? -- L.S.  </P> <P> A: It doesn't sound like a Pony Express cover of 1860-61 (the years of its  operation) because it doesn't show evidence of having a Pony Express stamp from  Wells, Fargo affixed to it, or the hand stamp or manuscript writing of  something like "Per Pony Express" or "The Central Overland California &amp;  Pikes Peak Express Company," which so many genuine Pony Express covers have on  them.  </P> <P> Scott U.S. Nos. 57 and 58 are rare special printings and are unknown on Pony  Express covers, so maybe you really mean some other catalogue number for the  stamp, such as 25 or 26 (the 3-cent perforated issues of 1857, in use through  midsummer of 1861). So to summarize, you probably don't have a rare Pony  Express cover, but let a stamp dealer look at it anyway for an evaluation.  </P> <P> Q: A number of years ago I purchased from the post office a roll of 13-cent  Liberty Bell stamps, Scott No. 1595, which was misperforated down the center of  the bells. I have a roll of 100 stamps in the original package. What are these  stamps worth? -- J.W.  </P> <P> A: Maybe a dollar or two per pair. They are certainly worth more than face  value, but not as much as totally imperforate (without any perforation holes)  copies would be.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stamp News  </P> <P> "Linn's World Stamp Almanac" in its long-awaited fifth edition has recently  been released by the publisher of the largest-circulation philatelic newspaper  in the United States: Linn's Stamp News, P.O. Box 29, Sidney, Ohio 45365. First  published in 1977, this useful almanac had its fourth edition in 1982.  </P> <P> The new edition contains 994 pages of useful stamp facts, figures and  addresses, and the soft-cover copy is available at $19.95 postpaid from Linn's,  or from many local stamp shops.  </P> <P> Included are a history of the U.S. Postal Service, U.S. postal regulations,  first-day covers, the addresses of worldwide postal agencies, collector  societies, dealer organizations, tips on collecting, and sources of stamp  information. An up-to-date listing of local, national and foreign stamp clubs,  and a summary of available computer inventory programs for stamp collections  are major parts of this book.  </P> <P> Regarding this new fifth edition of the Stamp Almanac, editor-publisher Michael  Laurence of Linn's says that "vast amounts of new material -- most of it  specifically related to stamps, especially U.S. stamps -- have been added. All  the remaining text has been screened, corrected, revised and updated."  </P></p>

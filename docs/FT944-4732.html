			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Nothing unusual in BAe accounting policy Sir, Many things concerned me about your article 'VSEL's suitors fight a war of whispers' published on December 5. In particular: It is wrong to suggest that many substantial companies do not treat pension fund prepayments as assets. I cite the following that do so: Shell, BP, Glaxo, Marks and Spencer, Unilever, RTZ and GrandMet. It is wrong to suggest that many substantial companies do not treat as assets undepreciated launch costs. Boeing, Rolls-Royce, Aerospatiale, Saab Scania, United Technologies, McDonnell Douglas and Fokker all carry forward such costs. It is wrong to suggest that there is anything unusual in the BAe treatment of capitalised rationalisation costs. These items relate to expected costs in bringing to a suitable condition for development the development land stock owned by Arlington Securities. Our treatment is appropriate and expressly approved by SSAP 9 para. 19 (c). Your treatment of the above three points is not only incorrect, but taken as whole contains the extremely damaging implication that BAe's balance sheet assets are being inflated by means of questionable accounting policies. Richard Lapthorne, finance director, British Aerospace, London SW1H 0RH</p>

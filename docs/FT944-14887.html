			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Company News: Windows helps lift Microsoft 27% Microsoft, the world's largest computer software company, reported a 27 per cent increase in revenues for its first fiscal quarter, with net earnings up 32 per cent. Driven by strong demand for its Windows personal computer operating system software and office applications programs, Microsoft continues to outpace all of its competitors in the PC software market. Revenues rose to Dollars 1.25bn from Dollars 983m in the first quarter of 1993. Net income increased to Dollars 316m from Dollars 239m, while earnings per share were 51 cents against 39 cents in the first quarter of fiscal 1993. Per-share earnings were restated to reflect a two-for-one stock split in May 1994. 'This was another solid quarter for the company,' said Mr Mike Brown, Microsoft chief financial officer. 'These results reflect the ongoing success of Windows as well as the continuing growth of our desktop applications revenues led by Microsoft Office.' North American sales represented 34 per cent of revenues, up from 33 per cent, while European sales declined as a percentage of total revenues to 23 per cent from 28 per cent in the same period last year, reflecting slower growth in the European PC market. Sales of applications programs represented 60 per cent of worldwide revenues. Earnings were at the high end of Wall Street estimates. Analysts said that Microsoft, which already dominates the markets for PC operating systems and office applications, is now also moving ahead of competitors in the PC database and word processing sectors, where it is winning market share from Borland and WordPerfect. Microsoft also introduced several new programs for home computer users during the first quarter as the company significantly expanded its consumer marketing efforts. Last week, Microsoft announced its intention to acquire Intuit, a leading publisher of personal finance, tax preparation and small business accounting software, for about Dollars 1.5bn in stock. The acquisition will give Microsoft entry to the emerging market for on-line financial services such as electronic bill paying.</p>

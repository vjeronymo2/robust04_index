			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Latin American Capital Markets: Brasilia pledges full support for debt deal THE NEW Brazilian administration of Mr Itamar Franco has expressed its full support for a Dollars 44bn (Pounds 24.7bn) debt agreement with commercial banks finalised last month, according to a senior commercial banker. Mr William Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citicorp, told a Financial Times conference that he had spoken yesterday to the new Brazilian finance minister, Mr Gustavo Krause, who assured him the new administration would 'proceed rapidly' to present the agreement to the Brazilian Senate as soon as a translation into Portuguese was completed. The agreement should be forwarded to Brazil's commercial bank creditors within the next four weeks, he said. Mr Rhodes told the conference on Latin American Capital Markets he was also informed the new government planned to continue a privatisation programme, although no details were yet available. He said he was optimistic the new government would command enough support in Congress to push through the necessary fiscal reform, needed under a standby loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund. He said this would expedite the commercial bank debt agreement and would allow a final exchange of instruments to take place no later than the end of the second quarter of next year. He said Dollars 7bn of bonds covering interest arrears in 1989 and 1990 should be issued by Brazil sometime in November. In a generally positive conference on the outlook for Latin America, he and other speakers told of how the challenge to Latin governments has shifted in the 1990s from the debt-dominated difficulties of the 1980s. Mr Shahid Husain, vice-president for Latin America and the Caribbean at the World Bank, said: 'The problem in most Latin American countries now is not the scarcity of capital. It is how best to channel capital into productive uses.' Although much had been done in adjusting economic and trade policies, some of the bigger tasks of building institutions and changing habits lay ahead. There was 'a pressing need for investment in education, health, urban development and the environment'; large investments in infrastructure; and a further strengthening of fiscal systems, in particular a reform of social security systems. He said he was concerned that growing protectionism in industrial countries could have serious effects on new regional trading arrangements within Latin America. 'If regional arrangements are not to degenerate into new protective walls, industrial countries will have to reduce and ultimately demolish the protective walls against Latin American products.' He also advised governments not to get involved in the new flows of finance now being directed into Latin America - estimated last year at Dollars 40bn  -and they should not assume any significant part of the risk. 'These flows are economic and sustainable only if they are based on the sharing of risks between private borrowers and the private lenders and investors.' Mr James Conrow, executive vice-president of the Inter-American Development Bank, expressed a concern that 'the period of explosive growth and extraordinary returns' on international investment in Latin America was now largely in the past. Such risk re-ratings tended to be one-time phenomena. With growing competition for international capital, investors would scrutinise even more carefully returns from Latin America. He said there were also worries about a lack of diversity among investors. A great majority of investors were individuals - holders of a pool of so-called flight capital estimated by the IADB to be about Dollars 190bn - rather than investment institutions. There was a need now to attract institutional investors, who were being discouraged by the memory of losses during the 1980s and by equity and bond markets that were still very thin. A high percentage of market capitalisation was concentrated in a few shares on most Latin American exchanges. A great majority of shares was still closely held among a small number of investors, with little information available to outsiders. A related problem was the scarcity of capital in the region committed to market-making. 'The existence of powerful economic groups which trade on insider information, frequently with little regard for minority shareholders, does not engender confidence,' he said.</p>

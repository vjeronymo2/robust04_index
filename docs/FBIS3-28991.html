The daily JAKARTA POST  said that Taiwanese Presidential Office spokesman Kramer Ting  told journalists that Li and Suharto agreed that Indonesia and  Taiwan should improve economic cooperation.    Suharto also expressed appreciation for Taiwanese investment  in Indonesia, the spokesman said. The two presidents met for 90  minutes at the Tampaksiring summer palace on the Indonesian  resort island of Bali Friday. Despite the absence of diplomatic  relations, Taiwan is the third largest investor in Indonesia,  committing nearly four billion dollars over the past 25 years in  the archipelago. Two-way trade was 1.42 billion dollars in the  first half of 1993 and was a total of 2.62 billion dollars in  1992.    The tightly guarded and closed meeting between Li and  Suharto  took place after a lunch attended by the presidents and the  first ladies, a source here said. [passage omitted]    Suharto arrived in Bali late Thursday, officially to visit  the newly renovated state-owned Grand Bali Beach Hotel, which  had burned down in January 1992. [passage omitted]    Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said that Li's visit  would not change Indonesia's One-China policy. He said that any  meeting between Li and Indonesian officials, including Suharto,  would be private capacities and should not be "exaggerated."  [passage omitted]</p>

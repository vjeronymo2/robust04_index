			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong gains 1.6% after listing of China stock BUYING by public funds and investment trusts absorbed arbitrage-related selling and the Nikkei average edged higher while most investors remained on the sidelines because of mounting political and economic uncertainty, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index rose 87.51 to 19,822.08, failing to recoup Friday's 1.9 per cent loss, having fluctuated between a day's low of 19,707.97 and high of 19,836.68 on index-linked trade. Volume shrank to 170m shares from 198m. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 6.22 at 1,615.55, but declines led advances by 493 to 406, with 232 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 0.28 firmer at 1,228.84. Investors are wary over the likelihood of a non-LDP coalition forming the new government, given that two splinter groups are poised to join the coalition to be formed among the five opposition parties. Further weak economic figures also weighed on sentiment. Department store sales for June fell 8.9 per cent from the previous year's, while the Bank of Japan said bank savings by retail customers were rising, reflecting consumer trends to save rather than spend. Mr Geoffrey Barker, an economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo, observed that since a recovery in consumer spending depended heavily on the willingness of households to run down their savings, lower interest rates, falling infla-tion and the return of buyers to the housing market were providing a backdrop for a rise in confidence. Hopes of lower interest rates supported banks. The bond market moved on similar speculation, with the yield on the No 145 10-year benchmark falling 3.5 basis points to 4.185 per cent. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y30 to Y3,120 and Sakura Bank gained Y30 at Y1,630. Suzuki Motor weakened Y6 to Y926 on reports that Volkswagen, of Germany, was likely to withdraw from a mini-car production venture in Spain. Persistent fears that a bribery scandal could hurt leading construction companies also affected sentiment. Hazama, already implicated in three cases of bribery to politicians, dipped Y4 to Y431. Tobishima fell Y13 to Y438 and Nishimatsu Construction retreated Y4 to Y918. Speculative favourites saw profit-taking. Nikkatsu, the day's most active issue, slipped Y1 to Y18 and Gajoen Kanko shed Y18 to Y135. In Osaka, the OSE average edged ahead 6.71 to 21,842.26 in volume of 6.6m shares. Roundup THE region experienced mixed fortunes yesterday. HONG KONG rose sharply as selling by overseas funds eased. The Hang Seng index put on 107.75, or 1.6 per cent, to 6,858.08 in HKDollars 2.52bn turnover. Brokers noted that nearly 10 per cent of the total volume was due to China's state-owned Shanghai Petrochemical, which began trading yesterday. The shares topped the active list, ending at HKDollars 1.61, against the offer price of HKDollars 1.58. Property issues rebounded from last week's falls: Henderson Land climbed 80 cents to HKDollars 20.40 and Cheung Kong rose 40 cents to HKDollars 24.90. TAIWAN built on Friday's 2.4 per cent rise, the weighted index ending 53.45 stronger at 4,083.87 after an intra-day high of 4,093.74. Turnover amounted to TDollars 19.8bn. Paper and construction shares were firmer, with China Steel up 60 cents at TDollars 20.10. SEOUL edged higher as buyers concentrated on small and medium-sized companies.

SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index initially fell 17 points on profit-taking before ending a net 11.46 off at 1,811.62. Sembawang Shipyard, which is expected to report interim earnings this week, fell 20 cents to SDollars 11.70.

AUSTRALIA reversed down through the 1,800 level ahead of inflation and balance of payments data due this week. The All Ordinaries index closed 11.1 easier at 1,795.7 in turnover of ADollars 284.1m. Among the banks, National Australia relinquished 8 cents to ADollars 10.28 and Commonwealth 6 cents to ADollars 8.68.

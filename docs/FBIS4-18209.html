			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Change Sought in Choice of </F> Speakers"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 30 -- The long-standing practice  of electing parliamentary speakers from opposition parties took  a knock Wednesday [30 March] when the right-wing victors of  recent elections said they would be aiming to put one of their  own number in the speaker's chair.    The debate on electing speakers -- the first item on the  agenda when the 12th legislature sits for the first time, April  15 -- was sparked by rumours, later strongly denied, that Forza  Italia and the National Alliance favoured centrist reformer  [Pact for Italy leader] Mario Segni for the Lower House  speaker's job. The rumour, said Forza Italia spokesman Antonio  Tajani this evening, "is without any basis in fact."    National Alliance Secretary Gianfranco Fini, in joking mood,  told journalists that "I would like to wait until the day after  tomorrow before formally presenting Segni: then the Italian  people will know it is an April Fool's trick."    Forza Italia chief Silvio Berlusconi, in an impromptu press  conference this afternoon, agreed that "the concept will be of  people from the majority parties," while Marco Taradash, the  Pannella List-Reformers member considered close to Forza Italia,  said "the speakers offices...must return to the governing  parties."    For Francesco Speroni, the Senate whip for the Northern  League, the opposition should not only be kept out of the  speakers' chairs, but should not be allowed to head permanent  parliamentary committees either. "As the League sees it, the  winners get things now, and the losers will get things next time  if they win," he explained.</p>

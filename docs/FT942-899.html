			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Italy puts 'prudent' price on Ina shares Shares in Ina, Italy's state-owned insurer, go on sale this morning at L2,400 each, in an international public offering which will raise more than L4,800bn (Pounds 2bn), making it Italy's biggest privatisation so far. It is the first sell-off under the new Italian government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, and provides an opportunity to test policy for the larger privatisations of Stet, the telecommunications holding company, Enel, the electricity generator, and Eni, the energy and chemicals group, likely to take place over the next year. The Ina price is just below the middle of the L2,200-L2,700 range set when the privatisation was launched a month ago. Ministers pressed for a higher price, but officials insisted that after a week of turbulence on Italian and world stock markets it would be more prudent to price the issue at the lower end of the range, in line with analysts' expectations. The Treasury, which owns 100 per cent of Ina, has imposed new rules for the sale, aimed at giving the smallest shareholders a voice on the board and limiting the ability of a few large investors to exercise effective control over the newly privatised company. It is selling 51 per cent of the insurance company, which claims a bigger share of the Italian life and non-life insurance market than any of its private-sector rivals. The Ina offer can run until the end of the week, but it could close as early as tomorrow night if demand is strong. Previous public offers of shares in state-owned financial institutions - IMI, Credito Italiano, and Banca Commerciale Italiana - have been oversubscribed and closed early. Trading in Ina shares will begin officially on July 6. Last Monday Italian equity prices fell nearly 4 per cent, forcing Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, to postpone its L1,500bn rights issue. The stock market recovered later in the week but investors are still nervous about the government's economic policy. However, officials say initial retail demand for shares in the company - particularly from existing policyholders, who will receive priority treatment - is strong. The international tranche of the shares is said to be three times covered by demand from institutions. Shares in other Italian insurers such as Generali and Ras slipped last week as investors adjusted portfolios to prepare for the Ina sale. Goldman Sachs and IMI of Italy are acting as global co-ordinators. Lex, Page 24</p>

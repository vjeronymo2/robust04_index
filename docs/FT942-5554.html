			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / International Company News: Murdoch's Fox network under scrutiny by FCC The Federal Communications Commission, the US government agency which oversees media industries, is re-examining Mr Rupert Murdoch's ownership of American television stations to determine whether this conforms with US laws restricting foreign ownership of broadcasting businesses. Mr Murdoch is himself a US citizen but his main corporate vehicle, News Corporation, is headquartered in Australia. The six wholly-owned stations were bought by Mr Murdoch in 1985 and form the core of the Fox television network he has built into a challenger to America's big three networks - ABC, CBS and NBC. US law restricts foreign ownership of broadcasting stations to 25 per cent. In order to comply with the rules and build his broadcasting empire, Mr Murdoch changed his citizenship from Australia to the US in the 1980s and ensured that he held 76 per cent of the voting rights in the company which owns Fox's broadcasting interests. News Corp holds 24 per cent of the votes. However, FCC officials are reviewing the case following a complaint by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which campaigns for minority businesses and is opposing an attempt by Fox to buy a Philadelphia television station. It emerged during the FCC review that News Corp holds more than 90 per cent of the broadcasting company's equity. News Corp yesterday confirmed that an FCC inquiry was under way, but said Mr Murdoch had clearly stated in 1985, when seeking FCC approval to buy the stations, that the funds for the acquisition would be supplied by News Corp through loans and capital contributions. Nothing material had changed since then. It said it was confident that the FCC review - which Fox had itself requested - would 'not result in any negative consequences' for Fox's ownership of broadcasting stations. The FCC has the power to order Fox to sell its stations, but the company has enjoyed good relations with the commission and observers think this outcome is unlikely. At worst, Mr Murdoch might be required to transfer control to another investment vehicle.</p>

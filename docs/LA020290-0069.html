			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DUFFY CHANGES CAMPAIGN-FUND RULES THAT HE MAY HAVE BROKEN  </P> <P> San Diego County Sheriff John Duffy and Assistant Sheriff Jack Drown accepted  thousands of dollars in campaign contributions last year from fellow members of  their department, apparently in conflict with a Sheriff's Department policy  prohibiting such contributions.  </P> <P> Duffy this week reversed the longstanding policy barring sheriff's candidates  from within the department from receiving political donations from sworn staff  members. He made the change on the eve of the deadline for candidates to file  their first round of financial disclosures.  </P> <P> In those disclosure forms, Duffy and Drown list numerous donations from  high-ranking members of the Sheriff's Department last year, including $250  contributions that Duffy and Drown gave each other.  </P> <P> The forms show that Drown collected three-fourths of his $3,650 in campaign  money from sworn staff members or their spouses, while Duffy received about 8%  of his $25,935 in donations from sworn deputies or their spouses.  </P> <P> Told of the contributions, other candidates for sheriff said Thursday it showed  collusion between Duffy and Drown. In December, Duffy announced he was pulling  out of the race and endorsed Drown.  </P> <P> The rival candidates contend that Duffy and Drown first ignored their own  written policy regarding campaign donations from department members, and then  reversed that procedure when they had to declare  </P> <P> the money on the campaign forms.  </P> <P> "It doesn't appear to be illegal," said ex-San Diego Police Chief Ray Hoobler,  one of the candidates in the June primary election for sheriff. "But the  conduct certainly is somewhat suspicious as far as a motive."  </P> <P> "I'm irritated for two reasons," said sheriff's Capt. Jim Roache, another  candidate. "I was given special instructions to comply with department policy  and did not accept or solicit any money from department employees. I have bent  over backwards not to involve department employees in this hotly contested  political battle."  </P> <P> Roache added that he has hired an attorney to research whether any campaign  laws were broken.  </P> <P> Despite repeated attempts, neither Duffy nor Drown could be reached for comment  Thursday. Nor did Janet Houts, the department's legal adviser, return several  phone calls.  </P> <P> Sgt. Bob Takeshta, a department spokesman, said he could not discuss in detail  the policy change because it was a political -- rather than a departmental --  matter.  </P> <P> But he did say it was his understanding that the switch was made only to  "clarify" what role sworn staff members can play in political fund raising and  to make sure their conduct is "in compliance with applicable government code  sections governing political activity."  </P> <P> Asked whether the policy was reversed to accommodate the money Duffy and Drown  had already received from members of the Sheriff's Department, Takeshta said:  </P> <P> "That's an unequivocal no. The change was based solely to clarify the rules,  and for no other reason."  </P> <P> Until Tuesday, the department's manual governing the "rules and conduct for  sworn members of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department" included this  provision:  </P> <P> "Officers are prohibitted from (any actions to) solicit or knowingly receive  from any other officer or employee of the county of San Diego any political  assessment, subscription or contribution."  </P> <P> Sheriff's officials could not say how long the policy had been in effect, but  one source said it had been a policy for more than 10 years.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, that provision of the policy manual was stricken and new language  was inserted, allowing sworn Sheriff's Department employees who are candidates  for political office to:  </P> <P> "Communicate through the mail or by other means requests for political funds or  contributions to a significant segment of the public which may include officers  or employees of the county."  </P> <P> "However," the replacement provision adds, "officers shall not solicit  political funds or contributions solely from employees of the county of San  Diego."  </P> <P> Takeshta said the change "was just to show that county employees can be  solicited for political support as long as they are included with others and  not targeted separately," he said. "And that's the reason why it was done."  </P> <P> Wednesday, the day after the policy was switched, was the deadline for  sheriff's candidates to file their first campaign finance disclosure forms. In  those forms, the candidates were required to list all significant contributions  they received in the six months between July 1 and last Dec. 31.  </P> <P> Duffy was a candidate for re-election through last fall and therefore was  required to file a disclosure form. He announced Dec. 11 that he was  withdrawing from the race, after intense media coverage about his management  style. On the same day that he told reporters he was quitting the race, Drown  announced his intention to run.  </P> <P> Drown's disclosure form states that he received $3,650 in contributions. That  amount includes $2,700 in 12 individual donations made by sworn members of the  Sheriff's Department or their spouses.  </P> <P> Those who gave Drown the maximum amount of $250 are Duffy and his wife, Linda;  Assistant Sheriff Richard W. Reed and his wife, Pamela; Capt. James Marmack,  who supervises the Vista jail; Lt. Alan Truitt; Sgt. Bill Southwell and his  wife, Susan; and Sgt. Debra Hanlon and her husband, John.  </P> <P> Lt. Ernest Klevesahl and Sgt. Frank Nunez gave $100 each to Drown.  </P> <P> Duffy, meanwhile, disclosed that he received $25,935 in donations. That amount  includes $2,000 in eight individual contributions made by sworn members of the  Sheriff's Department or their spouses.  </P> <P> Those contributors, all of whom gave the maximum donation of $250, are  Undersheriff Richard E. Sandberg; assistant sheriffs Drown, Reed and Charles K.  Wigginton; Capt. Alan Fulmer, the department's former chief spokesman who now  supervises the Vista station; and Lt. Liz Foster, who took Fulmer's job as  department spokesperson.  </P> <P> Duffy and his wife also contributed $250 each to his campaign, as did Janet  Houts, the sheriff's legal adviser, and her husband, attorney John Houts.  </P> <P> Roache said he was upset that Drown skirted the policy provisions regarding  money from staff members, while he as a sheriff's captain was forced to abide  by the code of conduct. He also suggested that the policy reversal -- timed on  the eve of the filing deadline -- indicated that Drown and Duffy were  attempting to cover their tracks.  </P> <P> "It's not a coincidence that the policy change was distributed to department  employees the day before the filing deadline," Roache said. "And obviously, up  until then, it appears Mr. Drown and Mr. Duffy both were violating that  policy."  </P> <P> Everett Bobbitt, a San Diego attorney who successfully sued Duffy to overturn  another department provision that had prohibited Roache from running for  sheriff, has been retained by Roache again, this time to research the legal  implications of how the money from within the Sheriff's Department was raised.  </P> <P> Bobbitt, who donated $250 to Roache's campaign, said he plans to lodge a  complaint with the County Board of Supervisors and also may file a lawsuit  challenging Drown's and Duffy's rights to retain that money.  </P> <P> Vince Jimno, a sheriff's candidate who is on leave from his job as police chief  in Escondido, said he believed it was simply a "policy of convenience" for  Duffy to change the provision regarding department employees and political  donations.  </P> <P> Jimno's disclosure form states that he raised $7,789, most of it from  individuals living or working in North County.  </P> <P> Roache reported contributions of $6,880, including donations from some  officials within the San Diego school system, where Roache serves as an elected  board member.  </P> <P> Hoobler's disclosure form had not been filed with the registrar of voters by  late Thursday afternoon. But the candidate said he raised a little more than  $10,000 during the filing period.  </P></p>

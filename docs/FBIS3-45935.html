In this connection, a  plan has been drafted and submitted to the State Council, and it  is expected to be officially approved and implemented this year.    The existing residential household system is the  "double-track structure" which has been practiced for several  decades. In fact it is a system under which rural household  status is distinguished from nonrural household status by the  criterion of whether one enjoys the privilege of being supplied  with commodity grain or not. This form of division has made it  extremely difficult for a household with rural resident status  to transfer to the nonrural category. A peasant can hardly have  his rural resident status changed even if he has been working in  a town for several decades. So he is not entitled to the  privileges and treatment of other urban residents with nonrural  resident status.    How is China going to do away with the constraints that the  existing residential household registration system imposes on  social evolution and social stability, in the wake of rapid  economic development? This question has aroused debate within  academic circles over the past few years, the focus being placed  on whether cities should open their doors wide to peasants and  residents of small towns. One view holds that in the wake of  urbanization and industrialization, it is necessary to provide a  fair environment to enable people to travel and choose  occupations freely. This can speed up the development process  on the one hand and, on the other, alleviate the uncomfortable  feeling on the part of peasants who do not have a sense of  belonging to the cities where they are living. Another view  holds that once the 800 million Chinese peasants are allowed to  move freely, it will inevitably cause a great urban population  explosion much more dreadful than what has already taken place  in Mexico city.    Since there are grounds for both views, the authorities  concerned, after rather long study, have finally adopted a  compromise that incorporates a gradual, progressive reform.  Under this program, the existing "double-track" residential  household registration system will be replaced by a new  registration system based on three population control  categories, namely, permanent residential household, temporary  residential household, and dependent residential household; the  conventional mode of identity verification by the residential  household registration book will be replaced by the identity  certifying system with the resident identity card as the  principal proof of identity; rural and nonrural categories will  be distinguished by domicile and occupation; and any  transference of residential household registration will be based  on consideration of the housing and living conditions of the  city concerned and subject to policy regulation and control.    Some attempts to reform the conventional residential  household registration system have been made earlier in many  localities, even in some counties in the suburbs of Beijing.  Some localities have begun selling urban household registration  quotas to peasants, some localities have introduced a "blue seal  household registration quota" system specially designed for  immigrants of the investment category, while some others have  introduced a "green card" system, and so on. All these  practices have been endorsed by the Beijing authorities.</p>

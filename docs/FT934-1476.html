			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / International Company News: Volvo shares hit record high Volvo's share price hit a record high yesterday as optimistic investors maintained a buying spree that has pushed the group's stock up smartly since it abruptly pulled out of a plan to merge with France's Renault two weeks ago. The most-traded B share closed yesterday at SKr524 (Dollars 62), up SKr15 from Thursday's close of SKr509 and 14 per cent ahead of its level of SKr458 just before the merger collapse was announced on December 2. The advance was even greater when taken against the price of SKr407 on November 25 when it appeared the merger would be approved by shareholders. Although stock market sentiment had for weeks favoured a breakdown of the merger, Volvo shares fell significantly in the days following the collapse, touching SKr435 on December 6. Many had already discounted the deal's failure and others were alarmed by the resignation statement of former chairman Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar. He predicted the end of an existing alliance with Renault and voiced doubts about Volvo's long-term ability to survive. In the last 10 days, however, the earlier judgment that Volvo will produce better earnings on its own than in league with Renault, where profits are sagging, has reasserted itself.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Imro pledges to review standards and procedures Imro, the self-regulatory body for the fund management industry, has committed itself to reviewing its standards, approach to monitoring and discipline procedures within the coming year. The proposals were set out yesterday in its regulatory plan for 1994-95. Publication of the plan makes Imro the first self-regulating organisation to meet this recommendation from the Large review of financial regulation. The change in the approach to monitoring will see Imro move to a system based on assessment of risk. 'High-risk' businesses and areas of greatest investor risk within those will be the focus of the most intense regulatory activity and the most frequent inspection visits. Mr Philip Thorpe, Imro chief executive, said the plans would mean a 12 per cent increase in costs in the year from spending in 1993-94, taking the budget to Pounds 12.8m. Most of the increase comes from a rise in the number of staff dealing with monitoring and enforcement. A further Pounds 2.75m will be paid in fees to the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulator. Among the other targets Imro has set itself for the coming year are the introduction of individual registration and closer co-operation with staff from SIB on collective investment schemes. Such specific projects will run alongside the continuing core objective of supervising its 1,150 members so as to provide effective investor protection. Imro also intends each quarter to publish statistical performance indicators covering areas such as membership applications and disciplinary investigations. A plan will be produced annually with a review of progress and new targets set for the year ahead. Mr Thorpe said he saw one benefit of the exercise as giving people a better idea of what regulators do. This would improve both transparency and help to reduce the prospects of unrealistic expectations.</p>

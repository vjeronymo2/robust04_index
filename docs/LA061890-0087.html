			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER;  </P> <P> HISTORICAL GROUP HONORS NEUGEBAUER  </P> <P> City Councilwoman Joy L. Neugebauer spent her 62nd birthday last November  watching crews move a 74-year-old red barn from its old location to the city's  new historical park three miles away.  </P> <P> It was the middle of the night, but Neugebauer said she wasn't about to miss an  event she had worked so hard to see take place.  </P> <P> As a result of her efforts, Neugebauer has been selected to receive an Award of  Merit from the Conference of California Historical Societies at a ceremony in  San Luis Obispo on June 22. The veteran councilwoman was nominated for the  award by members of the Westminster Historical Society.  </P> <P> In addition to being honored for saving the barn, which had stood on the corner  of Bolsa Avenue and Bushard Street since 1915, Neugebauer will also be honored  for her efforts in relocating and restoring the Midway City Women's Club  building last year. Both buildings are slated to be permanent fixtures at the  Leaora Blakey Historical Park at 8612 Westminster Blvd. The park eventually  will house a city museum.  </P> <P> "I'm pleased to be recognized and even more pleased to be nominated by members  of our local chapter," said Neugebauer, who is a candidate for Orange County  supervisor. "This was a team effort all the way." GREG HERNANDEZ  </P></p>

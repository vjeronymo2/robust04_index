			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / World Trade News: China signs deal with S Korea to develop airliner South Korean and China yesterday agreed to develop a 100-seat passenger aircraft by the end of the decade in the latest of several proposed Asian aerospace projects. The Dollars 1.5bn Sino-Korean project is meant to meet growing demand for regional airliners in Asia. Taiwan and Indonesia have already announced similar programmes. The aerospace agreement was signed during the first day of a visit by Chinese premier Li Peng to Seoul, following a memorandum of understanding reached in June. China and Korea will equally share between 70 per cent and 80 per cent in a joint venture to be formed next year. Western partners providing engine and other advanced technology would be given a 20 per cent share, while other Asian aviation companies, possibly from India and Indonesia, would be granted a 10 per cent stake. Samsung Aerospace was recently selected to head the project's Korean consortium, which also includes Korean Air, Daewoo Heavy Industries and Halla Shipbuilding &amp; Heavy Industries. Chinese participation is being led by Aviation Industries of China. The joint venture is expected to select the aircraft type and foreign technical partners by early next year. The aircraft programme has been promoted by the Korean government as one of the nation's main industrial goals over the next decade. However, Korean aerospace companies and airlines have privately expressed scepticism about the project because of the availability of similar and cheaper western aircraft. Korean officials argue that a domestic airliner is needed to reduce the country's dependence on imports of foreign aircraft and parts, which are expected to cost Dollars 3bn a year by 1997. The project's development target date of 1998 is also considered unrealistic by some analysts because of the lack of aerospace expertise, particularly in Korea. China is expected to provide most of the basic aerospace technology, while Korea's contribution will be mainly financing and production technology. But the Sino-Korean partners still disagree over which country will be responsible for final assembly of the aircraft. China is also understood to be interested in collaborating in a proposed project to develop a 70-100 seat regional aircraft with Japan in partnership with Boeing of the US. Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, China and Japan have all sought to expand their presence in the aerospace industry through increased collaboration with western airframe, aero-engine, components and systems manufacturers as well as through their own programmes. Western aerospace groups have also been keen to seek joint ventures with Asian partners to strengthen their presence in the growing regional market for commercial and defence equipment.</p>

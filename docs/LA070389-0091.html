			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> ABORTION FOES IN ORANGE COUNTY CELEBRATE SUPREME COURT RULING  </P> <P> As did their colleagues across the nation, anti-abortion activists in Orange  County exulted today over the U.S. Supreme Court's decision imposing tough new  restrictions on a woman's right to the procedure.  </P> <P> "We're pleased to see the court has taken a significant step toward the  protection of women from exploitation and their children from murder," said  Russell Neal, an Orange County spokesman for Southern California Operation  Rescue.  </P> <P> Although the court's decision on a Missouri case is not expected to have any  immediate effect locally, pro-choice advocates in the county lambasted the  verdict, calling it the first salvo in what promises to be a prolonged war over  the issue.  </P> <P> "It means we need to press our point a little harder, a little more vocally,"  said Margie Fites Seigle, executive director of Planned Parenthood of Orange  and San Bernardino Counties. "We will do that by encouraging pro-choice persons  to write to their legislators to let them know that reproductive rights should  remain a choice for all women in California."  </P></p>

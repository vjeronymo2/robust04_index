			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Bentsen predicts 2.5-3% growth US inflation is 'well in check' and economic performance is stable, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury secretary, told businessmen in Texas yesterday. He predicted growth at an annual rate of 2.5-3.0 per cent in the second half. Mr Bentsen's comments followed the publication of statistics showing lower than expected inflation and a narrowing of the merchandise trade deficit in August. Consumer prices were flat last month and up by 2.7 per cent in the year to September, according to Labour Department figures. Separate reports showed an unexpected decline in the trade deficit to Dollars 9.71bn (Pounds 6.43bn) in August against Dollars 10.4bn in July and an increase in industrial production of 0.2 per cent last month. The figures were better than most analysts had expected and indicated that the relatively sluggish, private sector-led US recovery is imposing few strains on the economy. On Thursday officials reported a zero increase in the core producer price index last month. The good news on inflation prompted further gains in bond and share prices on Wall Street as traders discounted the risk of a tightening of monetary policy in coming months. The decline in the trade deficit reflected a 3 per cent rise in exports to Dollars 38.2bn, which more than offset a 1 per cent rise in imports to Dollars 47.9bn. The increase in exports was led by a Dollars 707m increase in aircraft sales, a volatile item, but was seen as encouraging by analysts in view of sluggish trading conditions in many overseas markets. The trade deficit for the year to August was Dollars 76.8bn up sharply from Dollars 52.7bn last year, reflecting the US economic recovery. The 0.2 per cent increase in industrial production last month took the annual gain to 4.6 per cent. However the Federal Reserve revised down estimates of production increases in July and August to show gains of 0.2 per cent and 0.1 per cent respectively. For the third quarter, production is estimated to have risen at an annual rate of 1.8 per cent. The strongest sectors were business equipment and construction supplies.</p>

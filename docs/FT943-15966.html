			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Unemployment down in Germany: First fall in west for almost three years suggests faster recovery in labour market Seasonally adjusted unemployment in west Germany fell by 3,000 in June. It was the first drop since autumn 1991, suggesting a more rapid recovery than expected in the German labour market. The actual decline in Germany as a whole was 70,900, to 3.59m, with the largest fall in the east, where the total dropped by 42,800 to under 1.12m. The rate in the west was 8 per cent, down from 8.1 per cent; and in the east, 14.8 per cent, compared with 15.4 per cent in June. The figures were immediately welcomed by the government as proof that economic recovery is well under way. Chancellor Helmut Kohl told a conference of industrialists and trade unionists that he expected the economy to grow more quickly than the 1.5 per cent officially forecast at the start of the year. However, the relatively slow pace of economic recovery overall was confirmed by weaker industrial order figures in west Germany in May, and a downwards revision of the figures for April. What the figures do suggest is that domestic economic activity is beginning to recover, taking over from export demand. The provisional figures for industrial orders in May showed a fractional 0.1 per cent decline compared with April, which in turn was down 0.5 per cent against March, after the adjustment. Year-on-year, the May orders were up 8.1 per cent, nevertheless. The sharpest decrease month-on-month was in export orders, down 1.5 per cent, whereas domestic orders improved by 0.5 per cent, the federal statistics office said. Foreign orders have now been performing less well than domestic orders for the past two months, and capital goods, in particular, showed a clear improvement. On the other hand, the year-on-year figures still show a growth in export orders of 9.4 per cent, compared with just 2.1 per cent for domestic ones. In another clear sign that last year's very sharp recession has finished, the Ifo economic research institute published its forecast of investment plans, suggesting a marginal 1 per cent fall this year, compared with 20 per cent last year. The 1993 investment collapse was actually the sharpest recorded by the Munich-based institute since it began its investment survey of German industry in 1955. The researchers blamed it on the combination of an inflated investment level coinciding with German unification, and the switch by western enterprises to investing in the east since then. At the economic conference in Mr Kohl's office, the chancellor warned against any over-hasty satisfaction with the evidence of recovery, stressing in particular the problem of structural unemployment. He urged both employers and unions to concentrate on all possible means of job creation. The evidence of a real recovery in unemployment will certainly be welcomed by the governing coalition as useful ammunition for the general election in October. On the other hand, Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, is rumoured to be planning further change in unemployment benefit - restricting eligibility to just two years before jobless workers have to switch to a lower level of subsistence-related benefit. He refused to confirm or deny the plan yesterday, but the opposition Social Democrats are seeking to make maximum political mileage out of any such cuts which may emerge when the government publishes its draft 1995 budget next week.</p>

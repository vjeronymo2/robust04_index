			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Blocs on the horizon: The notion of an 'east Asian economic caucus' is gaining ground In Nineteen Eighty-four George Orwell imagined the world of the late-20th century divided into three blocs: Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia. Basically similar in their domestic totalitarian systems, they nonetheless flourished by depicting each other as deeply alien, hostile and threatening. At any given moment two of the blocs would be allied against the third, but every now and then the alliances would suddenly be reversed, preserving a rough but unstable balance. The actual late-20th century, whatever its other faults, has so far been mercifully unlike Orwell's vision. Yet the spectre of 'blocism' continues to haunt us. Time and again we are warned of the danger that, having disposed of the cold war, the industrialised world will now arrange itself into three great regional trading blocs, dominated by Japan, the European Union and the US; and that all other countries will have to attach themselves to one or other of these blocs if they are to survive econom-ically. The EU raised this spectre first. Its common external tariff, and its delegation of negotiating power in trade matters to a single, supranational authority, made it look a bit like a bloc. Plans for the single market, when first announced in the mid-1980s, prompted much talk of 'fortress Europe' in other parts of the world, even though what was involved was the removal of internal non-tariff barriers and few if any new barriers to external trade were erected. Now the North American Free Trade Agreement, even though it stops far short of a common market, let alone a political union, has aroused similar fears and suspicions in Asia. And of course the rest of us, well aware that east Asia is much the fastest expanding market in the world today, are anxiously on the look-out for signs that east Asia might be closed to us, with Japan seeking once again to turn it into a private hunting ground. The spectre loomed extra large in the closing stages of the Uruguay Round of the Gatt trade liberalisation talks, when mothers took to scaring their children with warnings that unless they took their free-trade medicine at bed-time they would wake up in a cold, unfriendly three-bloc world. Specially recalcitrant children had to be scared with creepy variations in the plot. Last November, for instance, C. Fred Bergsten, a leading US economist, told a European audience that they should realise the alternative to success in the Gatt talks was not a three- but a two-bloc world, with the US and Asia ganging up against the Europeans. Shortly before Mr Bergsten's warning, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, had delivered a similar message, reminding western Europe that it was 'no longer the dominant area of the world'. The main evidence for this proposition seemed to be that 'there is a lot of criticism coming from western Europe, but I don't see or hear it coming from Asia'. Mr Christopher should listen more carefully. There is a rising tide of criticism from Asia, not perhaps of his personal performance, but of the US and indeed of 'the west'. Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad is the best-known critic, but Mr Lee Kuan Yew, former prime minister of Singapore, is not far behind. Such leaders think that Asia now has more to teach the west, about virtues such as 'discipline, loyalty and diligence', than to learn from it about democracy or human rights. Mr Mahathir has for years been campaigning for an 'east Asian economic caucus', so far without much success: he was alone in his boycott of the recent Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in Seattle. Japan has firmly refused Mr Mahathir's invitations to take the lead in any kind of economic bloc. It is all the more interesting, therefore, to find that Mr Mahathir's ideas are taken seriously by Mr Ogura Kazuo, head of the economic affairs bureau in the Japanese foreign ministry, who last July called for 'a new concept of Asia', or 'Asian restoration'. This emerging regional consciousness is underpinned by a strong sense of economic achievement, and also by rapidly strengthening economic ties within the region. In a paper prepared for last weekend's UK-Japan 2000 Group conference, Mr Eiichi Matsumoto, a former vice-chairman of the Bank of Tokyo, points out that 'Japan is increasingly replacing the US as an absorber of Asian manufacturing products', while the fast-growing Asian countries themselves 'now mutually absorb their manufacturing products in an enhanced intra-regional trade'. Yet 'Asia' as a region is even less clearly defined than 'Europe'. It usually denotes the Pacific rim countries, inhabited by people with yellow or brown skin and a Confucian or Buddhist cultural heritage, overlaid in some cases with Christianity or Islam. South Korea, Japan, China, Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia are clearly core members, but in some contexts India and/or Australia can also be included. The formation of these countries into any kind of bloc remains highly implausible, and so long as they remain the world's most dynamic exporters they can have little interest in such an arrangement. What does seem likely is that Asians will be more prone to define themselves as such in political and cultural terms. Like Europeans since the 1960s and for much the same reason - a combination of economic success with an awkward feeling of political inferiority and cultural insecurity - they will seek, in schizophrenic fashion, both to 'stand up to' the US and to retain it as ally and trading partner.</p>

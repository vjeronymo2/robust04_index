			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ukraine comes out against recognizing the  Commonwealth of Independent States as a regional organization,  against recognizing the CIS as a subject of international law,  and against recognizing the right of the CIS to carry out  peace-making operations. Volodymyr Handohiy, acting charge  d'affaires of Ukraine's permanent mission at the United Nations  declared this at the UN General Assembly during the course of a  debate on a resolution on granting CIS the status of an observer  at the General Assembly. In particular he said: Ukraine joins  the consensus, as far as the given resolution is concerned, only  in the sense that the status of a CIS observer at the General  Assembly will be officially granted only to those community  countries that signed and ratified the Commonwealth charter and  became co-authors of the above draft resolution.</p>

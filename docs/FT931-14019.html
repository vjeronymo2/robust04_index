			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Investment trust savings fall INVESTMENT TRUST savings schemes last year showed their first annual fall in intake since records began in 1984. The total amount invested through the schemes was Pounds 115.5m, down from Pounds 119.5m in 1991. This was in spite of a strong fourth-quarter intake of Pounds 33.49m - the best quarterly figure since 1984. Lump sum investments accounted for most of the rise during the quarter, totalling Pounds 21.72m, an increase of 87 per cent on the third quarter. The Association of Investment Trust Companies attributed the year's fall to an exceptionally weak third quarter, when Pounds 23.5m was invested.</p>

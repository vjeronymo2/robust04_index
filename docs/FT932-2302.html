			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / New commitments to mortgages fall: House prices constant, say societies THE NUMBER of home buyers making commitments to new mortgages from building societies fell last month as further evidence emerged that the housing market recovery remains modest. The Building Societies Association published figures showing that net new commitments to mortgages fell 12 per cent in May to Pounds 2.78bn, from Pounds 3.18bn in April. The fall followed three consecutive monthly rises. The association also disclosed that its own index of house prices shows that prices remained constant in the first quarter of the year compared to the last quarter of last year, and were 6 per cent down on the first quarter of that year. Mr Adrian Coles, the association's director-general elect, said the figures indicated that the housing market was 'not taking off' but was nonetheless recovering from the 'very depressed' conditions of the last quarter of 1992. The figures do not include lending by banks or other mortgage lenders - although Abbey National is included in the house price index. Banks have been raising their share of mortgage lending over the past six months. Societies achieved a net inflow of retail funds from savers of Pounds 700m, a fall from April's Pounds 1.07bn but far higher than inflows in the first three months. Societies last year achieved a net inflow of only Pounds 295m for the whole year. Mr Coles said retail inflows had been 'surprisingly robust' in the year so far, in sdpite of fears of competition from National Savings and equity products. Societies have gained Pounds 2.5bn so far, compared with Pounds 657m for the same period last year. Mr Coles warned, however, that the forthcoming sale of British Telecom shares would 'severely distort' inflows in coming months as savers withdrew funds to buy shares. He said this effect would start to occur at the end of June. The house-price figures show that the heaviest falls between the first quarter of this year and the same period of 1992 occurred in Greater London (8 per cent), the south-east (9 per cent) and the south-west (11 per cent). The house price index - which is based on a value of 100 in 1985 - reached a peak of 201 in the third quarter of 1990 before falling. It rose marginally in the third quarter of last year before falling to 182.</p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Pacific Rim recovers after early falls POSITION squaring in advance of the weekend's Tokyo metropolitan assembly elections dominated activity, and share prices posted marginal declines in low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average fell 25.50 to 19,659.57 after a high of 19,755.45 and a low of 19,485.79. The Topix index of all first section stocks moved even more narrowly, falling 0.03 to 1,584.05 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.69 to 1,200.25. Most investors remained sidelined, while public fund managers supported the market against arbitrage selling. Volume totalled 260m shares against 250m. Gainers led losers by 522 to 468, with 164 issues remaining unchanged. Reports on the insolvency of Nikomart, an unlisted convenience store chain, prompted selling of supermarket chain operators. Teikoku Data Bank, a private credit research company, said Nikomart, whose debts totalled Y11.7bn, had been hit by excessive expansion. Jusco fell Y60 to Y1,890 and Seiyu lost Y40 to Y1,350. Mining issues, which were beneficiaries of the rise in gold prices, lost ground on profit-taking. Sumitomo Metal Mining, the most active issue of the day, plunged Y30 to Y1,000 and Mitsui Mining and Smelting fell Y14 to Y501. The oil sector was the strongest performer of the day, rising 1.08 per cent. Reports of a hike in wholesale oil prices encouraged some short-term investors, with Showa Shell Sekiyu up Y30 to Y1,050. The strong performance of Steven Spielberg's movie Jurassic Park in the US boosted Toho Y1,000 to Y20,000. The movie theatre operator will distribute the movie in Japan this summer. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 9.80 to 21,763.23 in volume of 18.5m shares. Roundup AFTERNOON recoveries after early falls were a pre-valent theme in the region. HONG KONG trimmed big early losses after news of some progress in the Sino-British talks. The Hang Seng index closing only 48.56 lower at 7,014.08, 2.6 per cent lower on the week, after sliding more than 134 points earlier. Turnover eased from HKDollars 4.78bn to HKDollars 4.24 bn. Trading focused on China related stocks or shell companies. KUALA LUMPUR also recovered, the KLSE composite index closing 7.14 higher at 708.80, 3.6 per cent lower on the week, after losing 26.15 or 3.7 pct to 675.51 in the morning. Malaysia has been one of the region's best performers this year, and analysts said that the market's sharp correction this week was healthy and would not disrupt its long-term uptrend. SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index closed 0.77 up at 1,771.67 after falling to an intra-day low of 1,721.97. Brokers said that falls in Malaysian shares over the counter had been far greater than in Singapore blue chips. Volume rose from 175.1m shares to 300.5m. NEW ZEALAND saw a sharp rise in Telecom to a record high as the NZSE-40 index rose 14.15 to 1,655.29. Telecom rose 8 cents to a recond high of Dollars 3.10. Brokers said it was well bid in the US overnight but were unable to explain why it rose so far. TAIWAN continued its technical rebound, the weighted index ending 50.11 or 1.2 per cent up at 4,182.28, just 0.8 per cent up on the week, as turnover expanded from TDollars 16.8bn to TDollars 20.2 billion. Banking stocks attracted strong buying interest, the financial sector sub-index ending 2.7 per cent higher on the day, with First Commercial Bank surging TDollars 6 to TDollars 153 and Hua Nan rising TDollars 5.50 to TDollars 142. BOMBAY's BSE index closed with a decline of 23.84 at 2,203.96, 0.5 per cent lower on the week. Brokers said that the volume of trade was limited, investors preferring to watch and wait as a fresh round of speculation began over the government's survival.</p>

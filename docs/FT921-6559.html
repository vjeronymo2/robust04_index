			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / International Company News: KLM and BA act on BFr2bn Sabena debt BRITISH AIRWAYS and KLM, the Dutch airline, have started legal proceedings in the Belgian courts over BFr1bn (Dollars 29.4m) of debts owed to each of them by Sabena, the Belgian state-owned carrier. The cash was due to be repayed at the end of 1991, since when talks between the three airlines over the timing of the cash transfer have run into the sand. 'We were no longer able to get a real answer from Sabena, so we went to court,' said KLM yesterday. BA said the action was 'to protect its position', but that talks were nevertheless continuing. KLM and BA said they and Sabena would appear before a judge in Brussels on March 5 for a preliminary hearing. Sabena said it had not been formally notified about the BA/KLM action, but that BA and KLM had said they intended to lodge a legal complaint. It blamed its failure to pay on delays to a separate tie-up with Air France. That deal, which would probably involve a cash injection of about BFr6bn, was frozen when the Belgian government collapsed last October. It also argued that the deal included a clause imposing interest charges on the loan at 8 per cent from the beginning of 1992. However, KLM replied that an extension to the loan was only allowed if all three airlines agreed to it, while BA said it had not received any interest payments. BA and KLM invested the money as a prelude to taking a 40 per cent stake between them in a new operation, Sabena World Airways, intended as a Brussels-based operation flying to 75 European cities. The plan was scrapped in December 1990 and the investment converted into a loan. The European Commission confirmed yesterday it had imposed a fine of Ecu750,000 (Dollars 604,838) on Aer Lingus, the Irish airline, for refusing to grant reciprocal ticketing rights to British Midland, the UK carrier. It said Aer Lingus had abused its dominance of the London-Dublin route.</p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / International Company News: Akzo in merger talks with Nobel AKZO, the Dutch chemicals group, is holding merger talks with Nobel Industries of Sweden. It plans to give details of their progress on Monday. The Dutch company, which is by far the larger of the two European chemicals companies, said yesterday morning that the talks 'may or may not lead to the announcement of a merger'. Last night, it said it would be holding a press conference in Amsterdam on Monday. Analysts said it was not yet clear whether Akzo was interested in acquiring parts or all of Nobel, a speciality chemicals producer which also has high-technology and medical activities. They said Akzo would probably be most keen to acquire Nobel's paints/adhesives and industrial coatings divisions, which last year accounted for nearly one-third of Nobel's group sales of SKr21.5bn (Dollars 2.7bn). It may be less interested in Nobel's high-technology division, Spectra-Physics. Akzo, which has annual sales of Fl 16.9bn (Dollars 8.9bn), is active in chemicals, coatings, fibres and pharmaceuticals. The companies were forced to disclose the talks after Swedish media reported on Wednesday evening and Thursday morning that Akzo may be seeking to acquire certain Nobel businesses. Akzo's shares rose strongly on the news to close at a record Fl 199.50, ex its Fl 1.50 interim dividend. Yesterday's gains come on top of a Fl 13.30 surge on Wednesday following Akzo's release of better-than-expected figures for the third quarter. Nobel's shares were suspended on the Stockholm Stock Exchange at SKr22 each on Tuesday, when the group's market capitalisation amounted to SKr10.4bn. Nobel is 61.4 per cent owned by Securum, a special unit set up to house the problem credits of Nordbanken. It had to be rescued by the bank after being threatened with bankruptcy in 1991 following the collapse of Gamlestaden, a finance company in which it had a 48 per cent stake. The group has been through significant restructuring culminating in the sale of its defence electronics interests to Celsius Industries for SKr1.55bn earlier this year. Of Akzo's four main businesses, the fibres sector is the only one operating at a loss. In recent years Akzo has pruned its fibre activities and focused on bolstering its fast-growing pharmaceuticals business. Nobel is near to finalising a deal to buy Akzo's paper chemicals operations, which have annual sales of SKr350m. This is a separate deal, underway before yesterday's announcement.</p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Markets: A somewhat sickly sector - The Bottom Line THE BEST way to make the chief executive of a drugs company laugh is to tell him his industry is immune from recession. Only 18 months ago he would have politely agreed. Recessionary clouds have gathered over the drugs sector quickly. Analysts' attention has been concentrated on the US, the world's largest single market. American healthcare cost Dollars 768bn last year  - equivalent to 14 per cent of GNP. The Clinton administration can no longer afford its portion of the bill. It is preparing reforms and the profitable pharmaceuticals industry is sitting in the cross-hair of its sights. The trigger is expected to pulled in September when the programme is announced. At the same time, the US customer-base for medicines is changing rapidly. Large bulk-buyers of health are taking an ever-greater share of the market - up from 22 per cent of the non-hospital drugs market in 1987 to 35 per cent last year. Worse still, they are negotiating ever-greater discounts - up from 10 per cent in 1987 to 25 per cent in 1992, according to analysts at Lehman Brothers. The US drugs market, long-used to double-digit growth, expanded at only 3 per cent during the first five months. The reaction of the financial markets has been brutal. Merck, the world's biggest pharmaceuticals company, has dropped 40 per cent since January 1992. Glaxo, Europe's largest drugs group, has fallen by a similar amount. But while eyes have been watching the clouds on the western side of the Atlantic, they may have missed the storms brewing in Europe. Some US drugs analysts have viewed Europe as a side-show. But Europe is a bigger market than America. IMS International, the market research group, estimates drugs sales in European pharmacies during the first five months this year were Dollars 19bn, compared with Dollars 18bn in the US. Europe, too, is being swept by healthcare reform. The reforms, though less dramatic, are nevertheless insidiously undermining results of both US and European groups. The reforms have hit hardest in Germany, the world's third biggest single-country market after the US and Japan last year. IMS International estimates that during the first six months of 1992 the market was growing at about 10 per cent (Eastern Germany at 16 per cent and Western Germany at 9 per cent). During the first five months this year, it has collapsed 11 per cent. Zeneca, ICI's former bioscience subsidiary, estimates its German sales for the first six months were down 18 per cent, while SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare group, believes its sales were down 9 per cent. Meanwhile, Italian reforms are also having an impact. IMS estimates the market grew 10 per cent during the first six months last year. This year, during the first five months, it fell 1.8 per cent. As a result, the European market, expanding at 10 per cent during the six months to June in 1992, registered growth of only 0.9 per cent during the first five months this year. Worse is to come. Jan Leschly, SmithKline Beecham's head of pharmaceuticals and group chief executive designate, said: 'I'm not optimistic about Germany and Italy for the full year. And there's no doubt that in France, the UK and Spain we will see cost-containment measures introduced in the near future.' Given the poor outlook in the US and Europe, it may be too early to call the turn for drugs sector. Some companies are riding out the storm. Those armed with new, innovative products capable of generating volume growth, are prospering. Take Roche of Switzerland, whose shares have risen from SFr3,001 in September 1990 to a peak of SFr8,650 this month. Astra, the Swedish company, has also held on well in spite of being hit by the German reforms. Its shares have risen from a low of SKr26 in 1989 to SKr142 this week. The lesson is that although pharmaceuticals stocks used to be difficult to differentiate, they must now be picked with care. That may bring a smile back to the faces of some - but not all - pharmaceutical company chief executives.</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Hot, hot, hot. It must be Chile - The wine trade's latest love affair if you happen to be a British wine merchant that is. Every few years the traditional British wine trade falls collectively in love with a 'new' wine region and this seems to be Chile's year. (Even though Chilean viticulture is more than two centuries older than California's or Australia's) Such is the price of a flight to Santiago that most wine merchants have to rely on their traditional buying method: a wine trade tasting. At last month's showcase of 28 Chilean wineries' wares in London, merchants from all over Britain were slurping and spitting, all trying to decide between San This and Santa That. Brand differentiation, like record-keeping and ampelography (vine variety identification), seems to be a relatively unfamiliar concept to Chileans, and exporting wineries include not just San Pedro but Santas Adela, Carolina, Emiliana, Helena, Ines, Monica and Rita. Until recently Chile has concentrated its wine export efforts northwards, and Chilean Cabernet, Chardonnay and Sauvignon are regarded in the US as a handy cheap alternative to the domestic produce of California. Indeed, according to one of New York's most famous wine merchants, the reason Americans have been so slow to cotton on to the value on offer in southern France is because they have ready access to the easier-to-understand Chilean varietals - no need to grasp such geographical concepts as Corbieres and Minervois. It is true that Chilean wine comes in basically three flavours - Cabernet, Chardonnay and Sauvignon - and this may well be an advantage in the mass market, but it does illustrate the limitations of the country as a wine producer. Of its 66,000 hectares of vineyard, more than half are still planted with the very ordinary Pais and Muscat of Alexandria vines. In spite of the admirable decision in the late 1980s to give Chile's wine industry export credibility, involving Pounds 67m invested in more suitable vineyards and modern equipment, there is still much work to be done. For the moment Chile produces a plethora of perm-a-Santa Cabernet, mainly from the Maipo region, which retails between Pounds 3.50 and Pounds 6 a bottle and is usually perfectly respectable with lots of obvious fruit as it hits the palate. But there is rarely much distinction or structure (oak ageing is another new science), and many of the wines seem to share a bloody, slightly salty character. Most producers are well aware of the need to demonstrate that Chile can produce truly exciting red wine, albeit in small, top-of-the-market quantities. Santa Rita, one of the more dynamic producers, has developed its beautiful Casa Real label for expressly this purpose, and it is getting better (and more expensive) with every vintage. Dedicated followers of wine fashion should certainly try a bottle of Casa Real, although at Pounds 11 to Pounds 13, the 1990 which should reach Harrods, Bibendum and Oddbins by the end of November, is probably less good value than Santa Rita's basic 120 range of unoaked reds at Pounds 4 to Pounds 5. They should also try Montes Alpha Cabernet Sauvignon 1989 which is another creditable effort likely to appeal to palates reared on claret, and is available at about Pounds 7.99 from Majestic, Oddbins, selected Tesco and Victoria Wine, Lay &amp; Wheeler of Colchester, Terry Platt of Llandudno, Playford of Thirsk, Noel Young of Trumpington, Euro World of Glasgow and Shaws of Beaumaris. Concha y Toro's Don Melchor is another ambitious Chilean Cabernet. For a straightforward, well-made, young Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon, the Segu Olle Caliboro 1992 is good value at about Pounds 4 from Augustus Barnet. Chile has made rapid progress in white wine-making recently, however. The 1993s, which should be in the UK before Christmas, show real finesse in some cases (although the Montes Sauvignon 1993 made by Hugh Ryman is one of his less concentrated efforts). An important ingredient here is fruit from Casablanca, the new, ultra-cool, coastal region that proved itself so cool that the 1992 vintage was substantially destroyed by frost. The most bravura performance is from roving winemaker Ignacio Recabarren. His 1993 whites, under the confusing Vina Casablanca label, will be fine value once they have crossed the Atlantic. The white label versions are made from fruit bought in from the Central Valley, while Casablanca Valley wines are made exclusively from (young) Casablanca fruit. The white label Sauvignon Blanc 1993 will be Pounds 4.99 from Oddbins from late November, and about Pounds 5.99 from Wine Rack at the end of this month. Recabarren calls it his 'Marlborough style', a reference to his stint in New Zealand where he learnt to blend the produce of shaded and unshaded vine rows, adding a dash of over-ripe grapes, to produce a Chilean answer to Cloudy Bay. The Casablanca Valley Sauvignon 1993 at Pounds 5.99 from Oddbins from November, is more austere, more au Sancerre perhaps, and is a worthy reflection of what Sauvignon can do if yields are restricted, with that faint suggestion of Riesling in its combination of strong aroma and piercing acidity. The 1992 Casablanca Valley Chardonnay is a high tech wine that has been snapped up by Sainsbury who expect to be selling it exclusively, in their 35 biggest stores, by Christmas for Pounds 7.99. The much more delicate 1993 vintage should be worth waiting for chez Oddbins at Pounds 6.99. Recabarren is also involved in the Vina Porta label. Chile is likely to produce better and better Cabernet, Sauvignon and Chardonnay during the vintages to come, but it is difficult to see how it will establish a definitively Chilean style of wine along the lines of California's Zinfandel or Australia's Shiraz. Over the Andes in Argentina, on the other hand, there is a rich mix of grape varieties reflecting Spanish, Italian and French influences. Some of the most exciting South American reds I have tasted this year were made in Argentina: either the Weinert wines from John Armit of London W11 (071-727 6846) or those of Bodegas Norton. Berkmann Wine Cellars, of London N7 (071-609-4711) is the importer finding enormous difficulty in persuading wine merchants to take advantage of powerful, characterful, juicy Norton reds labelled Sangiovese, Barbera, Merlot and Malbec. (Except Davisons which has them at Pounds 5 to Pounds 6 a bottle). Trouble is, the wine trade has decided that Chile is The Thing this year.</p>

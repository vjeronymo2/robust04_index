			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Japan to step up spending on LCDs TWO leading Japanese manufacturers of liquid crystal displays (LCDs) intend to invest a total of Y160bn (Pounds 950m) over the next three years in moves that could further widen the lead of Japanese LCD manufacturers over their western competitors. Sharp plans to invest Y80bn to expand its thin-film transistor plant in Nara prefecture in the coming fiscal year, modernise a separate plant in Nara and set up a plant in southern Japan which would begin production in 1995. NEC, which is building a plant in Kagoshima, southern Japan, is investing Y80bn in setting up a new thin-film transistor manufacturing plant, among other things. Total investment by the company since 1989 would rise to Y100bn by 1996, it said. Sharp and NEC are expanding their LCD manufacturing capacity despite the recession in the hope they can maintain leadership in a market which is expected to grow to Y1,000bn by the next decade. LCDs are used increasingly in portable computers, camcorders, car navigation systems, electronic diaries and other communication devices. The industry believes that with the growth in personal communication devices, such as Apple's personal digital assistant which is scheduled for launch this year, demand for LCDs will increase. US and Europe have been left behind in the race to capture one of the largest growth areas in electronics and western companies are dependent on Japan for LCD supplies. Philips, the Dutch electronics group, has joined Thomson and Sagem of France in an LCD joint venture plant in an attempt to break into the market. Philips already has a pilot plant in its home country. But LCD technology requires many years of manufacturing experience and the Europeans are likely to take some time to catch up.</p>

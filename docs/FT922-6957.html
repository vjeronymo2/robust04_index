			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Miller hit by write-down of Pounds 6.5m Pre-tax profits of Miller Group, one of the UK's biggest privately-owned construction companies, tumbled from Pounds 10.75m to just Pounds 537,000 in 1991 as the recession continued to hit property values. The figures were struck after an exceptional provision of Pounds 6.45m arising from land and property write-downs and the closure of a specialist subsidiary. This followed an exceptional provision of Pounds 3.5m in 1990. The group has interests in civil engineering, general construction, mining property development and housebuilding. It recently appointed Mr David Cawthra as chief executive to assist with its expansion plans. Mr Cawthra was previously chief executive of Balfour Beatty, the construction arm of BICC the large engineering group. Turnover of Miller last year was virtually static at Pounds 238.03m against Pounds 235.38m. After tax of Pounds 210,000 (Pounds 4.16m) and dividends the group suffered an overall loss of Pounds 314,000 (Pounds 5.91m profit). Mr James Miller, chairman, stressed the strength of the company's balance sheet.</p>

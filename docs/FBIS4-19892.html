			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has declared that  according to the latest reports, a cease-fire was secured in  Gorazde last night and the Serbs agreed to withdraw as of this  morning. Cetin added that all Serbian forces are expected to  withdraw from Gorazde by noon today. Cetin made this statement  at Ankara's Esenboga Airport before leaving for talks in  Azerbaijan.    In reply to a reporter's question on the cessation of  Serbian  attacks against Gorazde in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cetin remarked  that UN peacekeeping forces entered Gorazde in order to be  stationed between the city and the Serbian forces, which will  withdraw from the city. According to the latest reports  concerning Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cetin announced, positive  developments are taking place in Gorazde and therefore the UN  secretary general's special representative does not favor a NATO  attack at this stage. He added: Consequently, we are not  expecting an attack at this moment, but, I would like to repeat  that the Serbs could always be expected to change their minds  and act differently.    Assessing the recent NATO decision aimed at putting an end  to  the Serbian attacks on Gorazde, Cetin declared that this is a  very important decision which does not contain any loopholes.  Pointing out that the decision covers all safe havens, Cetin  noted that according to the decision, the NATO Council will not  have to adopt another decision in the event of a possible  Serbian attack against the other four safe areas outside  Sarajevo and Gorazde. I hope this determination on the part of  NATO will constitute a new important step taken toward a just  and realistic peace, the foreign minister stated.    In his statement, Cetin stressed that Turkey has always  supported Azerbaijan. His visit to Azerbaijan aims at  demonstrating once more Turkey's support, Cetin remarked. He  will return to Turkey tonight.</p>

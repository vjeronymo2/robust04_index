			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: BSM turns in Pounds 2.2m and pays 2.15p maiden interim BSM, the UK driving instruction company which was floated last October, yesterday announced a maiden interim dividend of 2.15p, compared with a pro forma 1.93p. Pre-tax profits for the six months to July 1 were Pounds 2.23m, compared with a previous loss of Pounds 144,000 after payment of Pounds 2.21m of interest on debt incurred in its management buy-out. Earnings per share were 5.9p, compared with a 6.3p loss. Operating profits on continuing operations were up 6 per cent from Pounds 2.23m to Pounds 2.37m. Total turnover increased from Pounds 11.8m to Pounds 12.7m. The latest figure included Pounds 1.12m from discontinued operations, compared with Pounds 724,000 previously. In July, BSM closed its MCR accident repair centre at Leamington Spa with a loss of Pounds 168,000. Mr Paul Massey, chief executive, said that while the core market of teaching learner drivers had been 'less than easy,' the group had finished the half with a higher number of instructors and pupils. 'Overall, the company is in a very healthy position.' In the past 12 months the number of people applying for a provisional driving licence fell by 1.6 per cent, while BSM increased its business by 1.7 per cent. The group, which now claims to have 15 1/2 per cent market share, has also pushed through a 2 1/2 per cent increase in prices. It has also identified four ways of increasing its customer base. Next month it will launch a national scheme for introducing school-pupils to driving; it is continuing discussions with insurance companies with a view to reduced premiums for newly qualified drivers who undergo further training; it has started a scheme for teaching disabled people to drive; and it is continuing to expand its Qualified Driver Training division, aimed at company car drivers.</p>

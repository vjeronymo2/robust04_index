			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / New Mexican regime to follow old economic programme: Zedillo will honour pact with business and labour The incoming Mexican government headed by Mr Ernesto Zedillo plans to follow a conservative economic programme next year, to reduce inflation to 4 per cent by maintaining the present exchange rate policy and running a balanced budget. The economic strategy was announced over the weekend as the current government renewed the annual pact with business and labour unions that sets economic policy for the next calender year. The pact was drawn up after long consultations with Mr Zedillo's campaign team, who say they are in full agreement with the accord, and intend to comply with it. Uncertainty over renewal of the pact had led to recent volatility in Mexico's money and foreign exchange markets, with speculation that Mr Zedillo's administration would push for a more expansive fiscal policy and faster depreciation of the currency against the dollar from the current rate of 5 per cent a year, to boost economic growth. Until rumours of the pact renewal reached the market on Friday, the peso was trading at 3.40 to the US dollar, the top of its permitted band. 'The signal of all this is that stability won,' said a senior government official involved in negotiations over the pact. Mr Zedillo, a former central banker known for his aversion to fiscal deficits, formally takes office on December 1, when he will have the opportunity to put some finishing touches to the plan. The agreement was signed by the newly independent central bank, whose credit operations will be directed to achieving the inflation target of 4 per cent next year. An official said the central bank's pledge, which could lead to higher interest rates if inflation did not fall from current level of about 7 per cent, was the 'anchor' of the programme. The Finance Ministry predicted that economic growth would rise to 3.6 per cent in the second half of this year, industrial sector growth to 4.9 per cent, and fixed gross investment by about 8 per cent. The unexpectedly strong economic recovery influenced the decision to push for stability rather than economic growth, according to officials. The pact aims for economic growth of about 4 per cent for next year. The pact allows for an increase in the minimum wage of 4 per cent plus the average productivity growth in the economy. The lowest-paid workers will have their take-home pay boosted by another 3 per cent. About 7 per cent of Mexican workers earn the minimum wage, although the salary is used to set prices and wages for other better-paid workers. Unions agreed - under some pressure - to limit contractual wage increases to 4 per cent plus bonuses based on productivity increases achieved at the plant level. With inflation this year expected to be close to 7 per cent, and many sceptical that the government will meet its 4 per cent inflation target, some union representatives complained their workers would be taking real wage cuts. The plan also provides for some modest measures to stimulate investment, as Mr Zedillo had promised on the campaign trail. The measures include: a reduction in the tax on assets for unprofitable companies from 2 to 1.8 per cent; a four-year exemption from the tax for new investments; a faster depreciation allowance for investment in training and anti-pollution equipment; and an increase in the number of companies that can pay taxes on a quarterly basis. In addition, the incoming government promised to put money raised from future privatisations into a special fund to stimulate private infrastructure spending.</p>

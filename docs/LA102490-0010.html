			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> UCLA STAR TO SPEAK AT ANTI-DRUG RALLY  </P> <P> UCLA basketball star Don McLean will be one of several guest speakers at an  anti-drug rally scheduled tonight at Simi Valley High School's Bob Jacob  Memorial Stadium, school district officials said.  </P> <P> The community rally, which will begin at 6:30 p.m, is part of Red Ribbon Week,  a national program designed to encourage students to stay off drugs and  alcohol, said Ellen Lee, district consultant for curriculum and instruction.  </P> <P> Lee said the purpose of the rally is to get the community more involved in the  anti-drug crusade.  </P> <P> "To establish a drug-free community is not something that the schools alone can  do," Lee said. "We invite the community to join us in that effort."  </P> <P> In addition to McLean, the 90-minute program will feature speeches by Mayor  Greg Stratton, interim Supt. Cathi Vogel and Simi Valley Police Chief Lindsey  (Paul) Miller. Students will provide the program's entertainment, which will  include dancing, singing and comedy acts, Lee said.  </P> <P> McLean, a former Simi Valley High School basketball star who helped lead his  team to a Southern Section title in 1988, was asked to speak to the students  because of the exemplary life he has led.  </P> <P> McLean "has had a strong, healthy lifestyle," Lee said. "We want to point that  out. We want young students to look to him as a role model." CARLOS V. LOZANO  </P></p>

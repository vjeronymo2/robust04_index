			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Receiver loses insolvency licence The former receiver to Chelsea Football &amp; Athletic Club, the liquidated company now subject to an Official Receivers' inquiry, has had his insolvency licence withdrawn. Mr John Papi, a London-based practitioner, has been asked by the Insolvency Practitioners' Association, the regulatory body, to return his licence following a disciplinary hearing concluded last month. Mr Malcolm London, a partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand and president of the association, confirmed yesterday that he had written requesting Mr Papi's licence and asking him to reassign all his existing work to other practitioners. After an investigation lasting several months, the association ruled early last month that Mr Papi should be prevented from acting as an insolvency practitioner and ordered him to pay Pounds 8,000. Mr Papi, who was under investigation on a series of alleged regulatory breaches, had one month to appeal. This period has lapsed. It also emerged yesterday that he faces a bankruptcy petition for several thousand pounds in the name of Manches, a firm of solicitors. A hearing in the High Court is scheduled for June 28. The Insolvency Practitioners' Association and a number of other creditors are also pursuing Mr Papi for outstanding sums. Mr Keith Goodman, a partner at accountants Leonard Curtis, who is receiver to Frank Dale &amp; Stepsons, a franchiser of Rolls-Royces and Bentleys, confirmed that he was seeking Pounds 15,000 from Mr Papi for unpaid servicing bills on several cars. Mr Papi, who was unavailable for comment yesterday, previously had his licence suspended on disciplinary grounds for six months in 1990.</p>

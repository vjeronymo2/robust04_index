			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRICE IS NAMED CO-CEO TO EASE FHP TRANSITION  </P> <P> As a step in the transition of leadership, FHP International Corp. on Wednesday  named Chief Operating Officer Wescott W. Price III to the additional position  of co-chief executive officer, effective by July 1.  </P> <P> The Fountain Valley-based company, which operates a health maintenance  organization, said that Price will share the CEO's job with founder and  chairman L. Robert Gumbiner until mid-November. Price will then become the  firm's sole chief executive.  </P> <P> The 67-year-old Gumbiner plans to retire from day-to-day operations but will  remain as chairman of FHP International and its operating subsidiary, FHP Inc.  He will also serve as a consultant to the company, which he founded in 1961.  </P> <P> Larry Selwitz, a health-care analyst at Cruttenden &amp; Co. in Newport Beach,  said the creation of a co-chief executive position is a mechanism for an  orderly transition in FHP's management. He said the company has been grooming  Price for the position.  </P> <P> Gumbiner "hasn't been involved in the day-to-day operations for some time now,"  Selwitz said. "He has been more involved in (corporate) strategy."  </P> <P> Price, 50, joined FHP in 1981 as a senior vice president. In 1987, he was named  to succeed Gumbiner as president and chief operating officer of FHP Inc. and  was appointed chairman of the company's executive management committee.  </P> <P> In 1985, Gumbiner, who is FHP's largest shareholder with an 11.7% stake, led an  18-member employee group that acquired the firm after it had been converted  from a nonprofit to a for-profit concern. In 1986, the new owners took the  company public.  </P> <P> FHP's revenue has jumped from $500,000 in its first year in business to nearly  $700 million for its fiscal year that ended June 30, 1989. FHP has 500,000  members, 7,000 employees, and 45 medical facilities.  </P> <P> FHP EXECUTIVES TO SHARE TOP JOB  </P> <P> L.

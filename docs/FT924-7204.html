			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Survey of Turkish Finance, Investment and Industry (9): Aid plan to link new republics / Telecommunications - the Soviet collapse presents an opportunity IF THE central Asian heads of state attending last month's Ankara summit were able to get a line home, then they only have one organisation to thank for the service. In the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union, PTT, Turkey's state-run telecommunications company, is embarked on an ambitious project to join these former soviet republics with the Turkish telephone network; and, through Turkey's automatic transit system, to provide a communication link-up with 198 countries in Europe and beyond. Officials are keen to stress this is an aid project, funded by the Turkish government budget, to help set up a basic telecommunications infrastructure. But the plan is a daring one, 'gifting' technology today in the hope of long-term commercial gain tomorrow. It is one of a number of government projects now under way, to cement the growing political and economic ties between Turkey and its long-separated Turkish-speaking neighbours. Renting space from Intelsat, and beaming a two-way transmission from dish antennae in each of the countries to an earth station in Turkey, the PTT has set out to satisfy the most urgent needs of government offices, embassies, businesses and hotels. The first stage, a satellite link with the digital exchange in Azerbaijan, was inaugurated on May 3 this year. Kazakhstan is already in operation. Kygyzstan should be up and running next month. Turkey's state telecom corporation will supply coin boxes, telex facilities and fax machines. Meanwhile, the country's private phone companies are installing public exchanges. Netas, a former state-owned company, now a joint venture with Northern Telcom of Canada, has installed its DMS switching system in Kazakhstan; while Teletas, part owned by Alcatel of France, is supplying its System 12 to Uzbekistan and Kygyzstan. Initially, the PTT is supplying some 2,500 lines to each republic with the ability to increase capacity to 30,000 lines. In addition, local trunk lines within each country are being installed. Using the same system, Ankara is also beaming Turkish state television, and hopes to take their programmes in exchange. The government is footing the bill. Mr Cengiz Anik, head of the international division at PTT, estimates the cost of what is in essence a turnkey project at around Dollars 20-25m. The Central Asian link-up is just one of a number of projects now being handled by PTT's international relations division - 'PTT's window on the world,' as Mr Anik calls it. Through the Sarp gate, there is now a cable link with Tiblisi, which means Georgia's telecom authority can tap into Turkey's international gateway switching system to transmit to Europe and beyond. The PTT is also doing its bit to end the isolation of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, still only formally recognised by Turkey and Bulgaria. Mr Anik says 60 lines now reach the capital, Skopje, through a 'terrestrial' or land telecommunications link from Sofia, the Bulgarian capital. Through the Macedonia connection, Turkey is also able to communicate directly with Albania, which in turn is linked to Italy and the European mainland. The operations are apparently quite profitable. 'We expect to make Dollars 150m from the division this year,' says Mr Anik. Taking their lead from PTT, Turkey's private telecom groups are venturing where others fear to tread. Even before the final break-up of the Soviet Union, Netas had signed a Dollars 20m contract with Azerbaijan to supply digital switching systems for public exchanges, as well as the smaller Dicle rural exchange. The deal envisages setting up a joint venture to manufacture the Dicle system with the Azeri state telecom company. Mr Tanju Argun, the company chairman, says the Netas DMS family is the first digital switch to be installed in the former Soviet Union. Netas has had to be very flexible on payment negotiations. Indeed, the company is understood to be taking payment in the form of aluminium and other resources under barter arrangements. Netas believes it has a product to match the market. The DRX-4 or Dicle rural exchange comprises 512 lines, and is ideal for village-size communities. The robust nature of the hardware means it is well suited to hard geographic conditions. 'The switch is designed by customer input, not a technology-driven product,' says Mr Argun. The system, for example, is able to work in temperatures ranging from 0 to 50 degrees C, compared with 35 degrees for a normal system, and at altitudes of of up to 3000m. It is easy to install. It comprises what the technicians call a 'fully distributed architecture, built on models and groups'. The great beauty of the system is that the design means a local failure will have little impact on other subscribers. 'Its the easiest thing in the world to have two people talking. The much more difficult part is the maintenance and administration,' says Mr Suat Baysan, of Netas's research department. He estimates that, of the total software costs, 30 per cent is devoted to call processing and the rest tied up with administrative issues like billing. Before the Soviet collapse, Netas had been in discussion with officials at the Leningrad Institute of Technology, trying to unravel some of the problems. 'But you can't just put an exchange there and assume it will work. Every state has different signalling systems,' says Mr Baysan. 'Its like a museum,' says Mr Argun, the Netas chairman. 'There are all types of products. And its going to take a huge R &amp; D requirement to interface some of the products.'</p>

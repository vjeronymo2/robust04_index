			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> LATE COMPUTER TRADING PUSHES DOW DOWN 3.61  </P> <P> The stock market posted a small loss for the second straight session Thursday,  yielding to some late selling by professional traders.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials closed with a 3.61 loss at 2,680.28.  </P> <P> Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading of  New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 677 up, 750 down and 536 unchanged.  </P> <P> Before trading began, the Commerce Department reported that the nation's gross  national product grew at an annual rate of 2.5%, after adjustment for  inflation, in the second quarter of the year. That came as a mild surprise to  analysts, who had generally expected no change from the 2.7% estimate reported  last month.  </P> <P> The resulting suggestion of a slower-than-expected pace of business activity  helped stocks gain ground in early trading.  </P> <P> But after the advance faltered near the 2,700 level in the Dow industrial  index, prices began to retreat.  </P> <P> Brokers said much of the late pressure on the market came from traders engaged  in computer-program strategies involving stock index options and futures, and  the prominent stocks that make up the indexes.  </P> <P> Chase Manhattan climbed 1/2 to 40 in active trading. Wall Streeters generally  upgraded their appraisals of the company's earnings outlook after its  announcement late Wednesday of large writeoffs on its loans to less developed  nations.  </P> <P> J. P. Morgan, which late Thursday announced a move similar to Chase's, rose 1/8  to 39 3/4.  </P> <P> Kollmorgen fell 5 1/4 to 18 3/8 after Vernitron Corp. said it no longer wanted  to proceed with a $25-a-share takeover of the company.  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 146.93 million shares, up from 136.64 million  Wednesday. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including  trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter  market, totaled 173.11 million shares.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, the Nikkei Stock index of 225 selected issues gained 274.44, or  0.80%, closing at 34,745.02. The index began rising soon after the market  opened as investors were reassured by the yen's overnight jump against the  dollar, dealers said.  </P> <P> In London, stock prices rallied in thin trading. The Financial Times-Stock  Exchange 100-share index, the most closely watched market barometer, closed at  2,380.9, up 11.1, or 0.5%.  </P> <P> Credit  </P> <P> Bond prices fell slightly in light trading, extending losses earlier in the  week.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 1/4 point or $2.50 per $1,000 face  amount. Its yield rose to 8.18% from 8.16% late Wednesday.  </P> <P> Some credit strategists said there was no particular reason for the weakness,  which has depressed the long bond's value by more than 1 point since Monday and  pushed up short-term interest rates back over 8%.  </P> <P> Others attributed the weakness to declining investor expectations that the  Federal Reserve will ease credit policy to stimulate the economy.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments  fell 1/8 point, intermediate maturities fell about 7/32 point and long-term  issues fell about 1/4 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service  reported.  </P> <P> The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which measures price  movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or  longer, fell 1.34 to 1,175.34.  </P> <P> In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal  bonds fell 3/32 point. The average yield to maturity rose to 7.48% from 7.47%  late Wednesday.  </P> <P> Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.08% as the discount rose 1 basis  point to 7.82%. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.16% as the discount rose 1  basis point to 7.74%. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.23% as the discount  rose 4 basis points to 7.68%.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  quoted at 8.9375%, down from 9.75% late Wednesday. The 9.75% figure was  considered a technical aberration caused by the end of a two-week reserve  measurement period.  </P> <P> Currency  </P> <P> The dollar gained ground against the major currencies in quiet dealings.  </P> <P> Gold prices were unchanged to slightly higher. On the New York Commodity  Exchange, an ounce finished at $365.50, up 60 cents from Wednesday. Republic  National Bank later quoted a bid of $363.85, up 25 cents.  </P> <P> Recent statements by Japanese and West German officials indicated some concern  about the dollar's strength. But a regularly scheduled meeting of Bundesbank  officials Thursday failed to result in an expected hike in West German interest  rates.  </P> <P> Some traders are anticipating higher West German and Japanese interest rates in  tandem with softer rates in the United States, a scenario that would depress  the dollar.  </P> <P> Separately, the dollar failed to respond to the Commerce Department's downward  revision in the second-quarter gross national product.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar  fell 1.25 yen to a closing 145.00 yen. Later in London, it was quoted at a  higher rate of 145.10 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 145.65 yen, up  from 145.10 yen on Wednesday.  </P> <P> In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $1.5805 to buy  one pound, cheaper than $1.5820 late Wednesday. In New York, one pound cost  $1.5790, less expensive than Wednesday's $1.5835.  </P> <P> Gold held steady in London at a late bid of $363.25, unchanged. In Zurich, gold  also was unchanged at $363.50 bid. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.69 to  close at $364.11 bid.  </P> <P> Silver prices rose. On New York's Comex, silver closed at $5.181 an ounce, up  from $5.119 on Wednesday. Earlier in London, the metal was trading at a late  bid price of $5.14 an ounce, compared to Wednesday's $5.13.  </P> <P> Commodities  </P> <P> Prices of grain and soybean futures rallied strongly on the Chicago Board of  Trade as the markets braced for the first hard freeze of the season in the  Midwest.  </P> <P> On other markets, silver futures were sharply higher for the second consecutive  session, energy futures were mixed, and livestock and meat futures were mixed.  </P> <P> Wheat futures settled 2 to 3 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in  December at $3.94 3/4 a bushel; corn futures were unchanged to 3 cents higher,  with December at $2.31 1/2 a bushel; oats were 1 1/2 to 2 cents higher, with  December at $1.41 1/2 a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents lower to 7 1/4 cents  higher with November at $5.82 3/4 a bushel.  </P> <P> The rally was rooted in forecasts for freezing temperatures this weekend and  early next week, possibly reaching as far south as northern Arkansas and  Tennessee.  </P> <P> "This is record-breaking or near-record-breaking type cold coming in," said  Charles Notis of Freese-Notis Weather Inc., a private forecasting firm in Des  Moines, Iowa.  </P> <P> Most corn and soybean crops west of the Mississippi River and in Illinois have  matured beyond the danger stage. But the crops in other Midwestern states east  of the Mississippi -- especially soybeans -- are susceptible to freeze damage.  </P> <P> In the western Corn Belt, where the crops are more mature, "I don't think  you're talking about yield losses, I think you're talking about quality  problems," said Dale Gustafson, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.  </P> <P> Silver futures scooted up sharply on New York's Commodity Exchange as the  dollar weakened. Gold futures made only slight gains, held back by the oil  market's lackluster showing.  </P> <P> Gold settled 10 to 60 cents higher, with October at $366.30 an ounce; silver  was 6 to 6.4 cents higher, with September at $5.181.  </P> <P> Livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  </P> <P> Live cattle were 0.25 cent lower to 0.55 cent higher, with October at 71.70  cents a pound; feeder cattle were 0.15 cent lower to 0.20 cent higher, with  September at 83.10 cents a pound; hogs were 0.43 cent lower to 0.13 cent  higher, with October at 41.90 cents a pound, and frozen pork bellies were 1.10  cents lower to 0.60 cent higher, with February at 48.75 cents a pound.  </P> <P> Tables, Page 6  </P></p>

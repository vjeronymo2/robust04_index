			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- On Thursday [3 March], the Bundestag  discussed the horrible human rights violations in the "forgotten  war" between northern and southern Sudan and condemned them  unanimously. In a discussion, which was agreed on by all  parliamentary groups, it was made clear that at least 1.5  million people have been killed since 1983 in the war between  the Islamic government in Khartoum and the south, which is  primarily inhabited by Christians and followers of other  religions.    In a statement for the Bundestag debate, the Society for  Endangered Peoples in Goettingen cited the figure of 150,000  Nubians who have been kidnapped; many of them have been  virtually enslaved. The Society calls for UN protection zones.  The United Nations has warned against an acute famine. Helmut  Schaefer, state minister in the Foreign Ministry, called for a  lasting peace and not just a cease-fire. Possibilities for  pacification are to be searched for together with the European  partners.    The constant hindrances of humanitarian aid are  "unbearable,"  Christian Democratic Union Deputy Alois Count of Waldburg-Zeil  noted. Speaking on behalf of Alliance 90/Greens, Konrad Weiss  recalled the constant bombing attacks by the Sudanese Air Force  on refugee camps, which are continuing even now.</p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Observer: Who me? Do recessionary times make difficult people even more difficult to cope with? During the next four months, 15 one-day seminars on the subject of 'Dealing with difficult people' will take place, half as many again as in the whole of last year. The organisers, the Institute of International Research, put difficult people into categories such as connivers, emperors, wet blankets, saints, saboteurs, exhibitionists, steamrollers, and emotional misfits. While Observer is quite sure that none of its readers could ever be so described, those who have the misfortune to work in close proximity to a likely example can cough up Pounds 99 (excluding VAT) and learn how to devise their very own seven-point master plan to deal with the 'super difficult'.</p>

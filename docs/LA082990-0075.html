			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 47 DEPENDENTS ARRIVE STATESIDE 'STRESSED OUT';  </P> <P> FLIGHT: WEARY AMERICANS SAY THEY LEFT FATHERS, HUSBANDS AND HEARTS IN IRAQ AND  KUWAIT.  </P> <P> With tears, teddy bears and thanks, a weary assemblage of U.S. diplomatic  spouses and children returned Tuesday evening to America, ending a three-day  journey out of Iraqi-occupied Kuwait.  </P> <P> The "stressed out" group of 20 women and 27 children arrived here about 6:18  p.m. EDT, nearly two days after crossing the burning sands of Iraq into Turkey.  Most left behind husbands and fathers who are among 55 U.S. Embassy personnel  from Kuwait being held against their will in Baghdad.  </P> <P> "Our hearts are left in Kuwait and Baghdad with all our husbands, members of  our families, our private American citizens and members of the international  community left behind," said an emotional Luz Marina Colwell, the wife of U.S.  Consul William Colwell.  </P> <P> Colwell, a short, bespectacled woman in a green-and-purple dress, read from a  statement scribbled on a scrap of paper. Her message of thanks to President  Bush and others responsible for their safe passage was nearly drowned by the  roar of two idling buses.  </P> <P> Her voice seemed to crack and her eyes clouded with tears midway through her  remarks as she spoke of the group's shared ordeal. At one point, she was  steadied by the supportive arm of Marge Howell, the wife of U.S. Ambassador W.  Nathaniel Howell, who remains in the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait city.  </P> <P> "During the present crisis, we learned to know each other, to care for each  other, and we became a big family," Colwell said. "We had to keep being strong  and keep our hearts very high."  </P> <P> Shortly after her comments, the Americans began moving away from their  chartered airplane. Many of the children, yawning and sleepy, carried large  stuffed animals down the jet runway. Some too tired for the short walk were  carried away from the plane. Largely ignoring the contingent of news  photographers and reporters gathered to record their arrival, the adults  hurried onto buses that took them to an undisclosed Washington-area hotel.  </P> <P> One woman, however, made her feelings apparent for the cameras by wearing an  American flag sewn onto the left thigh of her blue jeans. And, as the buses  pulled away and the plane's crew gathered in the doorway to wave goodby, many  of the family members returned the salutes.  </P> <P> A State Department official said Tuesday night that the family members would  receive some financial assistance from the government, as is customary when  embassy personnel are displaced from their stations. After resting for the  night, the group is expected to disperse to their homes "all across the  country," the source said.  </P> <P> He added that there are no announced plans for President Bush, who is in  Washington for a short spurt of work during his August vacation, to meet with  the family members.  </P> <P> The official said the group was "pretty tired out and stressed out" by their  travels, which included a 20-hour car ride across the Iraqi desert to  Diyarbakir in southeastern Turkey. From there, they were flown to Incirlik, an  air base in Turkey, and on to Paris before arriving at the military air base in  suburban Washington.  </P></p>

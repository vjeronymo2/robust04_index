			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Apprenticeship scheme sparks scepticism: Split over education reforms Widespread scepticism is expressed by Tec directors over the impact of the government's 'modern apprenticeship' scheme on skills shortages. Forty-eight per cent of directors questioned in the survey of the 82 Tecs in England and Wales said that they did not believe employers would support the scheme in sufficient numbers to make a significant impact on skills shortages. But 44 per cent disagreed, with the strongest support coming from voluntary and private-sector employers. The scheme - which is being piloted - aims to create a new generation of skilled workers. Directors' attitudes may be influenced by the fact that little information is available yet on how much extra the government will pay employers to train young people to National Vocational Qualification level three, the vocational equivalent of two A-levels. At present most of those who take part in Youth Training schemes attain NVQ level two, the vocational equivalent of four GCSEs. Directors were also divided over the educational reforms of Mr John Patten, the education secretary, with 51 per cent saying that they rated the government's educational reforms as 'satisfactory' or 'very satisfactory' at better equipping young people for jobs while 47 per cent disagreed. The idea of a 'universal credit', which would be offered to all young people at the age of 16 going into part-time or full-time education and training, received strong support. A total of 77 per cent of directors favoured such a move. The government said in its recent white paper on competitiveness that it was consulting widely on the feasibility of such a plan. Many Tecs are forging partnerships with local authorities for the delivery of the Careers Service. A large number of directors said their main priority for the service was earlier careers advice for young people, which should be more independent of teachers. Tecs administer Youth Training, a scheme for young people, and Training for Work, a programme for unemployed adults, funding for which has been cut this year. Fifty-seven per cent of directors said that government spending on training the unemployed adults was too low, a belief that was shared by 96 per cent of trade union members on Tecs. Increasingly the government is paying Tecs for 'outputs' - getting an unemployed person into a job or helping them acquire qualifications. The National Council for Voluntary Organisations said yesterday that this was encouraging discrimination against trainees with special needs. Of directors, 55 per cent said the regime was forcing Tecs to discriminate against trainees who needed a lot of help, a view held by 88 per cent of board members drawn from trade unions and 81 per cent of those from the voluntary sector. A total of 46 per cent of private-sector employers agreed.</p>

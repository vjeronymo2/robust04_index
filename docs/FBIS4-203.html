			<p>BFN     [Text] Venancio de Moura, foreign affairs minister of the  Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party,  MPLA-PT, is currently visiting Lunda Sul Province. His call on  the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola, FAPLA,  for become engaged in more fighting, has enraged the people.  Reports say that the MPLA-PT foreign minister does not believe  in the Lusaka peace talks. He showed similar spirit during the  negotiations in Estoril, which led to the signing of the fragile  Bicesse Accord.    A source in Lunda Sul Province said yesterday that Venancio  de Moura's remarks in Saurimo are in line with the Luanda  regime's warmongering plans for this year as announced by Jose  Eduardo dos Santos in his New Year message.</p>

			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEMOCRACY GETS TEST IN LARGEST SOVIET REPUBLIC  </P> <P> With simmering tempers and much arguing, Russians embarked Wednesday on a  struggle to create an institution unprecedented in their republic's long and  tumultuous political history: a democratic legislature with real power.  </P> <P> By a single vote, the new Russian Congress of People's Deputies showed its  mettle by rejecting an agenda that deputies complained was being forced on them  by the Soviet leadership. They said it was designed to lead to the swift  approval of a Kremlin apparatchik as the republic's president.  </P> <P> From a balcony, Mikhail S. Gorbachev impassively surveyed the unruly and novel  institution he helped to found, one that may deal him a political body blow by  making Boris N. Yeltsin, the strapping Siberian populist, the new leader of the  Russian federation instead.  </P> <P> "This is a huge victory for democratic forces," a member of the radical  Democratic Russia group exclaimed after the agenda, seen as damaging to  Yeltsin's chances, was rejected 495 to 494.  </P> <P> The Congress, the new Parliament for the largest of the Soviet republics and  the heartland of the Soviet Union, ironically held its inaugural session in the  same Kremlin hall used by the old rubber-stamp national legislature. Its  proceedings were carried live on radio.  </P> <P> Except for the locale, dominated by a statue of Lenin striding confidently  forward, little seemed the same.  </P> <P> A lawmaker from the Volga valley put his finger on the difference: "Now the  fundamental question is power."  </P> <P> Another, exasperated by the haggling over procedure that began almost  immediately from the floor, said: "This is not a congress; I don't know what it  is. I called home, and they told me the meeting was out of order."  </P> <P> Despite containing over half of the Soviet population and three-quarters of its  land, the Russian republic has long been a political pygmy in the country's  governmental system, which in theory is composed of 15 republics equal in  rights though vastly different in size and economic might.  </P> <P> Although ethnic Russians dominate Soviet politics, the civil service and most  other fields of endeavor, the continent-sized land they live in has been  virtually under direct rule by the national governmental apparatus and the  dozens of Soviet ministries.  </P> <P> "Russia has no rights. It follows the lead of the center; it has no policies of  its own, foreign or domestic," Yeltsin told a rally Monday as he openly  campaigned for the Russian presidency.  </P> <P> Many Russians, echoing Americans' complaints about foreign aid, believe wealth  is being siphoned from their homeland to bolster the lifestyles of ungrateful  peoples. According to Tass, the official news agency, the central government  distributes 61% of the profits it collects from Russian enterprises to the  non-Russian republics.  </P> <P> "It's time the central government stopped biting pieces off Russia," said  Yeltsin, who wants an office of nationwide importance to push his demands for  more drastic social and economic change.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's reforms have resulted in demands for local autonomy and even  independence, and Russia is no exception. Across its 11 time zones, anger at  the bureaucrats in Moscow has reached such a pitch that some people talk  openly, if unrealistically, about Russia seceding from the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> For many, the test of the new Congress' independence will be whether it elects  the 59-year-old Yeltsin as chairman of the Russian Supreme Soviet, or Russian  president.  </P> <P> The incumbent, Politburo member Vitaly I. Vorotnikov, 64, is not being  mentioned as a candidate, and Communist Party members say the squeeze has been  put on by the national leadership to choose Alexander V. Vlasov, currently the  republic's prime minister and a career party and government official.  </P> <P> Pravda, the party daily, gave splashy play this month to an interview with the  normally low-profile Vlasov, which the gadfly Moscow News said clearly tagged  the 58-year-old native of the Lake Baikal region of Siberia as the "official  candidate."  </P> <P> Yeltsin, who was dumped by Gorbachev as Moscow party boss in 1987 but scored a  stunning political comeback by winning election to the national Parliament, has  accused Gorbachev of putting pressure on deputies to vote for Vlasov.  </P> <P> Easily elected to the Russian Congress in March from his home region of  Sverdlovsk in the Urals, Yeltsin claims that one-third of the chamber's 1,068  members are pledged to him. He may have more, judging by the Congress' decision  on the first day of its session to reject the agenda calling for immediate  election of a president. A quick vote was seen as giving Vlasov an distinct  edge.  </P> <P> Now, Vlasov will be obliged to give an accounting of his three-year tenure as  Russian prime minister and to explain current economic difficulties. That is  likely to open him up to tough criticism. However, a Yeltsin victory in the  secret-ballot election still appears a long shot.  </P> <P> Prominent radical Tatyana Koryagina, who like the towering Siberian has made a  political career out of her attacks on official perks and privileges, garnered  more than 400 votes Wednesday in her bid to win election to the Credentials  Commission of the Parliament, but ultimately failed. That bodes poorly for  Yeltsin.  </P> <P> A powerful legislative branch is hardly in the political traditions of this  land where the czars long ruled as they saw fit, and where Lenin could speak  contemptuously of "parliamentary cretinism."  </P> <P> A key reason that Soviet rulers politically emasculated the Russian federation  was the longtime fear that its institutions, if allowed any autonomy, could  become alternate power bases to the national bureaucracy.  </P> <P> For example, though it has far more Communists than any other republic, Russia  for decades was without its own party apparatus, unlike the Ukraine or Armenia,  for example.  </P> <P> Significantly, when Gorbachev, already Soviet president and general secretary  of the Soviet Communist Party, created a separate "Russian bureau," he made  himself its chief as well.  </P> <P> OFFER TO MOSCOW -- Lithuania said it would suspend secession laws to get talks.  A7  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC  </P> <P> The Russian Republic, formally known as the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist  Republic, was formed in 1917 and joined the Soviet Union in 1922. It is by far  the largest and most populous of the republics, extending from the Baltic Sea  and the Arctic Ocean in the north to China and Mongolia in the south, and to  the Pacific Ocean in the east.  </P> <P> AREA: 6.5 million square milees.  </P> <P> POPULATION: 145 million.  </P> <P> ETHNIC BREAKDOWN: 82.6% Russian; 3.8 Tatar; 2.7 Ukrainian; 1.2% Chuvash. There  are about 100 other nationalities in the republic.  </P></p>

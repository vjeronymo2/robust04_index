			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Unions accuse Sony under Nafta accord US and Mexican labour organisations yesterday filed a complaint against Sony Corporation, the electronics multi-national, for alleged violations of worker rights at the company's plants in Mexico. The complaint was filed under a side agreement to the North American Free Trade Agreement which provides for the monitoring of labour law enforcement. It is the first to relate to labour rights violations alleged to have occurred since the signing of the accord. The case is being seen as a test of the Clinton administration's commitment to the agreement's legal provisions for ensuring equivalent rights for workers in all three countries of Nafta. The International Labor Rights Education and Research Fund (ILRERF), a non-profit human rights and labour organisation, in association with two pro-democracy lobbies in Mexico, is accusing Sony of obstructing free association of its workers. They allege that Sony maintained surveillance on active unionists, fired a number of workers who went on strike and pressured employees to work on national holidays. The complaint also alleges that Sony has violated the Mexican Federal Labor Law and criticises the Mexican government for failing to enforce applicable labour laws which guarantee freedom of association and limit hours of work. ILRERF is calling on the US National Administrative Office to hold public hearings and an on-site investigation of Sony's operations. Under the complementary arrangements of Nafta regarding labour conditions, the US cannot impose sanctions to guarantee labour law enforcement, but can review cases and inform their free trade partners when they perceive infringements of worker rights. Sony, which employs 2,000 people at its Nuevo Laredo plants denies any wrongdoing. Observers say Sony may be caught in a domestic political conflict between the Confederation of Mexican Workers, the government-linked union, and workers who wish to establish an organisation independent of the ruling party. The Mexican government has not informed Sony of any violation of labour laws, Sony said. A government spokesman declined comment before the complaint was filed.</p>

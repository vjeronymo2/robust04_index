			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Arts: Schiff's Schubert THE INCREASED attractiveness of the Wigmore Hall as a venue and the publicity it has received since its re-opening have combined to create a powerful draw for audiences. The first major series of the year is Andras Schiff's cycle of Schubert's Piano Sonatas and even before the first programme on Wednesday, all seats had been sold for the entire series. Schiff has long been faithful to the Wigmore Hall and its audiences respond in kind. The unshowy musicianship that marks his performances of the classics would seem to make him a natural resident of an intimate hall like this. But there can be surprises. I vividly recall a recital at the Maggio Musicale in Florence a few years ago, when the pianist attacked Beethoven's 'Hammerklavier' sonata as if he was dealing out a punishment. His Schubert is by no means a shy or demure visitor either. Those who enjoy this pianist's lyrical playing of Bach and Mozart may not expect to find him among the toughest interpreters when he comes to Schubert's Piano Sonatas. We are a long way from the dreamy tenderness that cocoons the Schubert performances of Radu Lupu, for example, or the classical poise of Maurizio Pollini. In each of the opening sonatas - a pair of unfinished works in E Minor (D566) and C Major (D840) - Schiff fiercely announced his readiness to address the music's dramatic outbursts head-on. In the C Major, in particular, there was an unsmiling dogmatic side to the playing, which would rise to a noisy plateau of hammered chords, where the music often lost its sense of forward movement. Tender moments came as a respite from the attack, not a permanent ceasefire. Each of the six programmes will conclude with one of the later sonatas. On Wednesday it was the A Minor (D845). Again, this was a strong and dramatic reading, although the softer elements of the music were now better integrated, showing how a pianist of Schiff's stature can marvellously light upon new colours in what may look a monochrome passage on the page. Only with the finale was the demon fully let loose, whipping up percussive rhythms in the closing bars that presaged Bartok or Stravinsky. The Wigmore's new Bosendorfer piano continues to play its part, bringing a more transparent texture to the thickest handfuls of chords. An encore of one of the unfinished sonata movements also suggests that this powerful cycle could turn out still more complete than advertised. Series continues through to January 23 (Box Office 071-935)</p>

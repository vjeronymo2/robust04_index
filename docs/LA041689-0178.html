			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AS LANGSTON WATCHES, ANGELS ROUT MARINERS  </P> <P> And on Saturday, Mark Langston rested, which meant the Angels had a chance.  Take Seattle's overpowering left-handed pitcher off the mound and the Mariners  are, well, the Mariners, in last place in the American League West for a  reason.  </P> <P> Take the seventh inning of the Angels' 9-2 victory before 29,819 fans Saturday  night at the Kingdome. Pick up the action with Angel rookie Kent Anderson on  second base, Brian Downing on first and Mark McLemore set to lay down a  sacrifice bunt.  </P> <P> With Langston only a spectator, McLemore's bunt was fielded by Seattle reliever  Jerry Reed, who threw to third base in time to beat Anderson, but not in time  for Seattle third baseman Edgar Martinez, who missed the throw.  </P> <P> The ball wound up down the third-base line, Anderson scored, Downing took third  and McLemore wound up at second.  </P> <P> Next, a passed ball by Mariner catcher Dave Valle allowed Downing to score and  McLemore to advance to third.  </P> <P> One out later, with Dennis Powell pitching, Wally Joyner walked. Lance Parrish  hit a pop foul that Seattle first baseman Jim Presley snared with a sliding  catch. Powell, however, was slow to cover first base, so Joyner took off for  second.  </P> <P> Presley's hurried throw skipped wildly away, enabling McLemore to score.  </P> <P> In a few not-so-easy steps, that is how the Mariners can turn a 2-2  seventh-inning tie into a 5-2 deficit, soon to be a 9-2 defeat.  </P> <P> In the process, the Angels improved their record against the Langston-less  Mariners to 3-0. Against Langston, they are 0-2, including an earlier six-hit  shutout and Friday night's 9-5 defeat.  </P> <P> "I don't think anybody takes any of their other pitchers lightly," Angel  Manager Doug Rader said. "Granted, if you can play a series with Seattle and  miss Langston, you're catching a hell of a break. But you've still got to  scrape something together against their other guys."  </P> <P> Scraping, however, can be made easier when:  </P> <P>  -- Mariner starting pitcher Scott Bankhead (0-2) surrenders three hits and a  walk in the first inning and a home run to Devon White in the third.  </P> <P>  -- Powell surrenders an eighth-inning home run to slump-ridden Jack Howell,  who took a .118 average into the game and went hitless in his first three  at-bats.  </P> <P>  -- Julio Solano, Seattle's third relief pitcher, serves up a three-run home  run to Chili Davis in the ninth inning.  </P> <P> In all, the Angels amassed 12 hits in support of starting pitcher Chuck Finley  (2-1), who pitched his first complete game of the season despite yielding nine  hits and two walks.  </P> <P> "Some good things happened tonight," Rader observed.  </P> <P> Then again, there was the first inning, which found the Angels off and running  -- not always a good thing, considering how the Angels can run the bases.  </P> <P> With the bases loaded and one out in the first, Parrish sent a line drive  single up the middle, which scored McLemore from third and should have scored  White from second.  </P> <P> But White attempted to score standing up and, worse, slowed to a jog as he  approached the plate. A strong throw from Seattle center fielder Henry Cotto  and catcher Valle's left leg cut down White.  </P> <P> Blocking home plate with that leg, Valle sent White for a spill, with White  tumbling over -- but never touching -- the plate. Valle chased down White to  make the tag and erase one Angel run.  </P> <P> Another Angel met a similar fate one batter later when Joyner tried to score  from second on Claudell Washington's single to right. Joyner had the presence  of mind to slide, but he lacks the quickness of feet to outrun right fielder  Mickey Brantley's throw home.  </P> <P> Another out, inning over and the Angels had managed to parlay three hits and a  walk into a solitary run.  </P> <P> "Not a whole lot of things went right in the first inning," Rader said. "It was  more like we persevered through it."  </P> <P> Rader was asked about White's non-slide, which made it all possible.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's appropriate to dwell it with all the good things that  happened," he said. "He's going to get blocked off the plate no matter what. If  I was Devo, I wouldn't want to run into that big guy, either."  </P> <P> White would make amends two innings later by homering into the left-field seats  against Bankhead.  </P> <P> This time, White scored standing up.  </P> <P> "He couldn't block him on that one," Rader deadpanned.  </P> <P> Still, those lost runs of the first inning loomed large when Seattle rallied to  tie, 2-2, in the bottom of the third. Jim Presley and Edgar Martinez hit  successive singles off Finley, advanced on Rey Quinones' sacrifice bunt and  both came home on Harold Reynolds' single to center.  </P> <P> Finley didn't let another Mariner run cross the plate and recorded a rare  complete game. Last year, in 31 starts, Finley had two complete games.  </P> <P> Rader kept Finley on the mound until the Mariners broke down. It can happen at  any time, but this time, it happened in the seventh inning, when everything but  the Kingdome roof collapsed on Seattle.  </P> <P> "The key to success is not allowing that type of thing to happen to you," Rader  said. "They had two innings like that tonight. They lucked out in the first,  but if you keep going to the well, it's going to get you sooner or later."  </P> <P> For the Angels, the seventh inning was soon enough.  </P> <P> Angel Notes  </P> <P> The Angels are running short on shortstops, which is why Kent Anderson made his  major-league debut Saturday night. He got his chance when Glenn Hoffman,  filling in for injured Dick Schofield, took a Mark Langston fastball on his  left forearm Friday. Hoffman had the arm X-rayed and no break was detected, but  a deep bruise relegated him to reserve status for Saturday's game. . . .  Anderson, 25, was the forgotten man in the Angels' training camp, his playing  time squeezed by the extensive trial given ex-Cincinnati Red shortstop Dave  Concepcion. Anderson received just 12 at-bats all spring, but hit safely five  times, finishing with a .417 average. "I didn't have a lot of at-bats, but I  had a pretty good spring," Anderson said. "They were playing Davey a good bit,  but they had to see what he could do. They also had Hoffman in camp and  Schofield's got to get his work in, too. I was fortunate to hit as many times  as I did." When the Concepcion experiment failed, Anderson was sent to Edmonton  but, in effect, moved up the depth chart. "I thought I'd get the call (to the  majors) some time this year," Anderson said. "I didn't realize it would be this  early."  </P> <P> Johnny Ray took ground balls at second base for the first time since being  placed on the disabled list last week with a sprained left wrist. "He's not to  the point where he can swing a bat," trainer Ned Bergert said, "but he's begun  some forearm resistance work. He's eligible to come off (the disabled list) on  the 21st, and he could be ready by then." . . . Chili Davis, playing with a  sore right shoulder, has discontinued treatment on the shoulder, hoping that a  light weight program will be enough to strengthen the joint. Davis has yet to  record an outfield assist with his weakened shoulder, but Saturday he showed  signs of coming around with the bat, going 2 for 5 with a three-run home run.  </P></p>

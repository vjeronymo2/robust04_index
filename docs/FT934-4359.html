			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Big fall in US jobless lifts hopes for robust recovery The sharpest fall in the US unemployment rate for a decade yesterday prompted claims that the US recovery, after stuttering for two years, is finally entering a benign phase of robust, non- inflationary growth. The Labour Department said the jobless rate fell from 6.8 per cent in October to 6.4 per cent last month, the lowest level for three years. The figures - the latest in a string of buoyant economic statistics - surprised Wall Street analysts who expected a decline of only 0.1 or 0.2 percentage points. Bond and share prices, however, were little changed as the figures confirmed recent signs of accelerating growth. 'We are moving in the right direction,' President Bill Clinton told supporters in Washington. 'We have unemployment down, investment up, no inflation and low interest rates.' Ms Laura Tyson, White House chief economist, said the pace of growth had picked up and was sustainable. Gross domestic product was likely to grow at an annual rate of more than 3 per cent this quarter. The faster recovery would continue next year, without putting upward pressure on inflation, now just under 3 per cent. Oil prices were down, commodity prices were soft and wage pressure was mild. 'The evidence is compelling that inflation won't increase,' she said. Yesterday's figures were uniformly encouraging. Non-farm payroll employment was reported up 208,000 last month, against projections of an increase of about 170,000. Manufacturing employment was up 30,000, the second monthly increase after declines earlier this year. Hours worked rose to a record level, suggesting a strong gain in industrial production. But there was little sign of upward pressure on wages. The Commerce Department said the official index of leading indicators - a guide to future trends - rose 0.5 per cent in October after solid gains in the two preceding months. Factory orders rose 1.2 per cent in October to register their third consecutive monthly gain. Many Wall Street analysts share the White House's confidence. The consensus is that the economy will grow at an annual rate of 4-5 per cent this quarter from 2.7 per cent in the third quarter. Growth is expected to moderate early next year but then regain momentum. Real gross domestic product is expected to rise by 3 per cent or slightly more over the year. Views diverge on the Federal Reserve's likely response. If inflation figures remain subdued, many analysts expect the Fed to postpone an increase in short-term rates, now 3 per cent, until well into next year. Others believe the Fed will begin nudging rates higher on the grounds that inflation-adjusted rates are too low. Currencies, Page 13 Wall Street report, Page 21</p>

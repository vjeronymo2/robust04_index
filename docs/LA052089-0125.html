			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD;  </P> <P> COUNTY SPOKESMAN MISQUOTED ABOUT JAIL  </P> <P> Because of a dropped word, Friday's article on the bill before the Legislature  to close the temporary San Diego County jail in Santee incorrectly stated that  county lobbyist Patricia Gayman had said that the county did agree to close the  jail by 1991. She actually said the county has not agreed to close the jail by  then. The county plans to close the jail by 1996.  </P></p>

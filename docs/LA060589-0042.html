			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> South African writer and editor Richard Rive, whose works depicted the plight  of Colored (mixed race) people under apartheid, was found murdered in his house  near Cape Town. Police said that friends of Rive, 59, discovered him lying in a  passageway. He was covered in blood and had been stabbed several times in the  chest and beaten in the face. A play based on Rive's short novel "Buckingham  Palace, District Six" is due to open in Cape Town on June 16. It describes life  in Rive's birthplace, a vibrant district of the city that was forcibly cleared  of its Colored population to make room for whites and now stands devastated.  </P></p>

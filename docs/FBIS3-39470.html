In talks with Bosnian Social Affairs Minister Arif Smajkic  and Health Minister Mustafa Beganovic, Contri discussed the  practicalities of an adoption programme that would prevent  children from being wrenched from a familiar, if war-torn,  environment. She told reporters that another focus of the talks  was the "aid truce" proposal, within the context of Italian  Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta's proposal to hold an  international meeting of social affairs ministers in Florence.    Accompanied by the extraordinary intervention chief at the  Italian foreign ministry's development aid department, Vitaliano  Napoleone, Contri also had talks with UN High Commission for  Refugees (UNHCR) Sarajevo coordinator Anthony C. Land, who said  the Bosnian capital was at present only receiving two-thirds of  the food and half the medical supplies it needs.    Land thanked the Italian government for its efforts in  support of the evacuation of wounded, which "Italy is  implementing to a much higher degree than other countries." He  said that, despite the cease-fire, aid to Sarajevo was still  being held up by security problems.    Throughout the day of talks, as snow fell heavily on the  city, sounds of gunfire were faint and extremely sporadic.    At the end of their talks, the two social affairs ministers  signed an accord on humanitarian initiatives to protect Bosnian  children from the effects of the fighting. The accord also aims  to "stimulate the commitment of all sides to the military  cease-fire", a communique said. The two ministers issued an  appeal to Europe and the international community to support  fresh aid convoys from Split to Sarajevo.</p>

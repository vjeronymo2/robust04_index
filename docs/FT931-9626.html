			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Trading east THE FIRST annual economic review of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development provides a chilling perspective for western Europe's pessimists. While economic conditions are difficult in the European Community, they are many times harsher for its eastern neighbours. While strained economic relations are making trading conditions difficult for members of the European exchange rate mechanism, the almost complete breakdown of monetary relations to the east has meant an accelerating collapse in trade and output in the republics of the former Soviet Union. All is not completely bleak. The first casualties of the demise of the former Soviet Union were the countries of eastern Europe. Heavily dependent on Soviet trade, they were devastated by the shift to hard currency settlement of trade with the then Soviet Union in January 1991 and the 63 per cent fall in Soviet imports that followed. But Poland, after three years of falling output, is on the verge of economic growth while the Czech Republic and Hungary have also shifted successfully to current account convertibility, and re-oriented their economies towards western markets. Sadly, the main obstacle to export-led growth in eastern Europe is now western Europe's unwillingness to accept free trade. But even if the EC, in a fit of uncharacteristic enlightenment, were to open its markets to eastern products, the plight of the republics of the former Soviet Union would remain dire. Heavily dependent on each other for the large majority of trade in oil, raw materials and industrial components, they have little chance of surviving independently. Rebuilding close economic and trade ties between the republics is a pre-condition for the success of economic reform. But the EBRD is right to argue that the western pressure to hold the rouble zone together was misguided. The inflationary and fiscal tensions produced by the effort to maintain it are largely responsible for the deterioration in monetary relations between the republics, the reversion to bilateral trade agreements and crude barter arrangements, and the collapse in trade and output. The former Soviet republics should, instead, be building a multilateral clearing system, with western support, in order to finance trade and allow Russia to raise oil prices to world levels, without provoking balance of payments crises. A common currency is not needed for a revival in inter-republican trade. At present, it is having the opposite effect.</p>

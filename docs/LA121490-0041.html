			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> L.A. CHARGES ASBESTOS VIOLATIONS AT 3 DEMOLITION SITES;  </P> <P> AIR QUALITY: PROSECUTORS FILE MISDEMEANOR COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE BUILDING  OWNERS AND CONTRACTORS UNDER A NEW REGULATION.  </P> <P> Calling improper building demolitions a major source of airborne asbestos, Los  Angeles city prosecutors Thursday filed three criminal complaints accusing  building owners and contractors of asbestos violations at demolition sites in  Van Nuys and Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The three misdemeanor cases, along with four others filed last month in  Municipal Court, appear to be the first criminal prosecutions under a new  regulation that tightened controls on demolition and renovation of  asbestos-containing buildings, regional air quality officials said. City  prosecutors said they expect to file complaints in other cases soon.  </P> <P> Asbestos, a fibrous mineral once widely used in floor tiles, roofing,  insulation and other building materials, has been linked to lung cancer and  mesothelioma, a rare and almost invariably fatal form of cancer. Asbestos  materials are safe when intact, but when broken or pulverized can release  fibers that are hazardous if inhaled.  </P> <P> The defendants are accused of failing to carefully remove asbestos before  tearing into buildings, which can loose hazardous asbestos fibers into the air.  Of the seven prosecutions, four involve the razing of single-family houses or  small apartments, which were exempt until the South Coast Air Quality  Management District's tough new rule took effect at the start of this year.  </P> <P> The "cavalier handling of asbestos, either through ignorance or indifference,  is a major public health problem due to the sheer volume of the material which  exists in older small buildings that now are being razed or renovated," City  Atty. Jim Hahn said in a prepared statement.  </P> <P> For years the air district enforced federal regulations covering demolition or  renovation of asbestos-containing buildings. The rules require that asbestos  material be carefully wetted, removed and packaged for disposal, that  demolition workers have safety training, and that air district inspectors have  advance notice so they can monitor the work.  </P> <P> However, the federal regulations exempted single-family residences and  apartment buildings of four units or less. They also excused jobs in which the  amount of asbestos to be disturbed was less than 160 square feet or 260 linear  feet.  </P> <P> The new rule, which took effect Jan. 1, eliminated those exemptions in the  South Coast district, which includes Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San  Bernardino counties. Now, single family residences are covered and safety rules  apply to all demolition and renovation jobs, regardless of the volume of  asbestos. Owner-occupants of single-family residences cannot be charged with  violations, but their contractors can.  </P> <P> "I guess there's a trend in Southern California to buy a house on a piece of  land and demolish it, . . . so a good percentage of demolitions and renovations  involve structures that . . . are not covered by federal regulations," said  Deputy City Atty. Donald Kass.  </P> <P> Before the new rule, residential projects "were a real concern for us" as a  large "cumulative source" of airborne asbestos, said Edwin Pupka, senior  enforcement manager for the air district's air toxics control branch.  </P> <P> No matter how unsafe the work, "we had absolutely no authority whatsoever . . .  to investigate a potential exposure" Pupka said.  </P> <P> Since the new rule took effect, the air district has beefed up its enforcement  effort, typically assigning four or five inspectors to asbestos cases, compared  to two or three last year.  </P> <P> Violation notices have also increased -- from 49 in 1988 and 55 in 1989 -- to  67 through the first three quarters of this year, according to air district  figures. Frequently, violation notices are issued to more than one party in  each case.  </P> <P> Some notices result in negotiated settlements and penalties paid to the  district, but others are referred to county or city prosecutors for criminal  prosecution.  </P> <P> One of the cases filed Thursday involved the demolition last January of two  houses in Van Nuys to make room for a 28-unit condominium project. In razing  the houses at Hamlin Street and Kester Avenue, workers tore up vinyl flooring  containing 5% asbestos without taking precautions, according to air district  citations filed with the complaint.  </P> <P> One of the site owners and the demolition contractor pleaded ignorance about  the asbestos rule when cited Jan. 11, according to the report by the inspector.  But when he returned the next day, workmen still were handling the flooring  without wetting it down or wearing protective clothing, he said.  </P> <P> Bruce M. Kates and Alan Shuman, owners of the site, and Ike and Sigal Yarom,  described as officers of the demolition firm, were each charged with failure to  properly remove asbestos; to test for asbestos before demolishing the  buildings; to properly package and dispose of asbestos material; and to comply  with record-keeping requirements.  </P> <P> Each count carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.  </P> <P> Kates said he and Shuman later hired a licensed asbestos contractor to remove  the material. "We were asked to do it correctly, we did do it correctly. Beyond  that, I don't know what the hell we can do," Kates said.  </P> <P> Ike Yarom said he was unaware of the complaint and was not an officer of the  demolition firm.  </P> <P> Another complaint involved the demolition of an asbestos-containing apartment  complex at 500 S. Berendo St. in Los Angeles. The defendant in that case,  demolition contractor James T. Rudometkin, said he had asked the owner for an  asbestos survey of the building before starting work, and had been told that no  asbestos was found.  </P></p>

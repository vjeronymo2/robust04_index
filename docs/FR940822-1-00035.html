			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following new definitions would be added:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Critical Group would be defined as the group of individuals reasonably expected to receive the greatest exposure to residual radioactivity given the circumstances under which the analysis would be carried out. For example, if the site were to be released for unrestricted use the Critical Group would be the group of individuals reasonably expected to be the most highly exposed considering all reasonable potential future uses of the site. This would include renovation of structures, water use, and industrial, residential, and agricultural uses of the land and structures. If the site were to be released with restrictions, the licensee would have to assess both the dose to the average member of the group of individuals reasonably expected to be the most highly exposed assuming that the proposed restrictions were successfully imposed and adhered to (the ``Critical Group'' appropriate to this set of circumstances) and the dose to the average member of the group of individuals reasonably expected to be the most highly exposed if the proposed restrictions were to fail (in essence the ``Critical Group'' for unrestricted termination of the license).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Critical Group, for purposes of screening dose calculations, is defined for each scenario described in NUREG/CR&hyph;5512, Volume 1. In each scenario, the Critical Group is an individual or relatively homogeneous group of individuals expected to receive the highest exposure within the assumptions of the particular scenario. The average member of the Critical Group is that individual who is assumed to represent the most likely exposure situation based on prudently conservative exposure assumptions and parameter values within the model calculations. For example, the Critical Group for the building occupancy scenario is the group of workers occupying a building that has been decontaminated. The average member of that group is assumed to spend 2000 hours per year working in the building and is exposed to residual contamination via the external, inhalation, and inadvertent ingestion pathways. A more detailed discussion of acceptable methods for selecting the critical group and estimating the dose to the average member of the group can be found in Section III.G. of the draft regulatory guide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is a departure from the requirement in &sect;20.1302 where, for licensed activities, the licensee is required to assess the dose to ``the individual likely to receive the highest dose.'' However, in contrast to licensed facilities where public doses normally result from activities that are carefully prescribed and controlled, the public doses from residual radioactivity at decommissioned sites may result from a variety of activities for which the maximally exposed individual is much more difficult to precisely define. Furthermore, in ongoing operations licensed by the Commission, it is possible to update or keep track of who might be likely to receive the highest exposure. In decommissioning, there will be no ongoing mechanism that would allow for adjustments of imposition of additional controls. Therefore, the Commission believes it is more prudent to use the average member of the critical group for assessing TEDE from residual radioactivity after the license is terminated because this provides a reasonably conservative estimate of public risk without attempting to speculate on which specific individual may be expected to receive the highest dose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The practice of defining and using a Critical Group when assessing individual public dose from low levels of radioactivity similar to those expected from a decommissioned site is proposed in Section 5.5.1 of the 1990 recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP 60) and has been adopted in the current draft of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Draft Federal Radiation Protection Guidance for Exposure of the General Public. For the purpose of this Subpart, the licensee would be required to estimate the dose to the average member of the critical group from residual radioactivity remaining at the site.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Indistinguishable from background would mean that the detectable concentration of the radionuclide is not statistically different from the background concentration of that radionuclide in the vicinity of the site, or in the case of structures, in similar materials using adequate measurement technology, survey methodology, and statistical techniques.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Readily removable would refer to residual radioactivity, as defined below, which is removable using non-destructive, common, housekeeping techniques (e.g., washing with detergent and water) that do not generate large volumes of radioactive waste requiring subsequent disposal. This would not include techniques that produce chemical wastes that are expected to adversely affect public health or the environment. Readily removable would also not refer to residual contamination dispersed in soil under conditions where removal of the residual radioactivity could only be accomplished by moving large volumes of soil.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Residual Radioactivity would include radioactivity in structures, materials, soils, groundwater, and other media at the site resulting from licensed activities at the site. This would include radioactivity from all licensed and unlicensed sources used by the licensee but would exclude background radiation. This term should not be confused with the term ``residual radioactive material'' which appears in 10 CFR 40.4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Site-Specific Advisory Board (SSAB) would be a committee constituted by the licensee to provide advice to the licensee on decommissioning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Scope <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would apply to the decommissioning of all facilities licensed by the Commission except for facilities or portions thereof (e.g., waste disposal sites and uranium mill tailings) that are already specifically covered in the regulations. It provides for both unrestricted and restricted release of sites. The proposed rule would not apply to sites already covered by a Commission approved decommissioning plan if the plan was approved before the effective date of the rule. This provision is designed to encourage licensees to continue with ongoing and planned decommissioning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After a site has been decommissioned and the license terminated in accordance with the criteria in this proposed rule, the Commission would require additional cleanup only if, based on new information, it determines that residual radioactivity remaining at the site could result in significant public or environmental harm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission recognizes there may be existing sites containing large quantities of materials contaminated with low level radioactivity where public health and the environment may best be protected by onsite stabilization and disposal with proper restriction of the site to prevent human disruption of the site and exposure to the radioactive contamination. There are precedents for these cases in the stabilization of uranium mill tailings under the Uranium Mill Tailings Remediation Control Act of 1978 (UMTRCA) and the DOE Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP). In these cases, some type of durable institutional control, such as placing the site under the custody of a State or Federal agency, may be necessary to ensure long-term protection of the public and the environment. However, consideration of these actions would require extensive site-specific safety and environmental analyses. In addition, input from affected parties in the vicinity of the site would be desirable to determine whether there are other local impacts that must be considered in determining the best course of action and to ensure the long-term effectiveness of the institutional controls. For these reasons, the Commission has determined that these actions fall outside the scope of this rulemaking in the sense that there may be site-specific determinations using criteria other than those proposed in this rulemaking. If, in the future, general criteria to evaluate these actions can be developed, the Commission will consider additional rulemaking to establish the criteria for general application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule would also require that all new applicants for licenses, other than renewals, describe in the application how facility design and procedures for operation will minimize contamination of the facility and the environment, facilitate eventual decommissioning, and minimize the generation of radioactive waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Radiological Criteria <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would establish a dose limit for release of a decommissioned site of 15 millirem per year (mrem/y) TEDE for residual radioactivity distinguishable from background. The 15 mrem/y TEDE dose limit was selected to provide both a substantial margin of safety below the NRC's dose limit for members of the public and an appropriate limit for the acceptability of release of a facility which would no longer be subject to regulatory control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The estimated lifetime risk associated with an annual TEDE of 15 mrem/y is approximately 4E&hyph;4. This estimate was arrived at by using a risk coefficient of 4E&hyph;4 per rem and assuming an exposure lifetime of 70 years. The 4E&hyph;4 risk factor is roughly equivalent to the 3.92E&hyph;4 risk factor in Table 6.6 of the EPA NESHAPS Background Information Document (EPA89). Use of this value is consistent with the calculational methods of the Environmental Protection Agency which is also promulgating regulations in this area. The 70-year exposure lifetime provides a conservative estimate of lifetime exposure. The Environmental Protection Agency is using a 30-year lifetime exposure in estimating lifetime risk from residual radioactivity at decommissioned sites. This is based on the assumption that it is unlikely that an individual will continue to live or work in the same area for more than 30 years. Using a 30-year exposure lifetime the estimated lifetime risk associated with an annual TEDE of 15 mrem/y would be approximately 2E&hyph;4. A more detailed discussion of estimating lifetime risk can be found in appendix B of the GEIS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In selecting this limit, the NRC staff took into account recommendations of the ICRP and NCRP and those criteria promulgated by EPA and NRC which provide acceptance criteria for areas where unrestricted access in the vicinity of facilities is permitted, such as generally applicable environmental standards established by EPA and the criteria used for remediation of contaminated sites under the Superfund (CERCLA) program. The dose value of 15 mrem/y TEDE is generally consistent with the risks implied by those criteria and with the remediations which have been achieved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters have argued that a 15 mrem/y limit for unrestricted release is not consistent with the recommendations of the ICRP and NCRP and that the limit should be raised to as high as 100 mrem/y. The Commission believes that an additional margin of safety below 100 mrem/yr is necessary because the 100 mrem/y limit is intended to apply to doses to the public resulting from  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> all <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  radiation sources (NCRP Report No. 116, Section 15; ICRP Publication 60, Section 5.5). Therefore, allocation of the entire 100 mrem/y dose to residual radioactivity from the decommissioning of a single facility would be inappropriate. Using a safety margin to limit the dose from a single source to avoid a summation of exposures approaching the dose limit is consistent with the recommendations of both the ICRP and the NCRP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the cost/benefit impact analysis in the GEIS (Chapters 5 and 6 and Figures 7&hyph;1 through 7&hyph;11) indicate that costs of achieving a 15 mrem/yr limit would not be unduly burdensome on licensees. In those few cases where remediation to achieve 15 mrem/yr may present an unreasonable burden, release of the site with restrictions placed on its use provides an alternative means for achieving this level of protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> PRICES SLIP, GOLD MINE CUT BACK  </P> <P> Producers at Australia's largest gold mine, hurting from low gold prices, cut  jobs and closed down some high-cost underground operations today.  </P> <P> "It's a reflection of the difficult times we're in," said gold stock analyst  Howard Walker at broker J B Were.  </P> <P> "There will probably be more suspended or closed over the next few months."  </P> <P> Joint venture partners Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie Ltd. and Homestake Gold of  Australia Ltd. said cash costs of production at their Fimiston underground  mines were running at more than $385 an ounce. That compares with current gold  prices at around $353 an ounce.  </P> <P> Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie and Homestake, an 80% owned subsidiary of U.S.  producer Homestake Mining Co., jointly own the huge "super pit" and five  underground mines in Western Australia's Golden Mile area at Kalgoorlie.  </P> <P> The price of gold is down almost $60 from December levels, and many analysts  believe there is little chance of a recovery for the next six months.  </P></p>

The deal on a possible volkstaat [homeland]  was scuppered after it was watered down by the ANC's national  executive committee (NEC). Yet more "final" talks are due on  Monday.    AVF sources said they had shown the draft agreement to their  most militant elements, including Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging  [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] leader Eugene Terreblanche, Cape  Conservative Party [CP] leader Jan Hoon and the [Orange] Free  State CP executive, who all gave it their blessing. CP leader  Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg also accepted it.    AVF moderates warned grimly late this week that the  initiative was slipping from their hands as hardline elements  threatened to make the running. One negotiator warned  nervously: "There will be no elections if we don't take part."    It is understood that the AVF, the ANC and Government  negotiators had earlier agreed on a draft amendment to the  constitution reading:    "Provision shall be made in the constitution for the  recognition of the right of self-determination of the peoples of  South Africa. It shall be understood that the right to  self-determination relates to the right of any of such peoples  to determine their own destiny. Such right may be exercised in  such a manner which does or does not entail a territorial  entity."    However, the ANC's NEC watered down this agreement, and  replaced it with:    "Nothing in these constitutional principles shall be  construed as precluding recognition by the Constitutional  Assembly of the AVF's idea of self-determination."    The AVF regards this amendment as "ANC tomfoolery" couched  in  sneering tones.    The ANC's latest proposals also tended to increase central  government power instead of greater provincial powers as  demanded by the Freedom Alliance [FA]. The ANC still rejects  two ballots for national and provincial elections as the FA  demands.    The IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], an FA member, is due to  decide at a conference this weekend on whether it will take part  in the election. But IFP organiser Senzo Mfayela said the  conference might take a decision which was conditional on the  outcome of Monday's negotiations.</p>

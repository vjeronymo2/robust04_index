			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLOCKING THE KHMER ROUGE OUT  </P> <P> There's no more promising path to peace in Cambodia on the table right now than  the new proposal for an enhanced role by the United Nations. China's  willingness to support the plan raises hopes that finally there may be a  resolution of the terrible strife.  </P> <P> The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council have agreed on a set of  principles designed to end the fighting, terminate the flow of foreign arms and  outside intervention and clear the way for free elections under U.N.  supervision.  </P> <P> It is a tall order, given the awful history of genocide, American and  Vietnamese intervention and the continued fragmentation of power in that  hapless nation. But recent fighting again has demonstrated that there is no  other way out. As the five-power declaration affirms, "No acceptable solution  can be achieved by force of arms."  </P> <P> China, by voting with the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France,  now appears prepared to accept the reality that its client within Cambodia, the  Khmer Rouge, cannot battle its way back to power. The new declaration  explicitly denies any of the four warring parties a veto over the peace process  as they are brought together in dialogue to facilitate the transition.  </P> <P> It will not be easy to bring the rival groups together, as was evident in the  collapse last August of a 19-nation conference seeking to create a government  of national reconciliation. The Khmer Rouge, supported by China, is blamed in  the deaths of at least a million people during its repressive rule from 1975 to  1978.  </P> <P> The government of Hun Sen is having difficulty shedding the image of being only  a puppet of Hanoi even after the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops in September.  The United States has played a complex role with support of two political  movements, one led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the other by former Prime  Minister Son Sann, both allied with the Khmer Rouge.  </P> <P> Australia was the architect of the new peace plan, with Indonesia playing an  important negotiating role. The plan fits well into the tradition of U.N.  peacekeeping as provided by Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter. Unanimity among  the permanent Security Council members is the essential ingredient. It is the  ingredient that has been missing through so much of the Cold War.  </P> <P> The new move for an enlarged U.N. role comes, unfortunately, at a time when the  organization itself has been weakened by failure of members to pay their  assessments, even though the assessments are treaty obligations. Members owed  $905 million at the end of 1989, including $517.7 million owed by the United  States, the principal debtor, according to U.N. tabulations.  </P> <P> At a time when permanent council members are proposing a new peacekeeping  venture, the United States' debt includes $152.7 million for other peacekeeping  operations, and the Soviet Union owes $122 million for the Lebanon peacekeeping  operation alone. The other permanent members are basically paid up. President  Bush had requested full payment last year but Congress refused.  </P></p>

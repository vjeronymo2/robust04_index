			<p>BFN     [Text] The Brazilian Government has donated 15  Brazilian-made primary training airplanes to the Bolivian Air  Force. The Brazilian Aeronautics Ministry considers the  refurbishing cost of these airplanes, which are poorly  maintained, very high. "They are as worn out as a driving school  Volkswagen Beetle," an Aeronautics officer said. These  airplanes, also called [Aerotec T-23] Uirapuru, were used to  train Aeronautics cadets in their first year of pilots school.</p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: Delayed issue damages emerging markets - Stefan Wagstyl and Sara Webb examine the postponement of a Dollars 1bn Euroequity offer The postponement yesterday of the Dollars 1bn Euroequity issue by Videsh Sanchar Nigam (VSNL), the state-owned Indian international telecommunications monopoly, is a blow for the company, the country and for emerging markets. But it is a blow from which VSNL, India and the markets can all recover. Financial ventures in developing countries are by nature risky. The fact that one attempt to raise funds has failed will probably not cast a permanent shadow over future offerings, though it may well make life difficult for Indian issuers over the next few months. VSNL's decision to defer the issue after frantic talks with the government in Delhi and with the global co-ordinators, Salomon Brothers of the US and Kleinwort Benson of the UK, has left all involved feeling embarrassed. There will be recriminations, particularly in India, where economic globalisation and the disposal of state-owned assets are sensitive political questions. The issue failed mainly because of bad timing, compounded by over-ambitious pricing and, in the final stages, inflexibility in decision-making which made it impossible for the issuers to cut the price to save the offer. From the start, VSNL was no ordinary offering. The Indian government, which owns 85 per cent, saw it as a flagship of its otherwise undistinguished portfolio of state-owned enterprises. When VSNL indicated late last year its interest in an international equity offering, investment bankers drooled at the prospect, not least because India was in fashion in international markets. Salomon and Kleinwort secured the mandate for the issue against tough competition. Quite apart from the prestige of handling India's biggest issue, there were the fees. The going rate for complex international offerings such as European privatisations is 3 per cent of the amount raised. If VSNL had raised Dollars 1bn, it would have paid about Dollars 30m - of which Salomon and Kleinwort would have received at least half. Shares prices in Bombay soared between November and February, taking VSNL from about Rs650 to a peak of more than Rs1,700 in January and February. This tempted VSNL and the government to double the size of the issue from Dollars 500m to Dollars 1bn and to aim for a price of Rs1,400 to Rs1,600. But by the time the issue was ready for market in early April, investor mood had changed. An increase in US interest rates had soured the markets, especially the volatile emerging markets. Potential investors told the company that the shares, priced at about 90 times 1993 earnings, were too expensive. In hasty talks last weekend, Salomon and Kleinwort tried to save the issue by securing permission to approach fund managers informally with a lower price. It emerged that the shares could be sold at Rs1,100 to Rs1,200, raising some Dollars 700m, and that investor demand would be sufficient for the deal to go relatively smoothly. It seems that the VSNL board, gathered in London, wanted to proceed. So did Mr N Vittal, chairman of the government's Telecommunications Commission and an advocate of economic liberalisation, who was also in London. But in Delhi, in meetings late on Monday, others counselled caution - notably Mr Sukh Ram, the telecommunications minister who is opposed to over-hasty deregulation and who insisted that price was an issue for the Cabinet. The prime minister's office agreed. So at 4am London time yesterday, the lead managers were asked to postpone the offer. The decision has no immediate impact on VSNL since its investment plans are flexible and do not depend on the issue for finance. The Indian government, which needs privatisation proceeds to help cut its fiscal deficit, will be under pressure to find funds elsewhere. It will also face criticism for having mishandled the deal. However, it will avoid accusations of having sold the 'family jewels' cheaply. Indian companies, which raised about Dollars 2.5bn in 1993-94 in Euroissues, are planning to raise a further Dollars 9bn in 1994-95. Brokers and fund managers were divided last night how the VSNL failure would affect their prospects. Some thought future issues might also be postponed, but others thought the failure of VSNL would leave more funds available for other offers. Mr Jeff Chowdhry, director at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment Management, said: 'Inevitably this will put further issues on hold but that may not be such a bad thing as it will create time for digesting Indian paper.'</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Furore grows over Bosnian refugees A POLITICAL outcry greeted the government's refusal yesterday to accept as refugees 175 Bosnians stranded on the Slovenian border with Austria. Opposition parties charged the Conservatives with callous inflexibility and one Liberal Democrat MP drew parallels with the British repatriation of German Jews in the 1930s. International aid officials also condemned the decision. In the House of Commons, Mr John Major, countered opposition attacks over the case by insisting the refugees were no different from 2m other displaced people in former Yugoslavia. He repeated earlier pledges that the UK would take some 600 recommended by the International Red Cross or the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and was ready to look at further cases. The prime minister insisted that a distinction had to be drawn between economic refugees and legitimate cases for asylum for those facing persecution. 'With the best will in the world, we simply cannot take everyone who, for understandable reasons, wants to leave Yugoslavia,' Mr Major told MPs. Britain has taken in far fewer refugees than some other European countries since Yugoslavia's disintegration over a year ago, though some countries, such as France, have taken even less. Since Yugoslavia's breakup, the UK has taken in 4,000 refugees compared with Germany's 253,000. Sweden and Switzerland have taken more than 70,000 each, while some 50,000 have gone to Austria and Hungary. Numbers have been smaller elsewhere. France has taken in only 1,108, Ireland 200 and Spain 120. The vast majority of refugees are from Bosnia-Hercegovina and Croatia, where ethnic fighting has been worst. The furore over the refugees, bused to the Austrian border on their way to the UK by a Leeds-based charity, Alert, has put British immigration policy under scrutiny. Britain has accepted six of the 183 refugees and two are awaiting a decision. Austria said yesterday it would provide the refugees rejected by Britain with shelter for three months until permanent sanctuary could be found. The refugees had waited a week on the Austrian border. Senior ministers yesterday fought a rearguard action against the attacks led by Alert and taken up by Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, defended his refusal to accept all but six of the refugees on the grounds that they failed to meet criteria laid down by the authorities. He said that Alert had been warned of the rules before the buses left the UK to collect them. While offering sympathy, Mr Clarke said the charity had ignored the warnings. 'At no time did they have any basis for raising the hopes of the unfortunate people concerned.' Mr Chris Lamb, an Alert official who has been at the Austrian border with the refugees, said on BBC radio that the British authorities had obstructed the charity's efforts to fulfil visa requirements, and that they had never been told by the gov-ernment not to go to the border. The refugees had been 'absolutely shattered and appalled' by the decision, Mr Lamb said. Mr Tony Blair, Labour's home affairs spokesman, said the government's rigid approach failed to acknowledge that a senior Red Cross official had recommended the refugees' evacuation and that the charity had prepared accommodation for them in Yorkshire. Amnesty International, the human rights organisation, described the decision as 'disgraceful'. Diary of despair, Page 2</p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / How To Spend It: The coolest ways to fight the summer heat - Lucia van der Post becomes a fan fan and finds that Y-fronts have shrunk I am one of the last of those Luddites who prefer fresh air and open windows to air-conditioning. To me, not the least of the charms of third world countries is their tendency to have hotels where you can still open windows by hand and can figure out how the taps turn on without the aid of an instruction manual. But, thanks to the recent heat wave in the south of England, even I have begun to think that maybe a little cooling air around the house might not come amiss. In Britain's climate a complete air-conditioning system, with attendant costs and disruption to the household, would scarcely seem worthwhile. But for the sort of sultry nights and stifling days that we have been having recently, a portable fan can make a lot of difference for a comparatively small outlay. You could spend as little as Pounds 16.99 for a small clip-on plastic fan by Pifco (clip it to desk or bedside table) or as much as Pounds 138.75 for the largest floor-standing Cinni. Cinni is the label most approved of by the style police, a classic of the world of whirring air, trailing overtones of ethnic chic, made as it is in India. It is, however, quite noisy, although I find the steady whirr quite soothing, romantic almost, reminding me as it does of tropical nights and sultry B-movies. Made of metal, either shiny chrome or painted matt black, there are table-top models (Pounds 82.50) and the 4ft high pedestal version (Pounds 185) which could cool a good-sized room. Stocks of Cinni fans are running low in many of their usual outlets (Harrods, John Lewis) but the Freud Shop, 198 Shaftesbury Avenue, London WC2 (tel: 071-831 1071) has a good supply. Xpelair offers a rather charmingly straightforward fan of the sort that is found in offices and hospitals up and down the UK. It is defiantly untrendy and no-nonsense to look at and does the job of moving the air around very efficiently. The noise level varies but the two and three-speed models are quiet enough for bedrooms if kept at the lowest speed. Higher speeds are noisy but move more air. Sizes range from small table-top models just 8in in diameter to a pedestal version 16in in diameter and 60in high The funkiest fan, though, has to be the one Viking Direct (suppliers of office equipment) is giving away free if - here's the catch - you spend Pounds 150 on one of its computers first. It looks as though it has been designed by Ettore Sotsass of Memphis fame, has the visual charm of a small sculpture and runs on batteries - you simply press a button and it produces a pleasing whirring and cooling of the air. It is small enough (about 18ins high) to be very portable. (Tel: 0800-424444). Those heading for enclosed spaces such as operas, theatres or tented marquees (last Sunday the temperature in the Cartier tent at Smiths' Lawn was reckoned to have risen to 110`F and it certainly felt like it) might like to have their own little folding fan. The Spotted Duck, 115 Fulham Road, London SW6, has a beautifully carved sandalwood version which smells exotically of spice as you wave it about. It costs Pounds 2.50. Fans mounted on the ceiling can be less intrusive and they are usually less noisy. The Xpelair version, called Whispair, is probably the most sophisticated and it does the job of circulating air very well. Sizes range from 36in diameter to 60in, with a drop down from the ceiling of 10in to 30in. All are the same price, Pounds 78.52 and the essential control switch is Pounds 18.77. Bemco is the wholesaler and it will be happy to give details of local stockists (tel: 081-874 0404). Those hankering for a bit Somerset Maugham-style colonial romance might look at colonial-style ceiling fans with brass bodies and rattan blades. These cost Pounds 99.50 from Christopher Wray Lighting of 600 Kings Road, London SW6. For serious air cooling, the most popular portable domestic device is the Holiday One refrigerated air conditioner unit made by Carrier. It normally costs Pounds 1,135 (currently Pounds 999 in Selfridge's sale) and will cool a fair-sized room. Most mechanical oscillating fans operate by moving existing air around but, for those who have been suffering from pollution this summer, it is worth knowing that there are ways of improving the quality of the air itself. Valerie Taplin, who runs the Air Improvement Centre at 23 Denbigh Street, London SW1, says that the levels of air pollution have brought her many new customers this summer, many looking for cleaner air. Her air purifiers sell at prices ranging from Pounds 50 for the smallest to Pounds 500, depending almost wholly upon size and capacity. These are basically boxes which are plugged into a socket and suck in dirty air at the back and expel clean air through the front, ionising it on the way. Most have two filters - a carbon filter which takes out gaseous pollution (car exhaust, fumes and the like) and an electret filter that takes out particulate pollution (unburned hydrocarbons, soot, lead oxide from traffic exhaust). The ioniser recharges the air and revitalises it, putting back in the negative ions (which Valerie Taplin describes as being like 'vitamins of the air') which polluted city air is low in. These air purifiers do not cool the air but make a difference to those with breathing problems. Valerie Taplin offers an emergency service for those in distress - she has delivered humidifiers in the middle of the night to a tracheotomy patient, an opera singer and many asthmatics. Come the hot weather, though, it is inevitable that the shops are out of fans - just as you can seldom buy a bikini when the summer is at its height ('Modom, they were all sold out in January'), or a hay fever remedy in the hay fever season ('everybody has been asking for it,' was my local chemist's excuse for being out of Beconase). My advice is this  - never mind if your local high street is looking like a frozen tundra, buy a good fan if you see it and next time the weather is sweltering you will be smiling. ***** Good news for chaps: the new improved Y-front by Jockey is about to hit the shops. Now you might think that there was little anyone could do with Y-fronts, that they were one of those all-time classics that should not be tampered with. But I have to tell you, you would be wrong. The boys at Lyle &amp; Scott are very excited by their recent discovery that there have been serious flaws in all previous thinking about sizing - no one, it seems, had ever bothered to measure this rather intimate area correctly. As a result Y-fronts, in common with all other underpants, were simply enlarged proportionally all round as they moved from little waists of 26 to gigantic ones of 54. After getting wives, girlfriends and even boyfriends to take a host of measurements, they discovered that while tums and bottoms varied hugely in size other measurements (most importantly the one from the navel to the top of the pubic bone) varied by an infinitesimal amount. As a result, the portion of the underpants that covers waists and bottoms is now sized appropriately while other measurements, from the middle down to the pubic bone, remain more or less static. This, it seems - and here I have to rely on the reports of the panel - results in much greater comfort and makes sure the double gusset is in perfect alignment. The new Y-front incorporates all the classic features of the old - in particular the waist-band (as integral to the design as the bumper is to the BMW). Made of woven elastic which has great flexibility (did you know your waist can expand by up to 5in when you sit down?) it is the key to the Jockey design. Whereas most men's underpants are sized simply as S, M, L and XL, the Jockey Y-front is sized in inches all the way from 32in to 58in (Marks and Spencer's XL Y-fronts go up to 48 inches). It is still made from fine ribbed 100 per cent cotton, just as it was on that momentous day in 1935 when Marshall Fields of Chicago filled a window with the new Y-front underpants and sold out by mid-day. At Pounds 4.25 for a classic brief (three for Pounds 10.99) it still represents value for money.</p>

			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> BOMB BOOM: Setting bombs is becoming more popular in Orange County, and no one  seems to know why. . . . In 1988, the sheriff's bomb squad handled 98 exploded  and unexploded bombs, but last year the figure was 138, and this year is ahead  of that pace. . . . The good news: Nearly half of the bombs never go off, most  are directed against property, not people, and bombs have killed only three  people since 1980 -- and one of them was the bomber. Jeffrey A. Perlman and  Sonni Efron  </P></p>

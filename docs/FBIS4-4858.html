			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- The state of Japan's  economy remains mixed with good signs and bad, and has entered  an "extremely delicate" stage, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii  said Wednesday [6 April]. Economic indictors have been patchy  and the experts are split in their views, Fujii told a regular  evening press meeting.    After describing the current state of the economy as  "extremely delicate," he reiterated the importance now of  steadily implementing the 15.25 trillion yen economic stimulus  package launched in February. Fujii made the comments after  Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno virtually declared an end  to the three-year recession at an earlier news conference,  saying the economy is gradually showing signs of bottoming out.    Considering a full-fledged tax reform to be enacted by the  end of the year, Fujii said the coalition government's basic  policy is unchanged from the aborted "National Welfare Tax" plan  announced by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. The plan called  for a permanent income tax cut and an offsetting 7 percent  welfare tax to replace the current 3 percent consumption tax.    A tax reform panel of the coalition parties reportedly  decided at Wednesday's meeting to compile an outline in late  June. Japan promised in its March market-opening package it  would reveal the details in June.    The Social Democratic Party, which strongly rejected the  welfare tax plan and forced Hosokawa to drop it, indicated in  its policy report Tuesday it would accept a consumption tax hike.</p>

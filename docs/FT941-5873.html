			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Life insurers face jump in fines The scale of fines faced by life insurance firms that fail to meet standards set by their regulator will rise sharply and is likely to start at more than Pounds 200,000. For the longer-term, however, Lautro, the self-regulating organisation for the life insurance industry, is considering a regulatory system providing a commercial incentive for firms to reach high levels of compliance. 'I believe that in the next year or so, regulators will need to start introducing a system based on incentives as well as penalties,' Mr Kit Jebens, Lautro chief executive, said yesterday. Lautro's warning that fines for those with seriously inadequate compliance procedures would increase substantially comes within a week of its imposing a record fine of Pounds 180,000 on Legal &amp; General. L&amp;G also had to pay Lautro's costs of Pounds 220,000. Mr Jebens said that, given the extensive guidance issued, there could be 'little excuse for failures to come up to standard' in the second round of inspection visits which has already begun. Lautro remains conscious, however, that the fines it imposes will bear directly or indirectly on a life office's policyholders, and so is keen not to embark on a practice that leads inexorably to ever-rising penalties. It believes that the adverse publicity suffered is a powerful weapon in itself. Mr Jebens said that one possible way of providing an incentive was a system of grading life companies in accordance with their record on compliance and customer care. Those which achieved the highest grade would be given greater room for manoeuvre than the other categories in the structures and procedures for achieving satisfactory standards.</p>

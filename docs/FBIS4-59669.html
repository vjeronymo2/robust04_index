The communique  said that the al-Ahmar gang had plunged its forces in to attack  Bayhan Province in Shabwah Governorate, but our forces, in close  cooperation with the masses in this district, repelled this  treacherous action of the al-Ahmar gang and turned them away.  Our forces in Bayhan District are continuing the repulsion of  the al-Ahmar gang forces. The Defense Ministry expressed  confidence that all plots and actions of the al-Ahmar gang which  are supported by some groups, particularly in Abyan, will be  doomed to failure and all their plots will be smashed on the  steadfastness of our armed forces.</p>

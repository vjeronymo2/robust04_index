			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / International Company News: Amtrak admits losing Dollars 33 on every ticket Amtrak, the heavily loss-making operator of US passenger train services, ended a dismal year with the yawning gap between its costs and revenues widening still further to Dollars 731m in 1993, its annual report shows. The state-owned corporation also performed poorly in getting its customers to their destinations on time, with only 79 per cent of its short-distance trains and 47 per cent of its long-distance services arriving punctually. Although the number of passengers carried rose from 21.3m to 22.1m, revenues of Dollars 1.4bn were far exceeded by expenses of Dollars 2.1bn, with the result that Amtrak lost Dollars 33 for every ticket sold. The year also brought the worst accident in Amtrak's history when the Sunset Limited express from Los Angeles to Miami plunged into an alligator-infested Alabama swamp in September, killing 47 people. Technically known as the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, Amtrak was set up by the federal government in 1971 to run the nation's loss-making passenger train services. These had previously been operated by the private railroad companies, which now concentrate on their profitable freight operations and continue to own the tracks. Amtrak was expected to reach a position where revenues at least covered its operating costs, but has proved unable to compete with air or road transport for speed or convenience and has continued to rely on federal support for its survival. The annual report shows that the corporation is due to receive Dollars 771.7m in federal funds this year, of which Dollars 351.7m is earmarked for operating losses and the rest for capital spending. But these sums are unlikely to reverse the steady decline in Amtrak's physical assets, which are ageing more rapidly than the corporation can afford to replace them.</p>

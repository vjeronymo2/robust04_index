			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Berisford near to closing takeover deal Berisford International, which in May lost a Pounds 184m takeover battle for C&amp;J Clark, the shoes group, is close to finalising an agreed bid for another UK business. The deal would be classed as a reverse takeover as it would be larger than Berisford, which has a market value of Pounds 110m. It is expected to be announced in January. Berisford shares rose 5p to 111p yesterday. After the failure to win Clark, when the controlling family shareholders rejected an offer which had been recommended by a majority of the board, Berisford is understood to have taken steps not to miss out again. The group, which yesterday reported a reduction in pre-tax losses from Pounds 65m to Pounds 5m for the year to September 30, has been in search of a business to acquire since it reduced its former operations, largely in the commodities and property sectors, to a minimal size, repaying debts that once stood at Pounds 1.2bn and nearly brought the company down. Mr Alan Bowkett, chief executive since January 1992, has assembled a management team with expertise in the engineering and building products areas and it is expected that the acquisition will be of a business in these sectors. It could be a division of a larger group. Mr John Sclater, chairman, said the deal would be 'the first step in the realisation of our strategy for the restoration of shareholder value'. The deficit for the year was struck after the Pounds 828,000 cost of the Clark bid. The balance sheet had net cash at the year end of Pounds 3.5m compared to debt of Pounds 15m, with the group raising Pounds 34.8m from disposals during the year. Shareholders' funds stood at Pounds 81.4m (Pounds 84.6m). Mr Bowkett said there were signs of a revival in the property market, with institutional interest showing a marked increase in recent months. The group expects to sell its remaining properties, valued at Pounds 18m in the UK and Pounds 5m in the US, at or above book value. Group sales rose to Pounds 69.3m (Pounds 50.5m) largely because of higher property sales. The trading loss was Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 5.9m). Severe weather conditions hit the US agribusinesses but Ketlon (UK), which makes automotive components, held turnover despite a fall in the European market. Bristar Trading, the cocoa trading associate, recovered from a poor first half in the second six months. The continuing push to sell or close activities led to further provisions of Pounds 13.5m, but this was partly offset by a Pounds 8.3m release of provisions made earlier but not needed. In 1992 net provisions were Pounds 58.2m.</p>

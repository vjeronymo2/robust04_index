			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Arts: Today's Television Being typecast is not a problem for Jane Horrocks the waif-like actress whose recent roles have ranged from Sally Bowles in the stage version of Cabaret to the fluffy secretary in Absolutely Fabulous. Tonight (BBC 2 at 9.25pm) in Suffer the Little Children she tackles a more emotionally demanding role (reviewed above by Clement Crisp). Man the Hunter is the theme of Desmond Morris's second investigation of The Human Animal (BBC 1 at 9.30). There is a kind of spurious intellectualism over the attempt to explain that the competitiveness and violence men needed when hunting for food is now chanelled into sport. Where does this leave the development of woman? Is she unchanged and should she stay minding the children and the hearth? In Witness (Channel 4 at 9 pm) former nun Karen Armstrong lays the blame for the ills of the world at the feet of the current Pope who she sees as a reactionary absolute monarch. Not much Christian charity observable here. At 11pm on the same channel Darcus Howe plays Devil's Advocate, quizzing Imran Khan about cricketers' dirty tricks.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Yin Nai-hsing (1438 0035 7451) and Li </F> Chien-kuo (2621 0256 2654) from Taipei]    [Text] With the crucial year 1997 approaching, such issues  as the orientation of Taiwan's relations with Hong Kong and  Macao and aviation agreements are attracting attention from  various quarters. Because the two sides of the strait, as well  as Hong Kong and Macao, will all be signatories to the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT], the Taiwan side may in  the future define the relations among the two sides of the  strait and the three parties as "one country, four regions" and  "two banks, four sides."    As to the aviation agreements, the relevant departments of  Taiwan will energetically push ahead with Taiwan-Hong Kong talks  on aviation rights and Taipei will also strive to open a  Taiwan-Macao air route, because it may even serve as a  "cushioning chip [huan chong chou ma 4883 0394 4693 4316]" for  the Taiwan-Hong Kong talks on aviation rights.    The first phase of the Macao Airport will be completed by  the  middle of next year. The Macao Government is very interested in  opening a Taiwan-Macao aviation line. The term of an aviation  contract is five years, so it should straddle 1999. If so, no  matter how the Taiwan-Hong Kong talks on aviation rights are  progressing, at least the Taiwan-Macao route can serve as an  intermediary transit base. But the Macao Government is hoping  that the two sides will sign a commercial aviation contract, so  as to lower the level of official involvement. Furthermore, the  Beijing factor is present in the Taiwan-Macao talks on aviation  rights, which will be a significant variable in the negotiation  process.    Beijing will resume sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macao in  1997 and 1999 respectively. The evolution of Hong Kong society  and Macao society under Beijing's rule and the development of  Taiwan's relations with Hong Kong and Macao will be a big  variable in the progress of cross-strait relations. The  departments concerned in Taipei are working hard on the  "Regulations on the Relations With Hong Kong and Macao," which  will govern exchanges between Taiwan and Hong Kong and Macao  after 1997 and 1999. Taking account of Beijing's response, the  relevant departments in Taipei have claimed to the outside that  these regulations are being deliberated under the framework of  "one country, two regions," but in actual fact the preamble of  the regulations will clearly define the Hong Kong region and  Macao region as distinct from the two sides of the Taiwan  Strait. Thus, with the additional definition of the Taiwan  region and mainland region contained in the regulations on the  relations between the people on both sides of the strait, the  framework of "one country, four regions" is coming into being.    Considering that the two sides and Hong Kong and Macao will  all be signatories to the GATT and the level of  internationalization of the two sides and three regions will  increasingly grow, Taipei's decisionmaking body on mainland  affairs will probably define the two sides and Hong Kong and  Macao after 1997 and 1999 as "two banks, four sides" and "one  country, four regions," so as to make less significant the  comparative appraisal [xiang dui ping bi 4161 1417 6097 3024] of  the two sides under the principle of "one country."    It is learned that when the group for developing the  regulations on Taiwan's relations with Hong Kong and Macao came  to Hong Kong to solicit comments from various circles in the  process of drafting the regulations, the people consulted  include some pro-China personalities, such as the persons in  charge of China-funded organizations, Hong Kong members of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference national  committee, and advisers on Hong Kong affairs.    Following the group's extensive consultations in Taiwan and  Hong Kong, the draft regulations on Taiwan's relations with Hong  Kong and Macao have been initially completed. Tomorrow, the  Mainland Affairs Committee will hold its first examination  session on the draft. In April, the drafting work will  officially enter the stage of examination by all ministries and  commissions. It is expected to be submitted to the Legislative  Yuan for deliberation before the end of this year.</p>

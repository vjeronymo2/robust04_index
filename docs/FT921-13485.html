			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / BT signs telecoms accord with cable group BT HAS SIGNED its first deal to provide a telecommunications service in conjunction with a cable television company. The agreement involves BT co-operating with Diamond Cable, which operates five franchises in the Midlands, in carrying customers' long-distance calls, but competing to provide telephone lines. Others among the cable TV operators, which are increasingly emerging as local rivals to BT, have signed deals with Mercury Communications, BT's only long-distance competitor, to carry their long-distance calls and switch their local calls - sending them to different routes. The deal with Diamond follows BT's calculation that, if competition is coming from the cable companies, it would be better to carry some of their long-distance business rather than leave it all to Mercury by default. BT is talking to other cable companies about similar deals. From the cable companies' point of view, BT's willingness to sign deals means they have a choice of operator. Mr Gary Davis, managing director of Diamond Cable, said it was his company's aim eventually to interconnect with Mercury and any other company which enters the long-distance market as well as with BT in order to achieve the cheapest rates for its customers. Diamond, whose main shareholder is Mr Allan McDonald, a US cable TV investor, will be the first UK cable company to do its own switching - others rely on Mercury. Diamond will install a System X exchange for switching to cover its Nottingham franchise in March, and plans to extend the service to its other franchises. System X is made by GPT, the UK telecommunications manufacturer. Mr Davis said that Diamond had been able to negotiate a better deal with BT than other cable companies had been able to negotiate with Mercury because it was doing its own switching.

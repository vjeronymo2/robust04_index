			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOREST FIRE EVACUEES RETURN HOME  </P> <P> About 5,000 people who were forced to flee a fast-moving forest fire near here  began returning to their homes Monday as the danger subsided, officials said.  </P> <P> The Awbrey Mountain fire, six miles southwest of Bend, a town of about 17,000  people, destroyed 28 homes, and burned across 3,300 acres of forest, grass and  brush, said Oregon Department of Forestry spokesman Jim Unterwegner.  </P> <P> The blaze was contained but still smoldered about a mile from the homes,  Unterwegner said.  </P> <P> More than 1,600 firefighters were expected to surround the fire with a  containment line by tonight, he said. At least five other fires are burning in  central and southern Oregon. The largest of them, the 1,300-acre Newberry  Crater fire about 90 miles south of Bend, forced dozens of vacationers to flee  area parks and resorts.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- China resolutely  opposes [jian jue fan dui 1017 0414 0646 1417] the "Murkowski  Amendment" approved by the U.S. Congress recently, stressed a  spokesman of the Foreign Ministry.    The remark was made by the spokesman while answering a  question at a news conference this afternoon.    The reporter's question was: The joint conference of the  Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States on  19 April adopted the modified Murkowski Amendment, which asserts  that the "Taiwan Relations Act" takes primacy over the Sino-U.S.  17 August Joint Communique. What is your comment on this?    The spokesman said: The Murkowski Amendment, which asserts  that sections 2 and 3 of the "Taiwan Relations Act" take primacy  over statements of U.S. policy, including communiques,  regulations, directives, and policies based thereon, is  designed, in essence, to negate the Sino-U.S. 17 August Joint  Communique, undermine [po huai 4275 0975] Sino-U.S. relations  and erect obstacles to the great cause of the peaceful  reunification of the Chinese people. It is absolutely  unacceptable [jue dui bu neng jie shou 4815 1417 0008 5174 2234  0649] and the Chinese Government and people are firmly against  it [jian jue fan dui 1017 0414 0646 1417].    He said: "We demand [yao qiu 6008 3061] that the U.S.  Government take this case seriously, abide by the principles  guiding Sino-U.S. relations as set forth in their three joint  communiques, live up to its promises, and immediately take  effective [qie shi you xiao 0434 1395 2589 2400] measures to  avoid bringing serious harm [yan zhong sun hai 0917 6850 2275  1364] to Sino-U.S. relations.</p>

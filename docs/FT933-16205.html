			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Sphere Drake seeks Dollars 150m via New York offering SPHERE DRAKE, the insurance and reinsurance company, is to raise more than Dollars 150m (Pounds 100m) through an initial public offering in New York, channelling most of the cash into its London market and Bermudian insurance subsidiaries. The move reflects increasing confidence among investors in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets where rates have risen sharply in recent months. Sphere Drake, whose majority shareholders include Electra Investment Trust, Dai Tokyo Fire and Marine, and Center Capital Investors, is a leader in the London reinsurance market. Net assets of the group's London-based insurance company currently amount to Pounds 75m. Net premium income amounted to Pounds 200m in 1992. The IPO offer will be underwritten by a group of underwriters for whom Smith Barney, Harris Upham, Lazard Freres and Salomon Brothers are acting as representatives. The IPO is scheduled for the middle of September, although no decision on timing has been made.</p>

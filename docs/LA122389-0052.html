			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART FROM EUROPE  </P> <P> Re "ART/LA89 Draws Mixed Reviews From Local, Out-of-Town Dealers" by Suzanne  Muchnic, Dec. 12:  </P> <P> I was amused by the Europeans' dismay regarding local collectors' lack of  sufficient interest in European art -- as if we should roll over and play dead  for anything from Europe.  </P> <P> The fact is that most of what came over from across the Atlantic was just not  that good or new, in the opinion of many attending ART/LA89. Just because  something is esoteric and ugly does not mean that it should automatically  qualify as art.  </P> <P> Could it be that local collectors don't care for the hodgepodge of detritus  that European galleries try to push off on what they think is an uneducated  local public? Convincing us of the merit of the work that they represent should  be more than hanging it and then criticizing us for not salivating at its very  sight.  </P> <P> S.

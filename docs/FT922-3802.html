			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Letter (1): Time to decide how Europe might be better managed Sir, Clear thinking is now needed. Of course the 11 can press firmly ahead. Denmark can go its own way, if it wants, and pay the price. But we should look further. The reality of European integration, taken one step further by Maastricht, reflects our practical needs, to solve at a European level problems that cannot be adequately dealt with by nation states. That includes most of our economic framework, hence the strong push from single market to single economic and monetary system. But the perception of the ordinary voter, not only in Denmark, is quite different. The ordinary voter believes that unelected bureaucrats are forcing nonsense down his/her throat. The lesson from Denmark is that current procedures are not acceptable and the flow of information between voters and the centre is inadequate. Europe is wrestling with complex and important issues, and voters are entitled to a political system that deals with the issues and takes the decisions under democratic control. What is needed is to strengthen the political centre, not weaken it. Even before the Danish vote political reinforcement was urgently needed, because of the drive to monetary union, enlargement and a more coherent foreign policy. Questions covering the relationships between Council, Commission, and European and national parliaments, as well as their internal workings, cannot be set aside to 1996, nor settled by secret negotiation. May I suggest we need much earlier a large and open conference designed to arouse and react to public opinion, focused on this very clear theme: 'We are building a new Europe, it is our only sensible hope for the future, isn't it time we decided properly how we are going to manage it?'

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Ozone layer pact tightened THE MONTREAL Protocol to protect the atmosphere's ozone layer, one of the most successful worldwide international environmental treaties, was yesterday tightened for the second time in its five-year life. The 93 signatories voted to bring forward the phase-out of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the chemicals most damaging to the ozone layer, by four years to 1996. Dr Mustapha Tolba, executive director of the UN environment programme and architect of the new agreement, called depletion of the layer 'an unfair action to future generations. We have done the damage; we have to undo it.' Scientists have feared that the thinning of the layer, partly caused by man-made chemicals containing chlorine and bromine, could lead to more skin cancer and lower crop yields. Dr Rumen Bojkov, head of ozone research at the World Meteorological Organisation, said the agreement would bring forward the date by when the layer had recovered to normal levels, and the 'hole' over the Antarctic had disappeared, by 10-15 years to the middle of the next century. The 'make-or-break issue' was the pledge by industrialised countries of an extra Dollars 500m (Pounds 331m) to a fund to help developing countries adapt in 1994-96, on top of Dollars 240m already committed. In return, developing countries agreed to bring methyl bromide, a substance used for preserving fruit and grain, under the protocol for the first time, and to freeze production at 1991 levels by 1995. The new agreement also stipulates industrialised countries will phase out: Halons, used in firefighting, by January 1994 instead of January 2000; Trichloroethane, used in cleaning metals, by January 1996 instead of January 2000; HCFCs, a less damaging substitute for CFCs, by 2030; Carbon tetrachloride, a rarely-used solvent, by January 1996 instead of January 2000; Even with implementation of yesterday's agreement, ozone depletion will worsen because of chlorine already in the atmosphere, Dr Bojkov said. The worst years are likely to be 1995-2005 when depletion of the ozone layer over inhabited regions of the northern hemisphere could reach a yearly 15 per cent average. The Copenhagen agreements fell short of some countries' demands, including the US and UK, and next year's meeting, probably in Nairobi, will face a testing agenda. Phasing out methyl bromide is posing problems because it is damaging to the ozone layer and few substitutes are available. Signatories will want to see if effective use of the fund to help developing countries adapt has increased. The fund has been criticised for its failure to move forward any ozone-saving projects. UN scientists also say more research is needed into how much ozone depletion is due to man-made chemicals and how much to natural causes. See Editorial Comment</p>

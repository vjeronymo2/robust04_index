			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Ecu activity could spark primary sector revival THE Ecu bond market is staging a comeback. The return of two European governments to the Ecu market, announced last week, boosted hopes that the recent recovery in secondary market prices will be followed by a revival in primary market activity. At its first auction of Ecu bonds since Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty sent the market into a downward spin last June, the French government last week sold Ecu710m (Dollars 585.5m) of 10-year notes, exceeding the indicated size of the transaction. Meanwhile, the UK, which was forced to cancel its last Ecu Treasury note auction scheduled for October, will issue Ecu500m of three-year notes on Tuesday. Other prestigious borrowers could soon return to the market. The European Investment Bank, which directly on-lends the funds it raises in the capital markets, had noted a decline in demand for Ecu funding from its borrowers, but 'clients are starting to ask for Ecu again,' according to Mr Philippe Marchat, director of finance and treasury at the EIB. Consequently, the bank is likely to return to the Ecu market in the next few months. In addition, the European Community is planning to fund part of its Ecu8bn balance-of-payments loan to Italy in the Ecu bond market, and Belgium is considering reviving plans for issuing an Ecu-denominated programme. But the Ecu bond market, which once had no trouble attracting top quality sovereign and supranational borrowers, has lost some of its charms. It has made good progress towards recovery, but is still in a fragile condition and would not be able to absorb the very large issues which can now be placed in the D-Mark or dollar markets. Further, for many borrowers, funding levels no longer appear attractive. For example, France, one of the earliest sponsors of the market, is committed to a target of raising 15 per cent of its funding in the Ecu market. But the Ecu market is no longer a cheaper source of funding than the French franc government bond market. The new French government Ecu OATs launched last week yield 8.16 per cent, nearly a quarter of a point more than French franc government bonds. For other countries, such as Italy and Spain, the Ecu still offers cheaper funding than domestic markets. But they can also raise cheaper funds, and in larger size, in the D-Mark sector. Nevertheless, the partial revival of activity in the primary market, which had ground to a virtual standstill, should help improve liquidity in the secondary market. Secondary market prices have already improved substantially. At the end of November, Ecu bonds yielded 50 basis points more than their theoretical value (based on bond yields in component currencies). That spread has tightened consistently since December, and is now about five basis points. Dealers also note increased volume in the secondary market, as retail and institutional investors return. 'The investment community is starting to realise that there may well be a happy ending to Maastricht after all,' said Mr Jim Pelgrift, executive director of Morgan Stanley International. In addition, there has been a realisation that the sell-off had been too severe. However, dealers are loath to predict when, or if, Ecu bond yields will fall through theoretical yields. This time last year, Ecu bonds yielded 40 basis points below their theoretical value. But investors now are likely to require strong evidence that European monetary union, with the Ecu as the single currency, is going to happen. Ratification of the Maastricht treaty by Denmark and the UK would be an important confidence booster.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Sumith Chakroberty] </F>   [Text] While the world media continue to focus on the  problems of economic reforms in Russia dominating the  U.S.-Russian summit talks in the Kremlin, the U.S. President,  Mr. Bill Clinton, and his Russian counterpart, Mr. Boris  Yeltsin, have taken yet another major step toward consolidating  international peace. The two presidents have reached an  agreement to end the targeting of their long-range nuclear  missiles at each other. Skeptics had been prompt to point to  the infirmities in the accord. Besides mentioning the  difficulties involved in carrying it out, they have pointed out  that the whole exercise could be easily reprogrammed to return  to the old position of aiming at each other. However, what is  being forgotten is that despite numerous problems afflicting  U.S.-Russian relations today, Russia as well as the other  constituents of the former Soviet Union have along with the  United States firmly set themselves on a course of nuclear  disarmament which is practically irreversible. Both the  intermediate nuclear forces treaty evolved at the  Reagan-Gorbachev summit in December 1987 in Washington and the  Strategtic Arms Reduction Treaty, START-II, arrived at in  January last year in Moscow during the last Bush-Yeltsin summit  have provided sufficient testimony of that course. In fact,  such a course signifies the final burial of the cold war,  conclusive evidence of which is offered by the latest accord.    Perhaps, more striking is Mr. Leonid Kravchuk, the president  of Ukraine, joining Mr. Clinton and Mr. Yeltsin in Moscow to  attest their signatures on an agreement envisaging the  destruction of the nuclear arsenal in Ukraine's possession.  This arsenal of 1,900 warheads is the world's third largest  after those of the United States and Russia. This accord too  has generated a lot of skepticism, fuelled as it is by the rise  of nationalist sentiments in the various republics of the  erstwhile USSR threatening to nullify the essence of whatever  has been achieved. Nevertheless, while not being blind to such  an eventuality, it is necessary to underline that these fears  are exaggerated, precisely when the public opinion in Russia and  other member states of the former Soviet Union is for protection  of their national interests alongside economic development and  national regeneration for which reinforcement of peace through  nuclear disarmament constituents an essential precondition. Mr.  Clinton has emphasized the U.S.-Russian role in promoting  European security.    The agreements about to be concluded in Moscow are of  far-reaching nature and would, therefore, actually exert a  powerful positive influence on global security in general, far  beyond the borders of the European continent. They are also in  full conformity with the Indian action plan for disarmament  spelt out by the late Rajiv Gandhi at the third special session  of the UN on disarmament.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Minimum payment level by class of hospital.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) HCFA establishes a minimum payment level by class of hospital. The minimum payment level for a hospital will equal a fixed percentage of the hospital's capital-related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs. The minimum payment levels may be no greater than the percentages of allowable capital-related costs that follow:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) 90 percent for sole community hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) 80 percent for hospitals located in an urban area for purposes of &sect;412.63(a) with at least 100 beds, as determined under &sect;412.105(b), that have a disproportionate share patient percentage of at least 20.2 percent as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined under &sect;412.106(b), and for hospitals located in an urban area for purposes of &sect;412.63(a) with at least 100 beds that qualify for disproportionate share payments under &sect;412.106(c)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) 70 percent for all other hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) HCFA will issue the minimum payment levels for each class of hospital in determining the additional exception payment in the annual notice of capital prospective payment rates, published in accordance with &sect;412.8(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Additional payments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A hospital is entitled to an additional payment if its capital payments for the cost reporting period would otherwise be less than the applicable minimum payment level. The additional payment equals the difference between the applicable minimum payment level and the capital payments that the hospital would otherwise receive minus any offset amount determined under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Determining a hospital's exception payment amount <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cumulative comparison.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For each cost reporting period beginning before October 1, 2001, the hospital's exception payment is determined by comparing the cumulative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments made to the hospital under the capital prospective payment system to the cumulative minimum payment levels applicable to the hospital for each cost reporting period subject to the prospective payment system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Offsetting amounts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any amount by which the hospital's cumulative payments exceed its cumulative minimum payment levels is deducted from the additional payment that would otherwise be payable for a cost reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Additional payment exception for extraordinary circumstances.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) A hospital may request an additional payment if the hospital incurs unanticipated capital expenditures in excess of $5 million (net of proceeds from other payment sources such as insurance, litigation decisions and other State, local or Federal government funding programs) due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the hospital's control. Extraordinary circumstances include, but are not limited to, a flood, fire, or earthquake.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A hospital must apply to its HCFA Regional Office by the later of October 1, 1992 or 180 days after the extraordinary circumstance causing the unanticipated expenditures for a determination by the Director, Office of Payment Policy, Bureau of Policy Development, HCFA of whether the hospital is eligible for an additional payment based on the nature of the circumstances and the amount of financial loss documented by the hospital.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Except for sole community hospitals, the additional payment is based on a minimum payment amount of 85 percent for Medicare's share of allowable capital-related costs attributable to the extraordinary circumstances. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sole community hospitals, the minimum payment amount is 100 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The minimum payment level applicable under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is adjusted to take into account the 85 percent minimum payment level (100 percent for sole community hospitals) under paragraph (f)(3) of this section for the unanticipated capital-related costs. The additional payment for the cost reporting period equals the difference between the adjusted minimum payment level and the capital payments the hospital would otherwise receive less any offset amount determined under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Special exceptions process.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For eligible hospitals that meet an age of assets test, receive any required approval from a State or local planning authority, and, in the case of urban hospitals, meet an excess capacity test, an additional payment may be made for up to 10 years beyond the end of the capital prospective payment system transition period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Eligible hospitals.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following classes of hospitals are eligible to receive exceptions payments under this special exceptions provision:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Sole community hospitals that have a current ratio less than or equal to 1.75 in the exception year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Hospitals located in an urban area under &sect;412.63(a) with at least 100 beds, as determined under &sect;412.105(b), that either have a disproportionate share of at least 20.2 percent as determined under &sect;412.106(b) or qualify for disproportionate share payments under &sect;412.106(c)(2), and that have a current ratio less than or equal to 1.75 in the exception year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Hospitals with a combined inpatient Medicare and Medicaid utilization of at least 70 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Age of assets test.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A hospital meets the age of assets test if_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: Surge at HK property developer Henderson Land Development Company, one of Hong Kong's largest property developers, yesterday reported a 51 per cent advance in net profits, to HKDollars 6.04bn (USDollars 782.4m) for the year to June 30, up from HKDollars 4bn the previous year and comfortably ahead of market expectations. Directors are marking the results with a cash bonus of HKDollars 1 a share, on top of a proposed HKDollars 1.20 dividend. This will bring the total for the year to HKDollars 1.60, an increase of 45 per cent over the previous year's payout. Earnings per share rose in line with total earnings, to HKDollars 3.78 from HKDollars 2.51. The Henderson Investment subsidiary reported a 16 per cent increase in net profits, to HKDollars 1.13bn from HKDollars 977m, with earnings per share improving 9 per cent to 47 cents from 43 cents. Shareholders are to receive a final dividend of 20 cents for a total of 29 cents, an increase of 16 per cent on the previous year. There will also be a warrant bonus issue of one warrant for every 10 shares held. Mr Lee Shau-kee, chairman, said credit-tightening measures in China had triggered a temporary slowdown in the local residential property market early in the financial year. The subsequent recovery was tempered in March by news of Hong Kong government measures to curb home prices. Mr Lee said these moves, twinned with a further tightening on lending from the banks, had sent home prices tumbling by between 15 per cent and 20 per cent and dampened turnover.</p>

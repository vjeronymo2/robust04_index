			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS SHOULD KEEP VALENZUELA, DANIELS  </P> <P> If you are dealt three aces in poker, do you toss one away in search of a  second pair?  </P> <P> If, as the rumor mill and the press suggest, a relatively unhealthy Kal Daniels  causes the Dodgers to drool over the prospect of trading him for some mythical  perfect third baseman, then the sight of Daniels a year and a half removed from  knee surgery, happy and ready for 1991, should make the Dodgers realize that  trading him would be an epic mistake.  </P> <P> Let's hope the New York Mets will let Darryl Strawberry go, and that the  Dodgers, buoyed by visions of Daniels, Strawberry and Eddie Murray anchoring  the lineup, will hold onto their aces and go for tangible greatness instead of  theoretical mediocrity.  </P> <P> ANDREW HYMAN  </P> <P> South Pasadena  </P></p>

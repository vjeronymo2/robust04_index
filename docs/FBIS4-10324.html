			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Straight Talk" program with host Osvaldo Rodriguez from </F> JUVENTUD REBELDE and guest Eloy Concepcion from TRABAJADORES --  live or recorded]    [Text] [Rodriguez] Lack of controls and criminality go hand  in hand. This is the subject Eloy Concepcion of TRABAJADORES and  I, Osvaldo Rodriguez of JUVENTUD REBELDE, will discuss today.  Eloy, I want to invite you to meditate a little on how the lack  of control of state institutions is fostering more criminal  acts. I think the most harmful criminal activity today is the  theft of the goods basic to survival that we have in minimal  amounts.    [Concepcion] The visible face of criminality is often that  of  the petty thief who steals a bicycle, breaks open a door in an  establishment to steal a few things, enters a home and steals,  etc. This is the classical thief who exists in all societies,  everywhere in the world.    I have meditated several times -- and at times when we held  a  roundtable meeting to discuss this subject and have listened to  the experts -- and I ask myself why there was an increase in the  crime rate last year, and why this problem has not yet been  definitively eradicated. Without trying to be absolutist and  without dreaming of being the only perfect society in the world  -- which is almost impossible because human beings react  differently under often incredible circumstances -- I keep  asking: Why does this theft or misappropriation exist in our  society? I want to add here the word missing inventory  [faltante] in four categories: theft, misappropriation,  embezzlement, and missing inventory.    The day before yesterday I brought up this subject for  discussion, because talking on the street -- we reporters must  converse a lot on the streets and listen to what people have to  say, especially those in lines, etc. -- I listened to two people  talking. A man was asking a woman how to get a pound of powdered  milk. The woman answered: Well, you know that the boat has not  arrived yet. I began to think: Well, the boat has not yet  arrived... and where are that man and woman going to buy the  powdered milk if she is not entitled to receive it as a special  food quota or because she has a child? But later, watching  Havana television and after reading the newspaper TRIBUNA DE LA  HABANA, I realized that the boat with powdered milk indeed has  not arrived.    I ask myself: Where does this milk come from? Milk that  often sells for dollars or for 100 or 200 pesos? I cannot  understand the astronomical prices that they charge for a pound  or a kilogram of powdered milk. I am not talking about the milk  that is bought at the hard currency stores, but the milk taken  from what is distributed to children and sick and elderly people.    [Rodriguez] And the milk used to make pasteurized milk.    [Concepcion] Yes. I would like to point out one thing: All  this demonstrates that we have very inefficient control  mechanisms. I do not want to mention the port because it has  been mentioned several times. I do not want to take it off the  list or add it to the list. I do not want to mention the dairy  complex, where that milk is produced, or the different plants  where the it is processed. I do not want to offend anyone, so I  am not naming anyone. But I do want to mention all those who  have to do with the powdered milk distribution network, because  it is painful. It cannot be allowed, in this society of justice,  that the state spend money to import milk later sold on the  black market.    [Rodriguez] We are talking about the lack of control by the  state establishments, which, in my opinion, is the origin of the  great black market that we are suffering today. We must say that  the great majority of the Cuban people are suffering, because we  must all go to that market to try to complement our diets --  even though it is a mirage, because no hard worker can purchase  these products at those prices. I believe these are products  that we could be receiving through normal means, through our  quota, our norm; yet they remain in those hands that, as you  said, are the hands of people who are uncontrolled, on the one  hand, and corrupt, on the other.    [Concepcion] Yes, because we spoke of an basic product like  powdered milk. We can mention other basic products, where the  state....[pauses] As reporters we know; we have the information.  This is a country that is facing a serious and difficult  financial situation. We understand that the government and the  leadership of the country, those comrades who are in charge of  administering the little hard currency we have, work miracles to  maintain and guarantee those products to the people who need  them. Sometimes, because of the blockade, we must go around the  world to purchase those products on credit, credit that many  times is not granted. We must obtain hard currency, one way or  another.    As a reporter, as a Cuban, and as a patriot, I am hurt by  these things, especially when one sees these products being sold  on the black market. Now, I ask the comrades, officials,  administrators, workers who have to do with this: Does it hurt  you that these products, which are brought into Cuba to cover  specific needs, fall into the hands of the black market? What  control is there at the port? What control exists in the dairy  complexes and the processing plants? What control is there in  the business system and in the distribution network? What  control is there over the truck driver who distributes the  product to the marketplaces and stores? What control is there  over the administrators of those stores to keep those products  from reaching the black market?    [Rodriguez] I believe that in the last few days, the Cuban  people have had the opportunity to see action by the police and  are getting upset with the attitude of certain administrations.  I have in mind one administrator who did not regard the 200 tons  of sugar stolen from his enterprise a considerable amount. At  that moment, Havana City was going through a sugar crisis. It  was the middle of the month and sugar still had not been  distributed to Havana City.    I believe there are many administrators who do not care. But  I also believe that some of these administrators are consciously  linked to this type of illegal activity. I am not saying that  they always participate in the distribution or theft network;  but they embezzle some for their home, some for their friends,  and some to solve the problems for John Doe at X enterprise  because, at the same time, he is solving X or Y problem for him.    I believe this to be a key element. It is something that  used  to be criticized in the enterprise assemblies which were held at  provincial levels, and it is something that continues today. It  is something that is unimaginable.    Just recently, I wrote an article in JUVENTUD REBELDE on  just  such an incident. It was about a person who used fake checks to  steal from several enterprises in the capital. Those  enterprises, in an attempt to solve the problem of another  supposed enterprise, would sell him their products. That  individual would simply sell those products on the black market  and thereby solve a number of problems far removed from the  purpose for which the goods had been produced.    [Rodriguez] Concepcion and I are talking here about the  damage caused by the lack of controls in state institutions.    [Concepcion] I think we cannot generalize the idea that all  comrades in state institutions are involved; the state  institutions have an organization of their own and comrades work  in various areas -- commerce, gastronomy, industry, and  construction. That is, there are comrades working at the  provincial level, at the state institution level, and at the  municipal level, who must oversee and check these institutions  in addition to what is done by the state administrative  apparatus, by the company, or by the ministry. Now I ask: What  do these comrades do? Why, if this is well known -- because if I  am aware, all people are aware of this problem -- why are not  the officials, administrators, and leaders of the people's  government in charge of that area not doing anything? But even  more serious is the fact that most workers from the labor  centers are aware of the problem. I think there is also the  other problem you mentioned: I think there is a false concept of  cronyism, of comradeship, of the idea that I see you and I let  you do it, because this follows the saying that a shrimp that  jumps into the water will splash.    [Rodriguez] No, it is not a shrimp, it is a shark. A shark  swims and splashes.    [Concepcion] Yes, something along that line. The truth is  that there is a moral lack. In my opinion, there is a lack of  morality in the administration and in the labor centers where  there are no requirements and where there is no moral authority  who can point a finger, because he himself is afraid of being  pointed at. He is not saying anything because he is afraid that  others will say: What can you say, since I saw you doing this?    [Rodriguez] And what about those who justify theft because  of  the current scarcity in the country? This subject will surely  demand another "Straight Talk" discussion, because lately people  would agree in saying: Well, what can we do about it if this is  the way things are? But I have not seen anyone stealing in order  to eat. This case I have not yet seen, although it might happen.  Everyone steals goods to sell on the black market.    [Concepcion] Theft has nothing to do with people's needs. I  was raised under capitalism, and my father taught me not to  steal. I think our people are sound and honest. Our workers are  honest and most of our officials are honest, I am convinced.  What happens is what you recently talked about: something called  bureaucracy, something called scheming or mechanization. We have  discussed these ideas at length. For instance, this morning I  used the term, missing inventory [faltante]. I think all these  things have created a negligence, a lack of requirements, and a  lack of aggressiveness. I would also say, as Luis Sexto once  said on this program that there is a passivism. I do not know  where the dividing line is between passivism and negligence, but  both are damaging to the Revolution. I think there must be some  elements behind this who either wittingly or unwittingly are  damaging the Revolution. When I was in the black market, I  realized that selling one kg of powdered milk brought for  children and the elderly is much more harmful than any direct  counterrevolutionary action.    [Rodriguez] I believe that many of these administrators do  not even know what is being stolen from them, because they do  not have the slightest controls over the products.    [Concepcion] If they do not have any controls, and if they  do  not know what is being stolen, they should not be  administrators. So, in addition to a raid against thieves, there  must also be a raid against the administrators who allow  themselves to be robbed.    [Rodriguez] Lack of controls and criminality unquestionably  go hand in hand. I think we have to cut off the hand of  criminality and the hand of lack of controls.</p>

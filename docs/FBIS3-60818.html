Yasin added  that Hamas will not stop its activities until the Jewish  settlements in the Gaza Strip are evacuated. Shaykh Yasin made  the remarks at a meeting this morning with Knesset Member Talib  al-Sani' at the Ramla Prison hospital where Yasin is being  imprisoned. [passage omitted with al-Sani' remarks]    At the same time, more than 1,000 Hamas and Islamic Jihad  leaflets were found last night in a large bag on Temple Mount  urging the termination of the peace process, attacks on the  settlers, and exacerbating the security situation in the  territories. The Jerusalem Police launched an investigation.</p>

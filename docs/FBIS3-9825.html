			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kazimierz Groblewski: "Lech Walesa--An </F> Opposition Activist"]    [Text] Lech Walesa has been acting in a way that is  characteristic of opposition activists: He weakens the  political rival at every opportunity--sometimes it is because he  has reasons, and, at other times, it is just for the sake of  principle. In a situation when the Democratic Union is not  capable of redefining its identity after the elections, Walesa  is currently the only "institution" that is persistently opposed  vis-a-vis the victorious coalition.    And he is dealing with the situation in his own way: He  would not be able to handle both the Democratic Left Alliance  [SLD] and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] so he courts and  bestows favors on the latter. He would have much less room for  maneuver if the SLD and the PSL were able to speak with one  voice, at least on the most important issues.    By rejecting Rosati's candidacy, Walesa made public the fact  that the SLD's personnel reserves are small. The president  says: Provide me with another candidate, please (as if  implying: After all, the party that won the elections should  have plenty of candidates!)    An opportunity arose, so it is worth doing some teasing and  showing that the victorious party does not have many candidates  ready to assume the post of deputy prime minister and finance  minister. In addition, the one candidate the SLD could possibly  submit--that is, Leslaw Paga--has already been submitted by  Walesa himself. After that happened, Kwasniewski could be  prevented from submitting Paga's name if only for reasons of  prestige.    The SLD and its leader responded in a way that can make Lech  Walesa happy. For four days now, it has not been capable of  coming up with any idea for solving the conflict. All the party  does is make announcements several times a day that it upholds  Rosati's candidacy.    The SLD feels offended by the facts. Regardless of how  unfair, in the SLD's view, the president's decision is, it is  still a fact. Walesa had a constitutional right not to sign the  nomination. He did it for reasons he officially announced and  also because he likes to provoke people and then wait to see  what the outcome will be.    The SLD leaders refuse to take cognizance of Lech Walesa's  decision. Aleksander Kwasniewski lets emotions take control of  him, accuses the president of trying to destabilize the state,  and flees from journalists in the Sejm building by using a  ladder. In this situation, which is difficult but occasionally  present in politics, one could have expected different behavior  from a politician of the year 1993, the chief of the biggest  deputies club in the Sejm and a "prime minister without  portfolio."    The coalition is acting in the president's favor. It was  known from the time of the elections that the issue of a  possible limitation of the president's powers will have to be  dealt with at some point. The coalition overdid it in their  "testing" by giving Walesa an answer to the question of how much  he can fear such a step on the coalition's part. As it turned  out, he does not have to fear that very much in the end. Marek  Borowski, who had threatened the president with limiting his  powers, was immediately disciplined by his own colleagues from  the Sejm deputy club.    Lech Walesa must be active so as not to be pushed into  oblivion. "Not to let them forget about me" seems to be the  president's main slogan of the moment. If he were to be  obedient, the PSL-SLD coalition would probably be gaining in  strength, whereas Walesa would become marginal.    And that is the way it is probably going to be; such  behavior  by Lech Walesa will be a permanent element of the political  scene until the time of the presidential elections. This is why  it made even less sense for the SLD to have reacted by feeling  offended by the facts.</p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Anne Bogart Quits Trinity: Anne Bogart, artistic director of the Trinity  Repertory Company in Providence, R.I., has resigned her post.  </P> <P> Bogart and the Trinity Rep board clashed earlier this week about cuts in the  proposed 1990-91 budgets. Bogart said any cuts would mean the termination of  staff members and the backing off from commitments. When the board, which said  the Rep's operating costs for the past few years were more than its box office  and fund-raising revenues, insisted on the cuts, Bogart resigned. No  replacement has been named. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

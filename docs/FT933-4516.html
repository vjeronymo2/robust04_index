			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices near 3-year lows as over- production continues THE RECENT slide in oil prices gathered pace again yesterday, taking nearby delivery quotations close to three-year lows. In the European physical market the October price for North Sea Brent Blend crude traded down 38 1/2 cents to Dollars 16.14 a barrel, the lowest level for the second month price since July 19, when it briefly dipped below Dollars 16 a barrel for the first time in three years. Mr Peter Gignoux, head of the energy desk at Smith Barney in London, said the problem was that there was 'precious little new news' and the market was concentrating on 'the re-occurrence of old facts', like the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries' inaction in the face of persistent overproduction and continuing concern about the prospect of the return of Iraqi oil to the world market. Traders hold out little hope that Opec will take decisive action at its meeting on September 25 to get members' aggregate production down to the target level of 23.6m barrels a day. According to the Middle East Economic Survey the organisation's production fell last month by 450,000 b/d to 24.335 b/d, but Mr Gignoux said MEES was 'the odd man out' with most estimates of August production being much higher. Topping the range at the moment is the Petroleum Intelligence weekly with its estimate of 25.05b/d. Meanwhile, said Mr Gignoux, UN-Iraqi talks were proving 'more ongoing' than many had expected, especially as the country had switched the emphasis from a one-off sale of Dollars 1.6bn worth of oil to pay for humanitarian aid to the permanent relaxation of the embargo on its exports.</p>

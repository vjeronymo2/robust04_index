			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: HE HARDLY RATES AS A FOUNTAIN OF BASEBALL INFORMATION  </P> <P> Eleven months after picking up a baseball for the first time, former cricketer  Julien Fountain of Bognor Regis, England, is heading for tryout camps in  Florida armed with Britain's best curve and a hunger to learn the American  pastime.  </P> <P> Fountain, a right-hander whose fastball has been timed at 65 m.p.h. on a rusty  radar gun, will pay his own way to tryouts with the Kansas City Royals, the  Chicago White Sox, the Dodgers and possibly the Philadelphia Phillies.  </P> <P> The 5-foot-8, 154-pounder is confident about his athletic ability but a little  concerned with his baseball knowledge.  </P> <P> "I took to it like a duck to water," he said. "I had a strong arm, but  obviously it was very erratic. The hardest thing was trying to keep it dead  straight."  </P> <P> The batters in America will no doubt keep that in mind.  </P> <P> "I'm chucking myself in at the really deep end with these tryouts," he said.  "I'm scared they are going to put me in a tactical situation. I can do the  physical stuff, it's the situations that are the problems."  </P> <P> Chucking himself in at the really deep end?  </P> <P> Someone has to introduce this guy to Yogi Berra.  </P> <P> Add Fountain: At the same time he was learning how to slide and tag up, he  injured his pitching arm and was unable to throw at full speed.  </P> <P> "My curveball suddenly came in June when I ripped all the ligaments in my  shoulder," Fountain said. "I was having physiotherapy and taking tons of  painkillers. I must have been hallucinating, because the curveball was just  moving like anything."  </P> <P> When the New York Yankees pulled an about-face and signed Ron Guidry to a  one-year contract after snubbing him all winter, the reason was clear.  Perfectly clear.  </P> <P> "It was my decision," owner George Steinbrenner said.  </P> <P> Was it hard to get new Manager Dallas Green to agree?  </P> <P> "Not at all," Steinbrenner said. "I just told him."  </P> <P> Scott Hastings of the Miami Heat was walking through the Milwaukee airport  recently when a man stopped him.  </P> <P> "He saw me standing next to a few of my teammates and asked, 'Who are you guys  with?' " Hastings recalled.  </P> <P> "I told him, 'We're with the Miami Heat.'  </P> <P> "And he said, 'Oh, you must be in town to play Marquette.' "  </P> <P> Quotebook  </P> <P> Former hockey star Bobby Hull on his divorce: "My wife made me a millionaire. I  used to have three million."  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOVE OF COEUR  </P> <P> I have found (Jerry Hulse's) articles on western Colorado and the recent Coeur  d'Alene (Aug. 6) truly wonderful to read. They capture the true atmosphere and  feeling of those places. I grew up in the mountains of Colorado and get  homesick for them at times. Thank you.  </P> <P> GERTRUDE R.

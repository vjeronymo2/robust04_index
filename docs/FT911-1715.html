			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets: Eastern Europe learns the symbolic value of bourses - The progress towards capitalism 'In many communist countries, stock exchanges rank with McDonald's as icons of capitalism. Establishment of a stock exchange, therefore, has symbolic value and may lend credibility to government efforts towards economic reform.' Match that assertion with stretched limousines awaiting customers at Warsaw airport and academic critiques on the Polish Road to Capitalism, and you can get something of the feel of what is happening in eastern Europe, or at the very least of what some (mainly western-based) entrepreneurs hope will happen in the developing capital markets of the former communist countries. The McDonald's analogy comes from a young, engaging and bright Italian lawyer who took up residence a few weeks ago in Prague, 'because I like the city'; presumably his bosses at the World Bank, in Washington, approved of the location, not least because of its political sensitivity. Mr Cesare Calari, a product of Bologna's Law School, picked up his near-perfect English at the John Hopkins university in the US, won a placement under the World Bank's Young Professionals Programme, and went to work for the bank's affiliate, the International Finance Corporation (IFC). Moving by way of responsibility and concern for central America, east Asia and southern Africa, he is back not too far from his native Italy, in the Czech capital of Prague. His job: the IFC's regional representative in eastern Europe, capital markets division. If stock markets take off in eastern Europe, some of the credit should go to Mr Calari and his IFC colleagues. They are now laying the groundwork for the emergence of capital markets in the former communist countries of the east, designing the essential nuts and bolts for a lot of new capitalist McDonald's, from Poland to Hungary, Yugoslavia to Czechoslovakia and Romania and, in between, to Warsaw, Belgrade, Zegrab, Ljubjana and (a delicate task from Prague) Bratislava, the Slovak capital. 'The current transition to market economies in eastern Europe is a task whose scale, scope and complexity have few precedents in economic history,' says Mr Calari. 'In addition, considerable emphasis has been placed on the development of capital markets and their tangible expression: the stock exchanges. These institutions must play a key role in the privatisation of state-owned enterprises by providing liquidity for their shares.' The task would be a formidable one, even on a clear playing field. But the field is by no means clear; it risks getting overcrowded with players, not always on the same side. Everyone wants to help eastern Europe along the road to developed capital markets, but the motivation ranges from exploitation to enlightened self-interest, from greed to genuine offers of help. The players include second and third-level financial intermediaries - many out for a fast buck - as well as the World Bank and IFC, the International Monetary Fund and Mr Jacques Attali's creation, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Then there is the Federation of Stock Exchanges in the European Community, and its component parts; the French are helping the Poles to see the capitalist light, while the Germans are giving a hand to the Czechs and Hungarians. The Poles are also talking to the British and the Canadians, and no one appears to be co-ordinating anything. At a recent London conference on European Securities Markets in the 1990s, Mr Calari agreed that there was a risk of confusion, conflicting advice, exploitation and overkill, but was too modest to say whether the IFC was best placed to take the lead role. The work to be done is enormous. The political commitment appears to be there, although varying from country to country, but there is not much else. For all practical purposes, none of the east European countries has the regulatory and legal framework necessary for the efficient conduct of securities business, an essential assurance for western investors. The concept of the joint stock company hardly exists, and there is an appalling minefield (witness what is happening in the former East Germany) over property rights and ownership. Audited accounts do not exist; there is little or no corporate information available for analysis; the business press is under-developed or scarred by too many years of communist rule; there are infrastructural problems, even down to market basics such as telephones and photocopying machines, to say nothing of trading screens and computers, and there is little hard currency with which to buy them. Everyone is offering to help, and hoping to gain. But there is hard work to be done, not just in establishing capital markets but also in educating potential investors. No one should expect quick results.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Dr. Dragoslav Avramovic, </F> governor of the National Bank of Yugoslavia, by Dusko Petrovic;  place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Avramovic] You have noticed that industrial  production has continued to grow. Weather permitting, we are  now facing a big harvest, so it seems, which will contribute to  a better supply of our market, a stabilization of prices, and  increased earnings. There are another two or three elements.    Regarding one element that has been discussed extensively in  the press, our farmers can rest assured that the value of the  dinar will remain fixed and that there will be no deviations or  compromises on this issue. Therefore, what they will get in  June will be the same as what they will get in September,  October, and so forth. Therefore, there is no reason to fear  depreciation. This is the first thing.    Second, the salaries in nonproductive branches have  increased  considerably, especially in the higher wage categories. These  salaries are stabilizing and we believe that for three months  the salaries in the higher categories do not need to change.  However, at the same time we must increase the salaries in the  lower wage categories. Because we will maintain stability in  this balance and equilibrium in the higher strata of salaries,  the overall production and increase in production will  contribute that all this will hold up, balance itself out, and  that the increased spending power in the low income groups will  be compensated for by the increase in production.    [Petrovic] How can we overcome the current deadlock in the  relations between banks and the economy?    [Avramovic] This problem must be resolved. I believe that  we will encounter a further expansion of our monetary system.  At the same time we must take care of our foreign currency  balance sheet. These are new issues that are coming our way. I  believe that we will successfully overcome the problems that are  appearing now and that the satisfaction of the economy's needs  for credits will be at a high level of realization and at a  satisfactory level of equilibrium in the balance of payments.    [Petrovic] Are there any grounds to fear the reappearance of  the [currency] dealers' cuts?    [Avramovic] I do not think so. Namely, the fourth series of  dealers' cuts that we first encountered in January and then in  March, April and now, has so far been lower that any earlier  cuts. I do not know why we have dealers' cuts now. (?It should  not have been a big one). One of the factors is that we have  assumed that we are nevertheless an island in Europe and we are  rather susceptible to these influences despite the blockade,  that is, influences in the circulation of capital, you know,  that is a problem [sentence as heard]. However, I believe that  problem will be easily resolved. [end recording]</p>

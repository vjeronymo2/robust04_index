			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Economic Diary Important inflation data in Germany this week will affect the market's perception of how quickly and how soon the Bundesbank is likely to lower its lending rates. Attention today will focus on the October M3 growth rate with many believing it will fall within the 4.5-6.5 per cent target range for the first time this year. The consensus forecast suggests M3 in October will rise by 6.7 per cent. Later in the week, the Federal Statistics Office releases the preliminary cost of living index for November. In the year to October, cost of living inflation was 3.9 per cent, its lowest since June. Analysts expect the index to have risen 3.7 per cent in the year to November. The last week before the Budget in the UK brings few economic statistics, but the Confederation of British Industry releases its November industrial trends survey on Friday. It will give a clue as to whether or not the UK is enjoying a non-inflationary recovery with strong exports. On Thursday, the CBI produces its forecasts and recommendations for the Budget. In Spain, third-quarter unemployment is forecast to be about 23 per cent. This measure comes from a quarterly survey based on a rather loose definition of unemployment. A poor figure will probably boost the bond market in the expectation that pressure will increase for lower interest rates.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               STATISTICS TO BE RELEASED THIS WEEK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Country  Economic                   Day            Previous       Median          Statistic                  Released         Actual     Forecast  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK       CBI industrial trends      Fri 26                -            - US       Oct Durable goods orders   Wed 24             0.7%         1.8%          Auto sales Nov 11 - 20     Wed 24         7m units     7m units          Truck Sales Nov 11 - 20    Wed 24       5.4m units   5.2m units          Weekly Money supply M1     Fri 26   Dollars 10.9bn  Dollars 1bn          Oct Bank credit            Fri 26             4.3%            - Japan    Sep leading indicators     Mon 22              50%            -          October inflation          Fri 26             1.2%         1.2%          Oct Retail sales           Fri 26            -3.7%        -3.8% Germany  Oct Money Sup M3           Mon 22             6.8%         6.7%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DURING THIS WEEK. . .  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Germany  Oct producer price index                     -0.5%        -0.3%          Nov prelim cost of living                     3.9%         3.7%          Oct Import prices                            -1.5%         -3.5          Ifo business climate                         87.7%            - Spain    Q3 unemployment                              22.3%          23% Italy    Sep wholesale price index                     6.5%            -          Oct money supply                              7.8%         7.7% Belgium  Nov inflation                                 2.7%         2.6% Denmark  Oct inflation                                 1.2%         1.5% Canada   Sep earnings                                  1.7%         1.5%  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

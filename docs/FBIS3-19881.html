After several hours of talks Foreign Minister Kinkel  said in the afternoon: "I do not see any progress here or any  chance of a breakthrough today." In the evening the efforts of  Greek European Affairs Minister Pangalos, current president of  the EU Council, failed to persuade the foreign ministers of  Britain and Spain, Hurd and Solana, to accept a compromise with  the other 10 EU partners and would-be members Finland, Norway,  Sweden, and Austria on the issue of the blocking minority in an  enlarged EU. Already the three previous rounds of talks in the  Council of Ministers had failed because of London and Madrid's  refusal to accept a change in the blocking minority from the  current 23 out of 76 votes to a future 27 out of 90 votes.  After an agreement had been reached with Norway on the fishery  dispute, membership negotiations with the three Scandinavian  countries and with Austria were concluded last week, with the  exception of the issue of the future rules for voting in the  Council of Ministers.    After the public controversy about Foreign Minister Kinkel's  way of conducting negotiations during the membership talks, on  Tuesday the German minister and his French colleague Juppe  demonstratively went to the meeting in Brussels with a  coordinated position.

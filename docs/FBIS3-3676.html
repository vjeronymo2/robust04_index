In an interview with reporters after his talks with Hata in  the morning, Chernomyrdin said "Russia will act without haste."    The Russian prime minister said he also discussed with the  Japanese foreign minister on the issue of bilateral trade and  economy cooperation.    "One way or another way we will move towards the signing of  a  peace treaty between our countries," he pointed out.    Responding to a question about the possible transformation  of  the Group of Seven industrial countries into a group of eight,  including Russia, Hata told reporters that Russia's membership  must be considered within the frame of this group of countries.    He added that Japan should maintain "close contacts" with  Russia, which is increasing its influence on the modern  international politics.

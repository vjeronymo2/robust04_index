			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Future looks up for Scots engineers ENGINEERING companies in Scotland reported a modest rise in optimism yesterday. Intake of orders and capital investment had increased, with the electronics industry and medium-sized engineering companies reporting growth while heavy engineering had a drop in orders. Scottish Engineering, which published its quarterly survey for the three months to June of its 300 members as well as some electronics companies that are not members, said the survey showed a 'positive move out of the depths of recession across the industry'. The level of job losses was slowing down, the survey said. The proportion of companies reporting increased optimism about their prospects was 41 per cent, compared with 32 per cent in the previous survey, which covered the period to the end of February. The proportion saying their optimism was unchanged was static at 44 per cent. In the electronics sector, some 42 per cent of companies said their orders had increased, while 28 per cent said they had declined. In heavy engineering, though, more companies reported a fall in orders than reported an increase. The foundry sector appeared to have arrested its orders decline, but improvement was patchy. Only light engineering companies said they had increased their staffing level, while other parts of the industry were still shedding labour. Overtime worked was falling, with the heavy engineering sector showing the sharpest fall. On capital investment, 18 per cent of companies said they were increasing their spending while 19 per cent said they were reducing it. The rest reported no change. The electronics sector reported the biggest increase in investment in training.</p>

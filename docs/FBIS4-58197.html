			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, "vehement critic of </F> PLO Chief Yasir 'Arafat," by an unidentified DER SPIEGEL  correspondent; place and date not given: "We Will Be the  Losers"]    [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Is the signing of the autonomy  agreement for Gaza and the region of Jericho the beginning of a  more peaceful era in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?    ['Abd-al-Shafi] Quite certainly not. The people here are  tired, frustrated, and disappointed. In addition, because of  the latest cordoning off of the occupied territories, they are  ruined economically. We are looking into the future with  anxious expectation.    [DER SPIEGEL] Where does this pessimism come from? After  all, the Palestinians now have the opportunity to shape their  lives themselves.    ['Abd-al-Shafi] There is no reason for euphoria. Since the  conclusion of the Oslo agreement, the PLO, Israel, and also the  United States, the main sponsor of the peace process, have  succumbed to a collective self-deception. We must shake them  awake: Open your eyes; this agreement will not make peace,  because the most basic Palestinian demands remain unfulfilled --  putting an end to Israel's illegal claim to the occupied  territories.    [DER SPIEGEL] Instead of a lasting peace you see the  agreement only as a short-lived cease-fire?    ['Abd-al-Shafi] I am afraid we will see a repetition of the  past: a bloody confrontation between Israelis and Palestinians.    [DER SPIEGEL] Even though the leader of the Palestinians,  Yasir 'Arafat, supports the agreement?    ['Abd-al-Shafi] This makes it even worse. With his  signature under the new agreement he only legitimizes the so-far  illegal claim of the Israeli occupation power.    [DER SPIEGEL] But 'Arafat is praising the autonomy agreement  as the first step toward a new Palestine.    ['Abd-al-Shafi] Pure delusion. Already with the skeleton  agreement the PLO leadership tacitly accepted the more than 140  Jewish settlements in Gaza and in the West Bank within the  occupied territories as independent legal and administrative  units -- answerable only to the Israeli authorities. This is  practically an annexation. There will be two kinds of law, just  as during the colonial time -- and this means specifically: An  Israeli who steals a car in Gaza is put on trial in Tel Aviv.    [DER SPIEGEL] The agreement applies to only the five-year  transition period for the time being, not to the final status of  the occupied territories.    ['Abd-al-Shafi] Nevertheless, the transition agreement is  fateful, because, in the meantime, the Israelis continue  building their settlements and establish new facts with that.  Even the withdrawal of the Israeli Army is, in reality, only a  transfer of the armed forces behind the fences of the  settlements, where Israelis live like in territorial military  villages.    [DER SPIEGEL] Not even 5,000 Israelis among almost 1 million  Palestinians: In particular in Gaza it is already foreseeable  that the settlers will not stay forever.    ['Abd-al-Shafi] It may be that they will withdraw from Gaza  and that they want to use the settlements there only as a point  of negotiations in the discussions about contentious issues --  such as the status of Jerusalem.    [DER SPIEGEL] Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has  already announced that he also wants to tear down settlements in  return for peace.    ['Abd-al-Shafi] Perhaps he will close one settlement or the  other, because the financial expenditures is out of proportion  to the military and strategic benefit. However, this does not  mean any basic readiness to abolish the Jewish enclaves.    [DER SPIEGEL] However, time is working against the  Palestinians. Can you afford at all to refuse the current offer  of peace?    ['Abd-al-Shafi] In view of the quarrels and infighting among  us Palestinians, we will be the losers given if the Israelis  present us with an independent state on a silver platter.    [DER SPIEGEL] You think that internal reforms of the PLO are  more urgent than the peace package?    ['Abd-al-Shafi] Regardless of the question of whether we are  for or against the agreement, we must finally put the  Palestinian house in order. We want to build a better future  here.    [DER SPIEGEL] This is precisely what 'Arafat is saying.    ['Abd-al-Shafi] But he is not doing anything for it. So  far, at least, he has not committed himself to democratic rules.    [DER SPIEGEL] And this is how he will rule in Gaza and  Jericho?    ['Abd-al-Shafi] I hope that in the personnel decisions  'Arafat will not sacrifice the necessary competence to the  various cliques or his personal preference. We will not permit  such nepotism, the people wil rebel against him.    [DER SPIEGEL] Within months after the return of the PLO, the  Palestinians are to vote on their leadership in free elections.  Will you run against 'Arafat on your own ticket?    ['Abd-al-Shafi] It is too early to say that, but I do not  want to rule out that I will be a candidate -- either as an  individual or on a ticket together with other independent  politicians.</p>

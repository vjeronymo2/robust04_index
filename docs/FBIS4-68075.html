			<p>BFN     [Text] Bingol--Four Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] terrorists,  who fled from that organization and surrendered to the security  forces some time ago, have revealed that the PKK killed  prominent and respected people in southeastern Turkey and then  blamed the counter guerrilla organization for its crimes in  order to provoke the people in the region.    The four terrorists surrendered to security forces near  Bingol last week. Yesterday, they attended a meeting in the  sports center in Solhan. One of them, whose alias is "Hayri",  revealed that a former PKK member killed Vedat Aydin, a former  head of the People's Toil Party organization, in Diyarbakir  Province on 10 July 1992. He said: "The PKK blamed the counter  guerrilla organization in order to provoke the people. I  witnessed Semdin Sakik, head of the PKK organization in the  region, instruct his men to kill 200 militants. I surrendered to  the forces of the state after witnessing the merciless massacres  by the PKK."    One of the other terrorists revealed he was an electronics  expert. He said several militants took him to the mountains to  work for the PKK in the electronics field. But he said he  escaped at the first opportunity. He claimed that Semdin Sakik  abandoned his men, leaving them in a miserable condition on the  mountains, and went to France. The terrorist also revealed that  a woman militant who joined the PKK in Istanbul wishes to leave  the organization but is not allowed to do so. The repentant  terrorist said: "I fled after witnessing the developments in  that organization."    Kemal Iskender, director of police in Bingol; Staff Major  Erguder Toptas; leading officials of several establishments; and  a large group of people were at the sports center to hear the  terrorists' revelations.</p>

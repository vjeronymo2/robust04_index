			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Recession found to hit IT jobs hardest EXECUTIVE jobs in the computer sector have suffered worst in the recession but their redundancy packages are among the most generous, according to Drake Beam Morin, outplacement company. The company, which provides counselling for people made redundant, found that 28 per cent of executive clients and 33 per cent of other clients came from information technology companies. The survey says that most IT companies have progressive management practices and while some have had to abandon jobs-for-life policies, they have offered redundancy packages on average 30 per cent higher than is usual in other sectors. Three quarters of recent pay deals are worth between 4 per cent and 5.9 per cent, with most towards the lower end, according to a report from Incomes Data Services, the independent pay analysts.

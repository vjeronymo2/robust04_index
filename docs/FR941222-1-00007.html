			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) This section and &sect;&sect;3001.57a through 3001.57c are initially to be effective for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited period of five years from the date of their adoption by the Commission. During  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that period the Commission will continue to analyze the need for these rules to enable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Postal Service to respond to changes in the market for expedited delivery services,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the impact of these procedures on Postal Service proposals. These rules will cease  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be effective at the end of this period unless they have been reissued by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission following a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> which provides an appropriate opportunity for public comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;3001.57a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Market Response Rate Requests_data filing requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Each formal request made under the provisions of &sect;&sect;3001.57 through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3001.57c shall be accompanied by such information and data as are necessary to inform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Commission and the parties of the nature and expected impact of the change in rates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed. Except for good cause shown, the information specified in paragraphs (c)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through (i) of this section shall also be provided with each request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this section, the information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by &sect;3001.54 (b) through (r) must be filed only for those subclasses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and services for which the Postal Service requests a change in rates or fees. Test period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volume, cost, and revenue estimates presented in satisfaction of rule 57a shall be for four  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> postal quarters beginning after the filing date of the request. The cost roll-forward may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be developed by extending the cost forecasting model used in the last omnibus rate case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (utilizing available actual data). Volume and revenue estimates required by these rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall utilize, to the extent practicable, the factors identified in rule 54 (j)(6), and must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fully explained, with all available supporting documentation supplied, but they need not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be econometrically derived.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Every formal request made under the provisions of &sect;&sect;3001.57 through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3001.57c shall contain an explanation of why the change proposed by the Postal Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is a reasonable response to the change in the market for expedited delivery services to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which it is intended to respond.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Every formal request made under the provisions of &sect;&sect;3001.57 through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3001.57c shall be accompanied by the then effective Domestic Mail Classification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Schedule sections which would have to be altered in order to implement the changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed by the Postal Service, and, arranged in a legislative format, the text of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement Domestic Mail Classification Schedule sections the Postal Service proposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) In addition to the required test period cost estimates, every formal request  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made under the provisions of &sect;&sect;3001.57 through 3001.57c shall be accompanied by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a statement of the attributable costs by segment and component for Express Mail service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined in accordance with the attributable cost methodology adopted by the Commission in the most recent omnibus rate case, for the base year used in that case, and for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each fiscal year thereafter for which cost data is available. If the Postal Service believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that an adjustment to that methodology is warranted it may also provide costs using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative methodologies as long as a full rationale for the proposed changes is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Each formal request made under the provisions of &sect;&sect;3001.57 through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3001.57c shall include a description of all operational changes, occurring since the most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recent omnibus rate case, having an important impact on the attributable cost of Express  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mail.

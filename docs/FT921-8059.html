			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Observer: Purdah progress The Treasury has been forced to drag itself into the late 20th century; it has relaxed its rules over pre-Budget purdah. This year, the curtain, which otherwise normally shields Moslem women from strangers, has been lifted because of a recent high-level review of the more than slightly absurd custom of muzzling ministers and officials for three months before the annual Budget statement. Presumably, the new thinking is that silencing Norman 'recovery is round the corner' Lamont and his colleagues would give the opposition an unfair pre-electoral leg-up. Anyway, the worst secret - notably the less-than-dazzling condition of the economy - is long out of the bag.</p>

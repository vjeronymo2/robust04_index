			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Bank of Scotland builds capital for lending Bank of Scotland yesterday said it would continue building up capital to back future lending growth as it disclosed an 81 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 117.6m to Pounds 213.2m. The bank achieved a 6 per cent 'tier one' ratio of core capital to risk-weighted assets - an international benchmark for capital strength  - by doubling earnings per share from 5.4p to 10.9p. But its shares fell by 10p to 196p with disappointment about a 13.9 per cent rise in the interim dividend from 1.87p to 2.13p. Mr Bruce Pattullo, the bank's governor, said it needed to retain earnings to be able to grow. He added there was 'clearly room to think' about the full-year dividend given cover five times earnings for the half year, but 'the market knows that we need retentions to finance growth, and we are not going to do anything daft'. Unlike the 'big four' English clearing banks, Bank of Scotland increased lending by 4 per cent from the year-end to Pounds 23.6bn. Most of the rise came in England, where the bank has increased its market share. Net interest income rose by 13 per cent from Pounds 376.4m to Pounds 424.7m, including a Pounds 10.9m dividend from the flotation of the venture capital group 3i. The net interest margin widened from 2.58 per cent to 2.71 per cent. Although margins on loans to large companies fell because of the re-emergence of competition among banks, the squeeze was offset by improved margins on wholesale deposits, and maintenance of mortgage margins. The ratio of costs to income fell to 47.9 per cent from 48.9 per cent despite a 9 per cent rise in costs from Pounds 271m to Pounds 295.6m. This included a Pounds 12.6m provision for payments to staff under a profit-sharing scheme. Specific bad-debt provisions fell to Pounds 109.8m from Pounds 157.9m, and there was a further general provision of Pounds 8.8m, compared with Pounds 16.5m. The bank said economic recovery should benefit provisions in the second half. Non-interest income rose by 8 per cent to Pounds 198.3m, including a rise of Pounds 11.9m to Pounds 81.9m in branch-based commissions in the clearing bank. Mr Pattullo said growing competition would limit the scope for further rises. Difficulties at Forthright Finance, a finance house, led to a fall in pre-tax profits at its Bank of Wales arm to Pounds 0.3m from Pounds 0.4m, but NWS Bank increased profits from Pounds 37.6m to Pounds 48.3m. Bank of Scotland is still considering acquiring a building society, which could provide cheaper retail funding. But Mr Pattullo said it had no need to find an outlet for excess capital. Annualised pre-tax return on equity rose to 34.4 per cent from 19.2 per cent, and annualised return on assets rose to 1.4 per cent from 0.8 per cent. The tier 1 capital ratio rose to 6 per cent from 5.8 per cent. Lex, Page 22</p>

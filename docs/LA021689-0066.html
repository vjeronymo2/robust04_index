			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN UNBIASED LOOK AT GANGS  </P> <P> This is my first letter ever written to the author of a newspaper article.  </P> <P> I did so because I wish to express my appreciation for the first unbiased  article about gang violence and use of automatic weapons. I refer to the  article about gang problems in Pomona (Feb. 5, Times).  </P> <P> It is fashionable to say "ban AK-47 assault rifles and cut gang crime." This is  a simplistic approach to a complex problem. A gun ban will no more stop street  violence than liquor bans stopped drinking, bans on knives stopped stabbings,  and controls on spray cans stopped graffiti.  </P> <P> Your article explored both sides of the problem.  </P> <P> RICHARD HOLMSTROM  </P> <P> City of Industry  </P></p>

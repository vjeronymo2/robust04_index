			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> A ROUGH START FOR AIKMAN  </P> <P> Shortly after quarterback Troy Aikman had been pulled from the football game  early in the fourth quarter Sunday, Babe Laufenberg walked over to the Cowboys  rookie and whispered a few words of consolation.  </P> <P> "I told him, 'Troy, you don't ever pull the other 10 people out, you pull out  the quarterback,' " said Laufenberg, the vagabond backup who is No. 3 here now  and didn't even put on a uniform Sunday against one of his former teams.  </P> <P> "It's not like you have a car with a flat tire, and you change tires and you  roll on down the road. It ain't that easy in football. Troy knows that. When  you play the position, you accept it. If things are going badly, you're the guy  who has to go."  </P> <P> Aikman insisted he had no problems with Coach Jimmy Johnson's decision to give  backup Steve Walsh some work, particularly after Aikman managed only six  completions in 21 attempts for 83 yards, was intercepted twice, sacked four  times and harassed as long as he played in a 30-7 loss to the Washington  Redskins.  </P> <P> "I have no problems with that," Aikman said of the switch to Walsh. "Any time  the offense is struggling, you make a change. ... I understand the nature of  pro football. We weren't moving the football. I understood when he made me the  starter there would be days like this.  </P> <P> "Any time you don't put points on the board, as a quarterback you feel like  it's your responsibility. ... But there's a lot of football left this season.  We have to work harder. Everybody knew it wasn't going to be easy, that we'd  have some bad times before we got better."  </P> <P> Clearly, for the Cowboys, these are the worst of times. They are 0-3 for the  first time since 1963, and they are reeling. It's also not going to get much  better, with a home game next week against the undefeated Giants and the 49ers  arriving two weeks later.  </P> <P> They also must contend with a very unhappy football coach. Johnson was talking  gloom and doomsday Sunday evening, starting off his postgame news conference by  saying the obvious: "We're not a good football team right now. It's not a good  feeling. We will not accept being a poor football team. We'll work and do  whatever it takes. Anyone who is not willing to work, let me know. I feel sure  they will work."  </P> <P> Asked if he would try to avoid discussing Sunday's debacle, Johnson snapped: "I  don't want these players to forget how awful they looked. We are not a good  football team and they shouldn't fool themselves into thinking otherwise. ...  They've got to realize they have to move up to a new level. We can't live with  it. I certainly can't live with it. ... We have to work harder.  </P> <P> "We'll spend more time on the field, more time in the meeting room, more time  running after practice."  </P> <P> Johnson also said Aikman would continue to be the starter and he did not hold  him entirely responsible for an offense that managed only 10 first downs, 190  yards and 3.2 yards per play.  </P> <P> Walsh, meanwhile, was simply grateful for the chance to play a bit. It was his  first action of the regular season, and he has made it known he would prefer to  be playing regularly elsewhere by the time the NFL's trading deadline comes on  Oct. 17.  </P> <P> The Cowboys have talked to a number of teams about Walsh, but also are asking a  steep price, a No. 1 pick and at least two players who can come in and play  right away. Johnson has said he does not want to trade Walsh, who played for  him at the University of Miami, and the backup said Sunday, "I don't expect  them to make a move.  </P> <P> "One thing I want to say about the whole thing: I never demanded to be traded.  But I do feel with the trading deadline coming up, it's an opportunity, an  option the Cowboys have."  </P> <P> Walsh said he was delighted to get a little playing time, even with his team  hopelessly out of the game by the time he arrived.  </P> <P> "I think it was done more to give me some experience. I'm grateful for that and  I felt really good about some of the things I did, and I could have done some  other things better. ... When you get out there, everybody is more intense and  things happen quicker.  </P> <P> "But Troy's the number one quarterback, and I don't really expect" to be  challenging for the starting job.  </P> <P> The Cowboys also didn't expect to score their only points on yet another  bizarre play yielded by the Redskins. It came midway through the first quarter,  when quarterback Mark Rypien was hit from the blind side by free safety Ray  Horton and fumbled. The ball was picked up by defensive end Jim Jeffcoat and  returned 77 yards for a touchdown and a 7-7 tie.  </P> <P> "We had an all-out blitz on, and we had good coverage," Horton said. "I made  the hit and the ball popped loose."  </P> <P> Said Jeffcoat: "When I saw Ray Horton coming from the back side, I was going to  shed my tackle because I thought Rypien was going to scramble my way. When I  shed him, Ray had just hit him and the ball came out. I just picked it up and  ran. ... I knew it was there. Any time I get an open field, I'm going to  score."  </P></p>

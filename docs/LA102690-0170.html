			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWPORT HARBOR CAN'T HOLD TUSTIN  </P> <P> Now that Tustin High School's football team has cast Newport Harbor aside, the  lingering question is: Who can beat the Tillers?  </P> <P> Thursday night's game against Newport Harbor was supposed to be the biggest  game on the Sea View League schedule for Tustin. It was, for about a half, then  Tustin pulled away for a 25-7 victory before 3,000 fans at Tustin.  </P> <P> The Tillers' method of operation was the same as in seven other victories this  season. Contributions came from all directions.  </P> <P> Running back Ron Goods gained 135 yards in 17 carries, quarterback Andy Borza  completed seven of eight passes for 99 yards, and linebacker Aaron Gutridge  returned an interception 10 yards for a touchdown. And Tustin turned a 7-6  halftime deficit into a runaway.  </P> <P> Afterward came the news from Tustin Coach Marijon Ancich that Tustin had never  been 8-0 in the 68-year history of the school.  </P> <P> "Whoa, this was a big win for us," Ancich said. "We have to look a little  tougher now. Everybody's playing a little tougher against us."  </P> <P> Tustin, top-ranked in the Southern Section Division VI and third-ranked in  Orange County, is 8-0, 3-0 in league play. Newport Harbor, fighting to stay in  contention for a playoff berth, is 5-3, 1-2.  </P> <P> It was a game of odd swings.  </P> <P> Newport Harbor controlled the ball for 18 plays, taking almost nine minutes on  its first drive, and scored on a one-yard dive by quarterback Steve Walker.  </P> <P> Walker's short-range passes were flawless early. He completed his first nine.  </P> <P> Tustin managed a 14-yard touchdown pass from Borza to Keve Love on its first  drive, but Michael Stipe blocked Matt Coo's extra point try and Newport Harbor  still led, 7-6.  </P> <P> But the game collapsed all around Newport Harbor in the second half.  </P> <P> Visko Ancich scored on a two-yard run and Borza added a one-yard quarterback  sneak for a 18-7 Tustin lead at the end of the third quarter.  </P> <P> Stuck at his own five-yard line and aware the game was slipping away, Walker,  who had misfired on four consecutive passes after his hot start, dropped to  throw on first down.  </P> <P> His swing pass went straight into Gutridge's waiting hands at the 10. He raced  untouched into the end zone, the index finger on his left hand pointing No. 1  and the ball secure in his right.  </P> <P> Coo's kick made it 25-7 with 10:46 left in the game.  </P> <P> "We played a great first half," Newport Harbor Coach Jeff Brinkley said. "We  just didn't block and tackle in the second half. It's basic fundamentals and we  didn't do it."  </P> <P> Next on the hit list for Tustin is Corona del Mar next Friday night at Newport  Harbor High.  </P></p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Dublin forum has shaky start New signs of strain between London and Dublin emerged yesterday over a framework document for Northern Ireland as Irish prime minister Mr Albert Reynolds outlined his hopes for the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. Mr Reynolds was clearly disappointed at the decision of the British ambassador Mr David Blatherwick not to attend on the opening day. Downing Street said the ambassador declined because of the presence of Sinn Fein, with which London has not entered into exploratory talks. Mr Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, described the British move as petty: 'It's an indication of the British attitude not just to the peace process, but also to the Irish government.' In another remark unlikely to comfort London, Mr Reynolds appeared to link the issue of the 'disposal of arms' with a British decision to withdraw 'troops to barracks'. The forum gathering in Dublin Castle comprised leaders of the constitutional parties of the south, together with Sinn Fein, the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party and the non-sectarian Alliance party of Northern Ireland. Mr Reynolds said the forum would 'establish for the first time . . . some measure of agreement on future structures governing relationships within Northern Ireland, between north and south and between Ireland and Britain'. This referred to the three strands of the Anglo-Irish talks. Mr Reynolds also held out the prospect of a debate on constitutional change, as foreshadowed in the Downing Street declaration.</p>

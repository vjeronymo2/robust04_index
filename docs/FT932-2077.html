			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Economics: Unemployment exercises EC leaders The spectre of high and rising unemployment hangs over Europe this week. While European Community leaders meet in Copenhagen to discuss ways of reviving the continent's ailing economy, May money supply details from the Bundesbank, due today or tomorrow, could trigger moves towards lower interest rates. Some economists think growth of M3, Germany's broad measure of money supply, may have slowed sufficiently to come within the Bundesbank's target range of 4.5 to 6.5 per cent seasonally adjusted annualised growth from its 1992 fourth quarter base. If so, the Bundesbank could be more inclined to ease monetary policy, especially if German cost of living figures this week indicate a moderation of inflationary pressures. But most forecasters take a cautious view of likely trends. MMS International, the financial information company, reports consensus forecasts of 6.8 per cent for M3 growth in May and an unchanged June annual inflation rate of 4.2 per cent. France is expected to report falling industrial production today, adding to pressure on the government to lower its interest rates. In the US, durable goods orders for May should be consistent with a moderate economic recovery. The main economic statistics and events of the week follow. The figures in brackets are the median of economists' forecasts from MMS International. Today: Denmark, EC summit in Copenhagen. UK, trade with non-EC countries in May (Pounds 900m deficit).

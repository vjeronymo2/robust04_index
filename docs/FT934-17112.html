			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / International Company News: Metall Mining drops CDollars 171m share offering METALL Mining has dropped a public share offer intended to finance the CDollars 171m (USDollars 131.5m) acquisition of its German parent's European copper smelting asset. Sharply declining copper prices are behind the decision. Metall is the main Canadian-based mining and exploration arm of Metallgesellschaft, and has international mining interests. Instead of the public offer, Metall has issued 15.9m shares at CDollars 10.75 each to the parent in exchange for the smelting interests. This raises Metallgesellschaft's interest in Metall to 68 per cent from 60.5 per cent.</p>

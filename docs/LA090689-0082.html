			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TROJAN DEFENSE WENT INTO THE TANK, SMITH SAYS  </P> <P> For weeks, USC Coach Larry Smith has been saying his football team might not be  as good as everyone thought.  </P> <P> But nobody listened.  </P> <P> Not either of the news services, both of whom picked the Trojans to finish  among the top five schools in the nation.  </P> <P> Not the national magazines, in which USC was picked anywhere from first to  sixth in the country.  </P> <P> Not the odds makers, who made the Trojans a 14 1/2-point favorite over Illinois  in Monday's season opener.  </P> <P> Now Smith has their attention.  </P> <P> His premonitions of trouble proved to be more than a case of a coach trying to  keep his team hyped up. USC, leading 13-0 through three quarters Monday night  at the Coliseum, lost to Illinois, 14-13, on two fourth-quarter touchdown  passes by quarterback Jeff George.  </P> <P> "Our defense went in the tank," said Smith after reviewing the films. "We  played well for 3 1/2 quarters and controlled their offense. We had a chance  for three or four interceptions, a chance for maybe six sacks, but we didn't  get them.  </P> <P> "But once they scored on that tipped play (a pass from George went through the  hands of linebacker Scott Ross to receiver Shawn Wax for a 53-yard touchdown  play), it was like we crashed. We never recovered. Then on that last drive for  the winning touchdown, we just did not put pressure on them."  </P> <P> While the USC defense stumbled at the end, the offense never got out of the  starting blocks, but Smith refused to point a finger at his redshirt freshman  quarterback, Todd Marinovich.  </P> <P> "There was not a whole lot positive about our offense, but our quarterback  graded over 90% on his performance," Smith said. "(Fullback Leroy) Holt and  (tailback Ricky) Ervins played pretty well. Other than that, there's not a  whole lot to shout about.  </P> <P> "I know that Illinois has a fine defense, but we didn't even dent them. I was  shocked and disappointed. They didn't do anything different than we've seen,  but man for man, they whipped us. There was no movement on our line, no  sustainment of blocks, not very many creases to run through for the backs. And  when they had them, the backs didn't run well. They just basically stuffed our  run."  </P> <P> Part of the problem was Marinovich's failure to balance the offense with deep  throws. He didn't go long until the final two plays.  </P> <P> "He was coached to take what the defense gives," Smith said of his quarterback.  "He was so geared into that. We are just going to have to say to him, 'Hey,  throw deep. The outside people will go catch it.'  </P> <P> "But because we were not controlling the line, the defense was causing us to  hurry and go to the short stuff. We were calling the deeper stuff, but they  were taking it away and forcing us to go underneath."  </P> <P> Smith indicated there may well be changes in his starting lineup for the  Trojans' next game, Sept. 16 against Utah State.  </P> <P> His uneasiness with his team began with the two crushing injuries the club  suffered in camp. At the end of the first week, starting nose guard Don Gibson  went down with a knee injury that will keep him out at least another four  weeks.  </P> <P> Then, last week in the final preseason scrimmage, starting quarterback Pat  O'Hara suffered a season-ending knee injury.  </P> <P> "That all dulled us," Smith said. "It had a mental effect on the team. You  could see it in practice. You could see it off the field. You could tell them,  'Hey, go for broke. Have fun on the football field,' but it just wasn't there."  </P> <P> X-rays revealed no break in the dislocated right thumb of tailback Scott  Lockwood. He suffered the injury returning a punt late in the first quarter and  never got an opportunity to rush from scrimmage. Lockwood is expected to be out  about three weeks.  </P></p>

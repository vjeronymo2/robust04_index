			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Arts: Today's Television Why is lip service so often paid to the need to preserve the cultures of obscure little bits of land? Cultural pride fiercely locked into geography is indivisible from the patriotic lunacy which so easily leads to violent death. It is but a step from the eisteddfod to the torched cottage. Bookmark, we are told, is about 'Serbian epics', the myths and poetry which 'enshrined the glory of the mediaeval empire'. These epics, it seems, are still sung on the front line to incite the weary warriors. A good reason for abandoning them, you might think. Still, this series has produced some remarkable documentaries so it should be worth watching (8.10 BBC2). Dispatches has fixed upon a 'dog bites man' story. At 9.00 they plan to reveal on Channel 4 that most diets fail in the long run, and that dieting can affect your mood and reduce your sex drive. In fact 'dieting can be positively bad for you'. A programme revealing that dieting was effective and good for you would be more remarkable . The Friend In The Corner (11.00 Radio 4) recalls 1956, Tony Hancock and the Goons, and BBC radio began 'Journey Into Space' and changed the shipping forecast.</p>

And whereas the first task was  soon resolved -- Bill Clinton responded with $100 million and  the Congress agreed to consider increasing that sum -- the  second task proved a far harder nut to crack. After announcing  full political support for the peacemaking efforts the White  House boss nevertheless categorically avoided promising to send  his soldiers to the Transcaucasus. Not even under the blue flag  of the United Nations.    Nevertheless, the U.S. President did give his word to head  an  international movement to send the UN blue helmets to the border  with Abkhazia. This measure will be particularly beneficial  given that the latest round of Georgian-Abkhazian talks held in  the past few days at UN headquarters in New York ended  fruitlessly.    But the idea of international involvement in the search for  ways out of the crisis, by all accounts, has not been abandoned  by the Georgian leader. He took that idea to New York, where he  met with UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali and set out his plan  at a session of the Security Council. There are three  "buttresses" to this plan: the creation of a directorate  involving the opposing sides and representatives of the High  Commissioner for Refugees, Russia, the "friends of Georgia"  group, and other UN member states, the institution of a mixed  administration in Abkhazia, and after that elections under  international control and the formation of new organs of power  based on those elections. "A specially created international  organ is operating under UN auspices, with the assistance  [sodeystviye] of the Russian Federation, and the participation  of the CSCE," Eduard Shevardnadze said, "which will cooperate  with the directorate and the government of the Republic of  Georgia in elaborating and implementing a program for the  economic revival of Abkhazia."</p>

			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Guidelines on Ecu bonds price quotations reset MARKETMAKERS have reset guidelines on price quotations in Ecu bonds, in the wake of a one-day suspension of marketmaking last month. The suspension was triggered by chaotic selling of Ecu bonds, following Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht Treaty on monetary union in June, which threw the future of the currency into doubt. Although market conditions have stabilised since then, allowing the spread between bid and offer prices on the most liquid bonds to return to 10 basis points, the market's former liquidity has not been restored. At a meeting late 0n Monday, marketmakers agreed that the top 35 Ecu bonds will continue to be traded at a bid/offer spread of 10 basis points to 25 basis points in a minimum size of Ecu3m or Ecu5m. However, the top tier of bonds (those traded at a 10 basis point spread in a minimum size of Ecu5m) has been reduced to bonds issued by France and the UK. Most other large sovereign and supranational deals are also traded on a 10 cent spread, but in a minimum size of Ecu3m. The spread for Ecu bonds issued by Italy has been officially widened to 15 basis points. Bonds totalling Ecu500m-Ecu1bn issued some time ago are now traded at a 20 cent spread. Bonds are to be quoted on a 25 basis point spread if they are difficult credits, or are particularly hard to trade for technical reasons. Small issues are to be traded on a 50 basis point spread. Mr David Ovenden, who heads the International Securities Market Association's Ecu sub-committee, said none of the market's 44 marketmakers had pulled out, but added that he expects 'to lose about half a dozen over the next six months.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jean-Louis Debre, deputy secretary general </F> of the Rally for the Republic, RPR, by Thierry Portes; place and  date not given: "Debre: `Chirac Should Become President'"]    [Text] [Portes] Has the position that you have been filling  for the past year offered you as many rewards as disappointments?    [Debre] I do not look for rewards in my position, and I can  assure I have found none in it. My role is a difficult one, I  am very much aware of it. My aim is to ensure that the RPR  remains an effective force, my wish is to support the  government's action, and I hope to contribute to the election of  Jacques Chirac to the presidency of the republic.    Because of family tradition, my education, and my  temperament, I do not like indifference and resignedness. In  fulfilling my duties, I am giving a definite direction to my  political commitment. From my position, I can observe the  interplay of political forces and opposing interests, the limits  of the loyalty of some, and the extent of the loyalty of others.  Above all, I have had the pleasure of meeting women and men who  are committed to fighting for the ideas in which they believe,  disinterested activists, who often expect nothing in return for  their political commitment.    [Portes] With what feelings is the RPR following the  development of relations between [RPR President] Jacques Chirac  and [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur?    [Debre] Leaders and activists are of course asking  themselves  questions about the relations between Jacques Chirac and Edouard  Balladur. Our leaders do not want a split to occur. In their  view, there should be no competition between Jacques Chirac and  Edouard Balladur in the presidential elections. If there is any  competition, it should be settled directly by the two men  involved. As for the activists, they are legitimists by nature.    [Portes] In other words?    [Debre] The older members, those who adhered to our movement  at the time of general de Gaulle or Georges Pompidou and who  have developed in a Gaullist tradition, are favorable to Jacques  Chirac because he led the Gaullists to victory and, through his  action, prevented the disappearance of Gaullism from public  life. The others, those who have joined us in the last few  years, following the creation of the RPR or after 1988, are  obsessed with divisiveness -- the divisiveness that made us  lose. For all these activists, everything that has happened  until now -- victory in the last general elections, Edouard  Balladur's appointment to the prime ministership -- seems to  originate in a plan developed by Jacques Chirac and Edouard  Balladur. They therefore feel that there was a sort of pact  between the two men. They do not understand why some would like  to breach this "pact" and call into question a winning team --  the aim of this strategy being Jacques Chirac's election to the  presidency of the republic.    [Portes] What about the deputies?    [Debre] The majority of the RPR's deputies are loyal to  Jacques Chirac because they feel that he ardently upholds their  beliefs. There are some deputies, on the other hand, who are --  legitimately -- concerned that the Left might come back into  power. "Make sure there is only one candidate," this is what  they are telling us.    [Portes] Do you regret some of your remarks concerning the  government's policies?    [Debre] I have never disowned my own convictions, nor have I  ever betrayed my loyalty to Jacques Chirac. However, I have  come to realize that, sometimes, what I have said has shocked  certain members of the government. The government is engaged in  a difficult and unpopular action. As a deputy, it is my duty to  support it, and this is precisely what I have always done  through my voting in Parliament. But it is also my  responsibility, as the RPR's spokesman, to show those Frenchmen  who placed their trust in us in 1993 that, when I meet them  today and they tell me their views, I do not then fail to  transmit these views to our leaders.    Now, I am concerned to see that some, engrossed in the  difficulties of their task, are imprisoned in their own job, in  their own unshakable beliefs, and no longer have the ability or  the time to listen to what the French have to say. However, a  majority leader must not only support the government's policy,  he must also act as a link between public opinion and the  government.    What sometimes may have looked like criticism of the  government was not intended as such in my mind. My aim was  simply to warn the government, to say: "Watch out, we are  drifting off course." Frankly, I cannot imagine for a minute  that anybody has any good reasons to wish the government to fail  in its task.    [Portes] What mistakes did the government and the majority  make over the past year?    [Debre] We have not sufficiently denounced the Socialist  budget, and we are now paying for its consequences. Moreover,  we should have been much more active up until October, we should  have carried out much more profound reforms, thus taking full  advantage of that very short period of time when a government  has the opportunity to act without hindrance. Finally, I  believe that, through certain decisions and appointments, we  have given the impression that cohabitation was turning to  complacency.    [Portes] Can you give us an example of this?    [Debre] In the field of employment, the government was right  to attempt to launch economic recovery. What was done in the  spring and the Giraud law were a good starting point. However,  we were too conformist, traditional, and not sufficiently  innovative. Why did we not say last year, for example, that any  company hiring an unskilled youth in 1994 would be exempted from  paying three fourths of its social security contributions? Why  procrastinate? Why remain stuck in the same old frozen schemes?    [Portes] Quite a few observers and economic analysts believe  that recovery is just round the corner. Do you share this view?    [Debre] As far as I can tell from observing my own region,  it  looks as if the crisis is under control. But I do not belive  recovery is imminent.    [Portes] Do you believe the government has the political  means to continue carrying out reforms?    [Debre] I think we did not take enough advantage of the  grace  period during which a government is in the position to carry out  many reforms. Today the government has fewer opportunities to  do so. I hope it will find new opportunities.    [Portes] How?    [Debre] We must put back on the agenda what was initially  envisaged, namely, the plan based on experience gained during  1986-1988, and which was subsequently conceptualized by Edouard  Balladur at various stages. This plan placed the prime minister  and the government outside the presidential perspective. Such a  positioning, in fact, enabled the government to focus on reform  and on France's renewal. However, some members of the  government are giving the impression that they have abandoned  this aim and that they are addressing electoral requirements.  In order to restore the image of an efficient government that  is entirely devoted to helping the country emerge from the  crisis, the government must show unambiguously that it is not  concerned about the presidential election, given that the prime  minister is not a candidate. In this way, the government could  indeed recover its credibility. Otherwise, the closer we move to  the presidential election, the less credibility the government  will have. This would also satisfy those who are denouncing the  background noise that is spoiling the government's action.    [Portes] Do you think that Jacques Chirac can put forward a  project without implicitly criticizing the government's policies?    [Debre] Yes, most definitely. Through his attitude and his  voting in Parliament, Jacques Chirac has always supported the  government unfailingly. With this sort of record, he will be  able to develop an agenda which will not be focused on the past  or at short-term prospects, but which will be geared to the  future, apart from and beyond the government's performance. You  cannot win the presidential election by looking back at the  past, but rather, you must put forward a plan, an aim.    [Portes] Are you in favor of a single majority candidate,  and  of organizing primaries for the presidential election?    [Debre] I would like to see a single majority candidate for  the presidency, and I would like this candidate to be Jacques  Chirac. As far as primary elections are concerned, it is a good  idea, but organizing them is up to the political forces, it is  not the state's responsibility.</p>

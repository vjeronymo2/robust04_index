			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Beijing Central Television Program One  Network in Mandarin at 1210 GMT on 22 December broadcasts the  tenth of a twelve-part documentary entitled: "Mao Zedong." The  tenth part, which lasts for 50 minutes, is entitled: "Splashing  Water Amid the Stream," and focuses on Mao's passion for  swimming.    After video shows an on-screen prologue read by an  unidentified narrator: "Mao Zedong said: It was rather  comfortable to swim at Beidaihe during a grade-seven  typhoon...." the documentary begins with historical footage of  Mao swimming at Beidaihe beach, in the Chang Jiang, and at  Shisanling Dam during the last two decades of his life; as well  as his last recorded swim in a Changsha indoor swimming poor in  1974 at the age of 81. As the video shows shots of places  associated with Mao's sporting activities, the narrator recounts  his endeavor to improve his physique and temper his will through  rigorous training, and notes that swimming and mountaineering  were Mao's two main hobbies. The narrator adds that while  climbing mountains, Mao never made detours and always blazed a  new path whenever he encountered a dead end.    As video shows places where Mao used to swim, the video cuts  to show interviews with Mao's bodyguards, nurses, doctors, and  his daughter Li Na, reminiscing about Mao's preference for  swimming in large rivers and lakes over small ones, to long  distances over sprints, and rapids over still water; and noting  that when he swam he never did a specific stroke -- he simply  swam "free style" as he pleased. While the video continues to  show footage of places and events associated with Mao, the  narrator explains: Mao's approach toward swimming fully  reflected his indomitable spirit to conquer nature. He once  expressed a wish to swim in the Mississippi and the Ganges. As  a sportsman and romantic poet, Mao often composed poems after  swimming. Deeply concerned about floods along the Chang Jiang,  Mao inspected the Three Gorges time and again in a bid to find a  way to tame the river. His dream finally came true when the  Fifth Session of the Seventh National People's Congress approved  the Three Gorges Project in April 1992.    As the video shows historical footage of Khrushchev's  "secret  visit" to China in July 1958, the narrator recalls an episode:  After turning down the Soviet proposal to establish a joint  fleet during a rigorous debate one morning, Mao invited  Khrushchev to his swimming pool in Zhongnanhai to conduct the  afternoon session. When Mao and Khrushchev showed up at the  pool, Chinese and Soviet officials present were stunned at Mao's  casual attire, a pair of swimming trunks, and his superb  swimming skills. The narrator continues: Mao disliked being  bossed around, and that was one of his invaluable assets which  transcended into a dauntless spirit in the face of stormy waves.    While the video continues to show historical footage of  related events, the narrator says: "From the late fifties to the  early sixties, China encountered one upheaval after another on  both the domestic and international fronts: The deterioration of  Sino-Soviet relations, armed rebellion staged by separatists in  Tibet, the Taiwan Strait crisis, Sino-Indian border conflicts,  and an anti- Chinese wave abroad. In the wake of such setbacks,  especially the natural disasters following the blunder of the  Great Leap Forward, Mao exhorted the Chinese people to foster  the spirit of fearing no devils. Thus, fearlessness against  devils became the slogan for Chinese people to tide over  difficulties at home and abroad. In 1962 the Sino-Soviet  polemics began. Consequently, Soviet experts were withdrawn  from China, contracts were scrapped, and Soviet-aided  construction projects were suspended. However, Mao never  panicked; he told Soviet comrades that in spite of the war of  words with the Soviet Union, life would go on as usual in China.    As the video shows historical footage of a party in which  close shots are seen of Mao, Liu Shaoqi, and Zhu De each dancing  with a female partner, the narrator cites American journalist  Anna Louis Armstrong's observation during her stay in Yanan:  "Zhou Enlai's waltz was first rate, Liu Shaoqi's steps were as  accurate as numbers, and Zhu De danced with the strides of the  Long March; Mao Zedong danced to the tune of his own rhythm."  The narrator adds: Therefore, unlike ordinary people who like  to swim in still water, Mao had a passion for splashing in the  rapids.    While video shows historical footage and interviews with  people concerned, the narrator recounts the events leading to  the start of the Cultural Revolution: In June 1966, Mao stayed  for 10 days at a resort in Shaoshan, doing nothing but reading,  writing, and swimming. Shortly afterwards, in Wuchang on 16  July, he plunged into the Chang Jiang and swam 15 kilometers in  65 minutes at the advanced age of 73. Big crowds of people  along the river cheered him and shouted: "Long live the  chairman," and he responded with "Long live the people." The  Chinese media gave exceptional, extensive coverage to Mao's  latest swim in the Chang Jiang. As the video cuts to show  historical footage of Mao waving to the sea of Red Guards during  parades in Tiananmen Square, the narrator says: "In the brief  period of 33 days after the swim, Mao, waving an army hat, stood  on the rostrum atop Tiananmen Gate. The blue sea was turned  into a red sea. Mao Zedong could not have dreamt the red sea he  stirred up would last a decade."    At 1300 GMT, the documentary concludes by showing historical  footage of Mao walking, talking, and swimming to stress the  carefree nature of his personality.</p>

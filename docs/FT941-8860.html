			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: Turnround at Enso-Gutzeit Enso-Gutzeit, the Finnish pulp and paper group, has put two years of losses behind it by posting a FM385m (Dollars 70m) profit after financial items for 1993. The result, which compares with a FM192m deficit in 1992 and a FM950m loss in 1991, was struck after a 27 per cent jump in net sales to FM13.06bn. Mr Jukka Harmala, chief executive, attributed the improvement to cost-cutting, the weaker Finnish markka, higher productivity and lower wood prices. He noted all the group's divisions had produced better figures in markka terms, in spite of difficult market conditions throughout the pulp and paper industry. The strong growth in sales reflected markka weakness and the group's expansion programme. It acquired Tampella's forest products and packaging operations for FM3.6bn in May. It benefited from increased sales from its new Enocell pulp mill. The group partly offset weakness in European markets by increasing sales to south-east Asia. Analysts believe the result may encourage the government to reduce its majority stake in Enso as part of the long-awaited launch of its privatisation programme. The group's consolidated operating margin amounted to FM2.99bn, or 22.9 per cent of net sales, up seven percentage points on 1992. Depreciation rose to FM1.1bn from FM786m, and net interest expenses increased to FM1.38bn from FM955m. Exchange rate losses at FM140m were FM60m higher than in 1992.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A CSCE delegation, which included Colonel Heikki  Happonen and Piotr Iwaszkiewicz, arrived in Idzhevan on 3 July.  During a meeting with the chairman of Idzhevanskiy Rayon  Executive Committee, the head of the delegation Col. Happonen  declared that they are ready to station CSCE observers in the  Karabakh conflict zone shortly. A control point will also be  established in Idzhevan, and the delegation arrived in the  region to deal with the technical matters.    According to Col. Happonen, thanks to the efforts of the  CSCE, Russia, and all other countries interested in the peaceful  resolution of Karabakh conflict, peace has never been so close  as it is now. To fail now would plunge the entire region into  disaster.    The colonel also declared that another CSCE delegation is  currently working in Azerbaijan, and there is hope that, in  keeping with the agreement, the yellow berets and the CIS  disengagement forces will soon be deployed all along the  Karabakh-Azerbaijani conflict zone.</p>

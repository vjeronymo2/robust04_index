			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Form a queue for your ID card: A National Gold Card will quickly break down any libertarian scruples The idea came to me in Barclays bank. It will solve the government's problems with unemployed scroungers, cut waste in the welfare state and make the police happy. It will make the British more like Germans, which is long overdue; and it will be popular. Requiring, for perfectly legal reasons, a large amount of cash in a hurry, I presented my Robert Fleming gold card to the lady in Barclays and was rebuffed. She rightly demanded proof that I was not a crook; but when I offered an impressive card issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers, complete with photograph and handsome logo showing that my owner is the Financial Times, she still refused to hand over the readies; wanted proof of signature which I had not got; subjected me to a sceptical gaze and was frigidly unimpressed by my representations that the FT was only a block away, that the picture was excellent, endorsed by Scotland Yard . . . and that, honestly, did I look like a thief . . . customers behind started to cough nervously. Suddenly, I understood the rage and frustration which must overtake a suppliant in the dole queue whose story is disbelieved - and I, at least, was asking for my own money. Yet I see the difficulty of the the person behind the counter. Scroungers look very much like anyone else applying for state benefits. Criminals with forged gold cards wear sharp suits and live in Bayswater. And I had a card from a bank she had never heard of, an odd-looking police ID and was demanding Pounds 2,000 in ready cash. So why not transfer the picture (and its police endorsement) to the Visa card, record finger-prints, password, mother's birthday and name of favourite singer on the magnetic stripe? Then next time, she will say: 'Good morning, Mr Wilkinson. You remembered flowers for the 14th? How can I help you? Pounds 2,000? . . . The new Bartoli CD is fantastic, by the way'. Libertarians would doubtless claim that such new-style credit cards were police identity cards in disguise: what Hitler would have imposed and similar rubbish. The fact is that more than half the adult population in Britain uses this kind of ID card without anxiety. However, theft and counterfeit by well-organised criminals is increasingly threatening their integrity. (Worldwide credit card fraud is running at about Dollars 1bn a year.) So the addition of photographs and other security information, now being considered by some banks, will soon become universal. What has this to do with the unemployed or with the police? The point is that law-abiding middle class people like the status conferred by plastic cards with or without photographs for getting into work, into bank accounts or getting discounts in restaurants. The government would like the other half to be similarly identified to help reduce benefits frauds and other crimes. But it dares not impose the hated ID card in the land of the free. Its image is still smudged with the sufferings of war, fascism and Teutonic orderliness. The government's error is to regard a national ID card as an instrument of compulsion. It should be be entirely voluntary and offer lots of goodies, just like a bank gold card, but available to all. Banks would surely accept it as additional proof of identity, so it would be useful to the middle classes. The government would require the banks to accept the card in their cash machines, which would be linked electronically to a citizen account which everyone would be entitled to have at the Bank of England. Expensive? Well, there would be savings because benefits claimants could collect their cash through a hole in the wall like everybody else, although of course initial claims would be processed manually. Those who insisted on a Briton's traditional right to queue for his cash would find the queues long. But how would this card become popular? By a tax-free national performance bonus to be paid into every account when public borrowing dipped below the Chancellor's target, perhaps? National Gold Card accounts could offer highly advantageous Savings products and maybe a Pounds 1m lottery prize. Discounts on police fines? It is just a question of marketing. When almost everyone had a National Gold Card we would soon find out who the fraudsters are and the woman at Barclays would discover at last that I am, really, honestly, only a journalist.</p>

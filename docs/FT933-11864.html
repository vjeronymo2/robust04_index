			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: ERM tensions cast shadow in Europe Tensions within the exchange rate mechanism overhung many European bourses last week, and the pressure seems likely to be undiminished, at least until Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting. The FT-Actuaries World index dipped by 0.8 per cent in local currency terms, with the Pacific Basin showing the weakest performance and Europe flat. Mr David Roche of Morgan Stanley sees two likely options for resolution of ERM problems: rate cuts within the ERM or suspension of the ERM and lower rates. In his latest review, Mr Roche says: 'The most elegant solution . . . would be a German rate cut combined with a widening of current ERM bands, perhaps to 6 per cent, prior to the Bundesbank's summer recess.' However, during the current ERM turmoil, he expects rising interest rates to depress the French equity market, particularly the financial stocks. Germany will outperform most other European markets; Italy may have a temporary correction; while Spanish equities will remain vulnerable. Elsewhere in Europe, Austria went its own way last week, the market advancing 4.8 per cent. Kleinwort Benson notes that the recent strong rise has followed a pattern seen elsewhere in Europe, notably in Germany. 'Hopes of economic recovery have encouraged the buying of export and cyclical stocks,' says its monthly review. 'In Austria, the rally has been led by the paper, refractory and chemical sectors. Falling interest rates have helped because of the high levels of gearing in many of the companies.' However, Kleinwort warns that although the economy will be helped by tax reform in 1994, high public borrowing and sluggishness in the German economy could retard Austria's economic recovery, and therefore the equity market may have rallied a little too soon.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                           MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                % change    % change in              % change in local currency**      sterling**  US Dollars**              1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of Start of      Start of                                         1993     1993         1993  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      +4.82    +8.14   +17.38   +19.61   +13.61       +12.33 Belgium      -1.46    +4.16   +16.56   +18.51   +11.94       +10.68 Denmark      -1.39    +0.35    +2.62   +19.79   +13.63       +12.35 Finland      +0.46   +14.07   +87.96   +53.64   +38.62       +37.08 France       +1.00    +2.28   +15.74    +9.96    +4.62        +3.44 Germany      +0.94    +7.63   +10.60   +18.23   +12.66       +11.39 Ireland      -1.10    +2.90   +26.83   +34.39   +17.61       +16.29 Italy        -0.91    +5.19   +54.47   +35.26   +25.67       +24.26 Netherlands  -0.19    +1.37   +18.89   +16.16   +10.57        +9.33 Norway       -2.00    +5.55   +19.22   +20.73   +15.11       +13.82 Spain        +0.73    +0.27   +24.80   +21.71    +2.89        +1.73 Sweden       +0.21    +6.79   +38.88   +16.93    +3.54        +2.37 Switzerland  -1.64    -0.12   +31.52   +14.85   +12.14       +10.88 UK           -0.18    -1.90   +20.66    +1.08    +1.08        -0.06 EUROPE       -0.02    +1.35   +21.02   +10.42    +6.56        +5.73  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia    +0.48    +5.84    +7.88   +13.07   +12.70       +11.43 Hong Kong    -2.85    -4.29   +10.44   +22.70   +23.90       +22.50 Japan        -2.62    +1.76   +32.32   +21.91   +44.13       +42.51 Malaysia     +4.45    +7.49   +45.37   +29.89   +33.88       +32.38 New Zealand  +0.76    +3.47   +11.79   +13.86   +23.17       +21.80 Singapore    +3.18    +3.58   +22.88   +17.53   +20.51       +19.16  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada       -2.13    -5.98    +3.70    +6.90    +7.40        +6.19 USA          +0.24    +0.04    +9.03    +2.73    +3.90        +2.73 Mexico       -2.26    +2.61    +5.97    -7.94    -6.92        -7.97  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa -2.52    -1.12   +17.83   +27.73   +39.68       +38.11  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX  -0.82    +0.82   +17.96   +10.59   +15.68       +14.39  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on July 23rd 1993.

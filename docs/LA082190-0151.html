			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> HEIRESS' UNINSURED GEMS STOLEN  </P> <P> An oil heiress who says insurance for her jewelry costs too much was robbed  last week for the fourth time in eight years.  </P> <P> Thieves broke into her mansion in affluent Newport early Friday and stole more  than $1-million worth of diamonds and pearls as Carolyn Skelly slept nearby,  police said.  </P> <P> "I didn't hear a thing," Skelly said.  </P> <P> None of the stolen items was insured, Skelly said. She told the Providence  Journal-Bulletin she stopped insuring jewelry years ago because it became too  expensive.  </P> <P> "I have nothing left. I'm going down to the five-and-dime store to get a little  costume jewelry until I get this other stuff back," Skelly said with a laugh.  </P> <P> The total take in the previous thefts was as much as $7 million. In 1982,  Skelly was robbed in New York at gunpoint of $1-million worth of jewels.  </P></p>

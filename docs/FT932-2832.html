			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Big phone reforms predicted IT MAY soon be possible to buy a 'phone number for life' under draft plans unveiled yesterday by Oftel, the telecommunications industry regulator. There may also be a service programmed to send telephone calls and faxes to wherever the user happens to be during the day. Personal numbering is one of the opportunities opened by the 9m new telephone numbers due to become available in 1995, when the digit '1' will be inserted after the initial zero for all UK area codes. Mr Don Cruickshank, Oftel director-general, said personal numbering was 'a very exciting development' for which the 'intelligent networks' technology already existed. It could also be used for purposes such as giving members of families a personal ringing tone on household telephones. 'You could even have singing and shouting phones', said Oftel's technical director. 'Personal numbering services are developing quickly in the United States,' says Oftel's consultation paper. 'They are likely to commence shortly in the UK and become an area of rapid growth.' British Telecommunications played down the idea, however, saying the investment required on its 6,000 exchanges would be 'enormous'. 'It's like saying we can build Concorde - but how many people can actually fly in it?' said BT. One operator has been licensed to provide portable numbering, but attempts to contact it yesterday led to an unresponsive answering phone. Oftel's consultation paper covers the 9bn telephone numbers that will be available for allocation after the national code change in April 1995. Oftel is proposing to open only 3bn numbers for immediate allocation. Unallocated numbers will be kept in reserve for future use. Only 26m numbers are currently in operation, but restrictions imposed by codes mean that the network is close to saturation in parts of the country. Apart from the new digit, existing numbers will be unaffected, and Oftel said it would not be necessary to impose any national code changes 'in the foreseeable future'. Existing codes for cellular mobile services will also remain unchanged. Oftel is also proposing to take responsibility for allocating numbers away from BT, in the name of fair access to all operators. The issue of whether users should be able to take their phone number with them when transfering between operators is not addressed directly by the paper. Oftel will publish a cost benefit study on the issue shortly. Mr Cruickshank gave the strong impression that he would enforce number portability in the near future. 'Numbers are for users, not for operators to grab as their product,' he said. Mr Cruickshank emphasised that the numbering changes were in line with practice in the US, Japan and Australia, leaders with the UK in the development of liberal telecommunications regimes.</p>

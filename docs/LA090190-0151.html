			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ALTHOUGH BIG FAVORITES, TITANS WON'T LOOK PAST SONOMA STATE;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: AFTER A SCARE FROM DIVISION II CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE LAST YEAR, THE  FULLERTON CAN'T AFFORD TO BE COMPLACENT IN OPENER.  </P> <P> It's not often the Cal State Fullerton football team gets the role of heavy  favorite, the big bully whipping a helpless foe.  </P> <P> But in Sonoma State, the Titans' opponent for the season opener at 1 p.m. today  in Santa Ana Stadium, the Titans will face an even lower life form in college  football's food chain.  </P> <P> Think the Division I Titans, who allocate the equivalent of 60 scholarships, 35  fewer than the maximum allowed by the NCAA, have it rough? The Division II  Cossacks don't give any football scholarships.  </P> <P> Think the Big West Conference doesn't get any respect? Can you name another  team besides Sonoma State and UC Davis in the Northern California Athletic  Conference?  </P> <P> Just listen to Cossacks Coach Tim Walsh, assessing his chances today.  </P> <P> "We're doing everything we can to compete with them," he said. "We just want to  play hard and make a good showing."  </P> <P> Sounds like Cal State Fullerton's motto when the Titans play the Auburns and  Louisiana States of the world. But for one rare day, Fullerton Coach Gene  Murphy gets to preach to his players the perils of complacency.  </P> <P> "I told them don't ever look down your nose at anyone," Murphy said. "People  say we should walk all over Sonoma State. Don't talk to me like that -- never.  We should win, but I don't have any idea what will happen."  </P> <P> Murphy has vivid memories of the last time Fullerton played a Division II team  it was supposed to defeat easily. The Titans needed a second-half comeback, in  which they scored 20 consecutive points, to defeat Cal State Northridge, 27-20,  in the second game of the 1989 season.  </P> <P> "We were lucky to win that game," Murphy said.  </P> <P> Murphy wouldn't tab his team a huge favorite today. Not when he'll be relying  on so many inexperienced players, many of whom will be making their first  starts for a four-year school.  </P> <P> Fullerton returned only two offensive starters and four defensive starters from  last season's team, and all of Murphy's offensive skilled-position players,  with the exception of receiver J.J. Celestine, are new.  </P> <P> Sonoma State also is inexperienced, with only six returning starters from 1989.  The Cossacks will start a freshman quarterback, Les Vanderpool, and five of six  offensive linemen are new. However, Sonoma State's center, two guards and two  tackles average 269 pounds per man.  </P> <P> The Cossacks have a solid running game with Glenn Campbell, former Saddleback  High and Rancho Santiago College standout, and Shelton Trosclair, who combined  for 1,050 yards and 10 touchdowns last season. Walsh says both could play in  the Big West.  </P> <P> Four other former Orange County community college players, linebackers Lenny  Wagner (Fullerton) and James Solley (Golden West), safety Kurt Szuba (Golden  West) and offensive guard Todd Little (Golden West), will start for Sonoma  State.  </P> <P> "It's like a homecoming for them, and I know they're excited about playing in  Orange County," Walsh said. "We just want to compete with Fullerton, but the  players really want to win."  </P> <P> The Titans and Cossacks are also similar in that two of their best players are  kickers. Fullerton's Phil Nevin made 15 of 21 field-goal attempts with a long  of 54 yards, and Sonoma State's Ed Beaulac, formerly of Long Beach City  College, kicked a 60-yard field goal against St. Mary's in 1989.  </P> <P> "He'll have a legitimate chance to get drafted," Walsh said. "If he's feeling  good, he may try a 65-yarder in a game."  </P></p>

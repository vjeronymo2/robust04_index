Billy Graham, on latter's recent  visit to North Korea, by An Hui-chang; date and place not given]    [Excerpts] Stephen Linton, 44, a professor of Colombia  University who recently visited North Korea as an aide and  interpreter for Rev. Billy Graham, arrived in the ROK on 6  February. [passage omitted]    The following are questions and answers from the interview  with Professor Linton:    [An Hui-chang] Having seen him up close, how would you say  is Kim Il-song's health?    [Steve Linton] I cannot say whether he is unhealthy  internally, but he appears to be healthy. His hands did not  quiver, and he walked fine. His voice was husky like that of a  chronic smoker, but his pronunciation was clear. His hearing  ability, however, was so poor that even though he was wearing a  hearing aid, sometimes someone nearby was asked to repeat in a  loud voice what had just been said.    [An] People are very interested in the messages exchanged  between President Clinton and Kim Il-song.    [Linton] We received President Clinton's message from the  U.S. Embassy in Beijing before entering North Korea. I cannot  provide details of what was in the messages, but I can say that  they will help improve the current tense relations between the  United States and North Korea.    [An] What was discussed at the luncheon between Rev. Graham  and Kim Il-song?    [Linton] Morality and religion were the main topics.  President Kim recalled that he had gone to church with his  mother during his childhood and that a pastor had helped him.    [An] Many observers note a change in Kim Chong-il's status.  What was the atmosphere like in North Korea?    [Linton] When I visited North Korea in 1992, President  Kim Il-song said: "Kim Chong-il is in charge of  administration." During my recent visit, however, I did not  hear him mention this. Although President Kim did not mention  any details, I came away with the impression that President Kim  himself was leading overall state affairs. According to custom,  we prepared gifts for both President Kim Il-song and Kim  Chong-il, while North Korea only presented us with a gift in Kim  Il-song's name.    [An] Why do you think North Korea invited Reverend Graham to  visit?    [Linton] Reverend Graham published a book introducing  various aspects of North Korea after his first visit in 1992. I  believe that after reading the book, the North Korean people  appreciated Rev. Graham's attempts not to distort [woegok] the  North Korean system. [passage omitted]</p>

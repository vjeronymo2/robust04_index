			<p>BFN     [Text] When the talks resume in Lusaka, the electoral  process will certainly be concluded. The National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] says there should be an  amendment in the electoral law and a change in the composition  of the National Electoral Council. It wants a more active role  by the United Nations and UNITA in this organ. Jorge Alicerces  Valentim, UNITA information secretary and chief negotiator, says  on the issue:    [Begin Valentim recording] The UNITA delegation has prepared  and delivered to the UN representative a document containing its  views on the conclusion of the electoral process, which are an  innovation in that they give the United Nations the right to  help the electoral commission prepare for the election. There  is also the need to alter the electoral law concerning the  counting of votes at the polling booths, and to ensure  significant UNITA participation in all the electoral process.  When we talk of elections, we are assuming there will be peace  in Angola. Afterward, can the elections be held. [end recording]    Paradoxically in Angola, the Popular Movement for the  Liberation of Angola-Labor Party has intensified its air raids  against civilian targets.    [Begin Valentim recording] However, while we are preparing  peace in Lusaka, very alarming reports from Huambo say that  yesterday as of 1000 [0900 GMT] there were massive air raids  against the city of Huambo, in which dozens of people died and a  number of houses were completely destroyed. The government  aircraft dropped every kind of bomb on Huambo residents. We  believe that this intensification of war in Angola does not meet  the wishes of the Angolan people or the expectations of the  international community.    The UNITA delegation once more reiterates that it is willing  to continue with the talks. It will remain in Lusaka, but it  appeals to the international community, the UN Security Council,  and observer countries to firmly condemn this intensification of  war and the government's air raids.

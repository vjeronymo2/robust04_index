There was an urgent need to  consider upgradation of the MiG-21 being flown by the Indian Air  Force, said Air Chief Marshal, S.K. Kaul, Chief of Air Staff  here.    India's Light Combat Aircraft (LCA), which would replace the  MiG-21s, would enter operational service only around 2005, the  Air Chief Marshal said at a press conference at the Bangalore  air show today. The budgetary cuts had also made it necessary  for the Air Force to prioritise its requirements. As a result,  the upgradation of the MiG-21s, which the Air Force has used for  over three decades, assumed importance. By upgrading the  aircraft, it was possible to get enhanced capabilities with a  smaller outlay.    There had been offers from various vendors and countries, he  said in reply to a question. All the offers were being looked  into. No decision had yet been taken, he added.    Full scale mock-up: Many of the companies which  would be involved in the upgradation were present at the air  show. The Russians had a full scale mock-up of the upgraded MiG  on show. `We can offer India the option of Russian or Western  avionics,' said a spokesman for MiG. The company had tie-ups  with French companies, such as Thompson-CSF, and could offer  Western avionics but at a higher cost. The improved MiG-21 would  have significantly increased combat capabilities against air and  ground targets. It would also be able to use the most up to date  air-to-air missiles.    The Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) too is offering to  upgrade the MiG-21s and had a mock-up of the improved cockpit on  display. `We can provide the F-16's avionics capabilities for  the MiG-21,' said an IAI spokesman. The cockpit would be  completely modernised and the IAI upgraded MiG-21s would be able  to carry both Western and Eastern weapons. the upgradation of  each aircraft would not cost more than $3.5 millions.    HAL in fray: The Hindustan Aeronautics Limited  (HAL) too is in the fray. `Apart from the Russians, we are the  people best acquainted with the MiG-21,' said a company  official. HAL too has a mock-up of its upgraded cockpit on show.  HAL had already carried out several improvements on the MiG-21,  and could offer the best mix of Indian, Russian and Western  systems for upgradation, he said. It may be possible to use some  of the electronic systems developed for the LCA in the MiG-21  upgrade.    French avionics suppliers may well be major beneficiaries if  either HAL or Russia gets the contract for the upgradation. The  French companies have turned out in strength for the Bangalore  air show and include the Thomson group and Sagem. Both companies  point out the suitability of their systems for upgrading the  MiG-21. HAL already manufactures under licence an inertial  navigation and attack system of Sagem, for its Jaguar strike  aircraft.</p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Parkland returns to black with Pounds 2.2m Parkland Group, the Bradford-based textile company, yesterday announced its return to profitability in the year to February 27, helped by the write-back of provisions and a 19 per cent increase in sales from continuing operations. Pre-tax profit amounted to Pounds 2.2m, compared with a Pounds 1.6m loss a year earlier. However, the 1993 figure was hit by a Pounds 704,000 provision, of which Pounds 694,000 was written back in the latest results, following the disposal of Maitland. The management is predicting more modest sales growth in the current year. It expects to achieve further reductions in its cost base, but in the longer term it could be affected by increasing raw material costs, primarily wool. The share price fell 18p to 220p, as a result of yesterday's cautious trading statement. Last year Parkland disposed of its remaining garment manufacturing businesses to refocus on its core area of spinning and fabric production. Total turnover for the year was down from Pounds 58.9m to Pounds 54.8m, but sales from continuing businesses increased sharply from Pounds 44.1m to Pounds 52.5m. Parkland has made a substantial push to expand its export markets, and export sales increased by 24 per cent to Pounds 11.4m, representing 22 per cent of total sales from continuing businesses. Gearing has been reduced from 31 per cent to 16 per cent, and Mr Bryan Lodder, chief executive, said the company would increase capital expenditure from Pounds 2.5m in 1994, to maintain its position in an increasingly competitive market. The company is proposing a final dividend of 3p, making a total of 5p for the year, compared with 2p in 1993. Earnings per share on a net basis amounted to 19.7p, against losses of 19.3p last time. On a nil basis they emerged at 21.1p (18.7p).</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Merger of anti-fraud agencies is proposed The Serious Fraud Office and the Fraud Investigation Group of the Crown Prosecution Service should be merged to improve the effectiveness of the fight against financial crime, an inquiry ordered by Sir Nicholas Lyell QC, the attorney-general, concluded yesterday. The report by Mr John Graham, a senior Treasury civil servant, makes no recommendation about whether the merged body should be controlled by the prosecution service or be in effect an enlarged fraud office. But it does propose extending the fraud office's 'Section 2' powers to the police. The powers, which remove the right to silence and compel witnesses to answer questions, can be used only by the SFO's lawyers and accountants. Sir Nicholas gave no indication of the direction of government thinking, and said yesterday that studies into the possibility of executive agency status for the fraud office and CPS would have to be completed before any final decision was taken. The report identifies a series of shortcomings in the operations of both the fraud office and the investigation group which have different powers and approaches to combating fraud. It makes a number of recommendations for immediate organisational and managerial improvements. The fraud office's management systems are not exploited fully, while the investigation group has few useful systems in place, it says. Both organisations should improve their use of outside barristers while the fraud office should review its use of police officers brought in on secondment. The report concludes that the main advantages of a merger would be to improve resource allocation and the extension of Section 2 powers, which it said had proved 'an effective investigation tool'. Although it does not make a final recommendation, the report suggests the fraud office should be brought under the control of the prosecution service, provided it can be ring-fenced from the rest of the CPS. However, it acknowledges that this could be politically damaging. The report also concludes that both fraud bodies should accept cases involving Pounds 1m or more. However, the fraud office, which accepts cases involving at least Pounds 5m, rejected the recommendation, saying that it does not make sense for both organisations to adopt the same financial threshold.

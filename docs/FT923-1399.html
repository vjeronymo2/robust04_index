			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Further plunge in Seoul stock market South Korean investors, upset by a further plunge in the Seoul stock market, showed their anger with the government yesterday by throwing thousands of share slips into city centre streets, Reuter reports from Seoul. A sweeper clears up the mess after bemused shoppers had been showered with slips from the windows of a local brokerage firm. Seoul's stock index has fallen more than 20 points in two days because of uncertainties in the run-up to December presidential elections. The index was at 519.16 at yesterday's close, a far cry from its record 1077.77 in April 1989.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Yugoslav embargo and its consequences for  Bulgaria and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM], a more rapid association of the two  countries with European structures, and a more active  development of economic relations between Bulgaria and Macedonia  were the topics that Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov  discussed with Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev and  National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov today.    The Macedonian head of state and President Zhelyu Zhelev  gave  a concluding joint news conference. The historic character of  the visit was stressed again. Here are some excerpts from the  statements made by President Zhelev and President Gligorov  during the news conference.    [Begin Zhelev recording] We established diplomatic relations  with the Republic of Macedonia first at the level of consulates  general and afterward at the level of a diplomatic mission, in  other words, an embassy. Trade and economic relations have  developed rapidly. I will allow myself to recall that at the  beginning of 1991 trade between the two countries amounted to  $90 million, but by 1993 it had reached $290 million. The  dynamic and irrepressible development of trade and economic  relations shows, among other things, that our official  interstate relations are lagging behind the natural process of  development. [end recording]    [Begin Gligorov recording, in Macedonian] I must say that we  have had a good and serious exchange of views with the Bulgarian  leadership on international issues and on cooperation in the  United Nations and other international organizations, which are  matters of common interest, and that signs of full trust and  sincere cooperation are more and more evident. [end recording]    The anticipated signing of documents between Bulgaria and  Macedonia during this first official visit by the Macedonian  president to our country was postponed because of a language  problem that was raised by the Macedonian side.    The official ceremony related to the departure of the  Macedonian president began at the Boyana residence. The  Macedonian head of state will depart from Bulgaria shortly.</p>

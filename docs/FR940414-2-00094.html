Cawley, OCC, to Jerry W. Carpenter, Esq. Chief, Branch of Clearing Agency Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, Commission (March 8, 1993). The amendment modified Article VIII, section 6 of OCC's By-Laws to clarify that in the event a clearing member seeks to withdraw from membership at the time of an additional assessment to the clearing funds and such clearing member's computed contribution is less than its minimum required contribution, the clearing member will be obligated to contribute 100% of the amount equal to its minimum contribution less its computed contribution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Description <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of this rule change is to revise the formula by which OCC assesses its clearing funds for losses incurred as a result of a default by a clearing member and for losses resulting from the failure of any bank or securities or commodities clearing organization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OCC maintains a stock clearing fund to which OCC's stock clearing members are required to contribute and a non-equity securities clearing fund to which non-equity security clearing members are required to contribute. Among other things, the purpose of the clearing funds is to make good any losses sustained by OCC as a result of the failure of a clearing member to meet its obligations to OCC or the failure of a clearing bank or another clearing organization to settle with OCC. Currently in the event of a clearing member default, once the contributions of the defaulting clearing member are exhausted, OCC will charge on a pro rata basis the clearing fund contributions of non-defaulting clearing members for any remaining losses. Similarly, in the event of a clearing bank or clearing organization default, the resulting loss is to be charged against all clearing members' contributions to the clearing funds on a pro rata basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unless a clearing member has been recently admitted, a clearing member's contribution to the clearing funds is determined pursuant to the formula set forth in OCC Rule 1001. A clearing member's contribution to the clearing funds is related to the clearing member's use of the options markets provided, however, that each clearing member must contribute at least the required minimum. Pursuant to Rule 1001, each stock clearing member or non-equity securities clearing member must contribute to the stock clearing fund or the non-equity securities clearing fund, respectively, the greater of: (i) Such clearing member's proportionate share (``computed contribution'') of five percent of its average daily aggregate margin requirement in respect of equity or non-equity securities option contracts outstanding during the previous calendar month or (ii) the required minimum contribution amount of $75,000. Because this contribution formula is based on a clearing member's open interests and margin requirements, it provides a reasonable approximation of a clearing member's participation in the options markets and use of OCC's services. Therefore, it is highly probable that a clearing member who deposits the required minimum to the clearing funds is less active in the options markets in ways that give rise to potential OCC financial exposure than a clearing member whose clearing fund contribution is its computed contribution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the current assessment formula, non-defaulting clearing members are charged on a pro rata basis against their required contributions, whether computed or the minimum. OCC believes that it is more equitable to base its assessment formula on a clearing member's participation in the options markets and use of OCC's services rather than on a minimum contribution requirement. Therefore, OCC is proposing that charges to clearing fund contributions be made on a proportionate basis against non-defaulting clearing members' computed contributions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, OCC is amending section 5 of Article VIII of its By-Laws to provide that any losses remaining after use of a defaulting clearing member's assets or as the result of a failure of a clearing bank or another clearing organization will be charged on a proportionate basis against non-defaulting clearing members' computed contributions. Section 5 is further amended to add three Interpretations and Policies. The Interpretations and Policies set forth the manner by which a clearing member's proportionate share of a remaining loss will be determined. As a result of these rule changes, OCC believes that the assessment formula is based upon a clearing member's use of the options markets and use of OCC's services and is more equitable to those clearing members which use the options markets with less frequency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

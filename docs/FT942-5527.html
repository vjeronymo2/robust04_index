			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Venezuela restores right of economic freedom The Venezuelan government has restored a constitutional provision granting the private sector freedom of economic activity, writes Joseph Mann in Caracas. Wednesday's action, praised by businessmen, lifted the February 26 suspension of so-called 'economic guarantees', which enshrine the individual's right 'to freely engage in the economic activity of his choice' without undue government interference. At the time of the suspension, the government of President Rafael Caldera said the measure would be temporary. Businessmen were worried, however, that the government would use the suspension to wield special economic powers, such as extensive price controls. The previous suspension of economic guarantees lasted 30 years. Ironically, on the same day as this move toward economic liberalisation, the cabinet approved a three-month extension of price controls on a wide range of pharmaceutical products. Mr Alberto Poletto, industry minister, said however, that some 'moderate' price increases would be permitted for medicines, and that it was not the government's 'style' to decree price controls on a general basis. Venezuela's central bank revealed on Wednesday that the consumer price index rose 5.2 per cent in May, the highest monthly increase in recent years. Most of the May rise was due to higher import costs related to a rapid devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar during April and most of May. Mr Julio Sosa, finance minister, said inflation this year was now expected to reach 50-60 per cent, compared with 46 per cent in 1993.</p>

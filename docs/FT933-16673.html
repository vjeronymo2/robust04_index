			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Technology: Annual reports put on disk - Worth Watching Manipulating companies' financial data on a personal computer has become an everyday part of an investor's life, writes Paul Abrahams. But getting the information from the annual reports into the PC is laborious and the chances of making a mistake are considerable. SmithKline Beecham, the healthcare group, has linked up with a London-based software house, AND Technology, to tackle the problem. At the back of SmithKline Beecham's report and accounts this year is a small plastic wallet with a diskette, containing the group's financial data going back five years. The data can be accessed using the software provided or can be downloaded to spreadsheets such as Lotus 123. AND: UK, 081 673 5330.</p>

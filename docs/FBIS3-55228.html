			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Vladimir Plotnikov and Vadim Telichev from Crimea; from </F> the "Novosti" newscast]    [Text] [Plotnikov] In the new year there are more thorough  structural changes in store for industry in Ukraine and  particularly in Crimea. This is the case, for example, at the  former "Foton" production association in Simferopol, which used  to provide services for the defense sector but which has now  become a commercial science and production firm and is rapidly  increasing its output of nontraditional goods. Those goods  include microwave ovens, large-screen TV sets, 55-channel  satellite TV receivers, and antennae. They are cheaper than  their foreign equivalents and can be bought not for dollars but  for Ukrainian coupons. Structural reorganization is a means of  salvation for many other enterprises in conditions when there  are no raw materials, demand for traditional goods has fallen,  and the energy crisis has become extremely acute. The Crimean  Supreme Soviet decree on an open economy regime in the peninsula  offers good scope for this kind of reorganization. This decree  will encourage the participation of foreign partners and  investors in the development of a modern production industry.</p>

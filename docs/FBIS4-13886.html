			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "New Regional Spread for Iraqi </F> Intelligence"]    [Excerpts] Beirut, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Well-informed  Iraqi sources have revealed in contacts with Jordan that the  plan to assassinate Iraqi oppositionist Talib al-Suhayl was  jointly drawn up by the intelligence center in Baghdad, the  Iraqi regional intelligence center in Amman, and the Iraqi  Embassy in Beirut. The plan was part of a new regional spread  for Iraqi intelligence.    The sources said that the intelligence deputy chief, who is  the Iraqi president's cousin, received an order from Saddam  Husayn to watch al-Suhayl's movements once he is notified by the  Iraqi Embassy in Lebanon of al-Suhayl's presence in Beirut, and  to draw up a plan to assassinate him, whatever the political and  diplomatic consequences.    The intention was to use some Palestinian agents linked to  Iraqi organs in Lebanon, but the speed with which the Iraqi  president's order was issued prompted reliance on Iraqi  intelligence elements who have diplomatic capacities.    Iraqi intelligence elements had been watching al-Suhayl's  movements for nine months, since the uncovering of an attempt to  overthrow the regime in Baghdad. [passage omitted]    The sources believe that al-Suhayl's assassination is a  message to Jordanian authorities on the one hand and Lebanese  authorities and the Syrian Government on the other. Al-Suhayl  had enjoyed Jordan's protection since 1970. He left Jordan  after receiving murder threats from Iraqi intelligence. The  Iraqi Government wanted also to ridicule the Lebanese  authorities' attempts to restore security to Lebanon in  cooperation with the Syrian Government. Its intention was to  carry out an operation such that it would be difficult to  uncover Iraqi diplomats' implication in it. But chance and  mistakes in implementation led to the exposure of Iraqi organs'  implication in this operation. [passage omitted]    The sources revealed that their information from inside  Iraqi  organs confirms that al-Suhayl's assassination is the start of a  large-scale plan which exploits the relaxation in relations  between Iraq and a number of states and the increase in the  number of Iraqi diplomats present in diplomatic capacities  primarily in Jordan, Lebanon, Qatar, Yemen, Tunisia, Turkey,  Morocco, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Russia, France, and Italy.  The number of these has doubled over the past year. Diplomatic  missions have been supplied with elements from the intelligence  and the special security organ or relatives of the Iraqi  president, as is the case in Jordan, Yemen, Italy, Turkey,  Libya, Morocco, Qatar, Sudan, and the Iraqi mission in Cairo.    The sources revealed that the planned assassination  operations in Lebanon include the targeting of the embassies of  a number of states hostile to Iraq. There is also coordination  in Jordan to carry out similar operations in cooperation with  pro-Iraqi Palestinian organizations, in addition to planning  kidnapping operations using Iraqi embassy cars, which enjoy  diplomatic immunity at land border points.    The sources said that the Iraqi Airlines and trade missions  have accommodated a number of intelligence officers posing as  technicians and commercial employees, as is the case in Tunisia,  Mauritania, and Jordan. In Jordan, the Land Transporation  Company, the Iraqi Trade Coordination Establishment in  al-'Aqabah, and the Trade Section in Amman are used to this end.    The sources believe that part of the political and military  onslaught which the Iraqi president has been threatening since  Ramadan [February/March] is devoted to the assassination of  Iraqi oppositionists and diplomats belonging to states that have  no relations with the Iraqi Government at present -- Arab and  foreign states.    The sources confirmed that they obtained their information  from elements working in Iraqi organs and Iraqi embassies  abroad. They declined to reveal another aspect of their  information at present for practical and security reasons.</p>

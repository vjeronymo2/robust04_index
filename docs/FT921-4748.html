			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The offshore way to soften hard Labour  -The tax implications THE prospect of a Labour government, with plans for tax increases for high earners, must be tempting many readers to move their money offshore. But given that most UK citizens have to declare all their worldwide income to the Inland Revenue, what advantages can offshore funds offer to investors who do not want to break the law? The main advantage is the ability to postpone, rather than avoid, tax. This can be done by 'rolling up' rather than repatriating income on an offshore fund. Tax is paid only when the income is actually taken out of the fund. Essentially, such funds invest in cash deposits. A range of currencies is available but, unless you are likely to face liabilities in a foreign currency (if you plan to emigrate, for example), it is safer to stick to sterling. Using these funds, it might be possible to 'ride through' a high-taxing Labour government and then repatriate the income once a Conservative government returns to power. But the snags with this strategy are that Labour might find some way of imposing tax disadvantages on overseas investment; or, conversely, it might offer tax incentives to domestic investors. Either way, the investor who had moved his money offshore prematurely might regret it. The second problem is that once Labour is in office, it might be there for some time. Accordingly, investors could face a long wait for their money. Nor is there any guarantee that if Labour raised taxes, a Tory administration would be able to lower them. For those willing to take the risk and plan for the long term, however, there could be advantages in using the offshore route. They include: Those approaching state retirement age. Labour intends to introduce a top rate of tax of 50 per cent. In addition, the upper limit on National Insurance payments will be abolished, effectively adding a further 9 per cent on top; a tax which savers will pay as well in the form of an investment income surcharge. Labour says that those above state pension age will not pay the surcharge, nor will it be paid on the pension income of those who retire early. Nevertheless, there are plenty of people who will be hit by this increase. Many people approaching retirement will have built-up their savings, and those who have retired before 65 (60 for women) will often depend on non-pension savings income for their standard of living. By investing in a roll-up fund, they can postpone paying tax on such income until state retirement age. At that point, not only will they probably be in a lower tax band but they will not face the surcharge. The snag, of course, is that many will not be able to afford to postpone their income. Parents investing for children The normal scope for parents to give money to their children for investment purposes is limited. If the income from such savings is over Pounds 100 a year, it will be taxed as if earned by the parent. But if the money is invested in a roll-up fund, it can be withdrawn after the child is 18. At that point, the child will have his own personal allowance and money from the roll-up fund can be taken as tax-free income. However, cash funds historically have not been great investments over long periods. If a child is young, it might be that an equity-based investment, while perhaps less tax-efficient, might bring greater total returns. Those moving abroad Anyone who knows he will be leaving the UK can build up his savings in a roll-up fund and avoid UK tax. He will, however, face tax payments in his chosen country of residence. Thus, careful advice needs to be taken on the nature of the tax regime in the new country. There are three leading companies in the field at the moment - NM Rothschild, Guinness Flight and Fidelity - and the rates they offer are available each day in the FT managed funds pages. Guinness and Fidelity recently have published free guides to the tax advantages of investing offshore. To get them, contact Guinness Flight at Lighterman's Court, 5 Gainsford Street, Tower Bridge, London SE1 2NE; or Fidelity by calling 0800-414-161.</p>

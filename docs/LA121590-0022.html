			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAKING SIDES OVER ABORTION AND TBS  </P> <P> TBS is taking sides with teen-agers who find it impossible to obey some of the  restrictive parental notification laws that have been passed in many states.  Broadcasting "Abortion Denied: Shattering Young Women's Lives" does not say  that TBS is pro-abortion.  </P> <P> It does say that it is pro-choice -- a distinction in terms that is important  and frequently not observed by the media.  </P> <P> Ted Turner did the public a favor by giving it facts about a situation many of  us are ignorant of. Those of us who come from middle-class homes and would  support our children and help them come to the conclusion that is right for  them are often unaware of homes where parents are unavailable or would abuse a  daughter who told them she was pregnant. Some of these pregnancies are the  result of rape, incest or just ignorance. Compassionate counseling and  assistance are what is needed, not punitive laws.  </P> <P> MARION E. DIXON, La Jolla  </P></p>

His successor, Colonel  Wayne Koppa, is scheduled to arrive this week.    During Moon's office, 33 U.S. defense delegations visited  Latvia and consulted Latvian specialists in medicine, law, civil  control over military structures and other specific issues.    Fifteen groups of Latvian defense officials joined various  U.S. government-sponsored workshops and courses in America,  Latvian Defense Minister Valdis Pavlovskis told reporters.    The U.S. Army assistance group consists of five specialists.  It aims at helping Latvia create democratic armed forces after  the Western sample.

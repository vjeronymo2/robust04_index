			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Mystery surrounds helicopter death crash ELEVEN men are believed to have died when a helicopter crashed in a North Sea blizzard, on what should have been a two-minute trip from a Shell oil platform to an accommodation vessel 200 yards away. There were six survivors of Saturday evening's accident, the cause of which was still a mystery yesterday. A specialist diving ship yesterday arrived at the Cormorant Alpha platform, 100 miles north-east of Shetland. It will attempt to locate and salvage the wreckage of the Super Puma helicopter, made by Aerospatiale of France. Six bodies had been recovered last night and there was no hope of finding any of the five missing men alive. The helicopter's operator, Bristow, said it had no immediate evidence of technical failure. 'The aircraft has an outstanding safety record so far,' it said. The intensive use of helicopters in the North Sea has led to several fatal accidents over the past 10 years. Most serious was the crash of a Boeing Chinook in 1986, which killed 45 men. Although the weather on Saturday night was poor - with the wind gusting at up to 60mph in snow squalls - Shell said the helicopter flight was within safety guidelines. Mr Frank Doran, Labour's oil industry spokesman, said: 'Despite the fact that pilots are trained to fly in extreme conditions, unless the flight was absolutely necessary I think we would want to question seriously why they were flying in these conditions at all.' Unions representing offshore workers said they would press for an inquiry into helicopter safety. Mr Roger Lyons, general-secretary elect of the MSF offshore workers' union, said: 'Shell has refused to discuss helicopter safety with us, and tomorrow I shall go back to the Civil Aviation Authority to tell them this is too important to be left to the company.'</p>

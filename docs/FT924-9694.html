			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Possible new US bidder for TVS TVS ENTERTAINMENT, the south of England ITV company which has lost its franchise, has had a new approach from the US, which could lead to a higher bid for the company. The approach has been made through TCW Capital, an Dollars 800m (Pounds 490m) investment arm of Trust, the Los Angeles money management company. It comes as the offer document for a bid worth Pounds 38.2m from International Family Entertainment for the ITV company is being finalised. IFE runs The Family Channel, a cable television channel devoted to wholesome entertainment which has more than 56m subscribers in the US. TVS shares, which before the offer in September were as low as 3 1/2 p, rose 4 1/2 p to 26p yesterday. Senior TVS executives were uncertain who was ultimately behind the new approach or how serious it was. One suggested possibility was Mr Alan Hirschfield, a media entrepreneur and a former head of Columbia Pictures. Mr Hirschfield has built a stake of more than 6 per cent in TVS. US investors are interested in TVS for two main reasons. The chief is the UK company's American subsidiary MTM and its library of programmes such as Hill Street Blues and Lou Grant. But TVS is also seen as a potential vehicle for entering the UK and continental European programme production market. Earlier this year Mr Rudolph Agnew, the TVS chairman, took the view that selling the company would be the best way of realising value for shareholders. The IFE offer would mean 25p for ordinary shareholders and 45p for preference shareholders. The offer has generated considerable opposition particularly from preference shareholders. Mr James Gatward, former chief executive of TVS, is also opposed to the IFE offer and said he would be willing to carry out a restructuring of the company he founded to ensure its survival.</p>

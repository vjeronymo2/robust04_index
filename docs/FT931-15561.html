			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / International Company News: BCE takes 5% stake in Spar Aerospace BCE, Canada's biggest telecommunications group, has bought a 5 per cent direct interest in Spar Aerospace in order to ensure a strong role in the development of international satellite communi-cations projects. BCE paid CDollars 8.5m (USDollars 6.6m) for a block of subordinate voting shares held by Mr Larry Clarke, Spar chairman. BCE and Spar already control Telesat, the Canadian domestic communications satellite operator which was privatised recently. Spar is Canada's sole space equipment contractor and is best known for the Canadarm shuttle manipulator. BCE, which is concentrating on its telecommunications businesses, plans to sell its 25 per cent interest in SHL Systemhouse, a fast growing computer systems integrator.</p>

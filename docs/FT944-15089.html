			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Kuwait compensation appeal Iraq's latest threatening moves towards Kuwait have deprived the UN of badly needed funds to pay compensation to victims of its 1990 invasion - by ensuring the UN embargo on Iraqi oil sales remains in place, a senior Kuwaiti official said yesterday. Mr Abdul Rahman al-Houti, chairman of Kuwait's public authority for assessing compensation, appealed to countries holding Iraqi assets to transfer 30 per cent of the funds to the UN compensation commission so that urgent claims can be paid. The commission, meeting this week in Geneva to assess claims from those forced to flee Kuwait and property claims below Dollars 100,000, has paid out less than Dollars 3m (Pounds 2m) so far. Total claims to the Commission amount to nearly Dollars 170bn, including Kuwaiti claims of over Dollars 102bn.</p>

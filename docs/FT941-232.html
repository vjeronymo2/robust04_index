			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / EU urged to discuss military and political issues The European Union should use its institutional review in 1996 to discuss how its military capabilities can help its political aims, the head of the Western European Union defence group said yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels. The WEU's secretary-general, Mr Willem van Eekelen, whose organisation might one day become the EU's defence arm, said that 'to a certain extent, Maastricht has already been overtaken'. He told the European parliament's foreign affairs and security committee that he was 'talking about the use of our military capabilities in a wider context to support our political objectives outside Europe'. Mr Van Eekelen said the WEU could take over some operational activities from the EU where it was involved in such tasks as providing police training in former Yugoslavia.</p>

During the three days, the draft treaty on  radar in the city of Skrunda was the topic of discussion. During  the talks, the parties did not reach any fundamental agreement  on the terms for keeping the Russian radar in Latvia temporarily.    The head of the Latvian delegation, Martins Virsis, declined  to comment on this round of talks. The head of the Soviet  delegation, Ambassador Sergey Zotov, emphasized in a talk with  journalists that the "delay in discussing an agreement on the  radar is postponing the signing of the closely related troop  withdrawal treaty."</p>

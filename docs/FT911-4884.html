			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / US ignored alert on arms to Baghdad THE White House allowed the shipment of military spare parts to Jordan until just before the outbreak of the air war against Iraq in January, according to past and present US government officials. The US shipments, which included diesel engine components for armoured vehicles and electronic testing equipment, continued in spite of intelligence advice that the kingdom was being used as an illegal conduit into neighbouring Iraq. There were additional concerns from the State Department and other government agencies that Iraq's other suppliers in the west were sending arms, spare parts and dual-use technology - which can have military as well as civilian applications - through Jordan as a way of evading the United Nations embargo against Iraq. Senior White House officials were given a written warning early last December that military shipments from US companies to Jordan were likely to be passed on to Iraq. It was delivered to Mr Robert Gates, the deputy national security adviser to President Bush. It was only several weeks later - after hostilities had begun in the Gulf - that the warning was acknowledged. In spite of these warnings, no changes were made to the way in which the export of military-related equipment to Jordan from the west was scrutinised. Yesterday, the White House said it had no comment on the issue of shipments to Iraq and Jordan. Up until the middle of January, the administration had denied persistent reports that Jordan was serving as a transhipment point, arguing that the UN embargo was virtually leak-proof. According to several administration officials, the White House had previously given its approval to the shipment of sensitive military equipment and technologies directly to Iraq as late as last June. The nature and scope of US weapons sales to Iraq in 1990 is part of an expanding Congressional inquiry into US support for Baghdad's armaments programmes over the past five years. This support included the sale of chemical weapons precursors, biological agents and dual-use technology applicable in missile development. The House Foreign Affairs sub-committee on international economic policy and trade is focusing on several high-level inter-agency meetings chaired last spring by Mr Gates, who was previously deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). These meetings, in April, May and June, were called to come up with a response to President Saddam Hussein, who had recently test-fired a ballistic missile in Mauritania and threatened to scorch half of Israel. In spite of detailed evidence known to have been available to US intelligence on Iraq's nuclear, chemical and ballistic missile projects, repeated sub-Cabinet meetings at the White House decided to take no action. A Commerce Department recommendation last May for economic sanctions against Baghdad was rejected. The view of some officials in the State Department, CIA, Defence Department and the White House was that it was still important not to isolate Iraq and to use diplomatic pressure to moderate Mr Saddam's behaviour - a view shared by moderate Arab states such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Mr Sam Gejdenson, Democratic chairman of the House subcommittee, said yesterday that the revelation of shipments to Jordan confirmed earlier Congressional testimony by Mr Dennis Kloske, a senior Commerce Department official. 'This is a continuation of a pattern in which the administration continued to do business with Iraq despite every indication that they had lost influence. I think it is clear the administration did not take action to prevent the shipments to Iraq,' Mr Gejdenson said. Democrats had criticised administration policy towards Iraq as a miscalculation bordering on appeasement. Their attacks largely evaporated after the allied victory in the Gulf war but a fresh head of steam may be gathering. New evidence is also emerging about the extent to which the US - along with France, Germany and other western countries - armed Iraq in the 1980s. Congressional committees have recently been told that the government approved 771 licences of high-technology items and biological agents to Iraq between 1985-90 worth Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 839m). The weapons flow was part of a pro-Baghdad tilt by Washington against Tehran which continued well after the end of the Iran-Iraq war in August, 1988. During the summer of 1990, the Commerce Department became alarmed at the stream of applications from US companies for export licences for dual-use technology. Mr Kloske told the committee last week that he ordered officials to tie up the licence applications in red tape - a rare and controversial admission since Congress constantly complains about unnecessary restrictions on US exports. Mr Kloske, who intends to leave the administration, was singled out for criticism by the White House which denied reports that he was sacked for talking to Congress.</p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / International Company News: Steep rise at Aker despite weak markets Aker, the Norwegian cement and building materials and oil and technology group, yesterday reported a steep rise in pre-tax profits for 1993 in the face of of weak construction markets at home and abroad. Turnover improved 5 per cent to NKr18.1bn (Dollars 2.4bn) but operating profit advanced strongly to NKr750m from NKr72m in 1992. Pre-tax profits, after financial items, advanced to NKr851m from NKr386m. Aker is stepping up its dividend to NK3.50 a share from the NKr2.60 paid for 1992. Mr Tom Ruud, chief executive, said the group had completed an extensive five-year restructuring which had transformed Aker into a strong financial industrial company with considerable investment capacity for the future. The cement and building materials division lifted pre-tax profit to NKr295m from NKr18m on sales little changed at NKr5.9bn, against NKr5.8bn. 'The improvement is due primarily to increased earnings by the international cement business and reduced financial expenses,' Aker said. The oil and gas technology division moved back into profit with a pre-tax return of NKr515m, against a loss of NKr77m. Sales rose to NKr11.5bn from NKr10.6bn.</p>

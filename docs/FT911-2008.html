			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / International Company News: General Dynamics to cut staff by 30% GENERAL Dynamics, the second largest US defence contractor, said yesterday that it expects to cut its 90,000 workforce by at least 30 per cent by the mid-1990s because of lower US defence spending. The figures, given at the company's annual meeting, reflect both the Pentagon's budget cuts and a new broom approach at General Dynamics under Mr William Anders, the group's recently-appointed chairman. Mr Anders, a blunt-speaking former astronaut, is not sure the defence spending downturn is ever going to be reversed, and he has decided to slash the company's employment and research budgets while possibly pushing it into entirely new business areas. Mr James Mellor, the company president, told the meeting that while it had spent Dollars 1.6bn on new capital projects over the past four years, it planned to spend only Dollars 575m over the next four. The US defence budget is likely to shrink by 25 per cent over the next five years, and all main contractors face sharp cutbacks. But few have yet been as forthright as General Dynamics about the consequences.</p>

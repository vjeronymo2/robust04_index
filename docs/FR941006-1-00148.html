			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Regulatory Options  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are many possible regulatory alternatives available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that may reduce the number of cases of pediatric poisonings from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the accidental ingestion of iron-containing products. The options include packaging, warning statements, product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reformulation, and educational efforts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Packaging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One regulatory option available to FDA is to require that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products containing iron be packaged in unit-dose containers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the CPSC regulations, most iron-containing products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently must be packaged in CRC's. Therefore, the effect of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this option would be to require child resistant unit-dose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> packaging for most of these products. FDA could require unit-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dose packaging for all products or for only higher dosage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products. For comparison, FDA will consider potencies of 30 mg,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 mg, and 60 mg as the minimum potencies per dosage unit of iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that would trigger unit-dosage packaging.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Costs.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are four types of costs associated with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandated packaging change: Equipment, materials, transportation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and administrative costs. If this option is selected, many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> packagers of iron-containing products will be required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purchase new packaging equipment. The cost of equipment used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> packaging blisters, one common form of unit-dose packaging, is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between $50,000 and $250,000, or on average $132,500. New  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment will not be purchased for each product sold because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some manufacturers already possess unit-dose packaging equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The cost of child-resistant bottles, currently the most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> common form of packaging, is approximately $7 per 1,000 dosage units. Child-resistant blisters cost approximately $9 per 1,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dosage units, a difference of $2 per 1,000 dosage units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA does not have information to estimate additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transportation costs caused by unit-dose packaging requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and requests comments on increased transportation costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, firms are expected to incur administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs of approximately $500 per product in the first year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrative costs are the dollar value of the incremental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative effort expended in order to comply with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation. Administrative activities include, but are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited to, identifying the underlying policy of the regulation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpreting that policy relative to the firm's products,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishing a corporate position, formulating a method for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance, and managing the compliance effort.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If FDA were to require unit-dose packaging for all iron-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containing products irrespective of their potency per dosage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit, the cost of equipment would be $39 million (300 products &times;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $132,500). The annual materials cost would be $24 million ((12  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> billion dosage units/1,000) &times; $2.00), or $260 million over the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> next 20 years (discounted at 7 percent). Administrative costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be $150,000. Total costs associated with requiring unit-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dose packaging for all iron-containing products would be $299  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> million over 20 years (discounted at seven percent).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If FDA were to require unit-dose packaging for products with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30 mg iron/dosage unit or higher, the cost of equipment would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $20 million (150 products &times; $132,500). The cost of materials would be $3 million per year or $32 million over 20 years  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (discounted at 7 percent). Administrative costs would be $75,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (150 &times; $500). Total costs associated with requiring unit-dose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> packaging for products containing 30 mg or more per dosage unit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be $52 million over 20 years (discounted at 7 percent).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If FDA were to require unit-dose packaging for products with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 mg iron/dosage unit or higher, the cost of equipment would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $13 million (100 products &times; $132,500). The cost of materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be $2 million per year or $22 million over 20 years  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (discounted at 7 percent). Administrative costs would be $50,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (100 &times; $500). Total costs associated with requiring unit-dose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> packaging for products containing 40 mg or more iron per dosage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit would be $35 million over 20 years (discounted at 7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If FDA were to require unit-dose packaging for products with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 60 mg iron/dosage unit or higher, the cost of equipment would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $5 million (37 products &times; $132,500). The cost of materials would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be $0.8 million per year or $8 million over 20 years (discounted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at 7 percent). Administrative costs would be $19,000 (37 &times;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $500). Total costs associated with requiring unit-dose packaging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for products containing 60 mg or more iron per dosage unit would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be $6 million over 20 years (discounted at 7 percent).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

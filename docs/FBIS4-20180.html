			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Prosperity Party [PP] leader Necmettin Erbakan has  said that his party does not consider negotiations on the Cyprus  issue necessary. If negotiations must be held, he said, they  must be held only after the existence of two communities having  equal rights is accepted.    Addressing PP deputies today, Erbakan said that the first  thing to do is to strengthen the Turkish Republic of Northern  Cyprus [TRNC] and to ensure that it is recognized. From the  beginning, he said, we have been calling for the existence of  two independent separate states on the island.    [Begin Erbakan recording] Everybody knows that we never  cared for these negotiations from the beginning. We have only  one problem in Cyprus and it is to ensure that the TRNC is  recognized first by the Muslim countries and then by the entire  world, then to help strengthen the TRNC and increase its  prosperity. That is our only Cyprus problem. [end recording]    Erbakan said that if negotiations must be held, they must be  held only after the equality of the two communities is accepted.  The issues can be discussed separately in the negotiations, he  said.    The PP leader pointed out that the United Nations has been  defending the same principles for the past 15 years, but that  since Butrus-Ghali became secretary general, the UN started to  ask for concessions. Erbakan stressed that the Turkish Grand  National Assembly rejected this stand both on 10 June and with  its resolution yesterday.    On the economy, Erbakan said that inflation and foreign debt  will increase fast and the growth rate drop. He said that for a  solution either early elections or a new coalition is necessary.</p>

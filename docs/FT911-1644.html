			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Ford and Vauxhall attack claim on prices FORD AND Vauxhall, the UK car market leaders, yesterday attacked figures produced for the Monopolies and Mergers Commission claiming that some pre-tax car prices charged in the UK are over 50 per cent higher than in certain other European markets. The controversial figures produced for the MMC by Ludvigsen Associates, the UK-based automotive consultancy, are expected to provoke a fierce dispute as the MMC finalises its monopolies inquiry into the distribution and pricing of new cars in the UK. The MMC has already provisionally concluded that at least two so-called 'complex monopolies' exist in the supply of new cars, which 'prevent, restrict or distort' competition in the UK market. The Consumers' Association claimed yesterday that the Ludvigsen report vindicated its 10-year campaign claiming that cars 'can be thousands of pounds cheaper in continental Europe compared with the UK. 'The details of the MMC's work blow out of the water the arguments of manufacturers that price differences are due to special factors - such as exchange rate movements, specification differences and discounts.' Mr Paul Tosch, chairman and managing director of Vauxhall, which controls about 16 per cent of the UK new car market, said the company had commissioned its own independent research which cast serious doubts on the Ludvigsen findings. 'We do not agree with the Ludvigsen figures. We have not finished our discussions with the MMC, but on a broad basis we are very competitive in the UK. In some cases prices in the UK are in the lower range compared with the rest of Europe.' Vauxhall also questioned the methodology of the report prepared for the MMC, which had sought to establish actual transaction prices through telephone calls to dealers, in contrast to the Vauxhall study, which had been based on invoices of actual deals. Mr Tosch said Vauxhall had largely stayed within the allowable 12 per cent price band laid down by the European Commission for car price differentials between national markets in Europe, except for a couple of 'rogue' models. Mr Lindsey Halstead, chairman of Ford of Europe, which captured 25 per cent of UK new car sales last year, said differences in pan-European car prices were 'affected by a complex series of issues. There are some factors that the Ludvigsen study did not even consider'. Record Pounds 239m Vauxhall profit Page 13</p>

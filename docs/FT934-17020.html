			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Arts: After Stevie Smith - Poetry in performance 'THERE'S ALWAYS another poet,' said that great humourist in verse, Stevie Smith; but when she died in 1971, readers of poetry might have been forgiven for wondering whether any of these poets were likely to be female. A quick look back at some of the most influential poetry anthologies published in the 1960s and early 1970s seems to suggest otherwise: AL Alvarez's enormously influential The New Poetry (1963) gave us 18 men and just two women; British Poetry since 1945 is even more strikingly unbalanced: 81 males to six females. Was this a true representation of the respective merits of male and female poets at the time - or an example of gender bias on the part of male editors? One publisher that has been doing its utmost to let the voices of younger women poets be heard is Bloodaxe Books of Newcastle, which this week launched both a new anthology of women's poetry from Britain and Ireland, Sixty Women Poets, and initiated a country-wide promotion of this book and six new collections of poetry by women (all represented in the anthology) in conjunction with Waterstones. The reading to launch the anthology, convened in an upper room at Waterstones, Charing Cross Road, was steamy with apostolic fervour. Sixteen of the poets in the anthology read a single poem each; and then came a wide ranging debate on some of the tougher issues of women and their writing. The poets who read, like the anthology itself, ranged widely in mood and subject matter: Pauline Stainer, in a remarkable short poem, memorialised the firefighters of Chernobyl; novelist and poet Elaine Feinstein celebrated the unexpected pleasures of ageing; Jenny Joseph wrote of the difficulties of naming things, the problem of bridging the gap between the name and what is named; Moniza Alvi, born in Pakistan, read 'The Sari', a poem in which she imagined herself a foetus inside her mother's body who is able to look out and see her future stretching ahead of her; Hilary Davies, in 'The Ophthalmologist', described an eye examination, the eerie touch of prying fingers on the skin; Connie Bensley, one of the older poets represented, gave us in her small, meticulous, Home Counties voice, a delightful poetic miniature of three elderly aunts in a garden, fat, comfortable, benign. The anthology represents a selection of the best work from the past 20 years, taking Stevie Smith's death as its starting point. Many readers will baulk at the very idea of a gender-based anthology: is not the purpose of poetry - as of any art - to unite people and not to divide them? But such an anthology as this one was needed. Women poets have been under-represented; and anyone who dips into this one will find evidence everywhere of the way in which female poets have gained a new confidence both in their own abilities and their power to speak out on matters of every kind in recent years. This is not a collection of poems about 'purely domestic' or 'female' matters. Erotic, rambunctious, gutsy, it reads like a celebration by women as writers, equal, both in talent and thematic range, to any of the male poets writing today. Nor is this a carping, defensive book as it might have been if it had been published when the women's movement was at its most vocal. It quietly assumes that certain battles have been fought and won. It deserves to be read if only for the pleasure of discovering some of the older women poets - Elizabeth Bartlett and EJ Scovell, for example - who might have been in many earlier anthologies if the anthologists had thought them worthy of attention. And - the greatest pleasure of all - the poetry is unpretentious. You do not need an English degree to enjoy this book of poems. Sixty Women Poets, edited by Linda France, Bloodaxe Books Pounds 6.95. Poets published this month include: The Country at my Shoulder, Moniza Alvi (Oxford, Pounds 6.99); Angel, Ruth Padel, (Bloodaxe, Pounds 6.95); Other Lovers, Jackie Kay, (Bloodaxe, Pounds 5.95); and White Eyes, Dark Ages, Deborah Randall (Bloodaxe, Pounds 5.95).</p>

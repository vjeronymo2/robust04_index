			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Caracas, 13 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- There was favorable  reaction today to the release -- authorized by President Rafael  Caldera -- of 23 people involved in the 1992 Venezuelan military  coup attempts, because "national coexistence is strengthened."  This was the common opinion of social leaders in praising the  gesture, Caldera's first, which released 12 civilians and 11  military personnel from the San Carlos military detention  facility on Saturday.    Nevertheless, main coup leaders Hugo Chavez Frias, leader of  the 4 February coup attempt, and Hernan Odreman Gruber, leader  of the 27 November uprising, publicly reiterated their refusal  to be discharged from the Army in exchange for their freedom.  The 11 freed officers placed themselves at the disposition of  military tribunals in addition to accepting their military  discharge as a condition to having their cases dismissed, in  accordance with requests by Caldera and the high military  command.    Episcopal Conference President Monsignor Ovidio Perez stated  that the presidential decision is aimed at strengthening the  country's coexistence and to having greater interaction with  society to solve the country's problems. Carlos Canache Mata, a  leader of the former ruling Democratic Action (AD) Party, said  President Caldera's pacification policies are correct as they  allow the Armed Forces to heal its wounds. Orlando Contreras,  acting secretary for the Social Christian Party, said his  organization shares the reasoning that led President Caldera to  make this decision, the third one applied to members of the  military since 1992.    Of the 247 military personnel and civilians who took part in  the uprisings "against the corrupt Carlos Andres Perez  government," as Chavez Frias says, 124 persons remain in jail,  most in military installations. Due to the failed 27 November  coup, about 48 mid-rank officers are in exile in Peru and four  others are in Ecuador. About 116 people had their cases  dismissed during the Perez term, which was suspended in June  1993 due to alleged corruption.    Octavio Lepage, Congress president who acted as president  for  one month in 1993, pardoned one captain. The last administrator  of the former ruling AD party, Ramon J. Velasquez, acquitted  seven officers and "pardoned" Commander Luis Reyes due to health  problems. Likewise, during the Velasquez administration, which  ended its term on 2 February, four members of the military, one  captain, one lieutenant, one sergeant, and one air technician  returned from exile in Peru. Three had their cases dismissed.  The military court, due to a counterorder by the arresting  officer, freed seven of the 11 Air Force officers who took part  in the 27 November attempt. They appealed the decision and  reenlisted.</p>

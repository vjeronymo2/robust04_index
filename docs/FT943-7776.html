			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Books: Making money and faking history - Malcolm Rutherford discusses the motives behind political memoirs POLITICAL MEMOIR: ESSAYS ON THE POLITICS OF MEMORY edited by George Egerton Frank Cass Pounds 38, 351 pages Political memoirs are not a new phenomenon. Otto von Bismarck's sold 300,000 copies within a few weeks of publication in 1898. The Earl of Clarendon's History of the Rebellion and Civil Wars in England, which first appeared in 1702, ran into 20 printings and established the economic foundation of the Oxford University Press. One can go back further. Julius Caesar's Commentaries on the Gallic War continues to be read. And if one spreads the definition of political memoirs widely, so does the Confessions of St Augustine. There is nothing new either about memoirs being at least a partial distortion of the truth. Marshal Foch, who led the French and eventually the allied forces in the first world war, said that he never wrote his memoirs because he had nothing to hide. Another view, quoted in the chapter on Indian memoirs in this book, is simply: 'I really don't understand why intelligent people risk to compose autobiographies. That itself is a matter of psychoanalytical study.' Yet the motives for writing political memoirs, though mixed, are fairly clear. As Stephen Ambrose, a biographer of Presidents Eisenhower and Nixon, writes here, they include making money, catharsis after office, and attempts to influence later historians, to get back at enemies and to justify one's own actions. Ambrose tells a story about the Liars' Club in Burlington, Wisconsin. Portraits of three US presidents hang on the wall: George Washington because he never told a lie; Lyndon Johnson because he never told the truth; and Richard Nixon because he did not know the difference. Ambrose says that this is too kind to Nixon: it was not that he did not know the difference, but that he did not care about the difference. 'He had a Soviet mentality with regard to historical truth. He believed that the past should serve the needs of the present.' Still, it is striking that even Ambrose concludes that the Nixon memoirs have the great virtue of being authentic. Without the memoirs, we would have known less about the man, including his achievements. Other anecdotes abound in this generally rather academic collection of essays on political memoir as a genre. (The word, incidentally, that we must learn to use is 'polygenre'.) President Truman had virtually no income - only an old army pension - when he left the White House. He was eventually offered Dollars 600,000 for his memoirs by Time-Life, Inc, but found it hard to get adequate researchers. He gently fired the first two, then came up with Morton Royce, a professor at Georgetown University who was working on a multi-volume history of the world, but had produced almost nothing. Royce kept asking Truman irritating questions and still failed to write, so he, too, had to go. The memoirs, which Truman described as his 'history', were written almost on time, as Francis H. Heller, who was largely responsible for putting them together, tells here. Subsequently it was discovered that Truman was not a bad writer in his own right, though he may have been dyslexic: he could never spell the name of his secretary of state, Dean Acheson, which came out as Atchison or Atcheson. George Egerton, the editor of the essays, is a Canadian and the collection has a strong north American emphasis. Yet the Canadians, like the British, have had their publishing dramas. In the mid-1940s, for example, the Canadian Liberal Party bought the entire edition (over 15,000 copies) of a biography of Mackenzie King before it reached the bookshops because it was thought to be hostile to the prime minister. King himself had the novel idea of writing his memoirs based on his diaries and incinerating the diaries as the work progressed, though like Edward Heath's so far, the memoirs did not appear. The diaries survived. The recent spate of British political memoirs is not much covered, but there is a reminder that the genre may not be improving with time, length and the increasing use of researchers. When the late Reginald Maudling published his book in 1978, it was called simply Memoirs and ran to under 300 pages. The author confessed that he had kept only one detailed record in his life. It was about the consultations on whether he would serve under Alec Douglas-Home as prime minister. But the record was taken in pencil and was illegible when he came to consult it. 'Anyway', he wrote, 'the details do not matter all that much'. That was authentic Maudling. Where I think that this academic book falls down is in directing the fire at the memoirists, not the publishers. Of course politicians want to write, and so they should. But they do need editing, pruning and checking. This no longer happens. Recently I went through the dozen or so memoirs that include accounts by participants of a famous British cabinet meeting on Westland. Every one was different, often substantially. Someone should have noticed.</p>

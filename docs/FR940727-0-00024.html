The decision to terminate these waivers of the Nonmanufacturer Rule is based on evidence provided to the SBA that there is a small business which manufactures items within these classes of products. This small business is available to provide items within each class to the Federal government. Terminating these waivers will require recipients of contracts set aside for small or 8(a) businesses to provide the products of domestic small business manufacturers or processors where these classes of products are required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The second purpose of this document is to announce that SBA is retaining class waivers for: (1) Bars and rods, high nickel alloy; (2) plate sheet, strip and foil, stainless steel and high nickel alloy; (3) wire, nonelectrical, high nickel alloy; (4) plate, sheet and strip, nickel-copper, nickel-copper-aluminum, copper-nickel, and copper; and (5) sheet and plate aluminum products. The effect of retaining these class waivers is that small businesses which receive either small business set-aside or SBA 8(a) Program contracts for these products awards may provide the products of any domestic manufacturer or processor. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> July 27, 1994.

The SBA regulations imposing this requirement are found at 13 CFR 121.906(b) and 121.1106(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 210 of Public Law 101&hyph;574 further amended the Small Business Act to allow for waivers for classes of products for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors ``available to participate in the Federal procurement market,'' 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17)(B)(iv)(II). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Decision to terminate two class waivers: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. SBA announced its decision to grant a class waiver for bars and rods, high nickel alloy, aluminum, nickel-copper, nickel-copper-aluminum, copper, copper-nickel, aluminum-bronze, and naval brass in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on May 15, 1991, 56 FR 22306. Recently, the Defense Logistics Agency's (DLA) Defense Industrial Supply Center (DISC) brought to SBA's attention the existence of a small business manufacturer for items within this class of products. Based on this information, a notice of the Agency's intent to terminate this waiver and waivers for six other classes of products was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 10, 1994, 59 FR 1360. The notice allowed thirty days for a comment period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comments received from the small businesses and DLA were similar to each other. They agreed that a small business exists which manufactures items in this class of products. However, they believed they may not be able to supply all of their potential procurement requirements with items manufactured by the small business. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the SBA's published regulations, 58 FR 48954 (1993), ``(u)pon receipt by the SBA of evidence that a small business manufacturer or processor exists in the Federal market for a waived class of products, the waiver shall be terminated by the Associate Administrator for (Government Contracting).'' Based on this regulation, the SBA is required to terminate the class waiver for this class of products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the waiver previously granted for bars and rods, high nickel alloy, aluminum, nickel-copper, nickel-copper-aluminum, copper, copper-nickel, aluminum-bronze, and naval brass (Product and Service Code (PSC) 9530, Standard Industrial Classification Code (SIC) 3356) is terminated, effective ninety days from the date of this notice. Small business set-aside or SBA 8(a) Program contracts for this class of products may rely on this waiver where the solicitation is dated before the ninetieth day after the date of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  publication of this termination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. SBA announced its decision to grant the waiver for structural shapes, angles, channels, tees and zees, aluminum and high nickel alloy in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on May 15, 1991, 56 FR 22306. The DISC brought to SBA's attention the existence of a small business manufacturer for items within this class of products. Based on this information, a notice of the Agency's intent to terminate this waiver was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 10, 1994, 59 FR 1360.

Those five classes are: (1) Bars and rods, high nickel alloy (PSC 9510, SIC 3312); (2) Plate, sheet, strip and foil, stainless steel and high nickel alloy (PSC 9515, SIC 3312); (3) Wire, nonelectrical, high nickel alloy (PSC 9525, SIC 3356); (4) Plate, sheet and strip, nickel-copper, nickel-copper-aluminum, copper-nickel, and copper (PSC 9535, SIC 3353); and (5) Sheet and plate aluminum products (PSC 9535, SIC 3353). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SBA originally announced its decision to grant class waivers of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for these five classes of products in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on May 15, 1991, 56 FR 22306. While researching SBA's Procurement Automated Source System (PASS) on a related issue, SBA became aware of the possible existence of small business manufacturers for items within each of these classes of products. After the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  announcement on January 10, 1994, of an intent to terminate these classes of products, the SBA received comments from several small businesses and DLA regarding this matter. All parties urged that SBA not terminate waivers for these five classes of products on the basis that doing so would adversely affect both the Federal procurement process for these items and the existing suppliers for those products. Also, we learned that the production capabilities of the small business manufacturers of these products is severely limited in quantity and product type. Based on these comments, the SBA will retain the class waivers for these classes of products. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: July 19, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Thomas A.

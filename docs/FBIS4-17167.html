			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Suslikov report: "Rocket Seeks Customer"] </F>   [Text] Omsk -- The "Polet" Aerospace Association, which in  the recent past manufactured the launch rockets for the "Buran"  shuttle in Omsk, has obtained a license from the Russian agency  granting it the right to launch Russian and foreign satellites.    "Polet" relies mainly on the "Cosmos" rocket, which is  capable of lifting large numbers of satellites into orbit for a  variety of purposes. Evidence from independent European experts  testifies to the rocket's high class: Only 19 failures in 700  launches is one of the world's best records.    The Russian rocket has a further advantage -- it is cheaper  than foreign counterparts. All the same, it will not be easy to  find buyers. The West dictates its own policy in the space  commercial services market.</p>

It was an act that "merits the firmest condemnation," the  Foreign Ministry said in a statement that went on to extend  condolences to the families of the victims.    Italy "expects Israel to adopt all the necessary measures to  prevent any further bloodshed," the foreign office said.    "Greater vigilance and sense of responsibility must prevail  on all sides in order to ward off the recreation of a vicious  circle of violence," the statement continued, adding that "the  madness of extremist fringe groups" could not be allowed to  jeopardize the peace process.    "This tragic episode is part of a series of acts of repeated  violence, nearly always against innocent civilians, used by  extremists of all denominations aiming to block the peace  process," the statement continued, adding that the peace talks,  "despite all the objective difficulties, are marking important  steps forward."</p>

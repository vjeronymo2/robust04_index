			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / Clarke promises economy will not boom and bust: Future rise in interest rates indicated by Bank governor Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, last night pledged that the government would not steer Britain's economic recovery into a new boom and bust cycle by generating a 'fraudulent, inflationary, feel good' factor among the electorate. Delivering the annual Mansion House speech in the City, Mr Clarke moved decisively to scotch suggestions that the government might opt for more expansionary economic policies in the wake of recent electoral disasters. After a day in which official figures pointed to a steady, low inflation recovery from recession, he made clear that public spending cuts would take precedence over tax cuts. He declared that it would be 'very bad politics' for the government to risk more inflation. 'We will cut taxes again, but only when we can afford to do so,' Mr Clarke said. 'The public are usually more sensible than politicians and the press. They will not put their confidence in a government that cuts taxes before getting borrowing under control.' The Mansion House speech has traditionally been the occasion for chancellors to expound on monetary policy. But last night, Mr Clarke chose a broader brush approach, partly because the details of monetary policy are in the public domain following the government's decision to publish the minutes of the chancellor's meetings with Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England. It was left to Mr George to dwell briefly on monetary matters, with a clear warning that UK interest rates would have to move upwards at some unspecified moment in the future. When rates were raised it would be 'to maintain the (economic) expansion at a sustainable pace', Mr George said. The Bank's purpose was 'not to leave the tightening of policy so late that the economy is brought to a juddering halt by a much larger interest rise than would otherwise be needed'. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, later claimed the speeches showed Mr George did not find Mr Clarke's policies 'credible'. He added that the government could not be trusted now on taxes or interest rates. Yesterday's figures on unemployment, inflation and earnings suggested the economic recovery is being sustained. Average earnings slowed to an underlying average annual rate of 3 3/4 per cent in April from 4 per cent in March, calming City fears that the Bank might soon have to push up short term interest rates. The news on the retail prices front was also positive, with the annual 'headline' rate of inflation staying unchanged at 2.6 per cent in May compared with April. Although the underlying measure of retail price inflation quickened to 2.5 per cent last month from 2.3 per cent in April, analysts said the increase partly reflected seasonal factors. Meanwhile, a seasonally adjusted 20,100 drop in unemployment to 2.66m in May reinforced the picture of a steady recovery. The fall, for the fourth month in a row, cut the jobless rate among benefit claimants to 9.4 per cent of the workforce in May from 9.5 per cent the month before. There continued, however, to be a discrepancy between the claimant figures and those for the workforce in employment. The latter showed that the number of people in employment fell by 92,000 in 1994's first quarter. Mr John Prescott, shadow employment secretary, said: 'The government's own statistics show in 1993, while 201,000 people came off unemployment benefits, employment increased by only 19,000. The rest disappeared.'

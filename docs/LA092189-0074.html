			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOK IT LIGHT: HAMBURGER PIE GOES HEALTHFUL  </P> <P> DEAR JEANNE: This dish is one of our family favorites, and I would appreciate  it if you could revise it.  </P> <P>  -- NEVA, Citrus Heights, Calif.  </P> <P> HAMBURGER PIE  </P> <P> 1 pound ground beef  </P> <P> 1 medium onion, chopped  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> 1 (16-ounce) can cut green beans, drained  </P> <P> 1 (10 3/4-ounce) can tomato soup  </P> <P> 5 medium potatoes, cooked  </P> <P> 1/2 cup warm milk  </P> <P> 1 egg, beaten  </P> <P> Shredded Cheddar cheese, optional  </P> <P> Lightly brown meat in skillet. Add onion and cook until tender. Add 3/4  teaspoon salt, dash pepper, beans and soup. Pour mixture into greased 1  1/2-quart casserole.  </P> <P> Mash hot potatoes, adding milk and egg. Season to taste with salt and pepper.  Drop in mounds over meat. Sprinkle cheese over top.  </P> <P> Bake at 350 degrees 25 to 30 minutes. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P> DEAR NEVA: There are several things you can do immediately to make this hearty  meat pie a heart-healthy pie. Use the leanest meat you can buy and, if  necessary, have the market grind it for you after removing all the visible fat.  After browning the meat, drain it thoroughly before proceeding with the recipe.  </P> <P> You didn't specify the kind of milk you use, so I based my nutritional analysis  on low-fat milk for your recipe but used nonfat milk for my revision.  Eliminating the egg yolk further reduces the cholesterol and fat in my version.  </P> <P> If you do sprinkle cheese on this pie, be sure it is a fat-reduced Cheddar. Few  people can tell the difference between regular cheese and a 20%-fat-reduced  cheese.  </P> <P> If you want to further reduce the bottom-line figures, I think this pie could  easily serve six instead of four.  </P> <P>  -- JEANNE  </P> <P> "HEARTY"  </P> <P> HAMBURGER PIE  </P> <P> 1 pound extra-lean ground round  </P> <P> 1 medium onion, chopped  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon sugar  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> Freshly ground black pepper  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon garlic powder  </P> <P> 1/2 pound fresh green beans, sliced into 1-inch pieces, steamed  </P> <P> 1 (6-ounce) can unsalted tomato paste  </P> <P> 1/2 cup unsalted tomato sauce  </P> <P> 1 1/2 pounds (5 medium) potatoes, peeled and cooked  </P> <P> 1/2 cup nonfat milk, warmed  </P> <P> 1 egg white, lightly beaten  </P> <P> 2 ounces shredded fat-reduced Cheddar cheese (1/2 cup), optional  </P> <P> Lightly brown meat in skillet and drain thoroughly.

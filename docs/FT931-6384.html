			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Hunt optimistic on future of valleys WALES would lead the UK out of the recession, Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, told the Commons last night when announcing a five-year programme for the regeneration of the valley communities, Ivor Owen writes. Insisting that the portents were good for the whole of Wales to 'go for growth', he also looked to the new local government structure based on a single tier of 21 unitary authorities, to secure a more co-ordinated approach to economic issues through the Welsh Economic Council. Mr Hunt emphasised that Wales had established itself internationally as the 'first option for new proejcts and expansion'. Assurances by Mr Hunt that the reform of local government was unlikely to lead to massive redundancies failed to satisfy Mr Ron Davies, the shadow Welsh secretary, who said the high level of unemployment was 'blighting the economy of Wales'. Mr Hunt emphasised the success of the first five-year programme for the valleys, due to end on March 31, in bringing to bear the full range of government policies on the problems and challenges of a single area.</p>

			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / South African economy puts on 5.1% growth SOUTH Africa's economy grew by 5.1 per cent in the second quarter, according to GDP figures published by the central statistical service yesterday, suggesting that the country's four-year recession has ended. The improvement compares with growth of 1.4 per cent in the first quarter. The news coincides with publication of fiscal data which suggest government finances are in reasonable shape. This follows speculation that the government would overshoot its deficit target. Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, said the continued growth in GDP vindicated his view that the cyclical turning point to the downturn  - which started in March 1989  - had been reached at the beginning of the year. Most of the growth is attributable to the agricultural sector, which is recovering from a devastating drought. Real agricultural production increased by 231.5 per cent in the second quarter following first-quarter growth of 53.9 per cent. Mr Keys said other pleasing aspects of the figures were that secondary industries continued to grow; growth in GDP owed nothing to higher government spending; and mining production continued to rise at a rate of 2.5 per cent.</p>

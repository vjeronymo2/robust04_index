			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tories defend pay bodies TWO FORMER Tory employment ministers last night came out against the abolition of wages councils, as MPs opposed a Labour proposal requiring the government to make an annual report to parliament on the conditions of low-paid workers. Mr Peter Bottomley challenged the government to explain why it had not 'make plain' before the last election that a move to abolish the bodies, which set minimum pay rates for 2.5m low-paid workers, was in the offing. 'The question is at what level is it worth taking away protection from the vulnerable,' he asked. Mr Jim Lester, another former junior minister, said: 'The whole responsibility of parliament . . is to look after those least able to defend themselves.' But a new clause proposed by Labour forcing ministers to report annually to parliament was defeated by 290 votes to 262 as the Trade Union Reform &amp; Employment Rights Bill reached its Commons report stage. MPs earlier backed a new government clause phasing out public subsidy for union ballots - a move similarly opposed by Mr Bottomley. Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister, described continued subsidy as 'inappropriate.' Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, warned that 'third world' pay levels and working practices were being introduced into Britain. He sought to dismiss the contention that Wages Councils cost jobs, arguing that the number of people working in the sectors they covered had actually risen, while those employed in other industries had fallen substantially. Labour did not believe wages councils should be abolished as the bill proposed, but if they were, Labour's suggestions would help to protect those affected.</p>

According to the circular, surplus military land  must be developed in a planned way and under organized  leadership. The army units which transfer their surplus  military land must, as required by the relevant state  regulations, register with the local land administration  department at the county level and above for the change in the  land-use right, so that they will be exempted from paying  charges for transferring land. The proceeds from transferring  and leasing surplus military land are collected by the General  Logistics Department and then put into a special account and  only used as designated. The "Circular" also provides that the  state will not require the land users to donate to the budget  adjustment fund and the fund for key construction projects  including energy and transportation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Admiral Carmo Duro is in trouble following an  interview given to the press. The Oeiras [outside Lisbon] NATO  commander spoke about the possibility of that command being  closed down. Some people assumed that this information was a  fact, and this was a good enough reason for NATO and the  Ministry of Defense to want to know what was really going on.  More details from Cid Saldanha:    [Saldanha] It all started with an interview Admiral Carmo  Duro gave about a NATO exercise. In response to a question by  Renascenca, the Oeiras NATO commander spoke about a hypothetical  closure of this Atlantic command, a possibility that may never  come through. It all depends on NATO's will and the opinion of  its member countries:    [Begin Commander Carmo Duro recording] If NATO is to be  paying increasingly less attention to the MSCs [military sealift  command], let us admit that some ideas generated on the other  side of the Atlantic lead to, or might lead to, NATO saying that  it does not want any more MSC's in the Atlantic. At that stage,  I believe there would be a greater pressure for this command to  be rotating. The issue will be more of a national concern rather  than a NATO concern, at that point. [passage omitted]    As I have stated, this is a possibility that may be raised;  and, although I do not have access to documents, it is in some  people's minds. It is possible it will be brought up at the  [word indistinct] Maritime Seminar scheduled to take place at  the end of June; it may or may not. It all depends on the  sensibility Admiral Miller finds in other commands -- the  SACEUR. [end recording]    [Saldanha] The SACEUR -- the NATO Command in Brussels --  recorded the interview and sent it to NATO in Oeiras. [passage  omitted]    Admiral Carmo Duro's words did not go down well, either in  Brussels or at the Ministry of Defense in Portugal. [passage  omitted]</p>

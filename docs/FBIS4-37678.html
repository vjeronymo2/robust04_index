			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Isam 'Abd-al-Jawad] </F>   [Text] Divisions that almost led to an armed clash broke  out within the extremist groups' ranks in al-Minya last week.  The reason was the declaration by over 40 extremists to the  security authorities that they have repented and renounced  extremist thought. Thus the number of repenters in al-Minya has  exceeded 70, most of whom represent the basic figures of the  extremist groups in al-Minya's cities, especially in (al-'Adwah)  District, where the majority of extremist leaders declared their  repentance. This is regarded as the first rift of its kind  among the extremists in al-Minya.    Reactions by leaders of the extremist groups over the last  week have varied. A number of extremists announced in their  mosques in al-Minya Governorate their intention to take revenge  against the repenters, whom they described as "hypocrites and  cowards," and demanded that they be banned from entering the  mosques they control. The extremist leaders urged a firm stand  against the repenters. Other extremists asked for there to be no  battle with the repenters or clashes with them because this  would lead to further intervention by the security agencies.    For their part, the repenters asked the governorate's  officials and security agencies to back them and to protect them  against the terrorists' threats.    An informed source stated that the repenters continue to  flock to the security authorities as a result of the firm,  decisive stand on extremism and terrorism and because of the  people's awareness in al-Minya Governorate, which differs from  other governorates in Upper Egypt. He said last week saw the  arrest of 30 extremists and outlaws in the largest ever campaign  of arrests in al-Minya Governorate, designed to avert more  incidents.    ROSE AL-YUSUF has learned that the Asyut security agencies'  Operation "Spencer" against the northern area--which includes  the cities of al-Badari, Sidfa, and Abu Tij--managed to  exterminate the terrorist elements in that area in cooperation  with the Suhaj security agencies. In the last few days the  authorities have been able to arrest 80 extremists and to foil a  plot to carry out terrorist attacks in the area.</p>

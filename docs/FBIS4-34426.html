			<p>BFN     [Text] In a news conference held last night, Manuel Camacho  Solis read a letter addressed to President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari submitting his resignation as Peace Commissioner in  Chiapas and announcing his decision to withdraw from political  activities to devote himself to his family.    [Begin Camacho Solis recording] In addition, I am hereby  announcing that I will not participate in any political  activities during the present administration. [end recording]    He said he will surely be criticized for quitting because he  did not attain the expected results.    [Begin Camacho Solis recording] But we have attained all  results possible at present. I quit the commission committed,  more than ever, to peace and democracy. [end recording]    Regarding the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party]  candidate's recent remarks, Camacho said this.    [Begin Camacho recording] His remarks on the Chiapas  conflict  have weakened the political negotiations and the role that I, as  commissioner, could have continued to play to take new steps  toward peace. For him, the problem focuses on the fact that a  petition was answered but not accepted and that, therefore, the  negotiation process failed. In the current situation in  Chiapas, the PRI candidate's position and its effects have  resulted in a kind of censure on my work, all of which makes  peace even more difficult to achieve. [end recording]    Camacho Solis pointed out that it is necessary to view the  problem, not only in terms of social policy, but in terms of  political concepts as well, to create conditions for a  respectable and lasting peace that can be accepted by the  Zapatist National Liberation Front, thus sparing Chiapas and  Mexico the social price of a protracted war. Camacho Solis  announced his resignation in a Mexico City hotel.</p>

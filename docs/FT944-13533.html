			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Arts: Today's Television As part of BBC2's 'Bard On The Box' season, Michael Bogdanov organises Shakespeare On The Estate, an exercise which sounds perilously like slumming by Islington trendies, but we shall see. It seems that on the Ladywood estate in Birmingham Bogdanov visits pubs, youth groups and young mothers' centres, and ends up using a tower-block balcony for the famous Romeo and Juliet scene (9.00). It would be hard to dream up a madder way of looking after our health than requiring completely inexperienced doctors in their mid-20s to work more than 100 hours a week, providing emergency cover throughout a general hospital, including the casualty department, in shifts lasting 24 or even 48 hours. Yet that is what happens. Inside Story watches two junior doctors at the Middlesex/UCH complex in London (10.00 BBC1). We know that a vestry is a place where a clergyman may keep or even change his clothes, but is it really the place for a bishop to investigate the inside of his secretary's blouse?

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / International Company News: Hilton Hotels posts solid increase Hilton Hotels, the US-based hotel and casino group, bounced back from last year's profit decline and a weak first quarter by reporting a 26 per cent increase in net income to Dollars 33.9m for the second quarter. The improvement was driven mainly by economic growth in the US, which lifted hotel occupancy levels and helped the company improve average daily room rates. Group revenue rose by 10 per cent to Dollars 381.2m. Operating profits on the hotel side shot up 47 per cent to Dollars 43.7m, while operating profits on the gaming side fell 2 per cent to Dollars 36.7m. Earnings per share rose 25 per cent to 70 cents. For the first six months, net income was 13 per cent ahead at Dollars 56.6m, excluding the effect of accounting changes. Earnings per share were 13 per cent ahead at Dollars 1.17 on the same basis. Hilton said it was the second successive quarter in which its hotel operations had shown double-digit gains. They had been boosted by good results from the hotels in New York, Chicago, Washington DC, New Orleans and Hawaii, and by a substantial increase in the contribution from luxury Conrad hotels, particularly in Hong Kong. The gaming side suffered from the loss of 500 rooms at the Flamingo Hilton Las Vegas because of a construction project. However, Mr Barron Hilton, chairman and chief executive, said Hilton was maintaining its leadership in the gaming business in an increasingly competitive environment, both in Nevada and elsewhere. Hilton's Conrad Hotels subsidiary is to develop a 500-room five-star hotel in Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City, helping to ease a shortage of first-class rooms in the former Saigon, AP reports from Hanoi. The hotel will be part of the planned Saigon South urban development, which includes a world trade centre complex, a financial district and a civic centre. Construction should start next year, and the hotel should open in 1997.</p>

			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / International Company News: Mannesmann warns of nine-month profit fall MANNESMANN, the German engineering company, yesterday warned that profits in the first nine months of the year were 'considerably lower' than in the same period last year, despite the fact that sales, including acquisitions, rose by 18 per cent to DM19.18bn (Dollars 11.9bn). Without giving any concrete profit figure, Mannesmann blamed the profits fall on a number of factors, including the state of the economy, restructuring costs, lower income from financial dealings, the decline in earnings from trading, and the costs of building up its mobile telephone operations. The company said profits in the trading division were severely hit by the downturn in steel and pipes markets, but the result in this area was still positive. The downturn in the market for capital goods had hit demand for plant and machinery, but the result was still 'clearly positive' and, in the circumstances, satisfactory. The group's Brazilian operations were likely to break even this year after two years of losses. Operating profits in the group's automobile technology business improved, but restructuring costs meant that this area made a net loss - but less than in the same period last year. Stripping out the effect of acquisitions, sales would have risen by just 1 per cent, the company said. At the interim stage, Mannesmann surprised the market by reporting first-half net profits down 89 per cent to DM15m from DM134m.</p>

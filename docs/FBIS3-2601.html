			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 23 Feb (XINHUA) -- Speaking at a national  statistics work conference today, Zou Jiahua, vice premier of  the State Council, stated emphatically: Statistical information  is a yardstick for monitoring the way the national economy and  society function. In carrying out statistical work, we should  stress accuracy, timeliness, comprehensiveness, and convenience,  attaching primary importance to accuracy. We should establish a  statistical survey methodology based on periodic general surveys  which are essential; which are focused on regular sampling  checks; and which are supplemented by surveys in selected areas,  scientific calculations, and the general application of a small  number of wide-ranging statistical reports.    What new demands has the socialist market economy set for  statistical work? Vice Premier Zou said: The state's economic  management mode should shift from the management of tangible  aspects of the economy, the management of microeconomic  activity, and direct management to the management of intangible  aspects of the economy, macroeconomic activity, and indirect  management. In making macroeconomic policy decisions and  exercising macroeconomic regulations and control, the party  Central Committee and the State Council have often been  confronted with the following three questions: 1) What is the  current state of operations of the national economy and society?  2) Does the national economy and society function normally? If  not, how should they be regulated and controlled? 3) What are  the results of the implementation of macroeconomic regulatory  and control measures? These three questions are closely related  to statistical work and cannot be separated from the latter even  for a moment. It would be difficult to make policy decisions on  the national economy in the absence of ample information,  scientific advice, and effective supervision by a statistical  system.    Zou Jiahua added: To establish a socialist market economic  structure, we should nurture and develop an information market.  The commercialization and industrialization of information is  one of the priority tasks in establishing a market system.  Because statistical information reflects the general state of  national economic and social development and is the main part of  economic, social, scientific, and technological information,  actively nurturing and vigorously developing a statistical  information market are tasks that brook no delay. Statistical  departments should fully play their role as the main departments  in charge of socioeconomic information, should make great  efforts to plan and manage national socioeconomic information  and consultation services, and should vigorously promote the  effective distribution of socioeconomic information so all of  society can share it.    Zou Jiahua noted: We must further carry out reform and  opening up in statistical work in accordance with the need to  establish a socialist market economic system. We should shatter  traditional concepts regarding statistics, and in accordance  with the general law of the market economy, should boldly draw  on advanced international statistic-related science and  technology to institute a statistical system suited to China's  conditions. We should exercise stronger centralized and unified  leadership, and should scientifically and effectively organize  national statistical work and national economic accounting work.  We should radically reform our statistical surveying methods  and develop surveying methods which are not all-encompassing,  placing special emphasis on widely promoting sampling surveys.    Zou Jiahua said emphatically: The statistical survey plans  developed or approved by the State Statistical Bureau in  accordance with the law are binding as national laws and  regulations. All legal entities and citizens must fill in their  forms truthfully; this is a bounden duty for every legal entity  and citizen. The current practice of filing false statistical  reports by the leaders of some localities, departments, and  units--who are driven by personal honor and advancement, or by  certain types of political honor and material benefits for small  groups--is quite serious. Some of them even go so far as to  retaliate against statisticians who dare maintain their  principles. We should sternly investigate and deal with such  negative and corrupt practices.</p>

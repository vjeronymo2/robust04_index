			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Private View: A young trooper in the battle for Europe - Robert Buckland, 25, is a Conservative candidate in the European elections. He explains why he is running Robert Buckland, novice barrister, settled his tubby, pinstripe-suited frame behind the pupil-master's desk and explained why he wants the 400,000 voters of his region to make him a Euro-MP on Thursday. He is talkative, tidy and 25 years old. Is politics your career? I asked him. He looked momentarily uneasy. 'I don't like that word,' he said in his sing-song Welsh accent. 'I think it's a vocation. I think it's a duty, an old-fashioned thing. And indeed some people might think it was rather disingenuous of me to start talking about service and duty. But I think it is a calling, and a noble calling.' Voters may think it has more to do with self-service these days than public service. 'I know, I know,' sighed the candidate sadly. 'I think that's a problem of communication.' Communicating is not Robert Buckland's weak suit: although not on the Conservative Party's official list of candidates he managed to persuade the selectors to run him, the local boy, in South Wales West, a Labour-dominated constituency they have little hope of winning. This putative moulder of post-millennial Europe was a mere 10 years old when Labour's strikebound winter helped Margaret Thatcher to her first election victory in 1979. He says he remembers it well. You were a bit precocious, then? 'I don't know about precocious. But I had a healthy interest in church architecture from an early age. And my parents used to laugh about that. We were always a very bookish family. My father (he is a solicitor) is a very well-read man.' His mother runs a municipal luncheon club for pensioners. He was, he said, a 'strange teenager' who spent his time at a local private school 'reading and listening to music and thinking and writing and doing all sorts of things that perhaps a normal child wouldn't have the time to do. So to that extent it was rather an isolated upbringing. And this sense of the misfit perhaps came in now and again. Perhaps I played up to it.' His first political act, at 16, was to join the Llanelli Young Conservatives. After school he worked as a political agent before going to Durham University to read law and become president of the Union Society. He sits on Dyfed county council. His heroes are Peel, Disraeli and Lord Salisbury. He calls himself a non-ideological, post-Thatcherite Tory for whom conservatism, today, wrongly identified with large vested interests, is really about 'what used to be called the little man'. He suggested his party's leaders have missed their way, garbled their message and lost touch with the ordinary person. No doubt they felt like you when they started, I said. 'I know. It's a real worry of mine,' he replied, quickly injecting a note of humility. 'I don't want to forget that. I thought it would be much better to come back to where I'm from and work amongst people I know, to stay local.' Shouldn't you learn a bit more before aiming for Europe? 'Yes, I've got a lot to learn. I don't pretend I haven't. But if you don't have people like myself from local areas who are genuinely interested in foreign European policy and who have learned a bit about it beforehand, and who, importantly, are from a younger generation, then where are we going to be? 'Are we to continue to elect anonymous figures to Europe, or are we going to start electing people who can relate those grandiloquent issues back to grass roots? 'Although I'm young, I think youth is an asset. Why can't we have more of a cross-section of representatives? Why is it that on my own county council I am the youngest person by 15 years? The average age there is 70. They're all old men] You've asked the question why. But why not? Pitt was prime minister at 23.' Are you attracted by the big expenses and salary? 'Well, I've heard a lot about the gravy train. Quite frankly, it doesn't attract me. It concerns me if there is abuse. I would be scrupulous, first of all in not indulging in it and secondly in trying to stop it. 'I'm doing very well, thank you very much, as a barrister. I'm working very hard here. I'm managing to pay off my student debts. As far as I am concerned it's not a meal ticket, it's something which genuinely interests me. Call me an optimist, call me naive, call me young, whatever, I don't care. That's how I feel now, and I don't want to forget that.' While Buckland practises criminal law from Swansea, his girlfriend is in London learning to be a manager with Abbey National building society. I said: in politics you'll need a wife, of course. He laughed, a little ruefully. 'Oh, I know that's what they say. I don't like to see myself as this cut-and-dried young man who's, you know, going to make it and has sort of set his sights and carefully tailored everything to that end. I haven't' Why do they see you like that? 'Because I'm young, because I'm a barrister, because I'm a Tory, because I like going round and speaking to old ladies or whatever they seem to think 'Oh, yes, he's going to make it, he's going to be there, he's guaranteed, a dead cert.' All I am is an enthusiast. I'm over-enthusiastic.' You mean just because you're a cardboard cut-out young Tory doesn't mean you don't care? 'Yeh. alright,' he said, swallowing the designation reluctantly. 'I do care. I'm a human being just like anybody else and I have interests and passions and concerns. I just want to get involved. There's no point sitting on the sidelines. What makes you passionate? 'What makes me passionate is . . . this sense of disillusion, particularly now in the 1990s, this sense of cynicism, this disillusion that the general public have with our elected politicians, this sense of drift . . . ' That's not a passion, I objected. I mean what brings a lump to your throat, a knot to your stomach? He pondered. 'I think, really, it's some of the traditional issues: the Union, for example, does get me going. I genuinely get very passionate in debates about the Union.' Buckland explained that although he was proud of being Welsh - he sings baritone in the choir - he loathed Welsh nationalism. 'There's no contradiction between being Welsh, being British and being a European. I think it was John Buchan who said you can't have too many loyalties. And I agree with him. I rejoice in that illogicality.' But do you have no over-riding humanitarian aim? 'I think it has to be the preservation of community spirit and the preservation of the notion of awareness and responsibility to each other.' Buckland is from an evangelical Anglican background, likes the Book of Common Prayer but has no quarrel with women priests. 'It would be nice to see Conservatives talking about Christian or religious values as being a good thing.' I thought they did that all the time, I said, but just practised the opposite. 'Well, that's individuals,' he said quickly. 'No, what I am saying is there are lots of values we have lost and we should go back and rediscover in organised religion - as long as government does not preach where it cannot legislate.' Are people going to call you a young fogey? 'Now, yes, sort of A N Wilson men in tweeds? Funny, I thought you'd ask me that. A young fogey is not only someone who dresses like that but who thinks like a young fogey, who has a love of the old dispensation and a contempt for change. That's dangerous. I'm not a reactionary.' What will you do if you don't win this seat? 'Carry on working.' Your next political step, I mean. 'I would like to be on the list and see where it goes from there.' Would you like to be a minister one day? 'What I want to do is mark each target as it comes, become an effective MP, as opposed to the ones I see round here who depress me. I can't help thinking if only I was there perhaps I could do it differently. Being a minister? Hmm. Yes, I suppose so. I haven't calculated anything. 'But I'm very conscious of what I don't want to be. I'm very conscious of what I dislike about politics and politicians. At the same time I think I have the frankness to admit that I'm still learning about what it takes to be a good and right politician and an honest politician. Perhaps that honesty itself shows I could have the capacity to make it. 'And I will make it.'</p>

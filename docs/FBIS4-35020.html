			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 27 Jun (EFE) -- Venezuela will not accept  impositions from the United States regarding Haitian refugees,  Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas stated in remarks  reported today. The foreign minister stressed that reports that  the U.S. Government is forcing Venezuela to accept Haitian  refugees are false.    "Venezuela is a sovereign country and does not accept  impositions from anybody," Burelli Rivas noted, although he  admitted his government may accept some Haitians for a brief  period. He added that the Rafael Caldera government shares the  concern regarding Haiti but added Venezuela has a foreign  immigrants problem, and for that reason cannot accept any more.    Burelli Rivas added, however, that since Haiti is involved  and that Venezuela is committed to searching for solutions so  that democracy can return to that country, some Haitians may be  allowed in for a brief period. "That was the response I gave to  the U.S. Department of State," he indicated.    The top official said no Haitians have come to the  Venezuelan  Embassy in Port-au-Prince and added that the United States has  two ships off the Jamaican coast to pick up Haitians and that  only six out of 35 who requested asylum were accepted.</p>

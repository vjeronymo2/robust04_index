			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Palmerston in loss after exceptionals Pre-tax losses at Palmerston Holdings, the property investor, increased from Pounds 2.68m to Pounds 5.46m in the year to March 31. The company blamed exceptional charges of Pounds 6.17m, relating to associate companies. The charges included Pounds 4.22m relating to the company's share of the revaluation reserve deficits from associates. The final dividend is passed leaving the total at 0.5p (1.75p). The company is to concentrate on expanding its residential portfolio and the retention of commercial property which provides secure long-term rental. As part of this strategy the investments in associates will be realised. The continuing downturn in the commercial market resulted in net asset value falling over the year from 229p to 121p. Before exceptionals there was a profit of Pounds 709,000 (Pounds 2.68m loss) helped by higher rents and charges of Pounds 9.57m (Pounds 8.7m) and a surplus on property disposals of Pounds 5.62m (Pounds 3.67m). Losses per share were 19.4p (12.4p).</p>

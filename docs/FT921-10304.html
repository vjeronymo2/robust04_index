			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Wesfarmers expects improved results WESFARMERS, the Australian agricultural services and coal group, yesterday said it expects full-year profits for the year to June 30 to be better than last year's, after reporting a 43.7 per cent rise in net profits for the first half to December, Reuter reports from Perth. The company said the half-year net profits of ADollars 19.2m (USDollars 14.7m), or 10.5 cents per share, up from ADollars 13.4m, or 7.3 cents, was achieved on improved performances in its chemicals and fertilisers, dairy, gas, transport and retail operations. These were offset by declines in rural trading, insurance and coal mining activities. 'While there has been some recovery in coal production during the second quarter, the performance of the coal division remains below budget for the first half, largely due to slower than anticipated productivity improvements in the underground operations,' Wesfarmers said. 'On the positive side, the 50 per cent owned explosives company Dyno Wesfarmers achieved an encouraging turnaround in profitability compared to the first half last year,' it said. Fertiliser sales to December were ahead of last year and ahead of budget and the company expected to sell about 100,000 tonnes more than last year's sales of 764,000 tonnes. 'But directors pointed out that as the majority of fertiliser sales take place in the final quarter of the year, it remains difficult to predict with confidence the end of year result.' First-half pre-tax profits advanced to ADollars 30.96m from ADollars 21.26m on lower sales of ADollars 566.77m compared with ADollars 584.97m. Wesfarmers is offering ADollars 3.55 cash per share for Bunnings, the Australian timber group, valuing it at ADollars 163m. The offer expires on February 17. Bunnings has recommended shareholders reject the offer.</p>

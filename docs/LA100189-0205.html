			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SABERHAGEN MAKES HIS BEST PITCH FOR CY YOUNG WITH 23RD VICTORY  </P> <P> Bret Saberhagen set a club record Saturday with his 23rd victory and clinched  the American League earned-run average title as the Kansas City Royals beat the  Athletics, 6-1, at Oakland.  </P> <P> Saberhagen, who won 14 of his last 15 starts, may have also locked up the  American League's Cy Young Award while his victory was helping the Royals  clinch second place in the West. His 23rd victory, against six losses, broke  the club record set in 1974 by Steve Busby, who went 22-14.  </P> <P> Saberhagen, who allowed only three earned runs in his last 58 innings (0.47  ERA), ended the season with a 2.16 ERA, best in the majors. The Cy Young winner  in 1985, when he finished 20-6, Saberhagen allowed four hits in eight innings  against the A's and struck out a career-high 13. He walked only two.  </P> <P> Saberhagen's streak of 31 scoreless innings ended when the A's scored in the  fifth, only the third run in 31 innings this season by Oakland against  Saberhagen.  </P> <P> "He threw good, one of the best in the league," said Oakland's Dave Parker, who  struck out three times. "But he's going to rest all winter now."  </P> <P> Seattle 2, Minnesota 1 -- Edgar Martinez singled home Jay Buhner with two out  in the 10th inning at Seattle to give the Mariners the win.  </P> <P> Buhner drew a one-out walk off Jeff Reardon and went to third on two-out single  by Dave Cochrane. Martinez followed with a ground single to right.  </P> <P> Jerry Reed (7-7) pitched the 10th for the win after Bill Swift allowed only  four hits over the first nine innings.  </P> <P> Minnesota rookie Kevin Tapani had a three-hit shutout entering the bottom of  the ninth, but Harold Reynolds led off with a single, stole second and went to  third on Greg Briley's groundout.  </P> <P> Minnesota's Kirby Puckett, who entered the game as the American League's  leading hitter at .340, was hitless in four at-bats to lower his average to  .33809. Oakland's Carney Lansford is second at .33759.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 3, Boston 1 -- Converted reliever Mark Knudson allowed six hits, all  singles, in 8 1/3 innings at Boston to beat Roger Clemens.  </P> <P> Two of the Red Sox hits off Knudson (8-5), making his seventh start of the  season, were infield singles. No Boston runner reached second base until the  ninth inning, when Jody Reed and Marty Barrett singled, and Reed then advanced  to third on a fielder's choice.  </P> <P> Reliever Dan Plesac gave up a run-scoring single to Mike Greenwell before  getting the last two outs for his 33rd save.  </P> <P> Clemens (17-11) struck out 10 in his first home loss in seven decisions.  </P> <P> New York 9, Detroit 2 -- The Yankees beat Detroit at New York for the 10th  straight time, and clinched fifth place in the East in the process, as Alvaro  Espinoza drove in three runs and Don Mattingly hit a solo home run.  </P> <P> En route to 13 hits, the Yankees sent 10 batters to the plate in the fifth  inning against Kevin Ritz (4-6), Steve Searcy and Edwin Nunez. They had five  runs on four doubles, two singles and a walk.  </P> <P> Chicago 8, Cleveland 2 -- The White Sox may be in last place in the West, but  the win at Chicago guaranteed they'll finish better than .500 for the second  half of the season after improving to 37-35 since the All-Star break.  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE  </P> <P> With an assist from Manager Don Zimmer, Chicago's Ryne Sandberg tied the major  league record for second basemen with his 89th consecutive errorless game,  equaling the mark set by Manny Trillo of Philadelphia, as the Cubs beat the  Cardinals, 6-4, at St. Louis.  </P> <P> Sandberg has played only one inning in each of the last three games. Zimmer  said his star will do the same today in the regular-season finale as the Cubs  prepare to meet San Francisco in the playoffs.  </P> <P> "I'll say one thing," Zimmer said. "Anybody that says that is a cheap record is  wrong.  </P> <P> "The guy has played in every inning of every game for six years. I think he's  entitled to the fielding record."  </P> <P> Doug Dascenzo's ninth-inning RBI single broke a 4-4 to give the Cubs the win,  after they blew a 4-1 lead in the eighth.  </P> <P> Houston 9, Cincinnati 2 -- Glenn Davis hit a two-run home run, and Jose Cano, a  27-year-old right-hander, scattered seven hits for his first major league  victory in the Astros' win at Cincinnati.  </P> <P> New York 7, Pittsburgh 2 -- The Mets scored five times in the 11th inning,  highlighted by Kevin McReynolds' bases-loaded single, to win at Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> Randy Myers (7-4) got the win despite allowing the Pirates to tie the score,  2-2, in the bottom of the ninth. Bill Landrum (2-3) got the loss.  </P> <P> The Pirates had a streak of 25 innings without scoring an earned run before  Dann Bilardello had a home run in the fourth inning.  </P> <P> San Diego 11, San Francisco 5 -- Tony Gwynn went three for four to reach 200  hits in a season for the fourth time in his career and narrow the National  League batting race in the Padres' victory at San Diego.  </P> <P> Gwynn, who entered the game with 197 hits, raised his average from .331 to  .333. He is pursuing San Francisco's Will Clark, who singled in four at-bats to  remain at .334.  </P> <P> With a double, Gwynn drove in the first of four runs in a fifth-inning rally,  which broke a 4-4 tie against Rick Reuschel (17-8). Reuschel allowed eight  runs, including Sandy Alomar Jr.'s first career homer, in tuning up for his  start Thursday in the National League playoffs.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 6, Montreal 3 -- Bruce Ruffin allowed three runs in seven innings  and Dickie Thon's two-run triple sparked a three-run fourth inning at  Philadelphia as the Phillies sent the Expos to their fourth consecutive loss  and ninth in 12 outings.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 16 Jun (XINHUA) -- The State Council  Information Office today issued a white paper entitled  "Intellectual Property Rights [IPR] Protection in China." The  white paper offers a detailed explanation of China's basic  position on the protection of IPR, a systematic account of  legislation and law enforcement with regard to IPR, and the  positive efforts it has made in undertaking international  obligations in regard to protecting IPR. The white paper is  divided into three parts and contains about 12,000 characters.    The white paper points out in its foreword: As a whole,  China, for a variety of historical reasons, began work on its  IPR protection system at a comparatively late date. After China  started reform and opening up to the outside world, it  accelerated the process of establishing an IPR protection system  to rapidly develop social productive forces, promote overall  social progress, meet the needs of developing a socialist market  economy, and expedite China's entry into the world economy.  Since the end of the seventies, China has done a tremendous  amount of effective work in this field, covering in a little  more than a dozen years a distance that took other developed  countries scores of years, even 100 years, establishing a  relatively comprehensive legal system for IPR protection,  thereby attracting worldwide attention for its achievements not  only in establishing the system but also in enforcement.    The white paper's first part elaborates on China's basic  position regarding IPR protection. It points out: It is the  Chinese Government's view that the intellectual property  protection system plays a significant role in promoting progress  in science and technology, enriching culture, and developing the  economy. It functions both as an important institution ensuring  the normal running of the socialist market economy and as one of  the basic environments and conditions for conducting  international exchange and cooperation in science and  technology, economics, and culture. China considers the  protection of intellectual property an important part of its  policy of reform and opening up to the outside world and of the  building of its socialist legal system. Beginning in the late  seventies, China has been formulating laws and regulations for  IPR protection, and has been actively participating in  activities organized by relevant international organizations  aimed at strengthening international exchange and cooperation in  the IPR field. From its inception, China's IPR protection  system was directed toward the world and geared to high  international standards. Spurred on by its reform and opening  up, China has carried on its intellectual property protection  legislation at a speed never before known.    After starting reform and opening up to the outside world,  China has enacted several laws for the protection of IPR,  including "the PRC Trademark Law," "the PRC Patent Law," "the  PRC Copyright Law," and "the PRC Law on Combating Unfair  Competition." It has also actively participated in activities  sponsored by the World Intellectual Property Organization [WIPO]  and other relevant international organizations. It has become a  WIPO member, the "Paris Convention for the Protection of  Industrial Property Rights," the "Madrid Agreement for the  International Registration of Trademarks," the "Berne Convention  for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works," the  "Universal Copyright Convention," the "Convention for the  Protection of Producers of Phonograms Against Unauthorized  Duplication of Their Phonograms," and the "Patent Cooperation  Treaty." China was among the first signatory states of the  "Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated  Circuits." China has consciously sought to fulfill its  international obligation in IPR protection, endeavoring to bring  its intellectual property protection level near the new  international standards, and has taken many major measures to  further raise its current level of IPR protection. Dr. Arpad  Bogsch, WIPO director general, pointed out that "China has  accomplished all this at a speed unmatched in the history of  intellectual property protection."    The white paper points out: While improving its legal  system, earnestly enforcing the laws, and striking relentless  blows at infringements and other unlawful practices, China has  spared no effort in publicizing and providing education about  the intellectual property protection legal system and in  accelerating the training of professional personnel in this  field. The fact that there has been an increasing number of  cases involving IPR in recent years and that these cases have  been remedied through recourse to law reflects the people's  heightened awareness and the wide spread of IPR knowledge  throughout society.    The white paper's second part elaborates on China's legal  system for intellectual property protection. In accordance with  its national conditions and current tendencies in international  development, China has formulated and fine-tuned various laws  and regulations on intellectual property protection, thereby  constructing a socialist legal system for intellectual property  protection with Chinese characteristics. The scope of the IPR  protected in China and the degree of protection afforded have  gradually conformed with international practices and a high  degree of legal protection for IPR has been realized.    Effective March 1983, the "PRC Trademark Law" and the rules  for its implementation set forth the principles of application,  examination, and registration in trademark registration  procedures that are entirely identical with common international  principles. In 1993, China revised both its Trademark Law and  the rules for its implementation to expand the range of  trademarks protected. Regulations on commodity trademarks were  joined by those on the registration and management of service  trademarks; in examination as to form, a revision procedure was  added; and in examination as to substance, a written comment  system was established to provide convenience for registered  trademark applicants. All these regulations coincide completely  with the requirements of GATT's Agreement on Trade-Related  Aspects of Intellectual Property. In addition, the State  Administration for Industry and Commerce has issued a series of  regulations including the Regulations on the "Administration of  the Printing of Trademarks" and the "Procedures for Filing  License Contracts for the Use of Trademarks." In February 1993,  the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee adopted  the "Supplementary Regulations on Punishing Criminal  Counterfeiting of Registered Trademarks" to further intensify  punishment for such counterfeiting and other infringements.  These laws and regulations fully and effectively guarantee the  right to the exclusive use of Chinese and foreign registered  trademarks.    "The PRC Patent Law" and the rules for its implementation  came into effect in April 1985, expanding the scope of  intellectual property protection in China to include inventions  and other new creations. To bring the level of China's patent  protection closer to international standards, the NPC Standing  Committee adopted an amendment to the Patent Law on 4 September  1992, which included important revisions. The revised Patent  Law expands the scope of patent protection: patents may be  granted to all types of technological inventions, whether new  products or new techniques, including pharmaceutical products  and substances obtained by means of a chemical process, foods,  beverages and flavorings; an invention patent's duration has  been extended from 15 years from the date of application to 20  years; the duration of utility model patents and of exterior  design patents has been extended from five years from the date  of application to 10 years; and the protection of patent rights  has been further strengthened. In addition to extending the  protection of a patented process to include products directly  produced by that process, the law clearly stipulates that the  importation of patented products requires the patent holder's  permission; and conditions for imposing compulsory patent  license were restipulated. These measures mark the reaching of  a new level of patent protection in China. In this way, the PRC  Patent Law has essentially been brought in line with the GATT  "Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of IPR."    "The PRC Copyright Law" and the rules for its  implementation explicitly protect the copyright and other  legitimate rights and interests of the authors of literary,  artistic, and scientific works. The law also provides  protection for computer software. China is among a select group  of countries that have explicitly listed computer software as  the object of protection by copyright laws. Moreover, the State  Council has promulgated the "Regulations on the Protection of  Computer Software," providing the specifics whereby the laws  protecting computer software will be implemented. These  regulations, a necessary adjunct to the Copyright Law, came into  effect in October 1991. On 25 September 1992, the State Council  promulgated the "Regulations on the Implementation of the  International Copyright Treaty," providing specific regulations  on protecting foreign authors' copyrights in accordance with the  international treaty.    These laws and regulations have been joined by the "PRC  Technological Contract Law" and the "PRC Law on Scientific and  Technological Progress" as formulated by the NPC Standing  Committee as well as a series of administrative regulations  concerning intellectual property protection worked out by the  State Council, together further optimizing the nation's legal  system for the protection of IPR, in the whole bringing the  system close to and in coordination with international levels of  protection.    The white paper also points out that China's intellectual  property law stipulates the legal responsibilities to be borne  by anyone who violates the law, including civil liability,  criminal liability, and exposure to administrative sanctions.    The white paper notes: With the implementation of  intellectual property laws, IPR are effectively protected in  China. These laws also actively encourage invention and other  forms of creation and fair competition. For instance, the  protection of the right to the exclusive use of registered  trademarks has resulted in the rapid growth of the number of  trademarks registered by Chinese and foreign businessmen in  China. By the end of 1993, there were over 410,000 effective  registered trademarks. Of these, 350,000 were domestic, with  the remaining 60,000 coming from 67 countries and regions. In  1993, there were 170,000 applications for trademark registration  annually in China, including more than 130,000 applications for  new trademarks registration, among the highest number in the  world. In addition, the PRC Patent Law has greatly encouraged  inventions and other creations in China, and has proved a magnet  for attracting patent applications from other countries and  regions. On 1 April 1985, the first day the Patent Law came  into effect, 3,455 applications for patent rights were  submitted. By the end of 1993, the PRC Patent Office had  handled over 360,000 applications for patent rights.    The white paper's third part elaborates on the law  enforcement system for intellectual property protection; that  is, the judicial institutions and administrative channels for  intellectual property protection.    In China, any citizen, legal person, or organization  entitled  to IPR whose rights and interests have been infringed upon may  bring a lawsuit to the people's court in accordance with the law  and receive practical and effective judicial protection. The  people's courts exercise judicial power independently according  to law; are subordinate only to the law itself; and are not  subject to interference by any administrative organ, public  organization, or individual. From 1986 to the end of 1993,  people's courts throughout the country accepted and handled  3,505 cases concerning IPR disputes, 1,168 of which concerned  copyrights, 1,783 patents, and 554 trademark rights. In  accordance with the law, the people's courts defend the  legitimate rights and interests of the foreign and domestic IPR  holders through trying cases concerning IPR disputes.    Intellectual property is an important civil right. In  civil infringement cases, the people's court is empowered to  order the infringer to bear civil responsibility for the  cessation of the infringement, for the elimination of any  negative effects caused by his actions, for offering apologies,  and for compensation for any losses in accordance with the law.  Furthermore, it is empowered to confiscate the infringer's  illegal gains and/or adjudge the infringer to criminal detention  or a fine. If the IPR infringement is so serious that it has  disrupted the economic order and constitutes a crime, the  infringer's criminal responsibility is investigated and dealt  with according to law. Between 1992 and 1993, people's courts  accepted 743 criminal cases for counterfeiting trademarks, of  which 731 have been tried with 566 people being sentenced to  fixed terms of imprisonment, criminal detention, or other  punishments.    The white paper points out: In addition to judicature in  accordance with international practices, China's system for the  protection of IPR comprises the Patent, Trademark, and Copyright  Laws and other administrative channels designated in  intellectual property laws, all proceeding from China's actual  conditions. Since the Copyright Law was put into force, local  administrative organs responsible for copyright affairs  investigated and dealt with more than 150 cases involving  pirated books and video products from June 1991 to the end of  1993. They have confiscated and destroyed the pirated goods and  levied administrative sanctions on the infringers. In 1994, the  Chinese Government organized the departments concerned to launch  an assault, investigating and dealing with the illegal  duplication of laser discs and illegal reproduction of books.  Relevant government departments took steps to strengthen  administration over the establishment of enterprises  manufacturing compact discs and supervision over their  production in accordance with the law.    A large proportion of the cases concerning violations of  foreigners' intellectual property rights were investigated and  dealt with by China's intellectual property protection  administrative offices on their own initiative, acting in  accordance with their prescribed functions and powers. For  instance, since 1988, administrative organs for industry and  commerce at various levels in Guangdong Province have  investigated and dealt with 301 cases concerning the violation  of U.S.-owned trademarks. Out of these 301 cases, one third  were filed by the American trademark owners, with the remaining  cases being the product of market investigations by industry and  commerce administrative organs or consumer complaints.    In its concluding remarks, the white paper points out: More  than a few international observers have concluded that in terms  of intellectual property protection, China has reached  international advanced levels. Nonetheless, China cannot remain  satisfied with the achievements it has already made and much  remains to be done toward optimizing China's intellectual  property system. In its modern form, this system was  established only a short time ago, and as a result, awareness of  IPR remains comparatively weak in society at large. In some  regions and governmental departments, there is insufficient  appreciation of the importance of intellectual property  protection. Some serious acts of infringement have violated not  only the legitimate rights and interests of the intellectual  property right's holder, but also the dignity of the law.  Accordingly, the State Council has drawn up Decisions on Further  Strengthening the Protection of Intellectual Property. The  implementation of all the important measures contained in the  Decisions will mark a great new step forward in the nation's  efforts to ensure IPR protection. China will continue to  actively promote international cooperation in the field of  intellectual property and make positive contributions toward the  development and optimization of the international intellectual  property system.    The Intellectual Property Protection in China White Paper  (Chinese version) will be published in booklet form by Wuzhou  Publishing House and sold through Xinhua Bookstores across the  country.</p>

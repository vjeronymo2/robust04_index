			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET AIDS TOLL, MEDICAL SYSTEM LINKED  </P> <P> A 10-year-old boy, infected with the AIDS virus while being treated for a heart  defect in a Soviet hospital, has died in the southern Russian city of Rostov --  the latest victim of the widespread use here of unsterilized syringes and other  medical equipment.  </P> <P> The case, reported by the government newspaper Izvestia on Thursday, was the  third of its kind, according to Soviet officials, who now acknowledge that the  AIDS virus is being spread through the country's medical system.  </P> <P> Two other children, a 2-year-old girl and a year-old boy, also apparently  contracted the virus through the use of contaminated equipment at a local  children's hospital in Rostov, the paper said, and both are now seriously ill,  suffering from acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS.  </P> <P> The 10-year-old died, Izvestia said, after the loss of his natural immunity to  disease weakened him and made him vulnerable to the heart problems he  previously had been able to resist.  </P> <P> The boy's death brought to five the number of Soviet citizens whose deaths have  been officially attributed to AIDS-related diseases; three foreigners have also  died here from AIDS, health officials have said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 258 Carriers Registered  </P> <P> Soviet health authorities said earlier this month that they had registered 258  Soviet citizens as carriers of the human immunodeficiency virus, an increase of  35% from the month before.  </P> <P> To prevent the further spread of the disease through the country's medical  system will require an immediate reorganization of health care, Alexander  Kondrusev, a deputy health minister, told Izvestia.  </P> <P> "Sterilization at all stages of examination and treatment is the main way to  halt the spread of the disease," Kondrusev said. "But not only should the rules  for medical personnel be made stricter, the whole state of our clinics should  be changed. This is a huge task, but it must be solved immediately at state  level."  </P> <P> Criticizing the country's medical care system for slack standards and haphazard  hygiene, Izvestia and other major Soviet newspapers have suggested that AIDS is  now spreading faster through the nation's hospitals than through sexual  contacts.  </P> <P> Soviet medical personnel, castigated almost daily now for jeopardizing the  health of those entrusted to them, are complaining in return that they often  lack sufficient equipment to sterilize syringes -- there is an extreme shortage  of disposable syringes -- and other instruments after each use, and they cannot  get the equipment.  </P> <P> And officials at the Soviet wholesale firm that buys and distributes medical  equipment told Izvestia that factories, many of them in the defense industry,  are refusing to manufacture the sterilizers and other much-needed equipment.  </P> <P> In Rostov, for example, a factory that manufactures machinery for nuclear power  plants is working at only half of its capacity and could easily make the  sterilizers that are in such short supply, local officials told Izvestia, but  so far it has declined. Other Rostov factories, including defense plants, have  similarly said they are not against retooling to produce the equipment, but  none has moved to do so. Only newly formed cooperative enterprises are trying  to meet the need.  </P> <P> "We are counting kopecks and forgetting our health," Izvestia said.  </P> <P> Even if there were enough autoclaves and other equipment to sterilize syringes  and other medical instruments, the problem would remain, Izvestia said, because  no precautions are being taken at most dental clinics, medical laboratories and  some surgical units.  </P> <P> Although Kondrusev said the route of the virus has not yet been fully traced,  it may have been brought to Rostov when dozens of children from another city,  Elista, were taken to a central hospitals in regional centers, including  Rostov, for treatment of what proved to be AIDS-related diseases late last  year.  </P> <P> More than 10 children were found last month to have contracted the AIDS virus  from the Elista children in a Volgograd clinic.  </P> <P> The children from Elista had themselves been infected, probably from  unsterilized syringes, while receiving medical care, Soviet officials have  said. At least 46 children and 10 adults were infected with the AIDS virus at  the Elista hospital, according to earlier reports.  </P> <P> A team of specialists, flown from Moscow, is now screening more than 300 other  people, most of them children, who were treated at the Rostov children's  hospital and two other local hospitals at that time, Izvestia said.  </P></p>

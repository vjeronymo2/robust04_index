			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Metin Sever and Baran Dural] </F>   [Text] The IBDA-C [The Islamic Great Eastern Raiders  Front], which not only defended the Sivas massacre of 2 July  1993 -- which caused great grief throughout Turkey -- but also  admitted to regretting the fact that it was not present, showed  how sincere it is in its views a short while ago when it bombed  a bar in Fatih, Istanbul, killing one person and wounding 19  others.    The IBDA-C, which aims at carrying out an Islamic revolution  through armed struggle and teaching a lesson to the "pro-Western  secularists," has recently featured prominently on the public  agenda. This time, the issue involved one of the most colorful  figures in Turkish society, Aysegul Nadir. One wonders: What  does she have to do with this organization? Apparently, she  mediated in the sale of a priceless handwritten Koran, which was  stolen from the Amasya Sultan Beyazid Library by IBDA-C  militants, to Ihsan Azzami, who lives in London. With Nadir's  mediation, the IBDA-C reportedly sold the Koran for $8,000 to  antique dealer Cavusoglu, who in turn sold it for $16,000.    The organization managed to earn itself a "significant"  place  on the public agenda recently as a result of its "radical"  statements. The roots of this organization go back to 1975.  Salih Mirzabeyoglu, who is known as "commander" in the  organization, has been leading the IBDA-C movement from the  start. He has had more than 30 books published containing his  views on almost every topic, from poetry to novels, from  economics to Islam. He is different from the usual Islamic  militant type. He tries to look like Che Guevara. His manner  of dress and speech is modern. He quotes [executed leftist  youth leader] Mahir Cayan. In other words, he looks more like a  leftist militant than an Islamic leader. In fact, he even goes  as far as marking the anniversary of Cayan's death in his  magazines. The slogans they use are the Islamic version of the  Dev-Sol [Revolutionary Left] slogans: Instead of "One, two,  three, or more Vietnams," they say "one, two, three, or more  Sivas'"; instead of "Struggle until liberation," they say  "Struggle until victory."    In 1975, Mirzabeyoglu left the Raiders Association, which  was  a pro-National Salvation Party organization, and established the  Raider-Birth movement. With his supporters, who organized  around the magazine KARAR [Decision], Mirzabeyoglu opened war on  the entire spectrum of the Islamic movement. He says that he  was supported by Necip Fazil Kisakurek at every opportunity.  The organization assumed leading roles in the Islamic religious  headgear and St. Sophie incidents. It made itself heard by  raiding the Press Museum and a class at the Istanbul Technical  University, where a professor was manhandled.    The IBDA-C considers the Prosperity Party part of the  establishment today. It is supported by radical Islamic  movements. In its ranks you can find "hard" [last word in  English] Marxists of the pre-12 September era, as well as former  "idealist" militants.    The most important characteristic of the IBDA-C -- which is  really one of a kind -- is its opposition to the state in all  things. Like Dev-Sol and the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan],  IBDA-C calls Turkey "TC" [Turkish Republic]. It supports PKK  activities only to irritate the state. In fact, when the state  operations in the southeast intensified and the PKK began to  withdraw, TARAF [THE SIDE], the IBDA-C organ, carried this  slogan on its cover: "Bosnia-Sirnak."    It is possible to understand the basic trait of the  organization that calls Tansu Ciller "devil" and antiterror  teams "verger teams" from the following slogans: "Power lies at  the end of the gun; Point the gun at the invaders; Liberate the  street, and the city will be liberated; liberate the city and  the country will be liberated; Blockade!; Trample!; Free  yourself!"    What are the concrete steps of this organization, which uses  "hard" [preceding word in English] slogans indifferently, and  what do they see as their chances of achieving an "Islamic  revolution?" Is the IBDA-C, as the sound-of-mind Islamic writers  claim, an artificial organization established by the state in  order to create antipathy toward Islam, or are the IBDA-C  militants a handful of dreamers who listen to folk songs they  themselves sing? Abdullah Kiraci, owner and managing editor of  TARAF, provides answers to these questions:    Claiming that the IBDA-C is speedily gaining power, Kiraci  explains that anyone who wants to join them must meet three  basic conditions: They must be anti-imperialist, ready to fight  the exploitation of Turkey, and willing to defend Turkey's  complete independence. Although Kiraci claims that the IBDA-C  is not a very demanding organization, his claim brings to mind  the expression: "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it."  As a matter of fact, after the "revolution" they are planning  to carry out, Kiraci is not overly generous about according the  right of existence to those who do not think like him. You  should take note now that it is a dream to think that you can  become part of the system envisaged by the IBDA-C. Kiraci  claims that the sanctions he is thinking of implementing are  considered necessary in Islam. According to Kiraci, the  rightful owners of our lands are Muslims; however, according to  this organization, the Muslims are prevented from living as they  wish. Kiraci claims that the day will come when Muslims will  not be obliged to live with those who create obstacles, and then  they will implement their own rules. It is up to you whether  you will comply. If you do not, however, it means that you have  taken into consideration the punishments envisaged by Islam.    Claiming that the organization has reached its goal  ideologically, Kiraci states that, from now on, the IBDA-C will  consolidate its front lines and thus march step by step toward  the "revolution." Asserting that the IBDA-C will have an  increasing impact on the country's course if Turkey's situation  deteriorates, Kiraci claims that either they will come to power  or anarchy will spread and take over.    Kiraci is very optimistic about the future of his  organization; however, it is obvious that he does not receive  too much approval from the Islamic sector of the IBDA-C. As a  matter of fact, Fethullah Gulen, a prominent member of the  organization's Islamic sector and one whom the organization  accused of being a "collaborator-agent," harshly criticized the  organization in some of his speeches. TARAF, which has  published condemnations of National Action Party [NAP] leader  Alpaslan Turkes, has been attacked by publications close to the  NAP, and as a result of this clash of ideas, the organization  was forced to show more "sensitivity" to its idealistic  foundation. Among those who sharply criticized the IBDA-C is  Ercument Ozkan, owner of IKTIBAS [ADAPTATION], another  periodical said to be the voice of the Islamic sector. Ozkan  even went as far as to say that the IBDA-C is not in the  slightest degree connected to Islam. Obviously, the IBDA-C is a  very unique organization. While nowhere near the Turkish left,  the IBDA-C, in one of its statements, praised the famous  revolutionary Mahir Cayan on one hand and defended the Sivas  massacre on the other. One can only wonder what line the  organization, which now has an autonomous sector, will follow  and how it will conduct its armed actions. It is not even  possible to figure out this organization's potential area of  influence. We still find it beneficial to remind you: The best  thing for you to do is be careful, because you are not from the  "TARAF" and one day you may be "put aside." It is for us to  warn you....</p>

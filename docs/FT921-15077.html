			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (22): Takeover battle a rousing but untypical climax - Mergers and acquisitions AN OLD-FASHIONED Anglo-Saxon takeover battle brought the 1991 European mergers and acquisitions scene to a rousing but untypical climax. BTR, the UK industrial conglomerate ranked 22nd in the FT500, won its Pounds 1.55bn hostile bid for Hawker Siddeley, one of the most famous names in British engineering, which was ranked 186. However, hopes that BTR's return to the takeover trail marked a resurgence in UK takeover activity proved unfounded - as did speculation that Hanson's taking of a 2.8 per stake in Imperial Chemical Industries would lead to a bid for the giant. The hostility with which Lord Hanson's stake-building was greeted by politicians demonstrated just how much the commercial climate has changed in the UK since the deal-driven 1980s. The combination of recession, shortage of bank finance and uncertainty caused by the Gulf war all helped reduce cross-border M&amp;A activity to its lowest level since the crash of October 1987. According to the accounting group KPMG, the value of cross-border deals in the first nine months of the year fell by 60 per cent, to Dollars 34.8bn Takeover activity in Europe fell less steeply, mainly because of the continuing drive by companies to consolidate and strengthen their position ahead of the unified market. Financial services saw some of the greatest concentration. In the Netherlands, the merger of the country's two largest banks, Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank (Amro Bank) and Algemene Bank Nederland (ABN Bank), formed ABN-Amro Holding, ranked 84 in the FT500. Then Nationale-Nederlande, the leading Dutch insurer, merged with NMB Postbank, the country's third-biggest bank, to create the Internationale Nederlanden group, which is ranked 72nd. One company's focusing often gave a rival an opportunity to buy market share. AEG, part of the Daimler-Benz industrial group of Germany, sold its cable business to Alcatel Alsthom of France as part of its strategy of concentrating on its main activities. AEG Kabel said the business would have required too much investment to make it a big enough competitor on the European market. The purchase lifted Alcatel Cable's share of the German market from 10 to nearly 25 per cent. This process of concentration often posed regulatory questions. The EC's merger task force, which began routine investigations in January 1991 approved the SKr16.25bn (Dollars 2.8bn) bid for Alfa-Laval, the Swedish dairy and food processing equipment company, by Tetra Pak, the Swiss packaging group. Both companies had promised not to make sales of packaging machinery dependent on orders for processing machinery. They also undertook to make equipment compatible with competitors' products. Sir Leon Brittan, competition commissioner, allowed Fiat to take a controlling interest in Alcatel Alsthom's battery operations, though on condition the Italian group sold most of its stake in a large French battery maker. However, Brussels banned a proposed takeover of de Havilland, the ailing Canadian offshoot of Boeing, by Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy. The EC said the proposed takeover would have created 'a powerful and unassailable dominant position in the world market for turbo-prop (commuter) aircraft'. Occasionally changes in government regulation speeded the restructuring of markets. Allied-Lyons, the UK drinks, food and retailing group, and Carlsberg, the Danish brewer, plan to merge their UK brewing interests in a Pounds 510m joint venture. The deal marks a further consolidation of the British brewing industry after the UK's Monopolies and Mergers Commission's unsuccessful attempt to loosen the national brewers' grip on pub retailing. According to KPMG, French companies overtook UK groups as the biggest acquirers abroad during the first nine months of 1991, although French M&amp;A activity was also down on the previous year. Much of the French activity was in the US, with Schneider, the electrical equipment company, taking over Square D, the electrical distribution group for Dollars 2.23bn. Axa, France's second largest insurer, took a FFr5.8bn (Dollars 1.07bn) stake in the Equitable Life Assurance Society, and Alcatel Alsthom, the engineering and telecommunications group, paid FFr3.8bn for the transmission equipment division of Rockwell. On the domestic front, however, France is debating how its two-year-old takeover legislation reforms are working. Under the rules, a shareholder who raises his stake in a firm's capital or voting rights to above one half must bid for full control. But a shareholder who takes his stake above one third can get away with raising that to a minimum of just two thirds. In those cases, critics say, minorities left with the remaining one-third are discriminated against, as there is no guarantee they will be able to sell their stock at the bid price. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, France's finance minister, said recently he did not rule out the need to modify the regulations, but felt there was no consensus for change. In Germany, the collapse of talks between Continental, the tyre-making group, and Pirelli of Italy rekindled fears of a 'Fortress Germany', from which foreign bidders would be excluded by a combination of banks, cross-holdings of shares and voting right limits. Mr Hubertus von Grunberg, chief executive of Continental, admitted the collapse of the talks could have a negative effect on the German M&amp;A scene: 'It wasn't our intention, but the whole thing could be rather discouraging for others contemplating mergers or acquisitions.' The UK continues to be worried by a draft EC directive which would harmonise takeover practices throughout the Community. The British would, of course, welcome a more liberal regime, encouraging more aggressive takeovers. However, the UK's Takeover Panel is concerned that any EC directive would threaten the self-regulatory and non-statutory basis of the UK approach, which has the advantage of keeping companies out of the courts.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 UK TOP 500 GREATEST PROFIT INCREASES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                             Top 500     Percent Company                          Sector      Rank      increase 1  Triton Europe                    213       480        898.3 2  Midland &amp;

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / International Company News: Swire chief gives pledge on ownership of Cathay John Swire &amp; Sons, the owners of Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong-based airline, have reassured senior airline management and staff that they have no intention of relinquishing control of the company. In an unusual move Mr Peter Sutch, chairman of Cathay, has circulated a letter from Swire's chairman, Sir Adrian Swire, instructing him to 'kill this fantasy'. Mr Sutch said he hoped the letter would put this 'dangerous notion to rest'. There have been persistent doubts among some aviation analysts about the willingness of China to abide by agreements and allow Cathay to remain controlled by non-Chinese interests. Cathay believes the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration and China's 1991 Basic Law for Hong Kong provide a secure future for the airline and its owners after China resumes sovereignty in 1997. But the future ownership of Cathay has resurfaced recently as a concern of airline's pilots, currently engaged in pay negotiations. The pilots have alleged that Cathay management's pressure on airline costs is a prelude to a sell-off. '(This) is something entirely without foundation,' Sir Adrian wrote in his letter to Mr Sutch on May 26. 'It has never been considered by Swires and it is an allegation which if it ever became accepted wisdom could do immense harm to the credibility of Cathay Pacific and to the future of all those associated with the airline, both employees and shareholders. 'It would be a tragedy if all the hard work that has been put in over the past 10 years to secure the post-1997 future of Cathay were undermined by irresponsible comment of this kind being reported in the press.' Sir Adrian said that Swire had given assurances to the authorities in Beijing that 'we were long-termers in China and Hong Kong'. Swire could not possibly be so unwise as to do that if its intentions were the opposite, he said. After the 1984 Sino-British agreement Swire realised it had to give up some control over Cathay. The first move was the listing of the airline on the Hong Kong stock exchange in 1986. It then encouraged mainland Chinese ownership of the airline - mainland interests now control 22.5 per cent of the company, with Swire Pacific owning 51.8 per cent. Swire said yesterday that 'everyone is very comfortable' with the current shareholding structure.</p>

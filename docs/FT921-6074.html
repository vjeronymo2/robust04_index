			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Banks give NHL 90 days' grace NATIONAL HOME Loans, the troubled mortgage lender and financial services group, has won a 90-day breathing space from its banks. The group spent last week negotiating with four syndicates of banks about alterations to its borrowing arrangements. It is thought that the talks were needed to prevent NHL defaulting on a technicality on funding arrangements set up five years ago. This would have led to a set of cross-defaults affecting up to Pounds 900m of its funding. To retrieve the situation, NHL was obliged to obtain waivers by last night from nearly 100 banks. During the week, Mr Jonathan Perry, the newly appointed chairman and chief executive, denied that NHL was seeking either a rescheduling or fresh funds from its banks. Mr Perry declined to give further details of the negotiations. It was not clear whether or not NHL would face further funding problems at the end of the 90-day period. Last July, a group of 10 banks agreed to put up a Pounds 200m cash life-boat for NHL after local authorities began pulling deposits out of its banking subsidiary, National Mortgage Bank, in the wake of the BCCI collapse. Yesterday Mr Perry said that the group had achieved its first objective and he would now concentrate on putting NHL on a sound financial footing and managing the arrears in its Pounds 700m mortgage book.</p>

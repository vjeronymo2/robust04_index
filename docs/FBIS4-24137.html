			<p>BFN     [Text] Theogene Rudasingwa, secretary general of the  Rwandan Patriotic Front, has had very harsh words for France's  operation in Rwanda. John Maguire met him in Paris this morning  and asked him what he thought of the UN's vote, giving the green  light for Operation Turquoise:    [Begin Rudasingwa recording, in English with superimposed  French translation] I do not think the UN decision reflects a  consensus on the part of the international community, because in  the post cold war era, to have five abstentions at the UN  Security Council is very significant.    You also know that the OAU, the countries of the region, and  many international organizations of excellent repute, strongly  oppose this intervention. So, I think we have witnessed not a  consensus, but rather the will of the northern powers to  consolidate a program which counters the interests of our  people, to save those very groups who are responsible for this  genocide. These powers at present see that these groups are  weakened and are losing ground. I think that not only France,  but also other countries, in particular Zaire, are trying simply  to see how they can reorganize these groups of people so as to  give them a place in the future.

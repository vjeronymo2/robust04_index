			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL PARK SERVICE SPRINGTIME HIKING TIPS  </P> <P> The Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, a unit of the National  Park Service, offers the following tips for springtime hiking in the Santa  Monica Mountains:  </P> <P> * Water is life. Carry plenty of water and drink it.  </P> <P> One quart or more for short walks. More for longer hikes. Alcohol is not a good  substitute for water.  </P> <P> * Sun protection. Wear sunscreen, hat and sunglasses. Long-sleeved shirts are  recommended on sunny days.  </P> <P> * Never hike alone; use the buddy system. That leaves someone to go for help if  you run into trouble.  </P> <P> * Plan your hike and tell someone -- a close friend or family member -- about  the plan. Stick with your trip plan.  </P> <P> * Wear sturdy footwear: hiking boots or sneakers.  </P> <P> * Do not build fires. Do not smoke.  </P> <P> * Carry a well-equipped first aid kit.  </P> <P> * High outdoor temperatures can reduce a hiker's efficiency. Travel light. The  heaviest item in your backpack should be water.  </P> <P> * Be aware that the Southern Pacific rattlesnake lives in the mountains. Stay  away from it and it won't bother you.  </P> <P> * State parks are closed during periods of extreme fire danger. Call (213)  454-2372 for a 24-hour recorded fire-condition message.  </P></p>

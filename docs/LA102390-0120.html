			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'NIGHT': AVANT-GARDE VOCALS AT SONIC SERIES  </P> <P> A refreshing addition to the madcap, low-budget world of avant-garde vocalizing  took place Saturday at LACE when French countertenor Frank Royon le Mee and  local composer/electronic music wizard Barry Schrader performed their  well-planned opus "Night," a musical collaboration written for voice, electric  piano, synthesizer and computer, with some minor theatrical elements included.  </P> <P> Nine separately titled sections proceed without pause, each inventively  exploring different worlds of improvisation and computerized sound, as well as  more conventional, through-composed parts.  </P> <P> The multistyled whole alternates between virtuosic solos from one or the other  performers as well as transcendental, more Romantic parts where they perform  together.  </P> <P> Royon le Mee's clownish use of extended vocal techniques and nonsense syllables  is most effectively displayed when used to intone the mystically provocative  Latin text in the neo-Medieval "Night Prayer." In "Night Chimes," his use of a  small chiming toy, as well as a digital watch alarm, adds some degree of  silliness, though never crossing the threshold of tastelessness.  </P> <P> In Schrader's masterful electronic settings, rudimentary keyboard noodlings  become exquisite landscapes of timbres and rhythmic elements. His stoic  delivery in works such as in the mesmerizing parallel organum of "Night Dreams"  complements Royon le Mee's wackier antics aptly.  </P> <P> Of four movements in which the duo performed together, the finale -- "La Grande  Nuit du Silence" -- offers the most variety. The longest of the nine movements,  it includes a recitation by Royon le Mee of his own French text, as well as a  carefully blended mix of zaniness and seriousness. GREGG WAGER  </P></p>

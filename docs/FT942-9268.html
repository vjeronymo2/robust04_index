			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Technology: Spiders spin a profit Dangling from its web, a spider uses the strongest and most elastic material in the world. Proportionally, a spider's silk can support external pressures of 200,000lb per square inch and can stretch up to 135 per cent of its original length. It is stronger than steel and more flexible than nylon. Researchers from the University of Wyoming have now cloned the genes that make the proteins found in an especially tough and elastic kind of spider's silk. Genes from the golden orb web spinner, found on the US southern coast, have been inserted into bacteria, which have produced small quantities of the proteins. By harnessing the properties of these proteins, dubbed Spidroin 1 and Spidroin 2, an array of new kinds of super-tough, elastic materials could be developed, says Randolph Lewis, the molecular biologist who heads the Wyoming research group. He reported his discoveries at a recent meeting of the American Chemical Society. Lewis says the proteins are the ideal material for super-thin sutures that would cause minimal scarring in surgery. They could also be used for artificial tendons and ligaments that could withstand the body's demands, yet still bend. So far, Lewis's group has only produced tiny amounts of the proteins in genetically altered bacteria. The next step is mass production. 'With large-scale production it will be possible to start making fibres for testing in various applications,' says Lewis. Other academic and military scientists in the US are also examining the unusual properties of proteins found in spider silks, although the work has not yet attracted commercial companies. However, some are likely to take an interest if researchers can mass produce and then spin the proteins into real thread.</p>

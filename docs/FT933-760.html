			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Rover eyes Indian assembly venture ROVER GROUP, the motor vehicles subsidiary of British Aerospace, is negotiating with the Sipani group of India for assembly of its Montego large family car in India. Rover said yesterday it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Sipani and was 'actively discussing' a joint venture agreement which could include assembly of both the Montego and Rover's two litre turbo-diesel engine. The diesel engine would be assembled by Auto Tractors, a subsidiary of the Sipani group. Rover said talks were still at an early stage. Its engagement in the project would be mainly technical rather than financial, and it was not aiming to take a significant equity stake. If a deal were agreed it is expected that assembly would begin from semi-knocked-down kits supplied from Rover's plant at Cowley, Oxford. At a later stage assembly would move to completely-knocked-down kits, and the joint venture would seek to increase gradually the volume of locally purchased components.</p>

Neither the West nor Russia Intend To Scale Down  Intelligence Activity"]    [Text] It has transpired from reliable sources that the  Russian special services have marked the beginning of the  current year by yet another successful large-scale operation,  although this time around it was related to intelligence, not  counterintelligence activity.    On 15 January, FCS officers detained a high-ranking staffer  of a large organization in the Russian military-industrial  sector on suspicion of spying. The name and post of this person  have not been identified so far for the purpose of the  investigation.    The Russian Main Military Prosecutor's Office has brought a  criminal lawsuit in connection with the matter; on 25 January  the suspect was indicted on Article 64(a) of the Russian  Federation Criminal Code for high treason in the form of  espionage. According to the source, the defendant has pleaded  guilty on all counts. During the preliminary investigation, FCS  officers managed to obtain evidence proving that the detainee  was recruited by British special services. In order to perform  his spy mission he was given specialized cryptographic  equipment, instructions on methods of communicating with secret  agents from the British Embassy in Moscow through "dead drops,"  and so forth. On instructions from the British agents he  gathered and handed over to them secret military and economic  information about the latest developments in the area of weapons  models, their specifications and performance characteristics,  the funding of defense and research-and-development programs,  and the prospects for the organization of military- technical  cooperation between Russia and foreign countries.    The investigation continues.</p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Letter: Better way of influencing UK wage expectations Sir, The article by Professors Layard and Bean ('Shut the stable door', November 4) is right in highlighting the inability to keep wage growth under control as the Achilles' heel of the UK economy. Disappointingly, the framework of their analysis appears inadequate and their proposed solution deeply flawed. It is facile to blame current problems on the wage inflation of the late 1980s. The real problems are longer term and cultural and need longer-term solutions. I use the word cultural because UK labour and management have consistently pursued the objective of achieving and maintaining real income growth both in times of recovery and recession. Evidence of this goes back at least to the inter-war years. Also disappointing is the view that the current recession was intended to bring wage inflation down from an annual rate of increase of about 9 per cent to 5 per cent. This rate of wage increase is in excess of both long-term and short-term productivity trends. The implications for international competitiveness are, as usual, negative. Equally wanting is the Layard and Bean solution: another committee to monitor wage relativities in the public and private sectors. The UK problem is not primarily one of relativities but one of an overall level of wage increase. The lead must come from government and from appropriate long-term policies. The government's current approach is not encouraging: declaring a victory as a prelude to withdrawing from the battlefield inspires no confidence. The acceptance of a 5 per cent annual increase in UK wages under recessionary conditions is out of line with thinking in most EC countries. And if the government wants to see how to deal with a long-term cultural problem on wage growth, it could consider the French experience over the past decade. How could the government help to influence wage expectations? First, by controlling the rate of wage increases in the public sector. Second, by setting tighter inflation targets expressed in terms of core rather than headline inflation. Third, by making a specific commitment to apply to return to the European exchange rate mechanism as soon as sufficient convergence has taken place and defining what is meant by sufficient convergence. Fourth, by targeting the reduction of PSBR as a proportion of GDP, if necessary through income tax surcharges related to the extent by which wages run ahead of inflation and productivity.

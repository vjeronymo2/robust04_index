			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The public has learned about the primary features of  the budget that will be debated by the parliamentary committee  for financial affairs before it is discussed at the Parliament's  general meetings.    Although this budget stems from the "philosophy" of the  so-called government program on the basis of which the  parliamentary majority gave its vote for the present government,  the finance law is unable to deliver what the said program urges  with regard to encouraging investment and creating a suitable  atmosphere for it.    It is known that the first condition for investment is the  availability of clear and precise resources in the proposed  state budget. But it is observed that the proposed investment  budget represents only seven percent of the GDP. This is a poor  average compared with that of the budgets of the early eighties,  which reached 15 percent.    Even this poor average remains vulnerable, because it is  basically linked to Morocco's obtaining foreign loans that the  government expects to reach $2 billion in 1994.    In addition to the fact that this will increase Morocco's  foreign debts, it is not certain that these amounts can be  obtained. This means that the investment budget will continue to  be dependent on these foreign finances, which remain mere  possibilities.    Therefore, it can be said that the field of public  investment  will not develop; rather it will continue to follow the same  direction that the successive previous governments followed  since the policy of structural reform began. This policy has led  to a crisis, which is reflected in particular on the fields of  employment and the citizens' social conditions.    With regard to employment, this year's budget promises to  create 25,000 jobs, an increase of 10,000 jobs compared with  1993. But official data tell us that tens of thousands of  graduates will enter the job market every year, some of whom  have been unemployed for more than 10 years. The budget  submitted this year will not be able to absorb the hundreds of  thousands of unemployed blue-and white-collar workers.    Also, establishing a special fund for the employment of  youngsters with a capital of 100 billion centimes creates the  problem of how can this amount can be utilized in order to get  maximum benefit from it and to solve part of the problem of the  unemployed youths with professional, scientific, and  intellectual capabilities.    On the one hand there is the problem of structuring the  loans  and the rate of interest on them and the guarantees that are  difficult to obtain. On the other, the general climate is not  helpful for the establishment of small- and medium- sized  contracting companies. The difficulties include administrative  obstacles and the lack of infrastructure, equipment, and land.    Therefore, the problem of unemployment remains an urgent  matter in the field of Moroccan economy. It is not enough for  the budget to come up with promises about job creation and the  establishment of a fund in order to overcome chronic, structural  problems.    The weakness of the social aspect is also reflected in the  1994 budget, both on the level of wages and of reforming of a  number of sectors, the most important of which, for example, is  the housing sector.    The [finance] minister's statement contains quick references  to this sector, which should be dealt with in a manner  categorically different from the past. The housing sector cannot  remain a source of quick and exorbitant profits or be subject to  speculation and monopoly as is the case now. It appears that  this year's budget is no different from the previous ones in  dealing with such urgent social issues. This is because it is a  budget stemming from a government program embodying the  perpetual pattern the Moroccan governments have been following  for the past 10 years. This is due to pledging financial  commitments with a narrow scope which adversely affect social  conditions and public investment.    Perhaps the citizens now wonder: What is the strategy on  which this budget is based? It is known that the present  government has no economic policy now that the years of a  planned economy are over.    Nevertheless, it cannot be said that the budget is not based  on any economic precedent. Although it is not based on a planned  and publicly open economic policy, it is based on the state's  principal constants that have dealt with the economic and  financial situation from a class viewpoint which led to  enriching the rich and impoverishing the middle class and the  poor. The [government's] answer to these social problems is to  ignore them sometimes, to remain silent about them other times,  and yet other times, resort to bludgeoning.</p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL REPEATS OFFER TO SWAP PRISONERS AFTER DEMAND BY HEZBOLLAH THAT IT FREE 5  ARABS  </P> <P> The Israeli government on Saturday repeated its offer to swap prisoners with  Shiite Muslim extremists in Lebanon and cautiously studied a statement by the  pro-Iranian Hezbollah movement demanding freedom for five Palestinians  imprisoned by Israel for fatal attacks against Israeli civilians.  </P> <P> Among the prisoners named by Hezbollah was a Palestinian from the Gaza Strip  who deliberately steered a bus off a highway near Jerusalem last month. Sixteen  passengers, including two Canadians and an American, were killed in the fiery  crash.  </P> <P> The statement of Hezbollah (Party of God) came in the wake of hints publicized  last week that it would hand the Red Cross a list of the names of prisoners  whom it wants Israel to free. No such list has been given to Israel; the names  announced Saturday were given to news agencies in Beirut.  </P> <P> As a precondition for any move, Hezbollah demanded the release of a Shiite  clergyman, Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, and two of his relatives seized July 28 by  Israeli commandos in southern Lebanon.  </P> <P> Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, whose ministry deals with hostage matters here,  announced Saturday night that "Israel's offer is valid." The offer, made last  week, included a willingness to exchange Obeid and other Shiites held by Israel  for three Israeli soldiers, now in Hezbollah hands, as well as 14 Western  hostages.  </P> <P> "But we are not taking into consideration public announcements," Rabin said.  "If and when Hezbollah contacts the Red Cross and the Red Cross contacts us, we  will discuss it seriously."  </P> <P> Eitan Haber, a spokesman for Rabin, said: "This is a war of nerves."  </P> <P> Israel would consider a Hezbollah contact with the International Committee of  the Red Cross to be an indication that the group would be willing to make a  deal, a Foreign Ministry official added.  </P> <P> Should Hezbollah respond concretely, the possible release of some of the  prisoners it listed would be hard for the Israeli public to swallow.  </P> <P> One, Abdel Hadi Suleiman Ghanem, a Palestinian refugee, grabbed the steering  wheel of passenger bus No. 405 on July 7 and sent it crashing off the Tel  Aviv-Jerusalem highway.  </P> <P> Another, Nidal Zaloum, a college student from Ramallah, slashed bystanders on  Jaffa Road in Jerusalem in early May, killing two people waiting at a bus stop.  </P> <P> The Jaffa Road knifings and the bus tragedy set off outpourings of rage among  Israeli citizens. There would probably be a public uproar at the release of the  suspects.  </P> <P> Ital Alyan, another mentioned prisoner, last year tried to kill Maj. Gen.  Antoine Lahad, commander of the South Lebanon Army, a Christian-led militia  allied with Israel in southern Lebanon.  </P> <P> The charges against the other two Palestinians on the Hezbollah list, Anwar  Yassin and Shoha Bishara, are not known publicly here. Hezbollah called them  "heroes of the Lebanese resistance," indicating that they had fought Israel  along its border with Lebanon.  </P> <P> Despite the possibility of domestic controversy, Israeli officials were not  ruling out a swap that would include these prisoners.  </P> <P> "We'll have to see. It would be difficult, but if it's an offer, we would have  to look at it. We have set murderers free before to get back our people," a  Foreign Ministry official said.  </P> <P> In a speech to a United Jewish Appeal meeting last week, Prime Minister Yitzhak  Shamir spelled out Israel's position. "We do not forsake the soldier in the  battlefield, nor do we relent in our efforts to obtain the release of a soldier  or civilian who may be abducted under any circumstances by enemies or  terrorists," he said.  </P></p>

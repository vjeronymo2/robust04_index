			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHINING AND WINNING: DOES IT REALLY MATTER?  </P> <P> So poor Bret Johnson decided to quit UCLA because he wouldn't be starting?  Isn't that a shame.  </P> <P> In high school, when Johnson was El Toro's sophomore quarterback, I was the  starting center. One thing I'll always remember is that when the going got  tough, Bret whined, sniveled and pointed fingers -- at everybody except  himself.  </P> <P> Bret never lost a game because the other guy was better. Bret always lost  because his teammates didn't block, the referee made a poor call or there was  bad weather. In Bret Johnson's mind, Bret Johnson could do no wrong. I think  UCLA fans will join me in saying good riddance.  </P> <P> J. THOMPSON  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Fanny Wong] </F>   [Text] Britain went on the offensive yesterday in the  dispute over whether or not details of 17 rounds of secret talks  with China on the 1994/95 electoral arrangements should be  published next week, claiming that the Beijing Government had  already leaked its own version of the negotiations. The  mainland edition of the People's Daily on January 7 contained  very long accounts from an anonymous official about the talks,  the Governor's spokesman, Mike Hanson, said. He said it was,  therefore, "very surprising" that China should issue a statement  saying it was dissatisfied that the British administration had  rejected "consultation" on releasing the contents of diplomatic  negotiations.    A mainland official said on Thursday that the British side  had not sought a discussion with the Chinese side on the  disclosure of these details and such a unilateral move was  inappropriate. But Mr Hanson said that in early December, both  the Director of the Chinese State Council's Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office, Lu Ping, and local Xinhua director, Zhou Nan,  had challenged Mr Patten to reveal what had happened in the  talks.    He would not say whether the Government would go ahead and  publish a White Paper outlining the negotiations and only  reiterated that the Governor had made clear on several occasions  that Hong Kong people would be given a full account. It is  understood, however, that the Executive Council will be asked to  formally endorse the final draft of the White Paper on Tuesday  and that it will be published on either Thursday or Friday.    As well as this dispute, Mr Patten plans to ignore China's  objections and any concessions that might have been offered in  the talks and table his original constitutional package to  legislators.    Among proposals in his Policy Speech in 1992 were the  creation of nine new Legislative Council [Legco] functional  constituencies, with a total franchise of 2.7 million people and  formation of an Election Committee by district board members to  return 10 legislators. The bill covering the functional  constituency and election committee polls of the Legislative  Council will also be gazetted on Friday.    China has threatened to call fresh elections for the  three-tier political structure in 1997 if Mr Patten goes ahead  with his original constitutional package, which it claims  violates the Joint Dcclaration, the Basic Law, and previous  understandings between Britain and China.    Although consideration has been given to whether the  Governor  should table modified proposals put to the Chinese side last  summer, Mr Patten is understood to have concluded that even such  a move would not help win Beijing's support. Instead, Beijing  would risk defeat as liberal legislators are certain to reject a  watered-down version.    According to the People's Daily article, the two sides had  come close to an agreement, with a draft memorandum of  understanding already available on the simple issues relating to  the district boards and municipal councils polls. The full-page  article, in the form of an interview between a reporter of the  paper and a relevant person, detailed the cause leading to the  collapse of the talks. It also revealed that the two sides  already reached consensus on how to proceed with the voting age  and voting method of the district boards and municipal councils  elections as well as the abolition of appointed seats in the two  lower tiers of political structure in the 15th round.    The relevant person talked extensively on the crux of the  problems leading to the failure of the talks and he was quoted  as saying that at one point, China had compromised on the issue  of the appointment system by agreeing to reduce the number of  appointed seats of the district boards and the municipal  councils from one-third to a quarter on the principle of  proceeding in an orderly fashion. But the British side was  unwilling to yield an inch, he added.    He continued to say that to help win an accord with Britain  on the district boards and municipal councils elections as  quickly as possible, the Chinese side had stepped up its efforts  at the 15th round of talks, offering to attach an explanation to  the memorandum of understanding spelling out the positions of  the two sides on the appointment system.    The explanation would say that the British side supported  the  abolition of the appointment system while the Chinese side  preferred keeping an appropriate proportion of the appointed  seats.    And after June 30, 1997, the Hong Kong Special  Administrative  Region (SAR) Government would decide on the number of district  boards and appointed seats on its own, based on the stipulation  of the Basic Law Article 98, he said, adding that the British  side had agreed to the Chinese side's view on this issue.    The two sides also agreed at that time that the  nongovernment  nature and functions of the district and municipal bodies would  remain unchanged in the run-up to 1997.    But then the British side started to open new subjects and  set out new demands at the 16th round of talks in demanding that  the single-seat, single-vote election method for the Legco polls  be applied to the Legco elections as well.</p>

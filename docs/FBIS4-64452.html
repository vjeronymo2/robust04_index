			<p>BFN     [Text] Here in the Netherlands the current coalition  government of Christian Democrats and Social Democrats has lost  its majority in parliament after yesterday's parliamentary  elections.    The Christian Democrats, the CDA, received more than 35  percent of the vote in the 1989 general election, but they have  now slumped to just over 22 percent. The Social Democrats  [PvdA] also lost ground. Their share of the votes fell from 32  percent to 24 percent, but they emerged as the largest party in  the new Dutch parliament. The two major opposition parties --  the Conservative Liberal VVD, and the Progressive Liberal D66 --  made significant gains in the elections. Both now have a  significant number of seats in parliament. The remaining seats  were won by a total of eight smaller parties.    The results provide no firm indication of the composition of  the new government. It is clear, though, that any new coalition  government will need the backing of at least three parties to  secure a parliamentary majority.</p>

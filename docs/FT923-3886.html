			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Labour plans a radical path for Israeli economy AFTER two months in office, Israel's Labour-led coalition government has this week set out its first broad policy initiative to tackle an economy weighed down by the cost of immigration and the double-digit unemployment the influx has fuelled. A near Shk100bn (Pounds 21bn) budget for 1993 approved by ministers on Tuesday represents a cautious but marked shift away from the policies of the previous Likud-led coalition. Potentially much more radical is a package of structural reforms that, if implemented, would considerably undermine the big hold on the economy that the state has always exercised in Israel. The spending plans slash overblown construction projects by more than half, including the Likud's controversial Jewish settlement building in the occupied territories. Instead, a Shk2bn schedule of infrastructural investment in Israel 'proper' has been drawn up and room has been made for a Shk800m tax cut. The budget deficit of Shk5.5bn, or 3.2 per cent of GDP, is on track for eliminating the deficit by 1995. Conspicuous by their absence from the budget proposals are the Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees which Israel now expects to win from the US later this year. These are meant to help finance immigration absorption. However, the government's strategy is to keep borrowing backed by the loan guarantees out of projects directly funded by the state. Instead the guarantees will be used to finance private investment in the economy. Mr Jacob Frenkel, governor of the Bank of Israel, said ministers should have gone further on investment and tax relief by opting for bigger housing cuts and cuts in the big defence and social service budgets. But the central bank also praised the budget as a step towards generating private sector growth that will eventually absorb Jewish immigration from the former Soviet Union. This now stands at more than 350,000 and, despite a sharp fall in influx rates this year, officials have estimated a further 120,000 may arrive in 1993. Latest figures suggest the economy is picking up after a dismal performance last year when per capita growth was negligible despite a construction boom. Exports look set to grow by 10 per cent in 1992. Inflation for the year is set to be at its lowest for more than a decade at about 10 per cent. But such is the burden of immigration that the government says unemployment will drop by less than half a percentage point next year to 10.7 per cent of the workforce. To help achieve faster growth, the government has adopted reform proposals that range from accelerating privatisation, through import liberalisation and capital market reforms to cutting the state's monopoly in areas such as land sales and telecommunications. Many of these measures have been on the books for several years and may yet not see the light of day. But the government insists that it is serious. But a bigger test lies in those areas which cut across the influence of the Histadrut trade union federation to which the Labour party is closely allied. Already the two are grappling over the heavily state-subsidised Kupat Holim health insurance system to which most Israelis belong and which is run by the Histadrut. Many economists - and probably most Kupat Holim members - argue that it should be removed from Histadrut control and integrated into a reformed national health system incorporating state-provided and private medical services. The government has so far not committed itself to this. The government has said it will end a system of providing high-interest state bonds for the Histadrut pension funds - which are also in deep financial difficulties. But it has hedged this by saying it will replace the system with direct state subsidies. Proposals to break the Histadrut's public transport monopolies did not appear in the government's reform package - not surprising, as the transport minister was until earlier this year the Histadrut secretary general. Israeli governments have to date delivered much less structural reform than they have promised. The new government has set itself a formidable target by promising more than any other before it.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Aznar in London To Explain People's </F> Party Solutions to Spain's Economic Crisis"]    [Text] London - [Spanish People's Party leader] Jose Maria  Aznar yesterday visited the British capital on what was  essentially an economic mission, since one of the main items on  his agenda was to speak in the Founders' Hall in the City of  London before a large gathering of business representatives,  explaining how the People's Party views the current economic  crisis being experienced by Spain.    The People's Party leader stressed the situation in which  the  Socialist government has placed the Spanish economy, and the  solutions that the leading opposition party is proposing to dig  the country out of the crisis.  <H5>  Meeting With Portillo </H5>   In addition, Aznar lunched with the British Chief Treasury  Secretary Michael Portillo, with whom he has good personal  relations and who is considered to be one of the Conservative  Party's strong men, in the same mold as former Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher. He also planned to meet with Foreign  Secretary Douglas Hurd. On this occasion, Aznar's agenda did  not include a meeting with British Prime Minister John Major,  with whom he has had the opportunity to meet at other times.  <H5>  Meeting With Cavaco in Lisbon </H5>   Today, continuing with his plan of contacting European  leaders, the People's Party leader will travel to Lisbon where  he is to meet with Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva. One of  the aims of this trip is to propose to the head of the  Portuguese government that his Social Democratic Party drop the  Liberal Democratic and Reform Group and join the European  People's Party. The European Christian Democrats want to be the  largest force in the European Parliament after the 12 June  elections, which is why every effort is being made to unite all  the associated political forces.    To achieve this objective, it is necessary to get other  formations to join the People's Group in the Strasbourg  parliament, like the Italian Christian Democratic Center which  could pull in Berlusconi's MEP's, or those of the French  center-right, with whom the group would acquire a major  Christian Democratic component.    Cavaco Silva won the Portuguese general elections on 6  October 1991 to become the European prime minister with the best  endorsement from the voters, while no other head of government  in the European Union has ever managed two absolute majorities  with more than 50 percent of the votes.    Curiously, he maintains good relations with [Spanish Prime  Minister] Felipe Gonzalez and, since both men have been  occupying the highest position in government in their respective  countries, bilateral relations have improved considerably and  some of the outstanding contentious issues have been solved, to  the extent where both men describe the change undergone as an  "historic turning point."</p>

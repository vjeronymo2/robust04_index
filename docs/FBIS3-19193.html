The biggest disillusion of separatists who organized the  meeting was the fact that the Turkish society living in Belgium  showed no reaction to the meeting and did not enter any dispute,  despite the provocations the conference made.    Since the beginning of the conference Saturday [12 March],  separatists kept on saying that they were facing danger and  Turks can attack any time. However, there was neither an attack  nor an interest towards the meeting.    The Belgian police took intensive measures around the  Sheraton Hotel which the meeting was held. A gendarme official  in site was saying, "the danger does not come from the Turkish  society, but from the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] militants  inside."    The Belgian media did not cover the conference and the small  number of audience included Pakistanis invited to the  conference, who were not listening to the conference but drawing  pictures.    None of the separatists in the meeting were speaking  Kurdish.  All the addresses, excluding former True Path Party member  Abdulmelik Firat, were speaking Turkish.    After PKK head Abdullah Ocalan's message, which claimed that  the terror organization was not intending to divide Turkey, was  read, a naive British participant who said "I did not know that  he was not a terrorist and did not aim at dividing Turkey" was  evaluated by the other participants as "the only person who took  the message at face value."    Meanwhile member of Democracy Party Remzi Kartal took the  floor to say that "they had been forced to carry an armed fight  against Turkey."    The Democracy Party, which hold 13 seats at the Turkish  Grand  National Assembly denies that it has links with separatist  terror organization PKK which claims nearly 11,000 lives in  Turkey in a decade of its bloody campaign against the Turkish  state and people.

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Pep bombardment Investors will be bombarded with mailshots and advertising campaigns in the coming months, to tempt them into a personal equity plan before the tax year ends on April 5. All income and gains made within a Pep are tax-free and this has made them enormously popular. Over Pounds 9.2bn has been invested in general Peps, which were first sold in 1987 and into which Pounds 6,000 a year can be invested. Since 1992, an additional Pounds 3,000 can be put in a single-company Pep. There are more than 870 schemes to choose from, so investors do not lack for choice. Chase de Vere, which published its annual Pep guide this week, also includes performance figures for unit, investment trust and single company Peps. The top performer among the unit and investment trusts over three years is Hill Samuel's UK Emerging Companies unit trusts with growth of 185 per cent (figures are offer-to-offer, so the initial charges are not taken into account, with gross income reinvested). The fund was launched in 1989 to invest in companies with a maximum market capitalisation of Pounds 50m. Personal Assets - managed by Ivory &amp; Sime - and Law Debenture, both investment trusts, were next, growing by 179 per cent and 171 per cent respectively. The first invests in the UK and the US, while Law Debenture, which is managed by Henderson TR, has a broad international spread. The remaining funds in the top 10, in decreasing order of performance, were St James' Place Pep Progressive unit trust, Henderson TR Electric &amp; General IT, Glasgow Shires IT, Perpetual High Income unit trust, Fleming Fledgling IT, the ordinary shares of Finsbury Smaller Companies IT and Pembroke unit trust. The Pep with the weakest performance was Equitable Special Situations which grew by 20 per cent over the period. The Pep leaders of the FT-SE 100 companies over one year were British Aerospace (with growth of 283 per cent), Powergen, Granada Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, Standard Chartered, British Steel, Blue Circle, Great Universal Stores, RMC Group and Schroders. Single company Peps are often used to transfer shares acquired under an employee share option schemes. Only one company's shares can be held at any time, but it is possible to switch between them.

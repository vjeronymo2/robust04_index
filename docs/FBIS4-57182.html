			<p>Resurgence   <F P=102>   PA1305163394 Caracas Union Radio Network in Spanish 1100 GMT  13 May 94 </F>  <F P=103> PA1305163394 </F> <F P=104>  Caracas Union Radio Network </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vicente Briceno from the "180 Minutes of News" </F> newscast]    [Text] According to Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom,  the conditions are not right in Venezuela for a guerrilla  resurgence. The minister denied that a guerrilla movement in  response to the country's situation. He said the Americo Silva  Guerrilla Front was the last rebel organization of its kind to  exist in Venezuela since the sixties. The minister also  expressed his satisfaction with the Front's decision to adopt a  legal, democratic coexistence.    Regarding the student disturbances of the past few days,  Escobar Salom called on the protesters to reflect and to  advocate change without disrupting peace and by preserving  tranquillity.    [Begin Escovar recording] I want to impress upon the various  social sectors that violence is not going to improve this or any  other problem. The government, therefore, while it favors this  democratic dialogue, wants to emphasize to Venezuelan society  the necessity of peaceful coexistence. That is the government's  purpose, and it is also the government's purpose to strongly and  firmly confront, as it is doing now, the disturbances,  aggressions, and attacks on citizens' rights. The government  must defend the rights of all citizens and cannot allow minority  groups to attack the social peace and rights of others: the  right to have property and the right to own or rent a vehicle,  bus, or truck, as is the right of Venezuelan workers, so they  can circulate freely and peacefully on the streets, avenues, or  highways. [end recording]    Minister Escovar Salom said the situation is totally under  control and emphatically affirmed that the government will deal  harshly and unhesitatingly to control these incidents, which in  his opinion do not compromise the country's political or  institutional stability.    The truth of the matter is that the famous sinister force  which Minister Escobar Salom accuses of being the main motor of  the student disturbances has thus far not appeared and its  whereabouts are unknown.</p>

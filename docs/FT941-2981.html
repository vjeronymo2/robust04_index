			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Credit group to meet registrar The Finance and Leasing Association, which represents companies providing consumer credit, business finance and leasing and motor finance, is to meet the Data Protection Registrar next week in an effort to sort out a disagreement over the use of credit information. The registrar believes finance companies should not pass information about accounts to credit reference agencies without the customer's specific consent and that giving consent cannot be made the condition of a loan. The association describes the proposals as a 'fraudsters' charter'.</p>

A Commerce Ministry source said M.R. Napthon Thongyai of the  Commercial Counsellor's Office in Washington wrote to the US  State Department opposing the $5-million sale. Under a special  assistance programme, the payment period will be 30 years with a  grace period of seven years at no interest.    Last November, the US sold 35,000 tons of rice worth $10  million to the African nation under the same programme that did  not adversely impact the Thai rice market because that sale was  of a lower-quality rice, the source said. Cote d'Ivoire imported  200,400 tons of rice from Thailand in 1992 and anticipates  imports of 215,000 tons this year.</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Patten confirms Polly Peck donation  -Party Finances THE Conservative party yesterday confirmed it had received donations totalling Pounds 440,000 from companies within the collapsed Polly Peck empire of Mr Asil Nadir which had not been disclosed in the company accounts. The party indicated that it did not intend to return the money. Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, would not comment on what action he might take, saying it was a hypothetical question on a matter that would be going before the courts. The donations were not disclosed in Polly Peck International's accounts covering the period 1985-1990, possibly in breach of company law. Mr Patten appeared to confirm that the money had already been spent, saying that 'since it was donated either side of the 1987 election, it would be surprising to discover it was still under the mattress'. He emphasised that the Conservatives 'had acted entirely in good faith throughout', and had answered all questions put by the administrator. The revelation sparked calls from Labour MPs for a Commons statement by Mr Patten. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary, wrote to the Serious Fraud Office pressing again for an inquiry into Polly Peck's contributions to the Conservative party. An early day motion tabled by Mr Peter Hain, Labour MP for Neath, accused the Tories of being 'in receipt of stolen cash'. It called on Mr Major 'to arrange for the return to Touche Ross, the administrators of Polly Peck, the Pounds 440,000 of contributions made to his party by Asil Nadir, the chairman of the company, without disclosure in the company accounts'. The 1985 Companies Act requires that the directors' report contains details of donations to political causes over Pounds 200. There are no such entries in the accounts of PPI for periods between 1985 and 1990, although Touche Ross unearthed evidence of such payments soon after one of its partners was appointed as joint administrator. It said the partner, Mr Christopher Morris, who has special responsibility for discovering any creditors' claims, had been advised there was no way he could request repayment of the money.</p>

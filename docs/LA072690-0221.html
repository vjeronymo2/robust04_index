			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHILDREN'S THEATER REVIEW;  </P> <P> ACTION-PACKED 'ROBIN HOOD' HAS PAGEANTRY AND ROMANCE TO BOOT  </P> <P> A wronged youth seeks revenge against a repressive society and, with the help  of his vagabond band, rallies the locals to revolt, earns the devotion of his  countrymen and the love of a comely maid.  </P> <P> And get this: He's doing it in Irvine.  </P> <P> This weekend, legend's most romantic renegade swaggers onto the Irvine Valley  College campus in an open-air production of "The Adventures of Robin Hood," a  presentation of the Irvine Valley Theatrefaire for Children. Closing  performances of this family adventure are scheduled tonight through Saturday.  </P> <P> Director Blake Gould has given us a virile, swashbuckling "Robin Hood" filled  with pageantry, romance and action. The trumpets blast, the banners whip in the  evening breeze, the ladies swoon and, in several highly realistic clashes  staged by fight directors Bob Barnett and Christopher Villa, the good guys beat  the living daylights out of the baddies.  </P> <P> The show's creator, Paul Downey, provided a rough script to Gould, who  ultimately "fleshed it out" to include 30 colorful characters, from the witty  Friar Tuck to the diabolical Sir Guy of Gisbourne.  </P> <P> Gould has assembled a capable cast of local adults and high school students,  headed by 18-year-old Martin Noyes. A senior at Irvine High School who made his  Theatrefaire debut at 12 in "Treasure Island," Noyes gives us a swaggering,  passionate Robin, a fellow quick with the wisecracks and quicker still with a  bow and arrow. It's no surprise when the feisty Maid Marian (a fetching  Kathleen Simmons) decides to ditch the royal life to be at his side.  </P> <P> Terry Christopher is delightfully nasty as Sir Guy of Gisbourne, Prince John's  devilish henchman, and Mark Downie is valiant and true as Robin's right-hand  man Will Scarlett. Ron Sheehan as Friar Tuck and Tammy Calder as Mistress Bess  Quigley provide plenty of laughs throughout, and Jose Lambert is strong as King  Richard the Lion Heart (who, unfortunately for England and the audience,  doesn't appear until late in the show).  </P> <P> With the liberal use of live trees, rustic wood pieces and towering flats, set  designer Wally Huntoon manages to turn a somewhat bland college courtyard into  a variety of romantic settings, from a humble country village to the grand  chambers of Nottingham Castle to the most remote corners of Sherwood Forest.  </P> <P> Mary Ann Griego's costumes are rich in color and texture, especially the  studded leather jerkins worn by the sheriff of Nottingham and his men and the  coronation vestments of the bishop of Black Cannons. Eric Kerns' taped  accompaniment, which ranges from simple lute music to thunderous  orchestrations, is fine but tends to be overly loud during the fight scenes.  </P> <P> One other complaint. Theatrefaire organizers might consider selling a quieter  brand of munchies. Even the most imaginative theatergoer will have a hard time  transporting himself to Medieval England while his fellow patrons crunch potato  chips and crinkle popcorn bags. How about a nice leg o' mutton or a tankard of  ale instead?  </P> <P> Founded in 1982 by Gould and his wife, Charlene, Irvine Valley Theatrefaire  presents two family shows each summer on the campus of Irvine Valley College.  Earlier this month, they presented "The Everyday Adventures of Harriet  Handleman, Super Genius," an original work by local playwright Greg Atkins.  Next season's schedule will be expanded to include performances of "The Beauty  and the Beast" at the new Irvine Barclay Theatre in March.  </P> <P> 'THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD'  </P> <P> An Irvine Valley Theatrefaire production, adapted and directed by Blake Gould.

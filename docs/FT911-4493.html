			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / World Trade News: Hungary gets 'try harder' nod from Gatt - Report calls for better behaviour from its members in return HUNGARY still needs to make many changes to become an open economy offering predictable and stable trade conditions, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade says. However, in its first review of an eastern European country's trade policy, Gatt suggests that its members could behave better towards Hungary. Hungary badly needed more foreign capital and a 'supportive external environment' to push through its economic reforms and make its trade regime compatible with that of the west. Countries with convertible currencies had to lower barriers further to imports of Hungarian farm produce, steel, textiles, clothing and other consumer goods, the Gatt secretariat said in the report presented yesterday in the Gatt council. Hungarian agricultural exports, in particular, were facing serious difficulties in gaining access to markets in Europe and elsewhere. Not only were they running into trade barriers, they were also being hurt by massive export subsidies, which depress world market prices. Successive devaluations of the forint, coupled with plummeting demand for Hungarian exports among its former east bloc trading partners, have stimulated exports to the west. Hungary achieved a record surplus of almost Dollars 1bn in trade in convertible currencies last year. Nevertheless, with debt-servicing obligations that exceeded half the value of its convertible currency exports in 1989, only a further expansion of exports could underpin Hungary's ability to pursue the structural adjustment of its economy, says Gatt. Gatt it acknowledges that Hungary is becoming 'a more attractive place' for Gatt members to do business, but the secretariat remains critical of the pace of reform. Foreign businessmen's confidence could be boosted by swift privatisation and a clearer definition of the future role of state-owned enterprises, it suggests. State authorities still had wide discretion to introduce trade restrictions; criteria or guidelines for decisions by the authorities were either lacking or remained opaque. Administrative decisions could not be challenged before courts and no independent statutory body carried out a regular review of trade policy. In response Hungary told the Gatt council that the success of the privatisation process depended to a great extent on the inflow of foreign capital. Under the new constitution state enterprises were guaranteed the right to operate independently and only an overburdened legislative programme had prevented parliament from replacing outdated laws. Substantial liberalisation of imports appeared to have been achieved, Gatt said, but a wide range of products, including transport and telecommunications equipment, pharmaceuticals and consumer goods were still subject to licensing. Hungary maintained a global quota on imports of consumer goods from market economies. These import restrictions and relatively high tariffs weakened, if they did not prevent, competition in many areas of the economy. The simple average tariff at 16 per cent was higher than in most developed countries. The Hungarians say reductions in a large number of products introduced in February have cut the average tariff rate to 13 per cent. Levies and charges on imports other than tariffs were substantial, Gatt reported. They included a 2 per cent customs clearance fee on imports settled in convertible currency. A new import regime is being prepared for farm products. Export subsidies to Hungarian farm products totalled about Dollars 370m in 1990 and support will continue under the economic reform programme outlined in September. The Hungarians say there are no other subsidies and point out that, as a member of the Cairns group of farm-exporting countries, they have been pressing for worldwide cuts in farm subsidies in the Uruguay Round trade talks. Currency convertibility was a major concern to foreign traders in doing business with Hungary, Gatt commented. The Hungarians said that, after a further rise in prices this year, strengthened budget discipline and a liberal import policy were expected to slow inflation, stabilise the currency and provide a basis for making the forint convertible in 1994.</p>

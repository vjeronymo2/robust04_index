			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEYOND PIETER BOTHA, A DAY OF RECKONING?;  </P> <P> A WIDER WINDOW FOR CHANGE MAY OPEN IN THE DIRECTION OF SOCIAL JUSTICE  </P> <P> In the aftermath of President Pieter W. Botha's stroke in January and his  resignation Thursday as the leader of the ruling National Party, South Africans  are acclimatizing themselves to the prospect of having a new leader. And change  at the top could create a new atmosphere of opportunity.  </P> <P> Whites, the minority who hold power, are excited and expectant. A new leader  could mean, in their terms, important shifts in policy and life style -- even  touching on their survival.  </P> <P> For blacks, a new white leader, coming inevitably from the ranks of Afrikaner  nationalism and committed in one form or other to segregation, will be a  distinction without a difference. The security forces' rule over their lives  will be the continuing reality. Many in the outside world probably incline to  this view, too.  </P> <P> The truth, I think, lies somewhere between the perceptions of whites and  blacks. A new political situation could arise overnight. A South Africa without  Botha could be a more exciting place to live in, offering a wider window for  change -- in the direction of social justice.  </P> <P> Botha, 73, recuperating after what was termed a "mild" stroke, is near the end  of his rule. His resignation from the party leadership is the first step toward  total retirement. The race to succeed him is on. The narrow election of  Transvaal leader F. W. de Klerk as party leader in Botha's place makes him the  favorite to take over when Botha goes, though meanwhile he will be on trial.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, critical problems are building up -- like a new liberal clamor to  have the Group Areas Act, which enforces residential segregation, repealed in  view of a right-wing campaign to hound people of color out of homes bought or  rented in "white" areas in disregard of the law; the delicate, problem-ridden  path to independence in Namibia; the vital question of when to call a general  election, which by law must be held by March next year, and how to deal with  widespread allegations of official corruption. These problems have to be  tackled soon, and with resolution.  </P> <P> Botha's era has notched up some success in Africa. However hostile the world in  general has been, he has gotten on better with African countries than might  have been expected, resulting in a thriving but clandestine trade with many of  them. And he has brought Namibia to the brink of internationally supervised  independence, foreshadowing an end to the Angolan conflict.  </P> <P> Internally, his success has been more modest. He has drawn some mixed-blood  "colored" and Asian people into his new constitutional scheme for limited  power-sharing, and, at the time of his stroke, he was preparing a new attempt  to draw in blacks -- something always thwarted by the African National  Congress.  </P> <P> Botha's South Africa has been racked by racial unrest, which alternately  simmers and surfaces. Government repression has been greater than under any of  his predecessors. Black statelets sporting "independence," the government's  quid pro quo for denial of full-scale rights for blacks, have progressively  become rickety, corrupt, warring regions reminiscent of the worst parts of  Africa.  </P> <P> The South African economy has suffered double-digit inflation for more than a  dozen years, unemployment is high enough to threaten social peace, and a recent  Carnegie-backed study found a staggering degree of abject black poverty. This,  for a well-endowed country, is indictment.  </P> <P> As members of Parliament gather in Cape Town for the session that opens today  -- with Botha suddenly wrenched from their midst, though not far away taking  recuperative walks around his garden, there is much speculation about a  successor. He has held the reins of government so tightly that there is no  crown prince in the wings. His style has been highly "personal" -- presidential  rather than committee chairman.  </P> <P> Clearly, a new untested person will emerge who will have to form an early  alliance with the military if he wants to rule this almost ungovernable  country. The military could even take over, de facto if not de jure. Yet  military options have their limitations, as experience in South America and  elsewhere has shown. Sooner rather than later a new leader will face the  awesome choice: Either broaden the base of government by offering meaningful  rights to blacks or risk a full-scale race war.  </P> <P> The right-wing backlash to meaningful reform would be severe. The right could  even win a future general election. But that, too, could hasten the day of  change.  </P> <P> There are signs that the steam has gone out of white South Africa. The hegemony  of Afrikanerdom, so skillfully forged in the 1930s and '40s, has given way to  political division and class differences. Factors like Afrikaner urbanization  and the growth of Afrikaner business have cracked the monolith. The police and  army still guarantee white security, but the ideological self-confidence of  past years has declined. Few young whites can realistically look forward to  drawing pensions in a white-dominated South Africa.  </P> <P> Blacks, by their numbers and their labor (if not by guerrilla war), are showing  increasing clout. Despite repression and denial of rights, there is a  resilience and a determination to govern, with or without white cooperation.  </P> <P> Someone, sometime, somehow will have to break the news to white South Africans  that their elaborate system of patronage and privilege, backed by the security  forces, must give way to social and political justice for all.  </P> <P> Botha's moving from the scene could bring that day closer.  </P></p>

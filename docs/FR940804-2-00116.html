			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> A. K. Lawrence Kemp  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Mr. Kemp submitted a copy of an antitrust complaint that has been filed on behalf of Mr. Gianotti and GTV. The complaint alleges that KBL Sports Network, Inc. and the defendants have attempted to monopolize sports television programming of collegiate athletics for cable distribution in Western Pennsylvania by interfering with Mr. Gianotti's and GVT's exclusive rights to produce and distribute such programming. Among other allegations, the complaint alleges that defendants refused carriage of GTV programming as part of an attempt to monopolize. Mr. Kemp asserts that for the reasons alleged in the aforementioned complaint, he objects to the proposed Final Judgment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed Final Judgment does not directly address issues relating to competition among firms seeking television production and distribution rights for sports events. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  The Department has no basis for a general concern that the proposed transaction will lessen competition among firms competing for television rights for sports events. However, to the extent that defendants discriminate against non-affiliated programming in the selection, terms, or conditions of carriage, such conduct is encompassed within the proposed Final Judgment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The omission of this issue from the proposed Final Judgment, however, in no way signifies an opinion by the Department as to the merits of the GTV private lawsuit, nor does entry of the proposed Final Judgment in any way effect the private lawsuit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section IV(A) of the proposed Final Judgment enjoins defendants' cable systems and multichannel subscription television distributors (``MSTDs'') from discriminating against non-affiliated video programmers in the selection, terms, or conditions of carriage, where the effect of such conduct is unreasonably to restrain competition. This provision does not create an automatic right of access for any individual video programmer to any of defendants' individual MSTDs, nor is it intended to inhibit good faith negotiations between defendants and unaffiliated programmers regarding the terms and conditions of carriage. However, where the effect of discrimination by defendants is to restrain competition, such conduct is prohibited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, Section IV(C) extends the prohibitions set forth in Section IV(A) to prevent defendants from seeking or supporting, with respect to any MSTD in which defendants have any financial interest but do not control, conduct that would violate Section IV(A) if engaged in by defendants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By prohibiting conduct by defendants that might restrain competition in the provision of video programming, the Department believes that the anticompetitive effects of the proposed merger alleged in the Complaint will be fully remedied. The Department's view as to the sufficiency of this relief also rests on the existence of Sections 12 and 19 of the Cable Television Protection and Competition Act, Pub. L. 102&hyph;385, 106 Stat. 1460 (1992) (``1992 Cable Act''), and its implementing Federal Communications Commission (``FCC'') regulations, as well as the judgments recently entered in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Primestar Partners, L.P., et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> State of New York, et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Primestar Partners, L.P., et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  (``Primestar cases'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> No. 93 Civ. 3913 (S.D.N.Y.

GTE Service Corporation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> GTE supports the entry of the proposed Final Judgment but argues that its duration is too short. In addition, GTE expresses concern that the proposed Final Judgment would allow defendants to withdraw highly appealing programming from distribution_and specifically from competing systems_upon expiration of the proposed Final Judgment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GTE recommends (1) that the term of the existing provisions of the proposed Final Judgment be increased from five to seven years; and (2) that upon expiration of this seven year period, defendants should be restrained from withdrawing any programming from distribution in a particular market unless that market is found to be subject to ``effective competition'' within the meaning of Section 623(l)(1) of the 1992 Cable Act&sect; <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  or unless such programming is withdrawn from all markets, specifically including any and all systems in which defendants have an interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 47 U.S.C. 543(l)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Competitive Impact Statement,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the United States explains why it limited the term of the proposed Final Judgment to five years. The five year term reflects the United States' ``recognition that this industry is one that has experienced major changes in MSTD technologies that are on-going, and the effects of the 1992 Cable Act and its implementing FCC regulations.'' <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  The United States continues to believe that for this transaction in this industry, with changing technology, substantial new entry as well as recent and substantial government regulation, a term of five years is a sufficient period of time and is in the public interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> U.S.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> TCI, et al.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Competitive Impact Statement at 8.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The United States also believes that it is in the public interest not to place additional restrictions upon defendants after the expiration of the proposed Final Judgment. Federal antitrust laws as well as the 1992 Cable Act and its implementing FCC regulations should provide adequate protection against potential anticompetitive behavior in programming distribution upon expiration of the proposed Final Judgment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> C. Standard of Judicial Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The APPA requires that proposed consent judgments in antitrust cases brought by the United States are subject to a sixty-day comment period, after which the court shall determine whether entry of the proposed final judgment ``is in the public interest.'' In making that determination, the court may consider:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The competitive impact of such judgment, including termination of alleged violations, provisions for enforcement and modification, duration or relief sought, anticipated effects of alternative remedies actually considered, and any other considerations bearing upon the adequacy of such judgment;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

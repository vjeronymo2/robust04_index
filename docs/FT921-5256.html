			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Management: Silent enemy poised for attack / A look at the threat to Europe from the arrival of US warehouse clubs - Retailing The threat posed by US 'warehouse clubs' opening their vast sheds on the eastern side of the Atlantic has set the European retailing industry aquiver. The clubs, dubbed the 'silent enemy' in the US because of their devastating impact on traditional retailers, sell huge volumes of a narrow range of goods at deeply-discounted prices from low-cost, edge-of-town outlets, more than three times the size of the biggest grocery superstores in the UK. One of the leading warehouse clubs, Costco, which is 20 per cent owned by Carrefour, the French retailer, looks set to open two stores in the UK within the next 18 months. Others are rumoured to be keen to follow. In a study of the potential impact of the entry of these clubs into the UK, the team of retail analysts at Goldman Sachs, the US securities house, argues that they could turn 'the retail scene upside-down' within the decade. It suggests there is scope for 30 Costco-style warehouse clubs in the UK generating sales of Pounds 2bn within five to 10 years. This would make the company one of the dozen biggest retailers in Britain with a knock-on influence across the entire retail sector. 'The warehouse clubs are hugely-efficient channels of distribution which just strip cost out of every link in the supply chain,' says Paul Deacon, retailing analyst at Goldman Sachs, reminiscing fondly about the bargain price he paid for a canoe at one of the clubs. He suggests the clubs are able to minimise their costs by running rudimentary stores in cheap locations, maintaining tight levels of stock, keeping the wage bill low, having a cash-only payment policy, and limiting marketing and advertising expenditure. They run on gross margins of around 10 per cent, compared with the 25 per cent enjoyed by traditional supermarkets in the US. The clubs have a very high stock-turn (18.8 times a year at the industry-leading Price Club) and dispense entirely with costly central distribution networks. Such is the speed with which stock is pushed through the distribution channel that in many cases the retailer has sold the goods before paying for them. The goods for sale are carefully selected: they are almost all high-quality, top-of-the-range branded goods - about 60 per cent are non-food lines with 40 per cent food. Price Club sells 2,800 different lines, of which 2,000 are constant and the rest vary according to the season and what deals the company is able to negotiate. This 'treasure hunt' element gives the clubs considerable customer appeal. The clubs' customers pay an annual membership fee of about Dollars 25. Typically, two-thirds of members are business customers, such as small retailers and caterers, who use the clubs as a wholesale outlet; the remainder are everyday shoppers drawn in by the cheap prices. The value of the average transaction is very high at Dollars 160. The warehouse clubs have experienced explosive growth in the US over the past decade. The industry is dominated by five big and very successful players which account for Pounds 26.7bn of sales. Whether any of them can now transfer their trading formula to Europe, however, remains a matter of doubt. One of the crucial constraints may be the differing cost structures on each side of the Atlantic. In the US, site and building costs are relatively cheap; the higher cost structure of the European retailing industry may well wreck the economics of the pure warehouse club format. In the UK it may boil down to a matter of classification. Goldman Sachs estimates that if a club were to buy a 12-acre site with permission to open a retailing operation, it might cost Pounds 24m. A site on an old industrial estate open only to wholesalers might be just Pounds 3m. Such differences may lead to a hybrid form of warehouse club being introduced. The clubs may limit themselves to the wholesale market before later spreading into a retailing formula. Or they may restrict themselves to non-food lines and then later broaden into foods. But the UK wholesaling industry is dismissive of the potential threat and argues that local operators already fully satisfy the market. David Poole, managing director of Nurdin &amp; Peacock, the cash-and-carry operator which has an annual turnover of more than Pounds 1.3bn, says: 'Costco could not operate more efficiently than we do.' Alan Toft, director general of the Federation of Wholesale Distributors, which represents wholesalers in the food and drink industry, even goes so far as to say that 'there is no way that this form of discount warehouse can have any impact on wholesaling companies in the UK'. He argues that small retailers who traditionally patronise cash-and-carry outlets would not shop at clubs if they saw them as a competitive threat. 'Retailers over here would not be seen dead in a warehouse that serves both retailers and consumers. The people who should worry about it are Tesco and Sainsbury,' he says. That suggestion comes back to the question of whether warehouse clubs could generate an attractive return on the higher capital investment needed to run a full retail outlet. Jane Carmichael, partner at OC&amp;C, the management consultants, suggests it is only the relative costs that matter. 'All that is relevant is the differential cost between a Costco and a Sainsbury or a Woolworth,' she says. A host of cultural differences may also detract from the clubs' appeal. UK consumers have largely become accustomed to shopping in posh supermarkets offering up to 30,000 lines. Customers simply may not fancy shopping in shabby warehouses, nor buying big, inconvenient multi-packs of 12 tubes of toothpaste or crates of petfood. Such differences in cost, market structures and consumer preferences may well make the warehouse club formula untenable in Europe. But given the extraordinary popularity of this style of trading in the US, it would be unwise for European retailers to discount the threat entirely - nor underestimate their customers' hunger for bargains.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            INDUSTRY SALES GROWTH OF LEADING WAREHOUSE CLUBS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            1985                1988                1991          1985-91     Warehouses sales    Warehouses sales    Warehouses sales       CGR*          (dollars m)         (dollars m)         (dollars m)  (per cent)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sam's    23     777         105   3,829         205   9,600       52.0 Price    24   1,834          41   4,055          69   6,598       23.6 Costco   20     371          48   1,989          71   5,215       55.4 Pace     15     272          39   1,270          95   3,700       54.5 BJ's     11     154          22     817          35   1,550       46.9 Total    93   3,408         255  11,960         475  26,663       40.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Goldman Sachs                       *Compound growth rate  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Arts: It's comic time (again) on the Fringe - Antony Thorncroft checks out the Perrier short list but finds that wiser comedians come with more packaging / The Edinburgh Festival There is an awful lot of (awful) comedy infesting the Fringe this year which forced the poor Perrier judges, looking for the best comedian, to check out over 100 shows. They have come up with a short list of seven, one of whom receives on Saturday night a smallish cheque and, on past experience, a nice television contract. Corky and the Juice Pigs is a high energy Canadian comedy band. The rest are stand ups. Lee Evans is the Norman Wisdom of our age; Phil Kay is Scots and calls up strangers on the phone to pad out his act; Greg Proops is American and features in crisp commercials; Parrot is bleakly tough and naturally another Scot; Johnny Meres was once Johnny Immaterial; and Donna McPhail is not Scots but a woman and the likely winner. A lot of fuss, much of it from McPhail herself, has been made of the fact that she chose her Edinburgh show to come out as a lesbian, although she is quick to add 'I'm not a proper lesbian; I don't fancy KD Lang.' Sexuality forms a good chunk of her act at the Gilded Balloon (after all this is the Fringe) but then so do other favourite topics for routines, like women's changing rooms and long train journeys. McPhail is confident; masterful in a Head Girly sort of way; and funny. Asking 'Why 'Grease, the Musical'? Do we imagine it is 'Grease, the Lubricant'?' she adds, 'Still there are people prepared to pay to watch a ton of lard - it's called opera.' She also asks the perennial question: 'What do lesbians do in bed?' And answers it 'Try and get some sleep, but its difficult with so many people watching through the window.' The Perrier Award perpetuates stand-ups, but many comedians, and even more paying punters, have lost interest in anal fixated anecdotes about the performer's childhood, or oddball monologues about contact lenses and bodily fluids. The wiser comedians come up with some packaging these days. For Arthur Smith it is writing witty plays. His brilliant An Evening with Gary Lineker seems destined to haunt Edinburgh for ever. His latest, Sod, (at the Pleasance) will quickly disappear again underground. We are just not interested why Frank decides to bury himself in his back garden for four months. It is immaterial to the real play, which is Smith's memories, conveyed through Frank's ten year old son, of the summer holidays of childhood 'when it was always boiling hot and every pop song was a classic.' This is a sketch too far, with slight whimsical charm. Other comedians develop a character. Last year Graham Fellows turned up as John Shuttleworth, a former security guard at a Rotherham sweet factory who entertained the old folks on his Yamaha and was only too happy to pass on tips on a career in show business. Shuttleworth is now more rounded and much more pathetic. He somehow manages to re-incarnate John Major, the cabaret artist, if he had not stumbled on politics. There are more awful songs which become worryingly catchy, like 'Up and down like a bride's nightie', but the sadness of the eternal optimist who only has unemployment, a bored wife, and trips to Texas Home Stores to look forward to, is achingly conveyed. Shuttleworth captures the limited concerns of the common man and in spite of all the banality, is very sympathetic. And Fellows is very funny. The other favoured form of comedy is the sketch show, taken to extremes by Stewart Lee and Richard Herring in Lionel Nimrod's Inexplicable World. This is a case of comic regression. Most fringe performers spend the next year regurgitating their material on the radio; Lee and Herring's act has already been aired on Radio 4. They attempt to answer the Big Ones: do ghosts exist?; are monsters real?; and although they are as unstructured as student humorists they are extremely amusing, not least in the running gag on Herring's sexual inexperience. The climax, when Lee re-writes the Dead Sea Exercise Book, in which the future is ordained, is as nicely argued a piece of comic surrealism as you will find anywhere.</p>

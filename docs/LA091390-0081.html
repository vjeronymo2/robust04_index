			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANDIDATES FOR GOVERNOR SET 2 DEBATE DATES  </P> <P> Setting up events that could prove pivotal in their neck-and-neck race for  governor, Pete Wilson and Dianne Feinstein jointly announced Wednesday that  they will meet in televised debates twice next month.  </P> <P> In a press release issued by both campaigns, the candidates set Oct. 7 and 18  as debate dates. The first of the two hour-long sessions will be held in the  Burbank studios of television station KNBC, and the second in San Francisco at  KPIX, the CBS affiliate in the Bay Area.  </P> <P> In a break from what has become the expected debate format, the candidates said  that half of each session will be set aside for exchanges in which Democrat  Feinstein and Republican Wilson will question each other.  </P> <P> The other half of each debate will feature the candidates responding to  questions posed by a panel of reporters.  </P> <P> Representatives of the two campaigns have been engaged in quiet  behind-the-scenes negotiating sessions since August, apparently finding much  common ground even as Wilson and Feinstein bickered publicly over issues.  </P> <P> "Both sides met in good faith and both candidates desired to get this nailed  down with a minimum of trouble," said Wilson's campaign director, Otto Bos.  </P> <P> Feinstein's campaign director, Bill Carrick, said there were no substantial  disagreements.  </P> <P> "I think Dianne is going to feel comfortable and Wilson is a veteran debater,"  he said.  </P> <P> The two debates, which will be open to any subject, are expected to be the only  head-to-head sessions between the two, despite the avalanche of requests that  have buried each of the campaigns. Among other groups, the California League of  Conservation Voters has pressed the candidates to gather to discuss  environmental issues.  </P> <P> "I think this is about it, given the campaign schedules and other campaign  demands," Carrick said. Each session not only requires the candidates to  dedicate an hour to film the debate, but also generally requires them to study  briefing books for days ahead of time, cutting into the time they can give to  campaign events and fund-raisers.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Wilson had challenged Feinstein to debate him and set aside  Oct. 7 and 17 as potential dates. The first date was agreed to by Feinstein,  and the second was moved back a day to avoid conflicting with the televising of  the second game of the World Series.  </P> <P> The first debate, to be held on a Sunday at 6 p.m., will be sponsored by the  California Assn. of Broadcasters, which months ago offered to sponsor a  meeting. The second, an 8 p.m. Thursday session, will be sponsored by KPIX. The  panel of reporters will be picked from a pool submitted by both campaigns.  </P> <P> Carrick said the campaign representatives were unsuccessful in efforts to have  both of the debates -- rather than just the San Francisco event -- aired before  prime time viewing audiences.  </P> <P> "Our desire, the Feinstein campaign's desire, was to try to have debates which  would reach the largest number of Californians," he said.  </P> <P> Last May, Feinstein and her Democratic primary opponent, Atty. Gen. John K. Van  de Kamp, took part in two debates that were out-watched by virtually every  other television program on the air.  </P> <P> Part of the problem was that major Southern California stations chose not to  air the first debate, which was broadcast from San Francisco. And Northern  California stations generally did not air the second debate, which was beamed  from Southern California.  </P> <P> Both of the stations airing the upcoming debates have pledged to offer their  signal to other stations, but there is no firm indication whether viewers from  different areas will be able to watch both debates.  </P> <P> In another campaign development, the Wilson campaign on Wednesday began airing  another campaign commercial, this one a 30-second advertisement touting  Wilson's Senate record in support of legislation aiding so-called "crack  babies," the offspring of addicted mothers.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, Feb 15 (AFP)--China is to publish a  Dictionary of Deng Xiaoping Thought and Theory to help shed  light on the works of the country's 89-year-old patriarch, it  was reported Tuesday.    The dictionary, recently completed by the Shanghai  Publishing  House, includes technical terms, essays, theories and documents  on subjects ranging from philosophy to education, politics to  culture, economics to diplomacy, military affairs to technology,  the Beijing Evening News said.    It did not say whether the dictionary would include a  definition of the "socialist market economy." Officials have as  yet failed to come up with a meaningful explanation of the term,  coined by Deng to describe his vision for China's future and  enshrined last year in the constitution.    The news of the dictionary comes as concern grows over  Deng's  failing health after he looked frail, emaciated and dazed last  week in his first television appearance in a year.    The newspaper gave no date for the publication of the  dictionary.</p>

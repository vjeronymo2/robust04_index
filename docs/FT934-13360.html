			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Workers block runways in Tel Aviv jobs row THOUSANDS of angry workers from Israel Aircraft Industries, Israel's largest employer, blocked runways and disrupted flights at Tel Aviv international airport yesterday, in protest at government plans to lay off workers at the loss-making state-owned defence company, writes Julian Ozanne. Police said 5,000-6,000 workers shut the airport for three hours, stopping 13 outgoing flights and forcing three incoming aircraft to be diverted. The action was part of a campaign against plans to restructure IAI, which employs 17,320 people. The company makes military and civilian aircraft, radar systems, and medical and law-enforcement equipment, and is involved in the troubled Arrow anti-tactical ballistic missile project. It had a turnover of Dollars 1.57bn (Pounds 1.03bn) last year, mostly from exports, but posted a loss of Dollars 60m. A revised government recovery plan calls for a 4,000 cut in the workforce, and a 15 per cent cut in wages. Prime minister Yitzhak Rabin has warned workers that if the recovery plan is not carried out, IAI will collapse. The government, he said, was ready to invest in and subsidise IAI but only when it got back to work and introduced measures to boost efficiency and implement a recovery plan. The finance ministry says the government has already injected Sh750m (Pounds 172m) into IAI but the company has not responded by dismissing workers, cutting wages and increasing sales. The company says it only received a Dollars 100m state guarantee and Dollars 22.5m of government participation in retirement packages. Government officials have warned that continuing disruption of IAI could force the company into receivership.</p>

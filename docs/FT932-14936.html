			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / World Trade News: Nafta trio narrow gaps on side-pacts TALKS on side-accords for the proposed North American Free Trade Agreements showed signs of progress yesterday as differences appeared to narrow between the three countries - Mexico, Canada and the US. Mr Rufus Yerxa, chief US negotiator, confirmed that Washington was not pursuing an ambitious side-agreement on controlling import surges. The existing Nafta chapter on such safeguards would not be reopened. Instead, the US was looking for ways to improve consultation and procedures in the detection of surges. Likewise, Mr Yerxa seemingly confirmed recent reports that the US would not push for the establishment of special commissions with direct powers to penalise violators of labour and environmental laws. He said he thought there a 'distinction to be drawn between the powers that a supranational commission itself would have and the enforceability of commitments the three governments undertake to ensure enforcement of their laws.' The side-agreements on labour, the environment and import surges have been demanded by the Clinton administration before it submits Nafta, formally signed last December, to the US Congress. While the administration, under pressure from a Congress with doubts about Nafta, is committed to mechanisms that would enforce these agreements on labour and the environment, Mexico and Canada are concerned that such rules would violate their sovereignty and become tools of protectionism. Mr Yerxa said that the three sides had to 'overcome differences over what might be the best means to achieve the objectives' of the side-agreements - that was to protect the environment and labour rights in the North American economy. He left open the possibility that the three sides would not reach agreement.</p>

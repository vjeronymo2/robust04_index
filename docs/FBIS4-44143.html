			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Prosperity Party leader Necmettin Erbakan has  declared that Armenians should withdraw from occupied  Azerbaijani territory and pay compensation for their unjust  attacks against Azerbaijan. Azerbaijani Deputy Prime Minister  Abbas Abbasov, who is conducting contacts in Ankara, called on  Erbakan today.    In a statement during the meeting, Erbakan said he does not  approve of the Bishkek agreement and the arrival of Russian  troops and UN forces in the region. Erbakan claimed that the  United Nations is anti-Islam, as demonstrated recently in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Cyprus. If a peace force is established  in Azerbaijan against the Armenians, Erbakan noted, this force  must be comprised of Muslim countries; otherwise, Azerbaijan  will be subjected to double standards.    [Begin Erbakan recording] We believe Turkey is the key to  the prevention of all these unjust attacks. Turkey is a country  with a population of 60 million. It is the most important  country for the protection of peace in the Caucasus, in the  Balkans, and in the Middle East. Therefore, Turkey must begin  to pursue an independent policy that can protect the peace.  [end recording]    Abbasov, in his statement, said the support accorded to  Azerbaijan gives him great hope.</p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DISTRICT POWERS STOCK WEST ALL-STARS' ROSTER  </P> <P> Putting players from powerhouses Woodland Hills West and Newhall-Saugus on the  squad that will face the East team in today's American Legion District 20  all-star game is like staging an all-star broadcast battle between Reagan and  Scully: It just doesn't seem even.  </P> <P> But take it from a partial observer: It's still a tough call to make.  </P> <P> "The West may have more name recognition-type players," Newhall-Saugus Coach  Tom Pedersen said, "but there are some pretty good ballplayers in the East,  too."  </P> <P> Newhall-Saugus (17-5) and Woodland Hills West (21-3) own the best records in  the district and players from both are on what is a potentially explosive West  team. The starting time for the game at Birmingham High is 1 p.m.  </P> <P> "There's no real formula to it," District Commissioner Mel Swerdling said of  how rosters are filled. "I just try to get as much exposure for as many players  in the game as possible. It usually turns out pretty even."  </P> <P> Woodland Hills West sends pitchers Pat Treend and Lance Gibson and its infield  of Ryan McGuire (1B), Paul Geller (2B), Rick Banuelos (SS) and Del Marine (3B).  </P> <P> Newhall-Saugus sends George Lopata (1B), Corey Byars (3B), Brad Anderson (SS)  and Ben Ealy (OF).  </P> <P> Panorama City, champion of the Eastern Division, will be represented on the  East roster by five players: unbeaten right-handers Roland De La Maza (6-0) and  Dave Unter (5-0), and Joe Cascione (2B), Shane Wight (SS) and Dave Garcia (OF).  Sun Valley will be represented by the outfield trio of Shad Martinez, Herman  Murillo and John Campbell.  </P></p>

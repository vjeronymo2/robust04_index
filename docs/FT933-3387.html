			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Addicted to a miniature world - Ian Hamilton Fazey peers at Lilliput Lane's marketing methods AN unusual bus load of American holidaymakers has toured Britain this month, guided by an equally unusual travel courier. The Americans were members of the Lilliput Lane Collectors' Club; their courier was one of the artists who sculpts the miniature model houses they collect. Their quest for the original buildings and settings on which the models are based was typical of the marketing strategy of the company. Addiction is the key, says Mr John Russell, Lilliput Lane's chairman and chief executive. People become charmed and hooked - and start collecting: more than 10,000 people came to its Collectors' Club annual fair in North Yorkshire. Small but deliberate shortages of models, which range from Pounds 7.95 to Pounds 450, feed the growing habit. Model retirements are announced six months ahead of time, creating a final surge in demand. Second-hand prices often rise after production ends. Only 66 models were made of Cliburn School, for example. They now change hands among US collectors for up to Dollars 8,000. Cultivating collectors has helped bring the company from near-collapse three years ago to a planned stock market flotation in November. Mr David Tate, an artist and the company's technical director, had the original idea for the models and worked out how to mass produce them with no loss of intricate detail in the moulding process. The company started near Penrith in Cumbria in 1982 making hand-painted plaster miniatures of quaint cottages and other attractive buildings. It ran into trouble, however, when it borrowed heavily in 1987 to diversify into gnomes, dragons, and fine china art objects. It was turned round by a new management team under Mr Russell which stripped the company back to its original model business. Fresh finance came from Lazard Ventures, which had funded the diversification, and North of England Ventures. Mr Russell, who had learned his management and marketing skills with Burton in the 1970s and Courtaulds in 1980s, introduced better financial and quality controls to achieve substantial productivity and profit improvements. The business is labour intensive, with hand-painting each model being a critical cost. The 250 painters in the Penrith and Workington workshops can now can earn incentive payments for completing models to quality standards but ahead of target times. Control of unit costs goes right back to the basic design, where new models are sculpted in wax for moulding. They are designed with both painting time and final price in mind: a vicarage now in the prototype stage, for example, will take 7.5 minutes to paint and will retail for about Pounds 14. A Welsh lodge will take 33.5 minutes and will cost nearly Pounds 50 in the shops. With these and other disciplines in place, Lilliput Lane's sales have risen from Pounds 12.1m in the year ended September 1990 to Pounds 13.6m in the year ended January 1993. The company has swung from a loss of Pounds 1.02m to a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2m. Mr Russell hopes to develop his 'collectibles' strategy in other markets after flotation frees him from having 60 per cent of Lilliput Lane's shares held by venture capitalists, although NEV will keep a 5 per cent holding.</p>

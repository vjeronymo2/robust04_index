			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["They Should Not Suspect Will of Korean People" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 12 (KCNA) -- The United States is  now clamouring for "military attack" and "forestalling strike"  upon the nuclear facilities of the DPRK, Japan declared that it  would join the United States in its measure for sanction against  Korea and some officials of the Secretariat of the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] are insisting on the inspection of  two military objects. The anti-DPRK pressure campaign is being  escalated by the United States and its followers over the  nuclear issue in a bid to internationalize and politicize the  "nuclear issue" of the DPRK to put "pressure" and isolate and  stifle the DPRK socialism, says NODONG SINMUN in a signed  commentary today.    Never should it go unnoticed that the anti-DPRK moves of the  United States and its followers are all the more undisguised,  timing to coincide with the replacement of fuel rods in the  DPRK, the commentary notes, and goes on:    Fuel rods are being replaced, preserving the technical  possibility to make ad hoc inspection of the fuel rods at a time  when our unique status is removed.    We have done all we can in relation with the IAEA and the  United States to settle the nuclear issue of the Korean  peninsula. We could no longer overlook the anti-DPRK moves of  the United States and its followers. Therefore, we solemnly  made clear our stand of principle toward them.    Herein lies the meaning that if the United States takes the  road of strong-arm policy, our road to go would be changed and  we would be left with no other choice but to go over to the  continuous process of the peaceful nuclear activities.    This is neither an empty talk nor a threat. We have not told  an empty talk but practised what we once decided.    We are now carrying into practice our declaration that we  cannot stop the peaceful nuclear activities, even sustaining a  great economic loss and posing a great danger to technical  security. We did if we intended.    If the United States and its followers continue to resort to  the pressure row against the DPRK, ignoring our warnings, we  would have no other choice but to put into practice our stand.  The United States and the IAEA will be to blame for any  consequence.    The United States and its followers should not suspect the  will of our people.</p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSITION 141;  </P> <P> WARNING SIGNS  </P> <P> Toxic chemicals discharged into our drinking-water supplies are a serious  problem. Four years ago voters approved Proposition 65, which imposed stringent  regulations on the release of substances believed to cause cancer or birth  defects.  </P> <P> There was one hitch, though: The new rules only applied to the private sector  -- not to public agencies.  </P> <P> A yes on Proposition 141 would change that by extending certain requirements of  Proposition 65 -- The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 --  to federal, state and local government agencies and water systems serving the  public.  </P> <P> Under current law, not only is the private sector prohibited from releasing  chemicals into drinking water in concentrations known to cause cancer or birth  defects, it is also required to post warnings before exposing consumers and  employees to even trace amounts of such chemicals.  </P> <P> Proposition 141 would subject public agencies to the notification and civil  penalties rules. However, it provides certain exemptions to the drinking-water  requirement. Chemicals put into drinking water for public-health purposes, for  example, would be exempt. So would chemicals due to storm-water runoff or the  result of a public agency's response to an emergency, such as firefighting. The  measure would not apply to public sewage-treatment plants.  </P> <P> The cost of posting warnings could exceed $1 million beginning 1991, but water  is precious to our well-being. We should know what's in it. Public agencies are  here to serve the people, no less than business. We urge a yes vote.  </P></p>

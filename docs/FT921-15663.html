			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Chemicals output set to lift 2% CHEMICALS manufacturing will grow by 2 per cent this year but investment will continue to decline sharply, falling 6 per cent compared with 15 per cent last year, said Mr Richard Freeman, Imperial Chemical Industries' chief economist, yesterday. Any improvement in output will come after a stagnant 1991 and, with most of the gain expected in the second half of this year, is in line with forecasts for much of the rest of British manufacturing. Demand for chemicals will rise a little faster than GDP, accompanied by a 3 1/2 per cent growth in imports, compared with one per cent last year. Export growth will slow slightly from 3 1/2 per cent to 3 per cent, said Mr Freeman at the annual business outlook conference of the UK Chemical Industries Association. The UK's performance will be in line with that of the chemicals industry in the rest of Europe, in spite of a halving of demand for chemicals products in Germany. The star performer in the UK last year, for the second year running, was the pharmaceuticals sector. 'Without pharmaceuticals, chemical production in 1991 would have fallen by 2 per cent,' said Mr Freeman, who chairs the association's economic appraisal committee. Drugs output will grow by 4 per cent this year, he forecast. Fertiliser production will continue to fall, he said, but the forecast of a 1 per cent fall is still a sharp improvement on last year's decline of 9 per cent. Fertiliser production has fallen over a number of years. Sales depend on a number of factors outside market forces such as environmental pressures and the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy. UK production of inorganic chemicals will recover after last year's fall in volume of more than 10 per cent. This was exaggerated by the gradual abandonment of chlorofluorocarbons, the coolant used in refrigerators that is blamed for damaging the ozone layer. Production of CFC replacements had not yet taken up the shortfall and inorganic output will recover by only 2 per cent this year. Demand for organic chemicals was soft. Growth is expected to fall from 5 per cent last year to 2 per cent this year as rising exports offset some of the inroads made by imports. The association warned that some of the government statistics used were unreliable, and any revisions would probably be downward. It is seeking a meeting with the Central Statistical Office to discuss the matter.</p>

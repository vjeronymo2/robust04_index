			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD  </P> <P> The Raiders are America's team. They have sold out every road game this season.  Now, if they can just become Los Angeles' team. They haven't sold out the  Coliseum once this season. . . .  </P> <P> Pro Bowl voters no longer can ignore Raider defensive end Greg Townsend. . . .  </P> <P> The instant-replay snafus were bad enough, but did the officials really have to  call 14 penalties Monday night? . . .  </P> <P> I still would like to know why the surprise guest, Eric Dickerson, was on the  sidelines at the Silverdome. . . .  </P> <P> What terrific duels we enjoyed Sunday and Monday nights -- Dan Marino vs.  Randall Cunningham and Barry Sanders vs. Bo Jackson. . . .  </P> <P> Sanders and Houston's Lorenzo White are proving that there is a place for the  run in the run-and-shoot offense. . . .  </P> <P> Pro scouts rate the senior quarterbacks: 1 -- Dan McGwire, San Diego State; 2  -- Craig Erickson, Miami; 3 -- Bret Favre, Southern Mississippi; 4 -- Browning  Nagle, Louisville. . . .  </P> <P> First running back taken in the draft could be Iowa's Nick Bell. . . .  </P> <P> Of all the underclassmen who opted for the NFL draft, Mark Carrier is having  the most success. The Chicago Bears' safety from USC leads the league in  interceptions with eight. . . .  </P> <P> By now, you'd think football players would know not to retaliate after taking a  cheap shot. The counterpuncher always gets nailed with the penalty. . . .  </P> <P> Iowa will practice for the Rose Bowl at Cal State Long Beach, prompting George  Allen to say: "It's great to have them here. I started my coaching career in  Iowa at Morningside College, and I still feel close to all Iowa people." . . .  </P> <P> Reign Road could be the horse to watch coming out of the $1-million Futurity at  Hollywood Park. He dropped so far back that track announcer Michael Wrona lost  sight of him and then rallied to finish a close third. . . .  </P> <P> Thoroughbred racing lost a good friend in Marty Ritt, who owned horses and was  considered to be Hollywood's best handicapper. . . .  </P> <P> Thumbs up to NASCAR for changing pit-stop rules after the tragic accident this  year. . . .  </P> <P> A New York 200 for Indy cars is being proposed for the financial district of  Manhattan in July. . . .  </P> <P> Calvin Banks, meet Bret Johnson. . . .  </P> <P> USC's losing streak to Notre Dame in basketball is only three games, but that  extends back to 1961. In 1973, the Trojans had the misfortune to meet the Irish  on St. Patrick's Day in the National Invitation Tournament. . . .  </P> <P> What might be the best basketball rivalry going in the Southland -- the USC and  Cal State Long Beach women -- will be renewed tonight at the Sports Arena. . .  .  </P> <P> If you can't get enough of Traveler IV, he will appear in the Long Beach Ballet  Company's production of "The Nutcracker," beginning Dec. 14 at the Terrace  Theatre. . . .  </P> <P> Saturday's Nevada Las Vegas-Michigan State game, which will benefit Comic  Relief, already has sold out the 21,454-seat Palace in Auburn Hills, Mich. . .  .  </P> <P> Defending champion Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Lee Trevino, Chi Chi Rodriguez  and Gary Player make up the field for the Senior Skins Game Jan. 26-27 in  Hawaii. . . .  </P> <P> The "A Different World" episode Thursday at 8:30 p.m. on Channel 4 is based on  the Shoal Creek Country Club incident. It was written by producer Gary H.  Miller, an avid golfer. . . .  </P> <P> If you've never seen college hockey, try to catch the Great Western Freezeout  with top-ranked Minnesota, Boston College, Michigan State and Toronto at the  Forum Dec. 20-21. You'll like the fast pace. . . .  </P> <P> Bob Miller got his start in hockey announcing at the University of Wisconsin.  His color man at one time was Ira Fistell. . . .  </P> <P> The San Diego Gulls of the International Hockey League, who have Charlie Simmer  on their roster, are negotiating with another former King, Ron Duguay. . . .  </P> <P> Do you get the idea that the Dodgers don't want Juan Samuel to be their second  baseman next season? . . .  </P> <P> The San Diego Padres would like to trade for Kansas City Royal outfielder Danny  Tartabull. . . .  </P> <P> Promoter Don Chargin is planning a junior-lightweight unification match between  International Boxing Federation champion Tony Lopez and World Boxing Assn.  champion Brian Mitchell in March at Sacramento. . . .  </P> <P> Loreto Garza needed treatment on his neck after being bitten by Vinny Pazienza.  . . .  </P> <P> That Mike Tyson-Razor Ruddock fight is attractive enough without needing a  phony title attached to it by the World Boxing Council. . . .  </P> <P> The only man Tyson ever has ducked is Larry Merchant.  </P></p>

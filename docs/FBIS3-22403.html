			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "State of Radioactive Waste"] </F>   [Excerpts] Bratislava -- At its meeting yesterday, the  Government of the Slovak Republic discussed, and took note of,  the "Concept of Disposing of Radioactive Waste from Nuclear  Power Generating Facilities and Other Workplaces With Sources of  Ionizing Radiation." The document was submitted to the  government session by the Ministry of Economy of the Slovak  Republic. [passage omitted]    Radioactive waste is currently being stored on the premises  of individual nuclear power stations and the existing capacities  are about 50 percent full. Spent fuel is being stored in  storage pools of the wet type [skladovacie bazeny mokreho typu]  and, in the best possible case, existing storage capacities will  last until 1997.    Dominant among solid waste are a large quantity of  contaminated soil (1,900 cubic meters) and scrap metal (1,980  tonnes) stemming from the dismantling of some technical  installations. According to the Ministry of Economy document,  radioactive waste from nuclear power stations is being stored in  various storage systems that represent a fairly big risk from  the viewpoint of potential environmental impact.    The devices needed to handle, pack, and transport  radioactive  waste to the storage site have been secured. The long-term safe  storage of radioactive waste, however, including the storage and  definitive depositing of spent fuel, has not been secured so  far, the Ministry of Economy document states.</p>

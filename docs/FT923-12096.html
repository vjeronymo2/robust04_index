			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Protest over Asean move Portugal yesterday blocked approval of an EC negotiating mandate with the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) to protest against actions by Indonesia in the former Portuguese colony of East Timor, writes David Buchan in Brussels. Portugal has the sympathy, if not the support, of its fellow EC members. But UK officials said Lisbon's stance was possibly counter-productive, because the new EC-Asean accord which Britain, the current president of the EC, hopes to negotiate this autumn, would contain human rights provisions which do not exist in the current agreement.</p>

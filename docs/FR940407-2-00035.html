Fleischman, Spokane District Manager, Crescent Court, suite 500, 707 Main, Spokane, Washington 99201, (509) 353&hyph;3279.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The Administrative Record, available for public review, contains background on BPA's Billing Credits Policy and a Record of Decision for the Wauna Cogeneration Project and environmental considerations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> BPA is a self-financing power marketing agency with the United States Department of Energy. BPA was established by the Bonneville Project Act of 1937, 16 U.S.C. 832  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., to market wholesale power from Bonneville Dam and to construct power lines for the transmission of this power to load centers in the Northwest. BPA sells wholesale electric power and energy to 126 utilities, 13 direct service industrial customers and several government agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act (Northwest Power Act) directs BPA to serve the net power requirements of any electric utility requesting service, and to serve existing DSIs in the Pacific Northwest. 16 U.S.C. 839c(b)(1) and (d). Although BPA cannot own or construct electric generating facilities, the Northwest Power Act directs BPA to acquire rights to the output or capability of electric power resources to serve increased customer requirements. See 16 U.S.C. 839d(h). Billing Credits may be adjustments to customers' power bills or equivalent cash payments. Resources eligible for Billing Credits include conservation and generation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specific requirements for resources and the amount BPA can pay for these resources are outlined in the Northwest Power Act and BPA's Billing Credits Policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BPA's Billing Credits Policy interprets the Billing Credits provisions in the Northwest Power Act, prescribes criteria for customer and resource eligibility, and establishes procedures for granting Billing Credits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Description of the Generation Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> BPA proposes to issue the Billing Credits as a method to facilitate Project construction pending the issuance of a ruling by the Internal Revenue Service under section 9(f) of the Northwest Power Act relating to the portion of the Project's output that will be furnished to nongovernmental persons and the extent to which the private business use test of section 141(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, will be met. Upon issuance of a ruling favorable to EWEB, the Billing Credits will terminate in favor of a negotiated Power Purchase Agreement with similar terms and conditions for all parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This project meets the qualifications for Billing Credits, and BPA has completed its obligations under the National Environmental Policy Act. EWEB will comply with all applicable environmental requirements in the construction of the project and during the operation phase.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Methodology for Determining Generation Billing Credits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The payment for Billing Credits for EWEB will be calculated and paid monthly as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EWEB is a Computed Requirements Customer under its Power Sales Contract with BPA, the monthly Billing Credits will be the lesser of the Adjusted Alternative Cost or Net Cost multiplied by the monthly amounts of Assured Energy Capability of the Billing Credits Resource, less the amount of Priority Firm Rate dollars EWEB avoids paying as a result of the Billing Credits Resource. There is no annual true-up because EWEB is required to maintain the Assured Energy Capability for the Billing Credits Resource, as it must do for all its firm resources under the Power Sales Contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

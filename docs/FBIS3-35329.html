			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by </F> Amirah Hasan; place and date not given]    [Text] [Hasan] What role did Egypt, President Husni  Mubarak, and Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa play to bring about the  success of the agreement in Cairo?    [Rabin] President Mubarak and 'Amr Musa had an important and  special role in bringing about the success of the Cairo  agreement. They did not deny us the time or the effort. They  were partners in the talks and presented proposals for the  settlement. We accepted and adopted some of them. President  Mubarak, Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, the president's aides, and  Egypt had an important role. I like to personally thank them  and also to convey the Israeli Government's thanks.    [Hasan] What issues have remained outside of the Cairo  agreement?    [Rabin] First, we reached agreement on many points in Cairo.  I believe that this agreement represents a big step forward,  especially with regard to the implementation of the first stage  of the "Declaration of Principles" agreement, I mean the  "Gaza-Jericho" agreement. We agreed in Cairo on all disputed  issues, such as responsibility for external security, the  crossing points, management of the crossing points, and the size  and division of areas in the Gaza Strip.    As to Jericho, there is a map of the region. But 'Arafat has  the right to raise the issue of Jericho's size in the meeting  that will take place between me and him when we sum up all the  contents of the agreement.    On the other hand, other issues remain pending, such as the  problem of security for the Israelis and Palestinians on the  major roads in Gaza. There are also other issues mentioned in  the Declaration of Principles, such as joint projects and the  Palestinians' own projects near the Dead Sea in an area that we  will agree on.    As to religious issues, the Christian holy places in Jericho  will be under Palestinian authority. Jewish ones will remain  under Israeli authority. For the record, the Cairo agreement  did not discuss at all the establishment of the Palestinian  police, its size, or its mode of operation in Gaza together with  the Israeli police. For example, if an agreement is concluded,  there will be joint action between us and the Palestinian police  even on the major roads that will be built for the Israeli  settlements from Gush Qativ to Lintserim in the Gaza Strip.  There are also talks about the establishment of the first  centers for coordination between the Palestinian forces and the  Israeli forces, which will take care of security matters, the  formation of the Palestinian police and its size, and setting up  observation posts for ships and fishing. We are not against the  Palestinians having a number of ships for guard duty in the sea.  All the above issues have not been discussed yet and no  agreement has been reached on them so far.    As to civilian affairs, Gadi Zohar on the Israeli side and  Jamil al-Tarifi on the Palestinian side met in Taba to discuss  issues related to the transfer of authority from the Israeli  civil administration. This will start with electricity,  particularly as electricity in the Gaza Strip comes from Israel.  Water and communications issues were also discussed.    [Hasan] Are you interested in having economic relations  with the Palestinians?    [Rabin] My interest is focused on setting up a free economic  body between the two sides. Naturally, we must take into  consideration some of their reservations and some of our  reservations as well. However, this body must be one economic  entity before the world.    The Palestinian side wants its economic relations to be  linked more to the Arab countries. On our part, we have our own  views, such as supervising the Palestinian work in Israel.  There are issues that have not yet been agreed on, such as that  of currency. This is one of the demands submitted by the  countries that will be giving aid. It is not our demand.    In the past, the Arab countries gave financial aid to the  PLO. But today, the countries that will finance projects in the  area need to know about those projects. They also need to know  the various channels of the projects and to make sure that the  funds reach their targets.    The Palestinian authority must define the means through  which  the funds should arrive, such as the development bank. For  example, we get U.S. aid and we must present all receipts  showing how the funds were used because these countries need to  know for which projects the funds have been used. Israel will  not interfere in such matters between the Palestinians and the  countries contributing to the projects in the area.    [Hasan] Have the government of Israel and you personally  delineated the area of Jericho?    [Rabin] We signed a map today. With my consent, Shim'on  Peres sent a message to 'Arafat in which he said that the issue  of Jericho's area and 'Arafat's request to expand that area will  be discussed after summarizing the agreement's provisions. Our  stance is clear with regard to the map, but it is possible to  discuss ways of enlarging Jericho's area.    However, we are not currently discussing this issue. It will  be postponed until a meeting is held between myself and 'Arafat  before signing the agreement's provisions. During the Cairo  meeting, we agreed on many points, including the implementation  of the Gaza-Jericho accord.    [Hasan] Increasing the area of Jericho would make it easy  for  many Palestinians in the occupied territories, who view the  Cairo agreement as Palestinian concessions to Israeli security  demands, such as the Palestinian People's Party, which first  supported the Declaration of Principles but later joined the  opposition.    [Rabin] Even in Israel there is dissatisfaction over the  Cairo agreement. This is natural. There will always be people  who oppose any agreement containing a settlement. There was  indeed a settlement. When I present this settlement to the  [Knesset's] Foreign Affairs Committee, it will be criticized by  some members.    [Hasan] Will the Israeli Army withdraw by April, or is even  that date not sacred to you?    [Rabin] I do not want to procrastinate in the talks for one  day, but at the same time I do not want an agreement that ends  in failure. We have to remember that concluding an agreement  with an Arab state will always raise an argument about the  nature of peace. And after agreeing on this point, we will have  to work out an agreement about the borders because there can be  no agreement without border demarcation. Then come the security  arrangements and the normalization of relations. After an  agreement is concluded, it then becomes the responsibility of  all parties concerned, Arab and Israeli, to preserve this  agreement, as was the case with Egypt.    But with regard to the agreement with the Palestinians,  which  involves stages--the transitional period, the first stage of the  Declaration of Principles, and then the overall  agreement--things are more complicated. This is because we are  trying to achieve peaceful coexistence between two entities: a  Palestinian entity and the Israeli entity in the territories.  We must remember that the Israelis are spread all over the  territories and lead a daily life alongside the Palestinians.  There are tens of thousands of Palestinian and Israeli cars  that face each others everyday. If we do not create a clear-cut  understanding from the beginning, it will be difficult to  control this situation, which could doom the agreement from the  start. But if we want to prove that it is possible for us to  live side by side in peace under this agreement, despite all the  difficulties and opposition from the Palestinian and Israeli  sides, we must reach a clear-cut and accurate definition of all  details. Otherwise, the situation may explode at any time over  any small problem. For instance, if there is a road accident  involving a Palestinian car and an Israeli car, how should we  handle the matter and in which court? We have to find solutions  for all such small problems right from the start, or else we  will regret it and the agreement will fail. I emphasize my  desire to make the agreement work. It is better to delay its  implementation for one month until the positions for us and for  the Palestinians are clear and agreed on, particularly regarding  the matters that may cause things to explode. The real  discussion is not between myself and 'Arafat, and not even among  the senior officials, but between the Palestinian and Israeli  citizens in their daily lives.    [Hasan] Are you confident that Yasir 'Arafat will be able to  control things in the occupied territories?    [Rabin] We basically presume that the Palestinians will have  to do their jobs and play their role. We also believe that  'Arafat can control things. I will not appear to be helping him  in these things. We expect 'Arafat to live up to this  responsibility with the help of the Palestinian police. There  also will be some joint cooperation between us on some issues.  'Arafat is a full partner and he must play his role as we play  ours. With our cooperation, we will be successful.    [Hasan] How do you want the Palestinian police to be  structured?    [Rabin] This issue is still under discussion in the Taba  negotiations. I have just received the first working paper.  But I want calm negotiations between the two sides without the  media. Making statements to the media and being criticized will  impede the negotiations. Therefore, I will not go into details  with you about the size and number of the Palestinian police.  But I can say that the atmosphere that prevailed during the  negotiations was positive. The negotiators discussed all aspects  of the Palestinian police establishment with regard to its size,  number, authority, the stages of its deployment, and the  buildings that will be handed over so that it can organize  itself and assume its responsibilities.    [Hasan] What kind of cooperation will there be between you  and the Palestinian police?    [Rabin] First, each side will do its duty. For example,  there are a quarter of a million Palestinians in Gaza city who  have to respect law and order in the interest of the  Palestinians and prevent terrorist actions. On our part, we  will prevent the Israelis from taking any illegal actions. We  will give the Palestinian police all the areas where there are  Palestinians and all the refugee camps.    Regarding responsibility for international borders between  Egypt and the Gaza Strip in the Rafah area, we have delineated  these borders in such a way as to have the minimum level of  Palestinian population centers. The Palestinians there will be  in charge.    [Hasan] Are all the Israeli security demands included in the  Cairo agreement?    [Rabin] The most important thing is that we reached an  agreement. We want to make progress in implementing the  Gaza-Jericho agreement.    [Hasan] The situation in the occupied territories is  deteriorating. There are daily killings and repression at the  hands of the army and the reaction of those opposed to the  agreement increases when Israelis are killed. Why, then, the  delay in implementing the agreement?    [Rabin] Let us first clarify who is carrying out these  operations. They are the Palestinians opposed to the agreement,  such as Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], Islamic Jihad, some  of the opposition Palestinian elements, and some of the Fatah  Hawks who refuse to obey the orders coming from Tunis. They  will continue their operations because they are opposed to the  agreement. Therefore, we should take care to make the agreement  clearer. If we do not clarify matters further, the operations  will continue without control and the situation will blow up one  day. Don't believe that Israel is not subjected to danger; it  is subjected to danger just like the PLO until calm prevails. I  am not asking the PLO to shoulder the responsibility for actions  carried out by the opposition elements in the area. But when  the PLO assumes responsibility in an organized way, then I will  ask it to shoulder full responsibility as it says in the  agreement.    [Hasan] Regarding Fatah's Hawks, the reason they joined  Hamas  and Islamic Jihad is the army's repression against them,  especially after some of them had surrendered their weapons to  the army. But the army continued to chase and even assassinate  them.    [Rabin] I don't want to go into the details. They, too, are  being pursued more by Palestinians than by Israelis. This is an  internal struggle. I believe that the current stage will see  several struggles in the area. Israel remains responsible for  dealing with this situation until the Palestinian police  officers are deployed. Then it will become responsible for  maintaining law and stability in Gaza.    [Hasan] Will the army continue to pursue the wanted  Palestinians?    [Rabin] There are some wanted people who stopped their  activity after 13 September 1993. Scores of them have returned  to their homes. Unfortunately, Abu-Rish, a wanted Palestinian,  was killed by mistake but the rest are unharmed. I am sorry for  what happened to Abu-Rish. Those who continued the acts of  violence after 13 September will be treated in the same way as  those who oppose the agreement and who practice terrorism.    [Hasan] Are you and your government concerned about opening  the door to dialogue with Hamas and if so on what conditions?    [Rabin] I am prepared to hold a dialogue with any party that  is ready to join and back the agreement on the Declaration of  Principles and that abstains from undertaking terrorist  operations.    [Hasan] Are you trying put out feelers to Hamas?    [Rabin] There are no attempts to put out feelers, because  Hamas' positions are known and categorical. Not even the PLO  has succeeded in holding talks with Hamas.    [Hasan] Could the release of Shaykh Ahmad Yasin help turn  over a new leaf with Hamas and make things easier for the PLO?    [Rabin] I don't think so. But if Shaykh Ahmad Yasin changes  his positions, supports the agreement, and calls for a halt to  terrorism, the issue could be discussed. Shaykh Yasin's  position is the opposite of this.    [Hasan] Will all the Palestinian detainees be released,  especially now that we are in the month of Ramadan and since  this issue is of interest to every Palestinian?    [Rabin] I repeat: The release of all or some of the  detainees is part of the negotiations to implement the agreement  on the Declaration of Principles. Some of them have committed  murder. I do not want to get into details now.    [Hasan] Do you link their release with progress in the  talks?    [Rabin] Yes of course.    [Hasan] Your position has changed in this regard. Why?    [Rabin] It has always been my personal position to link the  release of detainees with progress in the talks and with another  demand we want the Palestinians to meet, that is, providing  information on the Israeli soldiers who went missing in the  Sultan Ya'qub battles of July 1982.    [Hasan] Are you first awaiting an answer regarding the  Israeli soldiers?    [Rabin] The release of detainees depends on the issue of the  missing soldiers. What we are being asked to do is to release  detainees who were locked up 10 years ago. If we are discussing  events of 10 years ago, then it's mutual.    [Hasan] How many Palestinian detainees are in Israeli jails?    [Rabin] Approximately 9,000. Every month, some of them are  released while some others are detained.    [Hasan] Will their release make 'Arafat's job and that of  the  supporters of the peace process in the territories easier?    [Rabin] It might make things easier but at the same time it  would step up the terrorism undertaken today by Palestinians. I  do not encourage terrorism. I will release no one who has been  involved in terrorism because he will go back and do it again.  Some Hamas people who returned from the Marj al-Zuhur area [in  south Lebanon] have been detained again.    [Hasan] The deportation and then repatriation of 415 Hamas  members enhanced their position. Were you wrong to deport them  and has the age of deportation ended?    [Rabin] I think Hamas was on a path toward enhancing its  position over the past two years. Today they carry the  opposition banner, even though they are not the only ones  opposed to the agreement. The deportation constituted a blow  that weakened them. But there will always be new cells. If we  fail to reach an agreement and the PLO and the Palestinian  police do not get to the territories, things won't be clear. I  believe in our partner's ability to preserve law and order in  the areas that will fall under its control.    [Hasan] Will you repeat the closure of the occupied  Palestinian territories, particularly Gaza?    [Rabin] I support enforcing the closure despite the presence  of 50,000 Palestinian workers, 20,000 from Gaza, who work in  Israel. This number does not include businessmen and doctors. I  believe the economy will deteriorate if Gaza is closed. But if  operations persist inside Israel, I will reconsider the issue.  I do not want to have to close the Gaza Strip. But if  terrorism directed at Israelis continues, I regret to say that  my primary responsibility is to protect Israel's security.    [Hasan] Why do you link the issue of the Palestinian agents  with the release of Palestinian detainees and prisoners?    [Rabin] Of course I link the two things because those who  cooperated with us are entitled to the same privileges that will  be granted to those who tried to harm Israel.    [Hasan] It is the custom to try those people who cooperate  with the occupation against their own people. Why should the  fate of an agent be linked with that of a struggler who fought  the occupation?    [Rabin] People who conducted terrorist operations were tried  everywhere.    [Hasan] Are you talking about agents who betrayed their  people and cooperated with the occupier?    [Rabin] They did not betray their people. An agent is a  person who opposes terrorism.    [Hasan] Is Israel willing to absorb these agents?    [Rabin] We are willing to take whoever wishes it.    [Hasan] You recognized the existence of a Palestinian  entity,  a Palestinian flag, and a Palestinian anthem. Why then do you  object to the establishment of a state?    [Rabin] The others are no symbol of sovereignty. There are  many such entities around the world but none of them is a state.  There are far more Kurds than Palestinians. Are Iraq and Turkey  willing to recognize them as a state? Our target today is to  implement what we agreed upon at the Madrid peace conference  during the first transitional period. A timetable took shape in  the Declaration of Principles prepared in Oslo and signed in  Washington. This timetable applies to a period no later than two  years from the implementation of the comprehensive  agreement--Gaza-Jericho First. Then we will begin negotiations  on the final solution.    [Hasan] Can the duration of the self-rule and the  transitional period be shortened if peace and order prevail in  the region? And will you abstain from objecting to the  establishment of a Palestinian state in that case?    [Rabin] Right now I adhere to the Labor Party positions,  which oppose the establishment of an independent Palestinian  state.    We maintain this stance. But we did not object to the  integration of the Palestinian entity with Jordan.    [Hasan] Do you support a Palestinian-Israeli confederation?    [Rabin] I support all proposals for Israeli-Palestinian  cooperation. When we reach an agreement and succeed, many  possibilities not proposed today will be available.    [Hasan] The main issues for negotiation, such as the [1948]  refugees, Jerusalem, the settlements, the 1967 refugees, and  water, have not yet been practically discussed. How will these  problems be solved?    [Rabin] Why should I discuss special scenarios when we  already have one that is agreed upon? I am against the  Palestinians' right to repatriation. I want to tell you that  you are posing questions that I prefer are not posed. My  position is clear: Why should we discuss subjects we agreed  with the PLO not to discuss now? We are not trying today to  solve problems that have existed for 100 years. Let us begin  with the transitional period, which has never before been  offered to the Palestinians. Israel gave the Palestinians this  solution, which is only interim, not final. We are not against  the Palestinians proposing the shape of the final solution but  we tell them to begin with the first step, a chance they have  never been offered before. Why, when between 1949 and 1967 the  West Bank was under the control of Jordan and Gaza under Egypt,  wasn't a Palestinian state established? The West Bank, Gaza,  and east Jerusalem were under Arab rule. Did Israel prevent the  establishment of a Palestinian state then? As for Jerusalem, it  must remain united and under Israeli sovereignty.    [Hasan] Were you wrong to start building settlements in  1967?    [Rabin] There are settlements. We as a Labor Party opposed  their establishment, while others supported it. This is a fact.  The agreement with the PLO deals with the interim period, during  which all the settlements will remain.    [Hasan] Why have you not met President al-Asad?    [Rabin] That's not up to me. President al-Asad opposes not  only such a meeting, but also contacts between the foreign  ministers. Syria prevents direct contacts between us. Syria is  making a grave mistake. I do not expect President al-Asad to do  what President al-Sadat did and visit Jerusalem but it is  difficult to convince the Israeli people that Syria is  interested in peace when, at the same time, it is not prepared  for high-level meetings. Syria is making no confidence-building  statements. For example, Knesset member 'Abd-al-Wahhab  Darawshah sought permission to travel to Syria along with a  small delegation of Israeli Arabs to extend condolences to  President al-Asad on his son's death but the request was turned  down. This is not a confidence-building step. The Syrian  Government and President al-Asad showed no readiness for peace.    [Hasan] Will you approve the return of poet Mahmud Darwish  and 'Arafat's adviser 'Ammar Shattur to Israel?    [Rabin] I have received no official request in this regard;  I  know nothing about this. When I receive a request, I will  discuss it.    [Hasan] Have Israel's relations with the Arab world improved  since the Oslo agreement?    [Rabin] No doubt there is a new atmosphere and there are  meetings. I believe that in the next few months the  multilateral working groups will meet in Oman, Qatar, and  Tunisia. Who would have thought before the signing of the  Declaration of Principles with the PLO on 13 September 1993 that  we would go to those countries and meet representatives of Arab  states that have no relations with Israel to discuss building a  regional peace? I think this is an important change and there  is a general change in the Arab world.    [Hasan] Will your government bring about a just and  comprehensive peace with the Arab world?    [Rabin] This is our objective. Within the framework of the  Madrid conference, we called for a comprehensive peace with  Israel's neighbors in addition to Egypt and the Palestinians. I  believe that if progress is achieved with Syria, which is  changing its way and method for peace [as published], that will  boost the peace with Arab countries that have no border with  Israel, such as Tunisia, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states,  and Lebanon [as published]. But it is hard to imagine that  Libya and Iraq will accept such a step.</p>

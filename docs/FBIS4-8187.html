			<p>BFN     [Text] Obrenovac, 11 Apr (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, the  president of the Srpska republic assembly, said today that the  bombing of Gorazde was a great blow to peace, which was within  reach.    We are not ruling out fresh strikes, but if there are any,  we  will take certain political and military steps, Krajisnik said.    However, we cannot abandon Gorazde because before the war 35  percent of its residents were Serbs. We cannot watch and do  nothing while the Muslims are constantly mounting provocations  from all three protected areas. This is what happened this time  as well. The world should know that this area will never be calm  unless the causes of the conflict are removed; and they lie in  the Muslim violations of the agreement on protected areas.    Answering a question by a Radio Obrenovac [in Serbia]  journalist, of whether yesterday's events will influence  diplomatic activity and postpone the negotiations, Krajisnik  said: We cannot remain indifferent to what the Muslims are  trying to do, but despite everything, we have not closed the  door on negotiations and on establishing peace.</p>

At the conclusion of the  bilateral meeting between both nations, their foreign ministers  pointed out that "as of today, the process to influence the U.S.  decision to lift the blockade," in the short term, "could be  initiated."    At the meeting chaired by Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello and  his Canadian colleague, Andre Quellet, the latter expressed his  government's interest in the Chiapas incidents -- particularly  those that have to do with human rights -- and the process of  political and electoral democratization. He also said: "Canada  has always been interested in these matters, as a friend, and  following the initiation of NAFTA, we are also interested as  partners."    Quellet had the opportunity to discuss both issues during  the  meeting as well as at an afternoon meeting with President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari at Los Pinos. There he manifested his  acknowledgement of the open and peaceful manner in which the  Mexican Government has handled such a difficult problem while he  "encouraged" the Mexican authorities to "continue on the road of  negotiations already started."    At the conclusion of the meeting -- which included five  members of the Canadian Cabinet, as well as Carlos Hank Gonzalez  and Emilio Gamboa Patron, secretaries of agriculture and  hydraulic resources and of communications and transportation,  respectively -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretian's visit  was announced for 23-25 March. This will be the first bilateral  visit by that official to a nation in the Western Hemisphere  since he took office several months ago.    Tello announced at the start of the meeting that the  political geography of our region has determined that Mexico and  Canada pass from the category of "distant friends" to "strategic  partners." Together with the United States, he indicated, we  will form the most important economy and trade area in the world.    During a news conference both foreign ministers took up the  Cuban issue. The Canadian said, we think that the situation on  the island is more difficult every day for the people who no  longer receive aid from the former Soviet Union or from the  former socialist bloc nations. Mexico and Canada, Quellet  added, continue their cooperation in the health sector and in  food supply to help mitigate the situation as much as possible.  In our opinion, however, the trade blockade must be solved by  the United States.    Quellet emphasized that both nations have maintained their  ties with Cuba and "the time has come" for that nation's  rapprochement with the United States. He gave as an example  that "former enemies" such as Washington and Moscow have  overcome their problems and now their relations are on another  level. He remarked that the same way the United States "turned  around" the Vietnam problem and they normalized their relations  with China, it is now also time to lift the economic blockade of  Cuba.    Tello indicated that only Canada and Mexico have maintained  relations with the Caribbean nation after it was ousted from the  OAS while both nations have voted at international forums in  favor of ending the embargo against Havana.    Canada and Mexico, Tello stressed, do not accept that a  third  nation regulate the manner in which they realize their trade  relations. Tello was asked: "Some nations speak out in favor of  Cuba but they condition it to its `democratization.' What is  your opinion?" "We do not condition our position on anything,"  Tello replied.    Meanwhile, the Canadian minister made official his country  and Mexico's support for Colombian President Cesar Gaviria's  candidacy as OAS general secretary.    During his speech delivered in the morning, Quellet  explained  that his nation's main foreign policy goals are to consolidate  and strengthen democracy and to protect human rights. On these  issues, he remarked he was greatly impressed by the Mexican  Government's efforts to guarantee credibility and transparency  in the August presidential elections.    With regard to the human rights issue, Quellet said he had  met with the Jorge Madrazo Cuellar, president of the National  Human Rights Commission [CNDH], with whom he discussed the  Chiapas problem. Madrazo Cuellar handed over the report the  Commission recently published on the incidents in Chiapas.  Quellet said: It is a very thorough report which we will  widely disseminate in Canada. In addition, he announced that  the CNDH president had been officially invited to visit his  country shortly.    Among the agreements reached in this 10th Bilateral  Mexico-Canada Meeting, stand out the signing of three memoranda  between Mexico's Secretariat of Communications and  Transportation and Canada's Transportation Ministry with regard  to trailer trucks border access, the mutual acceptance of  federal driver's license, and of technical training.    The participants reconfirmed the importance of strengthening  this mechanism of consultation and analysis that allows -- in an  overall fashion -- the taking up of the main issues on the  bilateral agenda while they agreed to meet in Canada next year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by David Brown: "EC Farm Policy `Strangling New </F> Democracies'"]    [Text] Protectionist EC farm policy is stifling the infant  democracies of East Europe and threatening the stability of the  West, according to a report published today by the House of  Lords.    Radical reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy are needed  to prevent "economic decline and political instability" in  Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and  Romania -- the six Central East European countries -- it says.    The report, resulting from a five-month investigation by the  all-party Lords Committee on the European Communities,  concludes: "Unless the Community puts agricultural trade on a  pan-European footing not only will these countries' efforts to  join the Community be frustrated but their very exclusion will  jeopardise stability in West Europe."    The failure of trade agreements to open up EC markets to  greater amounts of agricultural produce from the six had led to  "growing disillusionment with the political reform process."    The committee found "disturbing patterns" in the working of  these agreements which resulted in a balance of trade moving in  favour of the EC.    In many cases subsidised EC food was competing for sales in  the poorer East European markets while the EC was offering very  few concessions in return.    All this was happening at a time when agriculture  represented  a key share of national income. "Without the much needed  foreign currency that agricultural trade can bring them, their  economies will decline," the report says.    "Both in Hungary and Poland, the first to begin dismantling  their centrally planned economies, the backlash is now evident.  Influential farming lobbies, now represented in government, are  now demanding more protection: a direct response to the  Community's own restrictive policies. Efforts to meet these  demands could bankrupt their economies."    While the EC had declared a year ago that these countries  could join the Community when they satisfied the necessary  political and economic conditions, "the trade agreements have  not been altered to reflect this new objective," the report says.    "There is a dichotomy at Community level between the  political desire to enlarge the Community and the resistance of  EC agricultural interests to will the means," it says. The  Common Agricultural Policy is, it claims, the biggest obstacle  to the six joining the EC.    The National Farmers' Union said that some sectors of  British  agriculture would be "alarmed" by the report. While the  political arguments were understandable it had to be remembered  that the horticulture industry in particular was already  suffering heavily from cheaper imports.</p>

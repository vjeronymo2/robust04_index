Today, the  State Environmental Protection Bureau set up a Chang Jiang and  Three Gorges ecological environment monitoring network in  Chongqing in order to more intensively and effectively monitor  and manage the ecological environment along the Chang Jiang and  in the Three Gorges area.    Wang Yangzu, deputy director of the State Environmental  Protection Bureau, said at today's inauguration meeting that the  establishment of such a monitoring network is a major step  toward increasing and intensifying environmental monitoring in  the Chang Jiang valley as a whole. The network will enable us  to closely trace the ecological and environmental changes in the  Chang Jiang valley while the Three Gorges project is under  construction and after it has been completed and put into  operation. It will promote the implementation of the measures  for preventing ecological destruction and environmental  pollution and will promote the restoration of the benign  ecological environment.    At present, China's environmental protection institutions  have set up more than 150 environmental monitoring stations  along the trunk stream and tributaries of the Chang Jiang to  monitor the atmospheric quality, acid rain levels, water  quality, soil quality, and biological and ecological conditions.  The Chang Jiang and Three Gorges ecological environment  monitoring network will be developed on the basis of these  existing monitoring stations. The first group of members of the  network will be composed of 25 environmental monitoring stations  in Chongqing, Yichang, Wuhan, and Shanghai.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 27 (CNA) -- Nearly 60 percent of  Taiwan-owned companies in Mainland China have made profits,  according to a recent government survey.    The survey also found more than half of production  technologies, machinery and raw materials needed by those firms  have come from Taiwan and their product distribution channels  are still controlled by their Taiwan parent companies.    The survey was conducted by several local industry  associations at the request of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.  The questionnaires were distributed to 2,800 Mainland  China-based Taiwan companies which have legally registered with  the ministry's investment commission. About 410 valid replies  were collected.    Thirty-one percent of the respondents publicly admitted that  they have earned money from their mainland ventures; 26 percent  said their mainland ventures have managed to make ends meet;  39.1 percent said their mainland ventures have lost money.    The industry associations responsible for taking the survey  said local businessmen are usually reserved in recorting their  profitability in Mainland China. Many of those who said their  mainland ventures can just break even have admitted in private  that they have made small profits from their mainland  subsidiaries.    The associations have thus concluded that nearly 60 percent  of Taiwan investors have made profits from their mainland  ventures.    As high as 70 percent of the respondents said they believe  the Mainland Chinese market will be further liberalized  following Beijing's economic reforms; 15 percent said they  expect the mainland market situation will remain almost the same  in the next few years; less than 10 percent said the mainland  market will be further tightened.    The survey found most respondents are optimistic about their  business prospects on the mainland, with 58 percent believing  their mainland ventures will make profits in the coming year, 25  percent saying they will be able to break even, and only 15  percent saying they may lose money.    The survey also showed 33 percent plan to expand their  mainland operations in the coming year.    Only 5.81 percent said they have shipped back to Taiwan  products manufactured by their mainland plants, but they  stressed that most of those items are semi-finished goods.  About 58.4 percent said their mainland-produced goods are  mainly for exports to other countries, and 35.79 percent said  their products are sold in mainland markets.    Major export markets for mainland-based Taiwan firms include  the United States (30 percent), Japan (20 percent), Europe (17  percent) and southeast Asia (16 percent), according to the  survey.    More than 50 percent said they have remitted their earnings  back to Taiwan while 28 percent said they have used such  earnings for expanding their mainland operations.    The survey was completed in early April. The government did  not immediately make public the results because of the Qiandao  Lake travel disaster in which 24 Taiwan tourists were robbed and  murdered. With cross-strait exchanges gradually resuming, the  survey results will be released in the near future, government  sources said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From BTA's 9 March "Press Review"] </F>   [Excerpt] Sofia, March 9 (BTA) -- Prime Minister Lyuben  Berov's heart attack yesterday and his hospitalization is in the  highlights of today's press. Along with reports on his sickness,  the papers run comments and forecasts on the turn of political  events in this country. According to NOVINAR, the prime  minister felt bad as early as Monday [7 March]; the initial  diagnosis was acute heart insufficiency; a cardiac infarction  followed. 24 CHASA says Prof. Milan Petrov, boss of the  Military Medical Academy, denied this report. According to him,  the premier had only a minor heart attack, yet he declined to  specify if Berov's life was out of danger. According to  KONTINENT, Prof. Petrov did not deny "the rumour spreading in  Sofia of an infarction". Recent exhaustion and pressure are  seen as a cause of the heart failure, says DUMA. KONTINENT and  NOVINAR link Berov's heart attack to a stormy cabinet meeting  Monday, and more specifically to a quarrel between Deputy Prime  Ministers Matinchev and Karabashev on privatization of the  tourist industry. 24 CHASA says the Prime Minister's sickness  had nothing to do with "emotional pressure" as a result of that  meeting, observing that Berov had had heart problems earlier.  DUMA and TRUD specify the premier has already had two heart  attacks. According to unofficial forecasts, the prime minister  will be away on sick leave for at least two months, says 24  CHASA.    "Berov Sick, Matinchev at Helm", says the headline of the  leader in "TRUD. [sentence as received] The paper cites a prime  minister order authorizing deputy prime minister to stand in for  him. Evgeni Matinchev is a representative of the ethnic Turks'  Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) which had a decisive role  in voting in the Berov government. This would force Deputy Prime  Minister Valentin Karabashev into resigning, predicts NOVINAR,  adding the cabinet row on privatization would lead to its  downfall. In a brief statement on national radio this morning,  Karabashev denied rumours of his upcoming resignation, saying  the prime minister did nothing out of the way by asking one of  his deputies to stand in for him during his sick leave. Small  wonder if the long and forcibly forestalled cabinet crisis sets  in, says a signed comment in STANDART NEWS. Leaders of DPS and  the anti-communist Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) are alarmed  about a likely complication of the political situation in case  of inability by Berov to lead the cabinet, says DUMA.  DEMOKRATSIYA says leaders of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP)  yesterday met with Deputy Prime Minister Matinchev. They,  however, said they did not discuss implications of the premier's  illness. The paper quotes Yanaki Stoilov MP of BSP as saying it  was accidental that Socialists yesterday discussed the  pre-election situation and the need for passing a new election  law and a regional and urban planning law. KONTINENT writes that  DPS will take a final stand on the Berov cabinet at an  extraordinary meeting on March 18. In the days to March 18, it  will try to find a solution to the tobacco harvest purchasing  issue, hand in hand with the cabinet. [passage omitted]</p>

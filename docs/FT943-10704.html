			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / International Bonds: Abbey National lifts offering on a quiet day A brisk flow of mainly small offerings in the eurobond market yesterday failed to stimulate much buying interest. However, the recent tightening of yield spreads in the secondary market boosted interest in the latest eurolira offering, a L300bn three-year deal for Abbey National Treasury Services, increased from an initial L150bn. Because eurobonds have lagged the sharp falls in Italian government bond prices, many are now trading at 50-80 basis points below Libor in the secondary market. The new Abbey deal, priced to yield the equivalent of five basis points below Libor, appeared attractive relative to secondary Abbey paper trading at 50 basis points below Libor. However, if the underlying market rallies it is likely that secondary market spreads will widen. In the D-Mark sector, the European Investment Bank launched a DM750m six-year deal via Dresdner Bank, designed to avoid the overcrowded five-year area, where several recent deals have failed to clear. The pricing of the deal, to yield one basis point less than German government bonds and five basis points less than German domestic bonds, discouraged participation by domestic investors. However, international accounts also look at spreads relative to Libor, and the spread of 7 basis points below Libor appeared relatively attractive. In the euroyen market, Sweden is widely rumoured to be preparing a Y100bn 2 1/2 -year offering via Nomura. Nomura said a transaction was being discussed, but no final terms or timing had been set. Poland plans to set a Dollars 150m-Dollars 200m eurobond early next year, Reuter reports. A Polish official said the dollar-denominated bond was likely to be fixed-interest paper, maturing in three or five years and with semi-annual coupon payments. He said the eurobond issue would serve as a benchmark for future borrowing and help establish Poland's position on international financial markets. The finance ministry was waiting for the outcome of Poland's negotiations with its commercial banking creditors before setting terms, he added.</p>

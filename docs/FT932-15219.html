			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Morocco plans petrol station sale THE Moroccan government is offering its 50 per cent stake in seven petrol station networks to domestic and foreign investors, Reuter reports from Rabat. It plans to sell off its stake in a total of 112 enterprises worth Dh35bn (Dollars 4bn) by 1995, including distributors of petroleum products. The seven networks are Mobil Oil, Shell, Total, Dragon-Gaz, Societe Petroles du Maghreb (Petrom), Societe Marocaine de Stockage (SOMAS), and the Compagnie Marocaine des Hydrocarbures (CMH). They are capitalised at Dh360m. Petrom shares worth Dh122.4m and CMH shares worth about Dh100m are among those on offer. Societe Nationale des Produits Petroliers (SNPP), the state agency, holds 51 and 50 per cent in the two companies. Bids close on May 12. 'In 1992, domestic sales (of petroleum products) were between Dh12bn and Dh14bn, an increase of 12.6 per cent compared with 1991,' the mines and energy ministry said. The SNPP owns 50 per cent of the seven companies to be privatised and controls 75 per cent of the Moroccan petroleum distribution market. It was set up in the 1970s when the authorities launched a 'Moroccanisation' programme to avoid multinational control of the distribution network. 'The government is preparing a large-scale return of multinationals to the strategic oil sector,' the opposition daily Al Bayane said. However, officials deny foreigners will control the oil industry. Mr Moulay Zine Zahidi, privatisation minister, said yesterday: 'The state is responsible for crude oil imports and the SNPP and other companies distribute refined products only.' Officials said the state-owned oil refineries at Mohammedia, near Casablanca, and at Sidi Kacem, north-east of Rabat, were strategic enterprises and not for sale. When the oil distribution companies have been sold, the SNPP will return to its status before 'Moroccanisation' and will also be privatised. SNPP, whose oil stock at the end of last year was worth an estimated Dh2bn, will probably take over gas distribution when the trans-Maghreb pipeline taking Algerian natural gas across Morocco to Europe is completed in 1995, analysts said.</p>

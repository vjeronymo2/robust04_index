			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 13 ITAR-TASS -- Most national newspapers  lead with reports and comments on President Boris Yeltsin's  visit to Germany.    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI says "Peace in Europe depends not only on  Russia and Germany, but their good relations can help develop a  pan- European security system". The newspaper remarks that one  of the sensitive issues, concerning the withdrawal of Russian  troops from Germany, was successfully solved during Yeltsin's  visit: the last Russian troops will leave on August 31 from  Berlin, as Moscow insisted, and not from Weimar, as Bonn  proposed".    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA reports from Bonn that the two countries  "have succeeded in lifting the shadow which weighed down on  Russo-German relations lately in connection with the departure  of the Russian western army". The newspaper stresses that the  second day of the Russian president's visit to Germany witnessed  "a special, trustful relationship which has taken shape between  the leaders of Russia and Federal Germany".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA stresses that "Yeltsin secured a version  of the Russian troop withdrawal from Germany which is acceptable  to Russia", while German Chancellor Helmut Kohl "was attuned to  Moscow's sentiments"    Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who accompanies  Yeltsin on his trip, said "The results of the first days of the  visit are evident. Solutions have been found which suit both  countries, and -- most importantly -- a basis has been laid for  building a common future".    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries a banner "Yeltsin has won the  battle of Berlin", but admits that Kohl, who was yielding on the  Berlin question, proved to be indomitable on another point: the  withdrawal of the Russian troops and the units of our Western  allies in the anti-Hitler coalition will "proceed separately".    The newspaper also mentions shifts in Russia's standpoint on  cooperation with the North Atlantic alliance: "Helmut Kohl  succeeded in "keeping the honorable guest from Moscow on track  for "Partnership for Peace".    TRUD reports on the press conference held by the two  leaders,  which "revealed the scale of their conversations, their  efficiency, and their reciprocal movement towards concord". The  German side supported Russia's striving for integration, the  newspaper says. The Russian president and the federal chancellor  stressed that the visit reflected the frank, friendly and  trustful character of relations between Russia and Germany.    PRAVDA says that "talks between the two politicians  confirmed  what had been expected: There will be no joint farewell to all  the four powers of the anti-Hitler coalition, on which Russia,  and especially its military insisted". The newspaper says that  no headway was made in solving yet another pressing problem --  the exchange of the cultural values which the sides captured  during World War Two.    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI publishes an interview with Yevgeny Yasin,  head of the Russian president's analytical centre. The  prominent economist proclaimed that Boris Yeltsin and Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin are at present "the mainstays of  political stability in society, which is absolutely needed for  reforms to continue".    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA comments on the fact that the State Duma  refused to give the army its "survival minimum" by turning down  the Defence Ministry's request for an addition of 18 trillion  roubles to the defence budget. According to the newspaper, the  cut in the defence budget will lead to a "further obsolescence  of the army's military technical potential, the curbing of  restructuring in line with the military reform".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA rebuffs Zbigniew Brzezinsky's statement  that calls for partnership between Russia and the United States  are premature. According to the newspaper, "Partnership is  possible and necessary, although it can hardly be comprehensive,  simple and smooth at the present stage".    The same newspaper carries an interview with Lithuanian  President Algirdas Brazauskas, who stresses the importance of  "cooperation of equals" between Russian and his country. The  Lithuanian president said that "despite complications, present  relations between lithuania and Russia can be characterised as  good".</p>

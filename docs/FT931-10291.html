			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Time to tilt the balance: UK pension funds are under growing pressure to increase their holdings of bonds Since the turn of the year Britain's pension fund trustees have been weighed down by an awesome volume of paper from City analysts on the relative merits of equities and bonds. Nearly 80 per cent of their Pounds 350bn portfolio is invested in equities - a higher proportion than in any other industrialised country. The question is whether the people who hold the nation's retirement prospects in their hands are dangerously over-exposed, when inflation poses a diminished threat to bond values. At first sight it may seem an odd question to raise when equity markets across the world are soaring on the back of falling interest rates. Yet for trustees the decline in dividend yields resulting from rising prices can be bad news, since actuaries value pension fund investments on the basis not of stock market values, but potential income streams. And with the equity market yield down to 4 1/4 per cent, against the 8 3/4 per cent available at the long end of the gilt-edged market, the bond-equity debate is very much alive. The following tour d'horizon of the arguments suggests no simple answers, bar one: the percentage of UK pension fund portfolios devoted to bonds is bound to rise. In a recent review of the debate, Sushil Wadhwani and Mushtaq Shah of investment bank Goldman Sachs point out that there has been a positive correlation between the bond weighting in portfolios and the public sector borrowing requirement (see chart). A PSBR approaching 9 per cent of GDP next year will exert an upward pull on bond weightings, though a less powerful one than in the days of exchange controls. The maturity of pension schemes is pushing in the same direction. Between 1967 and 1987 the number of pensioners increased as a percentage of all the members of UK pension schemes from 19 per cent to 57 per cent. If mature funds are obliged to sell investments to pay pensions, liquidity in the shape of cash and gilts becomes important. As the yield curve has steepened, with short interest rates falling faster than long rates, cash looks unattractive to funds that worry about short-term performance. The question, then, is simply the price at which pension funds increase their bond holdings. Do gilt yields provide adequate compensation against the risk of resurgent inflation? Put the other way, will the rising stream of future dividend income adequately compensate for the extra income foregone in gilts, after allowing for the additional risk inherent in equity investment? The extreme aversion of British pension fund trustees to gilts derives some support from history. According to a study by BZW, the UK investment bank, of the performance of equities and gilts since 1918, equities produced an average annual real return over the past 74 years of 7.3 per cent, compared with a dismal 1.2 per cent on gilts and 1 per cent on cash. On that basis an investor looking for maximum long-term return without regard to risk or income requirements would have done best to hold equities exclusively. It follows that, before fund managers substantially boost their gilt holdings, they have to convince themselves of the existence of a historical watershed. Is it possible, for example, that equities and gilts are mispriced? This has certainly happened before. In the 1940s and 1950s the conventional wisdom in the rarefied world of the actuarial profession was that equities were so risky that they should yield more than fixed-interest gilts. Yet the value of gilts bought at that time was destroyed by unanticipated inflation. Today it is easy to make a case that global inflation has been laid low by a combination of central bank rigour, persistent output gaps in the developed world economies and the emergence of a global labour market, all of which exert downward pressure on prices. Yet real rates of interest are above their postwar average, which suggests that the markets' inflation expectations are based more on past experience than on future probability. Over the past two years that has amounted to a powerful global case for buying bonds. In the UK the argument is complicated by the sorry record of the Treasury and the Bank of England in monetary policy and exchange rate management. But the market knows about the record; and in a debt-burdened economy in which pay settlements are moderating fast as unemployment soars, many analysts feel that the market's expectation of 5 per cent inflation (the long gilt yield minus the yield on index-linked gilts) is excessive. Consider the equity side of the equation. It is widely accepted that dividend growth holds the key to future share price performance. Adding BZW's historic rate of real dividend growth of about 1 3/4 per cent - close to growth in GDP - to today's equity market yield of 4 1/4 per cent points to a real equity return of 6 per cent. That looks good compared with the real 3 3/4 per cent available on index-linked gilts, or on long-dated gilts after 5 per cent inflation. Looking at nominal dividend growth, as Paul Walton of stockbrokers James Capel did in a recent exercise, throws up similar results. A survey of leading companies and fund managers showed that the expectation of medium-term dividend growth was 6 per cent; and an examination of the ability of leading companies to pay dividends appeared to support the finding. Given that most actuarial valuations assume a 5 per cent dividend growth rate, this looks reassuring. But the assumptions can readily be attacked. For a start, few company analysts are making any allowance in their forecasts for the increasingly plausible threat of a sharp deterioration in global trade relations. And it is becoming all too easy to paint low-growth, low-inflation scenarios for the world and for Britain. One of the more cogent comes from Brian Reading of Lombard Street Research, whose latest monthly review suggests that in a world of structural budget deficits, undercapitalised banks and overborrowed companies and consumers, we might even see falling prices by the mid-1990s. He also points out that in the three decades before the first world war inflation averaged less than 1 per cent in the industrialised countries. As far as dividends are concerned, perceptions may have been over-influenced by the freakishly high payouts of the 1980s. In a recent paper to the Institute of Actuaries, Peter Jones of James Capel pointed out that the period of handsome outperformance by equities against gilts happened before 1958 when dividend yields fell below gilt yields - the emergence of the so-called 'rev-erse yield gap'. With lower dividend expectations than in the 1980s he expects the equity risk premium - the excess return of equities over gilts - to be lower than at any time in seven decades. A point in support of the anti-equity case is that real dividend growth, using a three-year moving average, was negative from 1962 to 1982 (see chart). But perhaps the most difficult hurdle for equity investors is simply the demanding starting point of a 4 1/4 per cent yield. Just how difficult it is to outperform from a historically low yield base has been demonstrated in an in-house study by Daniel O'Shea of the M&amp;G unit trust group, using BZW's figures up to 1990. This set out to measure the average annual return on equities over five-year periods, dividing the years into those where the starting point was below the average long-term average yield of 4.7 per cent, and those where it was above. The results showed, inter alia, that 65 per cent of the time, when the starting point was below that 4.7 yield, the return on equities was below 3 per cent in real terms. Three per cent is traditionally regarded as the century-in/century-out real return on risk-free bonds. Note, too, that today's yield level is lower than it looks, because of the addition of high-yield utilities to the market in the past decade. So the equity odds are tougher as the bull market continues. In investment, timing is all. But most fund managers are not in the business of maximising returns. To keep their jobs, they seek whatever modest degree of outperformance is compatible with the behaviour of the herd. The one safe conclusion is that, if this really is the decade of the bond in Britain, most fund managers will be late to act on it.</p>

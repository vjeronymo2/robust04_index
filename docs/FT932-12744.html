			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Letter: Japan must face up to its Gatt obligations on low-alcohol tax Sir, We refer to Mr Kojiro Shiojiri's letter 'No contravention of Gatt rules by Japan's low-alcohol tax' (April 20), which does less than justice to the position held by the European Commission and the industry. The EC disappointment with the new tax structure is two-fold. First, as Mr Shiojiri says, EC regulation 1576/89 prohibits European whisky distillers from producing and selling whisky less than 40 degrees proof. The new tax is thus discriminatory in its effect on European producers, including the French who cannot produce and sell whiskies below this strength - one recent attempt to circumvent the legislation, to which Mr Shiojiri is possibly referring, failed last year in a Paris court. Second, European producers feel the Japanese government has not taken advantage of an opportunity for implementation of full liquor tax harmonisation as provided for in the 1987 Gatt council ruling. The latter was accepted by Japan and partially implemented in 1989, and full compliance was again formally requested last year by the Commission. The key finding was that Shochu (accounting for about 65 per cent of Japan's distilled spirits market) is competitive with all distilled liquor (including whisky, brandy and vodka), and should be taxed similarly so as not to afford protection to domestic production. It appears that, in printing, Mr Shiojiri's figures have become confused: Shochu Koh is taxed at Y83.1 per litre and Shochu Otsu at Y48 per litre (each on the basis of 20 degrees alcoholic strength). This compares with Y978.29 per litre for 40 per cent proof whisky and brandy, and Y331.4 per litre for all spirits such as vodka and gin. Even allowing for the differences in alcoholic strength, the ratios are therefore between 5:1 and 10:1 for Shochu and whisky/brandy, and slightly less for other spirits. It is also worth noting that duty levels on whisky entering Japan are six times those of whisky entering the UK, and 10 times those of whisky entering the US. The recent new tax on diluted whisky seems a partial admission of the need for a more level playing field. But, by leaving European distillers in the cold, it raises yet again the question of why Japan continues to protect the ailing domestic spirits industry at a time when its trade surplus continues to soar. Michiyo Nakamoto's article (April 21) illustrates the EC's pessimism on this point, and in particular the Commission's unhappiness with Japan's discriminatory liquor taxes. It seems the appropriate time for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Japanese government to face up to their international Gatt obligations.

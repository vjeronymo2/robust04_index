			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Wimpey to reorganiseland bank structure GEORGE WIMPEY is to reorganise the way in which it buys building plots in an attempt to avoid the mistakes of the late 1980s when housebuilders were left with large amounts of overpriced land. The group, Britain's second largest housebuilder, announced yesterday that it was to establish a new subsidiary which would be responsible for making long term land acquisitions. The company will take over Wimpey's existing long term land portfolio of more than 2,000 acres and sell the sites on to the group's 10 regional housebuilding subsidiaries as required. It will also be expected to generate profits from selling sites to other housebuilders and earn fees from managing greenfield sites by taking land owned by outsiders through the planning process to the point of development. Mr Joe Dwyer, Wimpey's chief executive, said the group's housing division would be expected to monitor its success by measuring return on capital. Traditionally, UK housebuilders have evaluated their performance simply by taking the cost of land and building and deducting this from the sale price of a home to arrive at a gross margin. Little heed was paid to the cost of holding land. This approach worked while high inflation ensured that house and land prices enjoyed unbroken increases throughout the 1970s and for most of the 1980s. As a result shares of housebuilders with large tracts of land, acquired many years earlier at low prices, were often more highly valued than those working on short duration land banks. Housebuilders, however, were caught badly at the end of the 1980s when house and land prices fell steeply, forcing Wimpey and others to make substantial provisions against land bought at the top of the market. Wimpey's housebuilding subsidiaries will, in future, be expected to base land purchases on foreseeable production and house prices. The new subsidiary, which Mr Dwyer says will work under tight financial disciplines, will provide a reservoir of longer term land for the group, which expects to build more than 6,000 homes in the UK this year. The plan is the work of Mr Richard Andrew, a former executive director of Scandinavian Bank in the UK, who last year was appointed chairman and chief executive of Wimpey's housebuilding division. Mr Dwyer said yesterday that it was an unusual appointment but that it was felt that a banker would bring the appropriate financial experience to an area where asset management, increasingly, was the key to profitability.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, Jan 7 (AFP) -- Cambodia's powerful  Chairman of Parliament Chea Sim endorsed Friday a controversial  request from the Phnom Penh party to reinstate as members of  parliament (MP) two hardliners who resigned their seats to lead  a secessionist movement.    "I believe that the request will be accepted by all MPs in  the spirit of national reconciliation," Chea Sim told AFP.    However, the move was adamantly opposed by many MPs from the  royalist FUNCINPEC party, several MPs confirmed. One of those  at the centre of the controversial request is Prince Norodom  Chakrapong -- half brother and bitter foe of co-premier Prince  Norodom Ranariddh -- who was deputy prime minister in the former  communist Phnom Penh regime. The other is the former National  Security Minister General Sin Song.    The two resigned their seats in parliament to lead a  secessionist movement to protest against the Cambodian People's  Party's loss to FUNCINPEC in the U.N.-supervised polls in May.    The movement collapsed within a few days and the leaders'  seats in parliament were subsequently occupied by other CPP  representatives as the former battlefield foes formed a  coalition government.    The prince and the general, however, recently reappeared out  of the political wilderness claiming they wished to "serve the  nation" and indicated they wanted to return to their seats in  parliament.    Chea Sim expressed his hope that the party leaders would  instruct their members to approve the move beforehand so the  reinstatement would not meet opposition in parliament. But  FUNCINPEC MP Ahmad Yahya said it was "illegal" to let the two  men back into the assembly as the constitution prohibited it.  The constitution states that in the case of death, resignation  or dismissal of an MP, "another representative shall be chosen  to replace him or her". Another royalist MP deemed the move  against the law.    "Normally the law would not allow for the return of these  two  persons to the National Assembly, but Chea Sim counts on the  spirit of national unity to accept these two persons back," he  said.    "Formally speaking the law does not allow this and he  acknowledges this."    Although ardently opposed to move, the FUNCINPEC MP said he  was a "disciplined party member" and would abide by the official  party line on the matter.    When asked what the official line was, cabinet director to  co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh Ly Thuch had no comment.    Party Secretary General and Minister of Foreign Affairs  Prince Norodom Sirivut was unavailable for comment. But MP  Ahmad Yahya said there was no room for compromise on the issue.    "Even if the party agrees on it, I am going against it," he  said. "I do not want to do something illegal and I believe many  others will support me".    Another FUNCINPEC MP said the two hardliners were  "blackmailing" the party leadership to get their seats back.    "Chakrapong and Sin Song threaten that if they are discarded  from power, they will reveal many things bad to the CPP  mainstream," he said. "They're blackmailing them."    The radical Khmer Rouge claimed the attempt to rehabilitate  the two secessionists proved that the government was still under  the control of the leaders of the former Phnom Penh regime --  despite the fact Prince Ranariddh is co-premier and FUNCINPEC is  the largest party in the coalition government.    By appointing "traitors, killers and corrupt officials" as  MPs, the government was "eating the flesh, drinking the blood,  and sucking the marrow from the Khmer people's bones", a Khmer  Rouge statement said.</p>

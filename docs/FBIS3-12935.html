In a statement to reporters today, he said that the leaders of  the Somali groups thanked President Mubarak, the Egyptian  Government, and the fraternal Egyptian people for their  strenuous efforts toward finding a solution to the Somali  problem. He voiced his hope that these efforts will succeed in  finding a solution to the Somali problem. Mohamed said that the  meetings of the 12 Somali groups in Cairo reached an agreement  on a statement that includes a complete concept on which all the  Somali groups agreed.    Responding to a question on General Mohamed Farah Aidid's  view of this statement, Mohamed said that Aidid did not take  part in the meetings and that a delegation will be sent to him  with the statement to study it.    Replying to a question on reports that a provisional  government will be formed at the end of March and whether the  declaration will speed up its formation, Mohamed said: We hope  that this will happen.    Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has stated that the  meetings of the 12 Somali groups in Cairo and their invitations  to the three other factions affirm that the situation in Somalia  is entering a new stage that calls for reconciliation among the  majority. He noted that Egypt sent an invitation to all the  Somali factions, including General Aidid. He stressed that  Egypt does not differentiate between Somali groups. He pointed  out that it is important for Somalia to enter into a new stage  of building on the basis of the agreement and the participation  of all groups in the presidential council or consultative  council. He noted that every leader has his standing according  to the Addis Ababa resolutions on national reconciliation in  Somalia. He said that President Husni Mubarak will send a  message to Ethiopian leader Meles Zenawi in his capacity as the  chairman entrusted with following up on the Somali problem. He  said that the message will deal with the latest developments.  Egypt will also brief other African countries on the Somali  agreement. He expressed his hope that these developments will  lead to genuine moves to resolve the Somali problem.</p>

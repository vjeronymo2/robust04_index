This meeting  is primarily devoted to summarizing experiences, defining tasks,  and further emancipating the mind and deepening reform with a  view to pushing the province's people's air defense work onto a  new level. Attending the meeting were Zhao Zhihao, deputy  secretary of the provincial party committee, governor of the  province, and chairman of the people's air defense committee of  the province; Zhang Taiheng, commander of the Jinan Military  Region and chairman of the people's air defense committee of the  region; Zhang Ruifeng, vice governor of the province and vice  chairman of the people's air defense committee of the province;  Gao Zhongxing, deputy chief of staff of the Jinan Military  Region; Yi Yuanqiu, commander of the provincial military  district and vice chairman of the people's air defense committee  of the province; and Liu Chaoming, deputy director of the  General Office of the State People's Air Defense Committee.    Governor Zhao Zhihao and Commander Zhang Taiheng placed  expectations and set demands on the province's air defense work.    Zhao Zhihao pointed out: The building up of the people's air  defense facilities is an important content to enhance the  comprehensive national strength. Secretary Jiang Chunyun has  demanded that the province should march in the forefront of the  country in building the people's air defense facilities. The  provincial government has also defined goals for this work. To  fulfill the goals, we are faced with an extremely arduous task.  By conscientiously implementing and protractedly persisting in  the principles of combining the peacetime needs with the wartime  preparedness and working out plans for all fields, with focus on  construction, all levels of governments and air defense  committees must strive to enhance the overall defending ability  and the ability of self-development and self-improvement.

He pointed out: The  building up of the people's air defense facilities is a task of  fundamental importance to the fulfillment of our great  long-range cause and is directly related to the security and  interests of the state. To achieve success in the reform and  building up of the people's air defense work, we must make great  efforts to suit the need of the high technology war, the need of  economic construction, and the need of urban construction. We  should also make great efforts to enable the people's air  defense facilities to truly play the dual functions of  facilitating economic construction and social development in  peacetime and facilitating air defense in wartime. In addition,  we should put the people's air defense work in a due social  position to ensure its long-range and steady development.    (Cheng Junting), director of the general office under the  provincial people's air defense committee, made a work report at  the meeting, entitled "Emancipate the Mind, Seize the  Opportunity, and Further Accelerate the Reform and Development  the Province's Air Defense Work."</p>

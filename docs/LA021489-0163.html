			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EXPO PITCHER CHARGED WITH SOLICITATION  </P> <P> A Montreal Expos pitcher could face up to 60 days in jail after his arrest  during a widespread prostitution sweep, police said.  </P> <P> Bryn Smith, 33, was among 116 people charged with solicitation during the Feb.  6-8 operation in which six police officers posed as prostitutes along a busy  street in West Palm Beach, about 60 miles north of Miami, said Police Chief  Billy Riggs.  </P> <P> "We're sending a message. . . . Don't come into our city looking for  prostitutes," Riggs said Monday.  </P> <P> Mayor Pat Schwab said maximum penalties should be sought for the suspects.  Under Florida law, soliciting for prostitution is a second-degree misdemeanor  punishable by 60 days in jail, a $500 fine or both.  </P> <P> Smith was 12-10 with the Expos last season with a 3.00 earned run average.  </P></p>

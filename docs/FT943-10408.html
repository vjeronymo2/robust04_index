			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Tesco is called on to increase local sourcing Tesco was urged yesterday to make its takeover of William Low, the Dundee-based supermarket chain, more acceptable to Scottish public opinion by obtaining more of its goods from Scotland. The battle for Wm Low - won by Tesco over J. Sainsbury - has caused dismay in Scotland because of the disappearance of another of Scotland's small number of quoted companies and because of the intended closure of Wm Low's headquarters in Dundee, which employs 300 people. Few Wm Low stores in Scotland or northern England are likely to close because of Tesco's small presence north of the border, while Scottish food and drink suppliers could gain a larger market. Dr Jeremy Bray, Labour MP for Motherwell South, yesterday wrote to Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman of Tesco, saying that it would be 'a material factor' with Scots if he were able to say Tesco would increase the sourcing of its products in Scotland for sale throughout Britain. In its original offer in July Tesco said it 'intended to continue Wm Low's policy of encouraging Scottish suppliers and to offer them the potential to benefit from the wider market served by Tesco'. Tesco has since said it plans to set up an office in Scotland to handle the buying of goods and the marketing of the company in Scotland. Yesterday it said its existing 16 Scottish stores would be given 'a Scottish flavour'.</p>

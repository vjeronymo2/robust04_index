			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Crime rates have increased in direct  proportion to the socioeconomic crisis affecting the country  and, according to an article by Javier Simancas in the Guayaquil  daily EL UNIVERSO of 29 May, kidnapping for ransom of  businessmen and politicians has intensified from 1992 to the  present. The national police have stated that the problem is  neither "accidental" nor linked to worsening socioeconomc  conditions, but directly related to the immigration of entire  mafia-type organizations and "subversive groups" from  neighboring countries. Police statements add that Ecuador has  become an easy target for these organizations to earn money by  these means. In the past two years, 15 kidnappings have been  officially reported that have earned the perpetrators a billion  sucres. According to EL UNIVERSO, kidnapping crimes are  concentrated in the Amazon areas of Sucumbios because that area  is conducive to the free movement of organizations between  Colombia and Ecuador. The article also pointed out that the  cities of Guayaquil and Quito are not exempt from this type of  crime.    Minister of Defense Jose Gallardo, however, denied that  crimes of kidnapping are a real threat to the country and  minimized their links to terrorist organizations. He added "it  is not true that kidnapping has become an unmanageable scourge,"  and stated that although Sucumbios had been the site for many of  these crimes, they have been "totally eliminated" at present.  Gallardo further noted that in Guayaquil, as well, many  kidnapping attempts "were controlled in time."</p>

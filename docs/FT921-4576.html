			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / International Company News: Trade in Italy's BNA to resume SHARES in Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura (BNA) and affiliated companies forming Italy's second-largest private-sector banking group will resume normal trading today after a decision on Friday by Consob, the country's stock market watchdog. However, investors will be banned from taking short positions in order to damp any speculation. Cosob had suspended shares of BNA - as well as Bonifiche Siele Finanziaria, its holding company, and Interbanca, its long-term lending subsidiary - after conflicting reports last month that the group's controlling shareholder, Count Giovanni Auletta Armenise, had decided to sell his stake. Count Auletta owns around 52 per cent of the ordinary shares in Bonifiche Siele, which in turn controls BNA. BNA, which is one of Italy's least profitable banks, has been the subject of intense speculation ever since Credito Italiano, the big public-sector bank, mounted an unsuccessful attempt to buy control in 1989, leaving it with 22 per cent of Bonifiche Siele and 8.2 per cent of BNA. Since then, BNA has been in limbo. While bankers have doubted Count Auletta's ability to meet its growing financial needs from his own resources, he has consistently denied any plans to sell out, whether to Credito Italiano or others. Last month Mr Giuseppe Gennari, a financier and former adviser to Count Auletta, announced he had decided to buy the count's shares for around L1,200bn (Dollars 959m). Mr Gennari already owned around 17 per cent of Bonifiche Siele. However, shortly after the announcement, Count Auletta denied any agreement to sell, prompting confusion in the market and Consob's decision to suspend the shares. CREDIT Lyonnais, the leading French bank, has spent L80bn (Dollars 64m) on a 12.8 per cent stake in Banca Agricola Milanese (BAM), a small Italian regional bank based in Milan. Credit Lyonnais is already strongly represented in northern Italy, where it owns the majority of Credito Bergamasco, a highly-profitable regional bank. The French institution is known to be keen to expand its Italian presence further. However, it is unclear whether the latest move by Credit Lyonnais represents a first step in gaining control of BAM, or a tidying-up of accounts. BAM is majority-owned by Banca Popolare di Milano, Italy's second biggest co-operative bank, which has shown no interest in relinquishing control.</p>

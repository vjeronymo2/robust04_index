Authorities attribute the attacks to urban guerrillas.    Colonel Daniel Peralta, subcommander of the Medellin  Metropolitan Police, said four bombs exploded during the day and  three were deactivated in a wave of attacks perpetrated by  guerrilla commandos against U.S. companies. Col. Peralta said  the attacks were made on a stationery store, two educational  centers, and a construction site near a bus terminal.    "The bombs, each one made with 3 kg of dynamite, exploded at  an English language school, a German language school, and a  travel agency. Two other bombs were deactivated at the Citibank  and Diner's Club main offices," Col. Peralta reported.    He added that the most serious incident occurred at the "El  Ancla" stationery store, located in downtown Medellin, where the  explosion started a fire causing damage estimated at 20 million  pesos.    According to reports, the blast caused millions of dollars  in  property damage due to shattered windows and glass doors and a  fire, which started in one of the offices that was attacked, but  there were no fatalities.    "The attacks were perpetrated by guerrilla commandos  protesting the presence of U.S. troops in Colombia," Col.  Peralta said. Authorities attribute the bomb attacks to  guerrillas from the Army of National Liberation and the  Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, which declared U.S.  companies and citizens living in Colombia military targets to  protest the presence of U.S. soldiers in Colombia.    Currently, there are 249 U.S. soldiers in Colombia working  on  humanitarian and social assistance projects, training programs,  and the installation of radars for the fight against drug  trafficking.    The largest group, 156 soldiers, are building a school, a  hospital, and a road in the town of Juanchaco, in Valle del  Cauca Department. The other units are constructing a military  base in Puerto Lopez, Meta Department.    A week ago, rebels blew up two Mormon churches and a Coca  Cola plant in the city of Bucaramanga, and kidnapped two  missionaries in eastern Colombia.</p>

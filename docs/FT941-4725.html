			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Wider financial regulatory net urged The sale of savings products such as Tessas, which were seen as alternatives to investment products, should be included in the retail financial services regulatory regime, a Standard Life executive told MPs yesterday. Mr Jim Stretton, the life insurance company's deputy managing director, told the cross-party Commons treasury committee inquiry into financial regulation that the rules should cover all products which seemed to be in competition with each other. These included some of the building societies' savings vehicles, which customers saw as quite similar to unit trusts. Mr Stretton again signalled that Standard Life was likely to join the Personal Investment Authority, the new watchdog to protect private investors, in spite of the company's preference for a single-tier statutory regulator. He resigned from the PIA board because most of its members would not come from the financial services industry so, he said, it would not be real self-regulation. He expressed some sympathy for proposals by Mr George Greener, chairman of Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star, for a single regulator in which an executive committee of people working in financial services was supervised by a board of public interest directors. He made it clear, however, that he did not believe there was enough common ground among the PIA's opponents to prevent the watchdog becoming operational in the summer.</p>

			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Motorcycle sales optimism Motorcycle sales should bottom out this year at 40,000 units, ending nearly 15 years of decline from the 315,000 in 1980, the Motor Cycle Industry Association said yesterday. The year started well with January sales rising 11.8 per cent to 2,626 compared with the corresponding month a year earlier. The figures reflect a fundamental change in the nature of the market. Sales of small-capacity machines including mopeds, which made up the bulk of 1980s sales, have tumbled as increasing affluence has wiped out their role as providers of cheap utility transport. 'We cannot ignore the fact that our market is changing and becoming more leisure-oriented,' said Mrs Monica Dickman, who chairs the industry's market information and forecasting committee. Industry research shows that half of all riders are now classified in the top three socio-economic groups and that the average age of motorcyclists has risen sharply, with more than 70 per cent aged 26 or over. A high proportion of large-capacity machines costing Pounds 5,000 or more is partially compensating dealers financially for sharply reduced sales.</p>

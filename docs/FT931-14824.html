			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: La Caixa posts 6.4% advance LA CAIXA, the Barcelona-based financial institution that ranks second after Italy's Cariplo among European savings banks, raised pre-tax profits last year by 6.4 per cent over 1991 to Pta42.2bn (Dollars 366m). This comes after putting aside Pta34bn for bad debts, a 107 per cent increase on the 1991 provision for non-performing loans. One of the most aggressive of the domestic savings banks, as well as the biggest, La Caixa has diversified in recent years to offer a full range of financial services, including commercial banking. Last year, it signed an ambitious joint venture agreement with the Dutch-Belgian group Fortis aimed at securing a leading position in the Spanish insurance market. Mr Josep Villarasau, La Caixa chairman, said yesterday funds managed by the savings bank had increased by 11.3 per cent last year.</p>

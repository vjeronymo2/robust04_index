			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Bensons lists on low tide of doubled losses BENSONS CRISPS, conceived in wartime austerity, yesterday splashed out on a shipboard press lunch, as the company listed on a low tide of doubled pre-tax losses made in the company's weaker first half. It was all a world away from Mr Sidney Benson, the fish and chip shop proprietor who fought a 1940s oil shortage with lard and ensured an unbroken supply of crisps for the people of Wigan, founding the snack maker at the same time. The 'informal press luncheon', aboard the Honourable Company of Master Mariners Headquarters Ship, the HMS Wellington, was probably not meant as ironic allusion to the late, lush eighties. Mr Tony Fiddian, the finance director presiding over losses of Pounds 386,000 (Pounds 191,000) for the six months to May 29, said: 'It's a matter of honour. We turn out whether the news is good or bad.' The losses were struck on turnover up at Pounds 16.5m (Pounds 15.6m). The increase in sales was entirely due to supermarkets and discounters, in line with the general trend. In the independent sector, which accounts for more than 50 per cent of Bensons' sales, Golden Wonder, owned by Dalgety, had taken market share by slashing prices to 1970s levels. Sight and Sound, the company's small animation offshoot, suffered from a last minute cancellation as a result of which it also lost money. Nevertheless, the interim dividend is maintained at 0.7p, although losses per share deepened to 3.2p (1.7p). All this on top of a first half typically weakened by seasonally high potato prices, means Bensons could be forgiven for describing its results as disappointing, but not surprising. However, Mr Malcolm Jones, chairman, said the second half 'is beginning to take on a more positive shape'. Despite this, Bensons' shares ended the day 7p lower at 62p.</p>

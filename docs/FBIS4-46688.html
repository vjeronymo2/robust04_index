			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vyacheslav Bobkov, Vladimir Litvinov and </F> Lyudmila Migranova, All-Russian Living Standard Center under the  Russian Federation Ministry of Labor: "Monitoring the Living  Standard; The Incomes of Russia's Population Have Increased on  the Whole During the Year but the Number Having Incomes Below  the Poverty Line has Increased"]    [Text] Per-capita monetary incomes amounted to almost  90,000 rubles per month on average during the first quarter of  1994 for Russia as a whole. By the end of the quarter they had  already reached R104,000.

At the same time the differentiation of  economic regions by monetary incomes in the first quarter of  1994 in comparison with the fourth quarter of 1993 has not  changed essentially--2.4 and 2.3 times respectively.    When comparing the data on per-capita monetary incomes of  the  population in January 1994 with the data of January 1993, it is  necessary first of all to note the overall improvement of the  situation in the area of the population's incomes during the  period under consideration.    Per-capita monetary incomes have increased 8.8 times in  Russia during the year. The maximum growth by economic regions  has been recorded in the North-Western and Central regions--10.1  and 11.8 times respectively (including in Saint Petersburg--13.8  and in Moscow--13.5) and the West Siberian region--9.8 times.  These regions in many respects have assured the overall  improvement of the situation with the population's incomes in  Russia as a whole. The growth of incomes has gone the slowest in  the Central Black Earth (7.5), Urals (7.6), Far Eastern (7.9),  North Caucasus (7.7) and East Siberian (6.2) regions.    The monetary incomes of the population for Russia as a whole  in dollar terms has increased approximately 3.1 times as against  8.8 times in rubles. That is, in freely convertible currency  per-capita monetary incomes grew almost three times slower than  in rubles. The level of monthly average per-capita monetary  incomes (API) has amounted to approximately $56 in the first  quarter of 1994. This is less than in the fourth quarter of  1993. A quite decent growth--21.2 percent--is obtained when the  calculations are in rubles. The calculations in freely  convertible currency indicate another trend--a drop in  per-capita monetary incomes during the quarter by almost 8  percent.    The rise in the price of the goods needed to achieve a  minimum living standard continued in the first quarter of 1994.  For Russia as a whole the monetary value of the minimum  substince budget (BPM) has amounted to R53,900 and has increased  more than 1.4 times in comparison with the fourth quarter of  1993, i.e., the BPM has increased by 12-13 percent each month on  average.    In January 1994 the maximum size of the BPM was registered  in  the Far Eastern economic region--R91,100. Based on the level of  the BPM the Far East, as previously, substantially outstripped  the East Siberian and Northern regions following after it  (R60,900 and R57,900).    As with a year ago, the lowest value of the BPM has been  registered in the Volga region--R33,100.    In the Russian Federation Ministry of Labor's officially  approved procedure the BPM is defined as an increment (doschet)  to the value of the food basket, the relative share of which on  average per capita is established at the rate of 68.3 percent.  Taking objective factors into account, in particular the more  rapid growth of expenditures for services and non-food goods,  the Living Standard Center proposes the reduction of this  percentage to 59.3. Taking this adjustment into account, the  value of the BPM in January 1994 for Russia as a whole will rise  from R48,000 to R55,300, i.e., by more than 15 percent.    The grouping of economic regions as a function of the  monetary valuation of the BPM also has undergone changes. If in  January 1993 the differentiation of regions on the basis of the  size of the BPM came to two times, then in January 1994 it was  already 2.5 times. Given an equal number of the regions (seven  in each) in the group with a "low" BPM in January 1993 and in  January 1994, the share of the population living in these  regions has increased by almost 10 percent in 1994. The share of  the population living in regions with an "average" BPM value has  shrunk by as much--from 30 to 20 percent.    The magnitude of the real incomes of the population (RDN),  expressed in the number of BPM baskets (nabor) in the average  per-capita income, has amounted to 1.47 baskets in the first  quarter of 1994 as against 1.17 baskets in January 1993.    In January 1994, the maximum RDN values have been registered  in the West Siberian, Northern and Central economic regions,  1.76, 1.74, and 1.86 baskets respectively. The minimum RDN  values have been noted in the North Caucasus, East Siberian and  Far Eastern regions, 1.09, 1.12, and 1.27 baskets respectively.  Attention should be paid to the fact that in the East Siberian  region in January 1994, the RDN level has turned out to be lower  than the level of the beginning of 1993, 1.12 and 1.45 baskets  respectively. A very insignificant absolute annual increase of  the RDN has been recorded both in the Urals region--0.05  baskets--and in the Far Eastern--0.1 baskets. The maximum RDN  increase has been observed in the Central region--0.92 baskets,  taking into account the 1.43 baskets increase in the city of  Moscow.    The RDN situation has become better in the beginning of 1994  than in the beginning of 1993. This has manifested itself,  firstly, in the absolute increase in the size of the RDN in all  economic regions except the East Siberian; secondly, in the  decrease in the number of regions with a low RDN level. The  overall number of regions in the group with a "high" RDN level  has increased in the beginning of 1994. Interregional  differentiation based on the RDN has increased somewhat. If in  the beginning of 1993 the coefficient of differentiation based  on the value of the RDN came to 1.6 times, then in the beginning  of 1994 it is 1.7 times.    Both for Russia as a whole and for the majority of the  regions (the North Caucasus and East Siberia constitute the  exception), most of the population possessed per-capita monetary  incomes in the interval of from one to two BPMs in the fourth  quarter of 1993. For Russia as a whole the share of such a  population came to 40 percent in the fourth quarter of 1993. In  other words, in the majority of regions, irrespective of what  group it belonged to based on the size of the BPM, there is a  stable block of the population with incomes above one and up to  two BPMs. For Russia as a whole the share of the population with  monetary incomes greater than two BPMs came to 25.5 percent and  was less than the share of the population with incomes lower  than one BPM--34.4 percent.    An indicator of the differentiation of the monetary incomes  of Russia's population equal to 11 is often published in the  press. This is the accepted in statistics decile coefficient of  differentiation, which is calculated as the relationship of the  minimal monetary income in the group of the 10 percent of the  population with the highest income (in the fourth quarter of  1993 this value equalled R180,000) to the maximum monetary  income in the group of the 10 percent of the population with the  smallest monetary income (R19,900). In its estimates of  differentiation the Living Standard Center uses a relationship  of the average incomes of these two groups of the population  (R289,000 and R13,900 respectively), equal to 20.79, which is  double the officially used estimate.    In the fourth quarter of 1993 the average per-capita  monetary  income of the three groups of the population--workers and  employees, pensioners, and the rural population--correlated as  1.92:1.19:1.    The monetary incomes of the rural population are  characterized by the lowest average level and a high indicator  of differentiation not only with respect to the families of  workers and employees but also to pensioners. It should be noted  that the incomes of kolkhozniks always were characterized by a  low average level and their relatively higher differentiation in  comparison with the analogous indicators for workers and  employees. However, that among the rural population the incomes  of kolkhozniks have become lower than in the families of  pensioners is a fact that is completely negative. One should  also bear in mind that the positive dynamics of average  per-capital real incomes does not always reflect the changes in  the real incomes of the various social groups. Thus, the share  of the population of Russia having an income less than the PLB  has increased during the past year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 24 (AFP) -- Bosnian President Alija  Izetbegovic charged here Thursday that Serbs have failed to  honor the NATO ultimatum to withdraw all artillery from  Sarjaevo. He said many Serb heavy guns were still in position  against the mainly Moslem Bosnian capital.    In a statement read to reporters by Bosnian Vice President  Ejup Ganic, Izetbegovic gave a list of weapons not pulled out  since the NATO ultimatum expired Monday. "According to reliable  data, the realization of the ultimatum is not accomplished," the  statement said.    It listed sitings by Bosnian sources from Monday to  Wednesday  of eight tanks, three armored personnel carriers and at least 16  artillery pieces in the 20-kilometre (12-mile) exclusion zone  NATO had called for around Sarajevo by last Monday. NATO  threatened air strikes as of Monday to destroy the arms.  Whether these weapons remained Thursday could not be  immediately confirmed.    UN spokesmen here say there is effective compliance since  Serb forces have been pulling out artillery and have not shelled  Sarajevo.    UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Canadian  Lieutenant-Colonel Bill Aikman said Thursday, however, that  there were still at least eight weapons sites to be checked.  Aikman said there were in addition sites where Serbs were  refusing to hand over arms to UN troops.    Ganic charged that the 260 pieces of artillery UNPROFOR has  collected so far from the Serbs included many obsolete arms and  many below the high calibre weapons the Serbs possess. He spoke  of UN Bosnian commander British General Michael Rose "saying he  was going to go to sleep comfortably (at the time the deadline  fell Monday at 0100 GMT) since the job was done." "Now it is a  mess," Ganic said.</p>

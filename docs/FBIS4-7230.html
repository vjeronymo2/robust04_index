			<p>BFN     [Text] On 17 April, hundreds of people living along the  Tonle Sap Lake assaulted the Vietnamese at (Kbal Taol) and (Kaoh  Khsach Pouy), killing 30 of them and destroying three motor  boats and four (?fishing) boats.    The report said that during the current fishing season, the  Vietnamese have arrogantly prohibited our Cambodian people from  fishing in this area. The Vietnamese aggressors have killed  many Cambodians who went fishing in this area.    The Cambodian people have time and again complained to the  authorities in this region but to no avail, because these  authorities who are lackeys of the Vietnamese think only of  serving their Vietnamese masters. Therefore, the people say  that their only alternative is to settle the Vietnamese acts of  aggression and expansion along Tonle Sap Lake by themselves.</p>

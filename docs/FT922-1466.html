			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (18): Efforts now starting to bear fruit - Quality Assurance IN SPECIALIST sectors such as military and aerospace, where lives depend on the robustness of a computer system, quality assurance techniques have been in use for many years. But it is only recently that the banner of quality has been taken up in the world of commercial computing. In the past couple of years, significant progress has been made in the definition of quality assurance standards and there is an increased interest in applying them to commercial systems. There are good reasons for the lengthy gestation period for quality assurance standards - particularly when applied to computer software. Quality is difficult to measure in software and it has taken the past two decades for the techniques to advance sufficiently to make them worthwhile. It is also expensive - especially if it has to be grafted on to existing systems many years after they were first built. As ex-IBMer Robert Pirsig observed in his book, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, 'quality isn't something you lay on top of subjects and objects like tinsel on a Christmas tree. Real quality must be the source of the subjects and objects, the cone from which the tree must start'. The computer industry has, therefore, sought to find ways both to define quality and to ensure that it is built into computer systems from the start. In the past couple of years, this effort has begun to yield benefits. Earlier this year, the first results from the Pyramid Project, an EC-sponsored project which forms part of the Esprit initiative, showed that the use of quality measurement techniques brought an overall reduction of 35 per cent in the number of faults found in software. The Pyramid Project was set up in 1990 by a group of European manufacturers and software suppliers to devise measurement techniques and assess their impact in development projects. Its members include Data Logic from the UK, Siemens Nixdorf from Germany and Veridatas from France. The experience drawn from the assessment shows that software quality is measurable and attainable, but it must go hand-in-hand with good staff training and tight management of development. The pioneering work on quality assessment and assurance has its roots in the military requirements for high-quality systems. The earliest practical standard for quality procedures was the NATO-sponsored Defense Standard 05/21 which emerged about 15 years ago. This formed the basis of the UK standard for quality assurance formulated by the British Standards Institute - BS 5750 - in the late 1970s. At the same time, NATO devised a series of quality standards known as the AQAP requests - AQAP 13 being the one which related to software quality. During the past decade, the emphasis has shifted to international quality standards which would be appropriate to all systems - whether for military or commercial use. Commercial organisations, such as British Telecom, British Gas and the British Shoe Corporation, began to influence the process and the result was a complex set of three quality standards. The most important of these in the UK is BS5750. If a software developer is accredited for this standard, then it follows that it is also effectively accredited for the other two - although the present bureaucratic process requires that each be registered separately. This means, for example, that a company which wants to sell software internationally, must do so under the appropriate quality standard. The BS 5750 quality standard is divided into three parts, each covering a different aspect of systems development. It lays down standards of quality management to create the right environment for building systems where quality can be tracked and checked - although in itself it is no guarantee that the end product will be a quality one. The first part of BS 5750 covers the requirements for design and manufacture and is the most important part for software developers. The second part covers installation and the third part distribution. The standard lays down the methods and procedures which are required to ensure that software is produced to a standard throughout its entire life-cycle. Companies which are accredited under the standard are required to demonstrate that they have appropriate management procedures in place to achieve the standard. Software developers are increasingly using quality standard accreditation to give them a marketing edge - although accreditation does not necessarily guarantee that the end result is a quality product. It is, however, far better than no standard at all and quality assurance procedures are likely to become mandatory for large software suppliers in the future. The full results of the Pyramid Project are available in the report, 'Quantitative management: get a grip on software.' Price Pounds 12.50, from Data Logic in the UK.

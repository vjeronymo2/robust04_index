These results, which add 39 more renewalist delegates in  Madrid and 14 in Leon, do not change the percentages achieved in  the rest of Spain in the previous week, which put the Guerraists  at 30 percent, as against 70 percent for renewalists and  integrationists, but they leave the force of Alfonso Guerra's  supporters to the federations of Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria,  Aragon, and Extremadura, with, moreover, a renewalist presence  in the five federations, and in the last-mentioned federation  with an explicit pledge by Juan Carlos Rodriguez Ibarra, its  secretary general and autonomous government premier, to support  integration or, what is the same thing, the presence of Guerra  and Guerraism in the future Executive Committee, but to vote for  Felipe Gonzalez' list, even if integration is not finally  achieved.    These facts and the loss of their traditional fief --  Andalusia, where they have had a big failure -- greatly limit  the Guerraists' ability to pressure the secretary general in  order to force him to reach agreement on the new leadership with  Alfonso Guerra. This is despite the fact that in the official  count the Guerraists claim 35 percent of the party members'  votes, which is more than they are granted by the renewalists,  who insist that the supporters of the party's current number two  total well below one-third.  <H5>  Complicated Alliance </H5>   Nevertheless, the Guerraists have seen their support in the  Madrid Socialist Federation strengthened, and have won over 48  percent of the grassroots votes, albeit with a complicated  alliance with some renewalists disagreeing with Secretary  General Teofilo Serrano and under the last-minute leadership of  former mayor of Madrid Juan Barranco, who enjoys considerable  popularity in the party. But Guerra's supporters themselves  bear in mind that one and a half years ago they were credited  with -- and they themselves claimed -- a strength below 30  percent in their federation.    In Leon, where one of the dirtiest battles with a view to  the  federal congress has taken place, with alleged irregular  memberships, objections to the census, and investigations by the  Federal Executive Committee, the renewalists eventually  triumphed with 63 percent of the votes, which gives them 75  percent of the representation at the March congress, with 14  delegates, as against the five Guerraists.    As the surprises of the past few weeks -- especially in  Andalusia and Murcia -- have confirmed, renewal has been  gradually gaining supporters among the members, especially since  Felipe Gonzalez made some gestures which were interpreted in  that direction, such as, for instance, taking the Executive  Committee to a vote, which he won, for Carlos Solchaga's  appointment as parliamentary group chairman, or the designation  of a government, following the election, in which he placed no  Guerraist. Gonzalez' recent statements, in which he expressed  his support for Guerra's remaining deputy secretary general, and  in which he called for trust to be placed in him to form the  Executive Committee, also contributed to this. In some  renewalists' opinion, these two interventions deprived of  arguments the Guerraists' line, based on the assertion that  their internal opponents wished to exclude the number two from  the Executive Committee, because of which they were demanding  support to sit Gonzalez down with Guerra in order to reach  agreement on the new party leadership's makeup.

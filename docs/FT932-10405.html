			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Gift from grandmother I AM a 19-year-old student at university and live with my parents during the holidays. My grandmother, who is 82, seems determined to give me her house (value Pounds 65,000) in the near future, although she would continue to live there. Would capital gains tax be charged on any appreciation in value from the date of the gift to when it is eventually sold on my grandmother's death? (I doubt if I will ever live there). Second, how does she transfer ownership to me? If the house is never your main residence (in fact or by designation), there will be a CGT liability on its eventual sale if the sale proceeds exceed the market value on the day of the gift by more than the rise in the retail price index, subject to the exempt amount for the tax year of the sale (if you have no other capital gains in that tax year). But if you can conveniently live in the house for a short time - either during your grandmother's lifetime or afterwards - it should be possible to make a substantial reduction in the potential CGT bill by means of notices under section 222(5)(a) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992. Your grandmother will need the assistance of a solicitor in conveying the house to you. Ask a tax office for the free pamphlets CGT4 (Owner-occupied houses) and CGT14 (Capital gains tax: an introduction). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

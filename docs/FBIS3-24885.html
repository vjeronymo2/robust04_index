			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] The international community appears to be gradually  losing patience with the slow progress Liberia's factions are  making toward disarmament and the establishment of a  transitional government. Under the Cotonou Agreement, signed by  the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia], ULIMO [United  Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia], and the interim  government, Liberia should be preparing for multiparty elections  this month but the peace process has virtually ground to a halt  despite the arrival of UN observers and the reinforcements for  ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire  Monitoring Group]. At the end of last week, UN special envoy  Trevor Gordon-Somers carried a message from the Security Council  in New York back to the faction leaders in Liberia and at the  weekend he had a meeting with Charles Taylor in Gbarnga. He is  now back in Monrovia and on the line. Josephine Hazely asked him  what the message says.    [Begin recording] [Gordon-Somers] Well, the Security Council  has issued a communique asking the leaders of the three parties  to demonstrate tangible progress in the process and the Security  Council identified that tangible process as the immediate  commencement of disarmament and the immediate seating of the  transitional government, and also, the council wants a schedule  for the holding of free and fair elections.    [Hazely] How was that message received by Mr. Taylor?    [Gordon-Somers] Very well. He was in complete accord with  the message.    [Hazely] But, what does that mean? I mean, does that take  your negotiations anywhere nearer to the end of this old saga in  Liberia?    [Gordon-Somers] Well, I should think so. If the three  parties, and I might say that not only did Mr. Taylor find the  message acceptable, but I also had met with Dr. Sawyer before  and I had met with Chairman Alhaji Koromah before, and all of  them accepted the thrust of the Security Council message. I  think that is very positive.    [Hazely] Mr. Somers, as you very well know, they always  accept these messages. They always accept these resolutions and  accords, but they do not put them into practice, do they?    [Gordon-Somers] Well, let us say that there has been a  history and there are present circumstances. I would like to  believe that the parties themselves, having been reassured of  the support of the international community, will be able to  translate that into tangible action.    [Hazely] OK, let us talk about tangible action now. When do  you see this transitional government sitting?    [Gordon-Somers] Remember that the sitting of the  transitional  government is clearly the prerogative of the three parties. The  Security Council was not attempting to impose something on the  parties, just to signal to them what the Security Council wants  to see, so I have not yet consulted the three parties together,  which I hope to do soon and see if we can reach an agreement on  that.    [Hazely] As you would realize, what most Liberians want to  know now is: For God's sake, when is the date going to be given  when we have a transitional government, when we have this  disarmament started? I mean, is it not.... [pauses] Is that not  what we want to hear now? The date?    [Gordon-Somers] I share the frustration with all Liberians  who want to hear the date. I, too, want to hear the date, and I  think we are moving to that position. I wish I could be more  forthcoming at this moment, but I cannot be, as you may well  understand. This is a sensitive matter, and it is one in which  the Liberian leadership, with all the counsel that they can get  from Liberians on how soon and how quickly we can move forward.

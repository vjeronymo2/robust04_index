			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / End-of-term fatigue: The Tories face a rough autumn In three short months, elation has given way to foreboding. The Conservative MPs leaving Westminster this week for the long summer recess looked weary and bewildered. Anxiety about the economy and arguments over Europe have long since submerged celebration of the election victory. Within hours of their departure the Bundesbank - again the bete noire of the jingoists on the Tory backbenches - had tightened the screw. Any hopes of a fall in British borrowing costs were dashed by the rise in the German discount rate. The turbulence on the financial markets underlined the possibility that yesterday's mortgage rate rise may not be the last. Prime Minister John Major is adamant he will not change course. He is convinced personally, as well as politically, that Britain cannot retreat now from the rigours of the exchange rate mechanism. He is as committed to the Maastricht treaty as he was last December when he left the conference table declaring 'game, set and match'. But as his cabinet colleagues gathered in 10 Downing Street for end-of-term drinks with the press, they were not pretending it would be easy. 'We'll get through it, but I'm not sure quite how,' one commented. 'There is no question of going back but none of us like starting from here,' said another. Elsewhere a more junior minister wondered aloud whether there was a parallel with the 1960s. The then Mr Harold Wilson had been elected in 1966 determined not to devalue the pound. The subsequent U-turn destroyed his Labour government. A fourth Tory term should have provided the catalyst for recovery. Ministers and backbenchers alike were convinced Mr Major's return to Downing Street would reawaken the confidence needed to haul the economy out of recession. It did not. Instead Tory MPs left for their holidays clutching an admission from Mr Norman Lamont that, even when it came, the recovery would be slow and unspectacular. The chancellor could only exhort them to keep their nerve. Then there is Europe. The skilfully crafted compromise negotiated by Mr Major at Maastricht was meant to bind the party's wounds. The Danish referendum and the exploitation by Euro-sceptics of the link between the recession and the ERM have reopened them. Lady Thatcher long ago decided that her passionate antagonism to Brussels came before loyalty to her successor. Now ministers fear that she will seek to upstage his victory celebration at the party conference in October by launching another tirade from the sidelines. So Mr Major is bracing himself for a rough autumn. The internal forecasts circulating in Whitehall suggest that, at best, output will stagnate this year. Treasury ministers would not be surprised if it fell for the second year in succession. The prime minister's judgment is that an upturn in domestic confidence - prompting consumers to stop saving and start spending - will not be delayed indefinitely. He has always said that the pace of recovery would be measured. But there is acknowledgement also that an array of uncertainties - the US presidential elections, the German interest rate squeeze and a deadlocked Gatt trade round among them - provides an inauspicious international backdrop. With that comes the tacit admission that the party conference and the return of parliament will herald a much more serious bout of party unrest. Recent outbursts owe something to post-election weariness and a realisation among the old hands that a government majority of 21 rather than 100 means many more late nights at Westminster. Precocious newcomers to the Commons chamber have found it hard to adjust to the notion that blind loyalty is more important than freedom of speech. A few weeks beside swimming pools in the Tuscan hills or on the beaches of southern France might provide a partial cure. But the economy and Europe are issues that do not go away. Local Tory constituency associations are full of the small business owners who have borne the brunt of the recession. White-collar unemployment and falling house prices strike at Conservative self-confidence. Party activists and MPs alike applaud the principle of lower public spending, but this year the reality of Treasury cuts in spending on schools, hospitals and roads will add to the gloom. The Euro-sceptics have been quick to capitalise on the unease. The ERM and Maastricht are cast as part of the conspiracy to submerge British sovereignty: Brussels will run the UK's foreign affairs, the Bundesbank its economy. It was a message that the Conservatives flatly rejected two years ago; one that led directly to the downfall of Lady Thatcher. But the prospect of 3m unemployed provides more fertile ground. Mr John Smith will maximise the discomfort. His leadership victory later today will strengthen rather than weaken Labour's commitment to Britain's place in Europe. But Mr Smith has already injected flexibility into his stance on sterling's exchange rate parity. Opponents should not underestimate the prime minister. Mr Major's sights are on the medium term - on 1996 rather than October 1992. He has more grit than many on his own side realise. Not all in his cabinet were enthusiastic backers of the ERM, but they agree that to retreat now would destroy the Tory party as well as its leader. That leader is convinced the prophets of doom predicting a slide from recession into slump are wrong. If the financial markets test his resolve, he is willing to put up interest rates to defend sterling. He plans to deliver on his promise of sustained low inflation. He calculates also that in spite of all the noise on the backbenches only a handful of irreconcilables in the end will rebel against his policies. His followers have nowhere else to go unless they want to risk defeat in another election. Mr Major is prime minister because he has proved himself a shrewd judge of his party's mood. The best guess at Westminster is that he will again be proved right. But it will be rough - for the Tory party and for the economy.</p>

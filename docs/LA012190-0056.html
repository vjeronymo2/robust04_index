			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> TURKEY, OLD FOES LOOK BACK ON GALLIPOLI  </P> <P> Seventy-five years after the epic Gallipoli battle, Turkey and its World War I  foes plan to join forces to commemorate a campaign that produced both chivalry  and mass slaughter.  </P> <P> Some 120 veterans in their 90s, Australian, British, French and Turkish  warships and national leaders will converge on Gallipoli for the April 25  ceremonies, organizers said.  </P> <P> It will probably be the only time that such a ceremony will be held for the  battle, which saw the rise of modern Turkey's founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk,  and gave Australia and New Zealand their first real sense of nationhood.  </P> <P> Officials said Turkish President Turgut Ozal, Australian Prime Minister Bob  Hawke, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, New Zealand Governor-General  Sir Paul Reeves, other government ministers, diplomats and senior officers are  likely to attend.  </P> <P> Preparations are being conducted with military precision, down to doctors for  the veterans and accommodations on land and at sea off the sparsely populated  peninsula.  </P> <P> "Australia and New Zealand are the only Western countries which have a positive  image of Turkey. The reason is common experiences in battle," a Foreign  Ministry official said.  </P> <P> "Their first encounter was in a battle that commanded respect on both sides  from the way they fought and the way they endured," the official told Reuters.  </P> <P> Most of the veterans are expected to come from Australia and New Zealand, which  mark April 25 as a public day of remembrance.  </P> <P> "We have asked Turkey to identify any of their vets (veterans) but we don't  think they have many because of lower life expectancy here," an Australian  diplomat said.  </P> <P> For Britain, which headed the Allied force, which also included soldiers from  India, the campaign -- originally inspired by Winston Churchill -- was a fiasco  brought about largely by poor intelligence, questionable command and  ill-equipped troops.  </P> <P> The plan was to send warships up the narrow Dardanelles straits to reach  Constantinople, now Istanbul, and so take Ottoman Turkey, a German ally, out of  the war.  </P> <P> However, Turkish forces, led by German Gen. Limon von Sanders, ripped into the  Allied fleet in March, 1915, putting out of action or destroying six of nine  battleships.  </P> <P> At dawn a month later, on April 25, Allied troops landed at what is now known  as ANZAC (Australia and New Zealand Army Corps) Cove and elsewhere at the start  of trench battles involving a total of some one million troops from both sides.  </P> <P> Official records said there were 46,000 deaths among British and French troops  while 86,692 Turks were killed. Unofficial estimates put Turkish deaths at up  to 250,000.  </P> <P> Reports of the prolonged battle, in which machine guns held sway against  advancing troops, tell of instances when charity overcame hostility between the  two sides.  </P> <P> After one engagement, Turkish troops held up placards from their trenches  saying they were hungry. ANZAC soldiers threw over tins of beef and received  Turkish cigarettes in return.  </P> <P> The campaign ended Jan. 8, 1916, with an ignominious Allied withdrawal.  </P> <P> Although dwarfed by the carnage on the war's Western Front, Gallipoli was  horrific by previous standards of modern warfare and a shock to the young  nations of Australia and New Zealand.  </P> <P> "Gallipoli is very much part of the national character of both countries. It  signified for many people the start of Australian and New Zealand nationhood,"  one diplomat said.  </P> <P> The Allies have marked each April 25 with ceremonies at cemeteries and sites  whose names, including Ari Burnu, Chunuk Bair and Lone Pine, have passed into  Australasian folklore.  </P> <P> The Turkish military traditionally celebrates March 18, when its guns and mines  halted the Allied fleet.  </P> <P> Ataturk, who played a major role as a senior officer at Gallipoli, founded the  Turkish republic from the ashes of the Ottoman Empire seven years after the  battle.  </P></p>

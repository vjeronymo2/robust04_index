			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: News Corporation Mr Rupert Murdoch has hardly put a foot wrong recently, as his latest burst of deal-making and the 10-fold increase in News Corporation's shares since 1991 testify. But he trod in something nasty yesterday as News reported a 5 per cent fall in first-quarter operating profits and the controversy resurfaced over its plans for a new class of super voting shares with a discussion paper from the Australian stock exchange. News's book publishing profits were weaker and problems grew at its free-standing insert division. But the real hit came from its price-cutting campaign in the UK, where newspaper profits slid 15 per cent. Thanks to his non-executive directorship at Philip Morris, Mr Murdoch has had a ring-side seat watching similar pricing punch-ups in the US. But Marlboro's assault has led to a fearful bruising and US cigarette prices now appear to be edging up again. The suspicion grows that any imposition of VAT on newspapers would cloak restorative price rises on its UK titles. The Australian stock exchange is treading gingerly over News's share proposals. It may worry that if it blocks the scheme, its second most heavily traded stock will switch its listing to the US. But that is no reason to concede a point of principle. Besides, News can hardly count on an ecstatic reception in New York. Calpers has been among the most vociferous critics of the share proposal. Moreover, there was heavy selling of News's ADRs after disappointment grew with its first-quarter results.</p>

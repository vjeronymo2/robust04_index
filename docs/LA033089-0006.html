			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BATTERED WOMEN  </P> <P> Andrea Dworkin's column ("Living in Terror, Pain: Being a Battered Wife,"  Opinion, March 12) about the realities of living in a battering situation was  excellent.  </P> <P> I am a family therapist at Cedar House, a child abuse treatment program. Many  abused children grow up in homes where battering is a way of life.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, Dworkin is correct -- unless the cycle is broken, children grow  up and become adult victims or batterers.  </P> <P> Programs like Cedar House treat the children now in an attempt to stop the  cycle. These programs are valuable assets to the community. The programs we  have need to be expanded, and there is a need for many additional ones.  </P> <P> MARY JO HAZARD  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

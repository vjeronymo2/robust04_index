			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Technology: Stained glass window dressing - Worth Watching Stained glass windows suffer from pollution just as much as masonry. But to prevent further deterioration restorers have to isolate the cause of the corrosion and the potential damage. This is where scientists from the Fraunhofer Silicate Research Institute in Wurzburg, Germany, have stepped in. One of them, Dieter Fuchs, has developed a type of glass that corrodes much faster than normal. By placing pieces of it, each just a few centimetres square, on the surface of the windows, the mini-sensors show what could happen to the glass in the future. Corrosion measurements are taken using infra-red light to enable restorers to calculate the best way of treating the stained glass. Fraunhofer Silicate Research Institute: Germany, 931 4149 0962.</p>

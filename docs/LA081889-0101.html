			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAGAZINES: PIX! FAX! FLASH!;  </P> <P> THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES TO KEEP BOP ON TOP OF TEENZINE SCENE  </P> <P> Hey, all you Bopperoos in Bop-land: Like, can you believe it! Summer's almost  over! But don't lose your cool, 'cuz Bop writer Carmen Carmalatta wants you to  get comfy with all your faves! Alyssa! Corey! Deb! And those five incredible,  total babes New Kids On The Block! Donnie! Danny! Joe! Jon! Jordan! Fluff up  your pillows, stargazers, and let's schmoooooze!!!!  </P> <P>  Like, let's do the teenzine thing, people! And we're not talking about a new  dance craze. We're talking 'bout a generation of rad-reading teens hooked on  the poster-filled pages of Teen Town Celebs splashed in Bop and The Big Bopper  -- top teen-fan mags brought to you by the princess of Bopland, Los Angeles'  own Julie Laufer!  </P> <P> Though this July 2, 1962, birthday girl and editor of the West Coast's top  teenzines left her bubble gum on the bedpost eight years ago, she's still a  teeny-bopper at heart! So are this Valley Girl's staff of college-grad news  hounds, who go after Tinseltown tidbits for their 400,000 readers!  </P> <P> Where do they get all that energy?!  </P> <P> Hey, the teen stars they write about, and the teen readers who pore over the  pages put out by Laufer's 22- to 32-year-old staff, take this business  seriously!  </P> <P> There's warmth in their words, sensitivity in their stories, and, for sure,  lots of hype and hipness in the BIG, BOLD headlines that tease fans to discover  why "Johnny Depp Is So Hurt!" or read about "The Day Corey Haim Will Never  Forget!" or why Kirk Cameron says, "I Can't Take It Too Seriously!"  </P> <P> Just how does Laufer's crew try to out-scoop the dozen or so other teenzines  out there?  </P> <P> Read on Boppers!  </P> <P> But, first, let's cool the exclamation points and go to our panel of teen  experts -- a couple of multitalented fabulous fellas we had a chance to talk  with while curled up at our desks with a few of our fave Bop and TBB (teen talk  for The Big Bopper) periodicals.  </P> <P> The $100-million-plus-a-year teenzine industry is a growing one, says Peter  Zollo, president of Teenage Research Unlimited, a Northbrook, Ill.-based youth  marketing firm.  </P> <P> He says that 12- to 19-year-olds -- kids his agency calls "Skippies," or school  kids with income and purchasing power -- spend about $30 billion of their own  money annually on items from tennis shoes to teenzines, which fall into two  groups.  </P> <P> Teen-fan periodicals like Bop and TBB rely almost exclusively on newsstand and  magazine-generated product sales, have no advertising and strictly adhere to  lively written teen celeb stories about who's doing what with whom and where.  But the stories never get steamier than what celebs are exchanging phone  numbers. And photos are never hotter than a hand-holding twosome at a teen  party.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Outlets  </P> <P> The other teenzine category includes such notables as Seventeen and the Los  Angeles-based Teen, which are subscription- and advertiser-driven and focus  articles on self-improvement and intellectual growth, Zollo says.  </P> <P> Wow, is this guy brainy or what!  </P> <P> Magazine expert Samir Husni, author of the "1988 Guide to Magazines," says "the  whole magazine climate is on the rise, especially teen-fan magazines because of  kids who are part of the MTV and Nickelodian generation."  </P> <P> This professor-author-lecturer says the magazines are big sellers mostly with  the 20 million 10- to 15-year-old girls known as the "tween" group or  in-between teens.  </P> <P> "The teenzines are still cheaper than buying a poster or a book about a teen  star," Husni says. "Readers can get the whole catch from Kirk to whoever is hot  on the Top 40 in one issue."  </P> <P> That's what Laufer has offered readers month after month for six years, never  tiring of dashing to teen celebrity birthday bashes sans drugs and booze, movie  sets sans violence, sound stages sans heavy metal or video tapings sans sex and  lies. She exults in escorting Bop contest winners backstage at concerts, which  produce copy cleaner than a Clearasil-cleansed complexion.  </P> <P> Any good teenzine editor knows that Rule No. 1 is to always be positive.  </P> <P> And this 27-year-old editor, born under the sign of Cancer, is one groovy  chick. So are her five staff writers -- all women who, like the teens they  write for, occasionally do go ga-ga over the guys they interview.  </P> <P> But don't call these young-at-heart women cradle-robbers!  </P> <P> They're more like older sisters, says Laufer, whose photos with many of the  teen stars accompany gossip columns. One of Laufer's faves is her very own  Secrets from Hollywood.  </P> <P> For instance, there's Laufer pictured with blond teen star Jonathan Ward of the  television show "Charles in Charge." He "made me giggle when I met up with him  at a Hollywood party," she writes.  </P> <P> Flip through the pages and you'll find Laufer and other staffers immortalized  on fast-speed film with the singing group New Kids On The Block, more teenfully  known as the NKOTBs; Laufer with singer Deborah/Deb/Debbie Gibson; Laufer with  "Growing Pains" star Cameron; Laufer with "Who's The Boss?" co-star Alyssa  Milano, and Laufer with "My Two Dads' " teen sensation Staci Keanan.  </P> <P> Talk about a role model!  </P> <P> "This wasn't something that I had planned to go into," Laufer says, then adds  she's glad she did.  </P> <P> Based on the tens of thousands of letters received monthly, she says her  teenzines are making a difference in the lives of girls -- they're 90%-95% of  her readers -- who plunk down allowances for her publications.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Take Readers Seriously'  </P> <P> "We take our readers very seriously," she says. "A lot of the girls come from  broken homes or are not in the happiest of homes."  </P> <P> She says the average reader is middle class, has few friends, is not the most  popular girl in school and probably doesn't have a boyfriend.  </P> <P> "They read us to escape," she says. And in the process, to learn just a little  about teen life through the stories that reveal how teen stars also struggle to  find acceptance among peers and parents.  </P> <P> Laufer also takes pride in knowing that Bop and TBB promote literacy. "If we  can get kids to read us, then we must be doing something right," she says.  </P> <P> Her father, Charles Laufer, creator and former editor of Teen and former  publisher of Tiger Beat, was the undisputed West Coast teenzine king when he  started the magazines almost 40 years ago to interest kids in reading. ("I  wasn't even born yet when my dad started Tiger Beat," she says.) Her dad sold  the businesses and retired about 10 years ago.  </P> <P> These days, Julie and brother Scott, 28, president of Laufer Publishing, have  put the family name back atop the teen heap. Two married sisters, Teena (named  after Teen magazine) Naumann and Kerry Getson, Bop's first editor, serve on the  board of directors of the company, which is privately held and will not  disclose its annual revenues.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Private Investments  </P> <P> Her siblings pulled together resources from private investments and started Bop  in the summer of 1983 with Michael J. Fox dominating almost every cover. These  days -- because of his married man-father status -- a magnifying glass is  needed to find Fox's photo among Bopdom's newer bachelor boys who outnumber  (almost 3 to 1) the teen girls splashed on pages.  </P> <P> Three years ago, The Big Bopper was born to meet the demand among readers for  more teen celebrity stories that all couldn't squeeze into Bop. Today it is  fast approaching the 200,000 circulation mark. The combined circulations of  both teenzines are giving the East Coast competition a run for its money and  bubble-gum-chewing readers.  </P> <P> How do editor Julie and her crew meet the challenges of the publishing world?  Like the stars they write about -- with energy, enthusiasm and Rule No. 2: "We  have to make every story better than the last," she says.  </P> <P> That mean's producing flashy issues crammed with pix (teenzine lingo for  photos) and fax (teenzine lingo for facts) from shoe size to birth date to the  dating woes of a teen babe, or as Laufer puts it: "Personal things readers can  relate to."  </P> <P> And don't forget the pages and pages of pinups and posters of pubescent teen  hunks whose torsos are fully clothed, of course. One does not pick up Laufer  publications for gawking at pint-sized stars in teeny-weeny swimming trunks.  </P> <P> No way! says the editor.  </P> <P> Freckles may meet fantasy in Laufer's teenzines but that's where the Bop stops.  Besides, Laufer adds, that's where Rule No. 3 comes in: Go crazy with  exclamation points! They use as many as 53 of them on a single page!! "They're  cheerful!" Laufer says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Kissing-Star Poems  </P> <P> This is about as risque as Bop and its sister publication get, though fans, for  possible publication, do send poems about kissing male teen stars on the beach.  </P> <P> "We don't tackle heavy subjects and we don't want to be preachy, sexy or  negative about anyone," Laufer says. "If we can cover a story and influence a  reader in a positive way, that's great! We've reached our goal!"  </P> <P> Still, there are times when a teen's star does get tarnished, she acknowledges.  Take for instance the substance abuse troubles of notable Hollywood youth.  </P> <P> Who, Julie, who?! Prodded for names, she finally relents: Haim and Drew  Barrymore, who both went public with their problem, got help and now are  members of the Just Say No gang.  </P> <P> Teen stars -- those who have reformed and are back on top -- meet with writers  to spill the details of what went awry. They make amends with readers,  sometimes in two-part series with lots of quotes from Mom and lots of pix.  </P> <P> Managing editor Sally Dobruskin, 26, says readers are mostly drawn to the teen  posters "of the fellas."  </P> <P> She fires away teen star's names with the aplomb of a well-read 14-year-old and  adds that the NKOTB guys "have been our centerfold for the past four months.  They are big!!! They're gonna get bigger!!! They're the hottest!!!"  </P> <P> We're sold, Sal!  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Ask Alyssa'  </P> <P> Dobruskin also works with teen star Milano, who writes a monthly "Ask Alyssa"  advice column that receives more than 200 letters a week. Fans in-the-know  address mail simply to "Lyss," whose photo in next month's TBB appears 21 times  to Gibson's 10.  </P> <P> For two years, Milano, 16, has been a dynamo Dear Abby-Heloise-Dr. Ruth  teenologist, answering not more than seven questions a month about health,  beauty, peer pressure and self-esteem.  </P> <P> One of our fave queries from an admiring adolescent fan: "How are ya doin'  Alyssa? I'm only 12 years old, but I've had white hairs growing out of my head  since the fourth-grade. Some of my friends say it's because I worry too much or  that I'm in love. Do you know the answer?"  </P> <P>  You bet she does!  </P> <P> But you'll have to buy November's TBB to find out.  </P> <P> "I feel a real sense of responsibility to the readers and my fans," says  Milano, discussing her column after a photo shoot at Laufer Publishing's swank  eighth-floor office suite in Burbank.  </P> <P> "My fans also want to know how I deal with the paparazzi and how it feels to  ride in stretch limos because they see those pictures of me in the magazines,"  she says.  </P> <P> Still, she wants to be a totally positive force for fans: "If they look up to  me as a role model, then I want to be the best one around. I want to help."  </P> <P> Newcomer Jay Ferguson, 15, who will portray Pony Boy in the fall Fox TV series  "The Outsiders," hopes to fill his high-tops with high marks among readers. Bop  publishers have singled out the Dallas-born Ferguson as a face most likely to  cause a major meltdown with fans.  </P> <P> "I'm not really prepared for anything, all this is new to me," he says after  being interviewed for Bop and TBB by Laurel Dewey, the magazines' 28-year-old  assistant editor. "Other teen stars tell me not to fool around and to stay  concentrated," Ferguson says. And, to try to get as much exposure as possible,  which suits teenzine editors just fine.  </P> <P> "Some teen stars are difficult to get interviews with," says Dewey. "They're  either too shy or feel they've outgrown us." But that doesn't stop either  teenzine from getting the story, photos or juicy tidbits readers want.  </P> <P> Dewey's "Hot From Hollywood" column, which reads more like Rona Barrett with  barrettes, is a fave with fans. Next month's offering reveals that 18-year-old  singer Gibson has decided to sub pizza and cola with "a more nutritious diet!"  NKOTB's Donnie Wahlberg spills the beans on a promise "to telephone Bop every  three to four weeks to share all the exciting New Kids adventures!"  </P> <P> But don't accuse Dewey or her co-workers of catering to stars barely out of  braces. They take their cues from reader mail. Says Dewey: "We print stories  for the readers, not for the artists, not for the management companies and not  for publicists."  </P> <P> For readers, it really doesn't matter. Even rewrites of resumes will do in a  fix, says Glendale teen reader Darlene Balderas.  </P> <P> Balderas, 14, retreats to her bedroom with teenzines in tow to relax from the  rigors of passing through puberty. "I don't have to worry about things," she  says of her escape into the magazines teeming with teen stars.  </P> <P> Her 12-year-old sister, Alba, also is hooked, she says, adding: "My walls are  covered with posters" pulled from the periodicals.  </P> <P> Thirteen-year-old Los Angeles gal-pals Tracey Andrews and Anna Perez catch a  few zzz's with their teenzines under their pillows.  </P> <P> "I can't believe I'm telling you this," Anna confides, then giggles while  standing at a grocery newsstand. "But I'm buying two of this issue."  </P> <P> Why? Because somewhere in Bopland, TBB editors have -- oops! -- put Joe  McIntyre, the fave babe among the NKOTB singers, and teen movie heartbreaker  Corey Feldman back-to-back on the same page!  </P> <P> </P> <P> Double Dilemma  </P> <P> It's a double dilemma all too familiar to Bopsters everywhere. Laura Adelmann,  15, of Cincinnati and Joanne Casale, 14, of Cranston, R.I., also have bought  two copies of the same issue.  </P> <P> But not to worry, Bopperoos! These kids are rolling in allowances!  </P> <P> Laura saves her weekly $5 allowance and earnings from baby-sitting jobs to keep  up with famous kids her age. This NKOTB-lover and secret admirer of teen  heartthrobs Wil Wheaton, Corin (Corky) Nemec and Chad Allen has been a devoted  teenzine reader for almost two years.  </P> <P> Three months ago, as one of two Bop and TBB contest winners, Laura spent five  days in Los Angeles meeting many of the teen personalities whose posters are  plastered above her bed. "My friends were jealous of me! I'll be the talk of my  school in September!" she says.  </P> <P> Like Laura, perky 14-year-old Joanne and her 9-year-old sis, Adriana, spend  their allowances on teenzines including Bop and TBB. Joanne likes the  interviews with TV and music stars. But she's especially crazy for teen celeb  guys who know how to have fun "but also go after what they want."  </P> <P> "It's good that there are positive images for young people to follow," she  says. "My friends and I are holding our breaths for the next issue!"  </P> <P> </P> <P> TEENZINE'S TOP 10Here, ranked by newsstand sales volume, are the hottest teen  magazines in Los Angeles and Orange counties.  </P> <P> 1.

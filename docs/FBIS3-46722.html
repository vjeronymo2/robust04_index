			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> ["Summary" of remarks by unidentified "senior U.S. </F> Government official" at news conference at U.S. Embassy in Tokyo  following 12-13 October U.S.-Japan discussions on insurance]    [Text] Two days of discussions were held regarding the  insurance issue as one of the areas of negotiations. The aims of  the United States in this area are to broadly increase market  access for foreign insurers in the Japan market, and to insure  the growth of sales of insurance products and services offered  by foreign insurers with broad competitiveness in the Japan  market. We have surveyed the Japan market for months, and have  tried to understand why the share of foreign insurers is  extremely low.    Three data sources were used. The first was the report  submitted by the Insurance Council in June 1992. The second data  source was the various comments made by Japanese experts,  scholars, and the representatives of Japan's insurance industry.  The third source consisted of members of the insurance committee  of the ACCJ [American Chamber of Commerce in Japan], who are  U.S. insurers operating in Japan, and also data from U.S.  insurers who have relations with Japan.    At the meeting on the 12th (October), the Japanese  Government  discussed mainly its points of concern vis-a-vis the U.S.  market. Mr. Wall, the vice president of NAIC [National  Association of Insurance Commissioners], came to Japan on this  occasion as one of the delegates and held a press conference  yesterday at the U.S. Embassy. He explained about the U.S.  market, saying that, although the Japanese Government criticizes  the U.S. market, the criticism is unfounded.    Today, the U.S. proposal was submitted to the Japanese  Government. The content corresponds considerably with the report  submitted by the Insurance Council. Frankly, however, the U.S.  proposal is more concrete in its content.    I cannot talk concretely today about the content of the  discussions exchanged with Japan's Ministry of Finance. Instead,  I would like to simply stress some principal points as to why we  are concerned about Japan's insurance market and system.    The first point is that we feel that the lack of  transparency  in the Japan market is a serious problem. For example, at the  present point in time, we are in a situation where it is  difficult for us to sufficiently understand what the  prerequisite conditions are to receive business licenses in  Japan. We believe that it is necessary to make thoroughly public  the existing rules and guidelines, including guidance, in order  to maintain transparency. Also, when new policies are introduced  in the future, they should be made fully public.    The second problem point is that foreign insurers are unable  to participate in the forums of insurer organizations and the  Insurance Council. We believe that participation by foreign  insurers in such industry organizations and the council should  be recognized on a similar basis as participation by Japan's  insurer companies.    We would also like to have participation by foreign insurers  be recognized not only in insurance, but also in the councils  and committees controlled and sponsored by the Japanese  government, as well as in the insurer organizations at the  private level.    The third problem point is the basic thinking regarding  liberalization. Of course, in order to maintain solvency and to  protect the consumers and insurees, regulation is necessary.  However, if the existence of regulation should conversely deter  reform and competitiveness, it would result in injury to the  consumers and insurees. The report of the Insurance Council has  repeatedly pointed out that promotion of competition is the  purpose in easing controls, and we fully agree on this point.    We also believe that licensing procedures regarding  insurance  products and services should change to a registration system. In  other words, we believe that the discretionary authority held by  the bureaucrats should be abolished. And we believe that, as  long as there is no problem of solvency, and as long as there is  no problem from the standpoint of the consumers and insurees,  new products should be authorized automatically. To rephrase it,  except in cases where consumer interests are injured, or in  cases where there is a solvency problem, new products and  services should be authorized immediately.    I would like to move on to the problem of insurance brokers.  Insurance brokers are people who are legally authorized or  requested to speak for the interests of not the insurance  companies, but for the consumers who use insurance. At present,  the broker system is prohibited in Japan. It is stated in the  Insurance Council's report that it will be possible to offer  services to the consumers by authorizing a broker system, and it  strongly demands the introduction of such a system in Japan.    Next, I would like to talk about the problem of the third  sector. There is noticeable newspaper reporting that "the United  States opposes easing of controls over insurance in Japan," but  such reporting is inaccurate and irresponsible. Regarding easing  of controls in the third sector, it is written in the Insurance  Council's report that a step-by-step approach should be adopted.  Particularly concerning the insurance area where smaller  companies and foreign insurers participate actively, it is  written that easing controls in the third sector should be  implemented gradually.    We agree with that portion of the report's content. The  reason is that market practices have been built up over many  years and cannot be eradicated overnight. We believe that it is  necessary to allow a transitional period prior to reaching a  completely new and deregulated situation.    As for the "keiretsu" problem, the ACCJ has compiled its  survey findings on Japan's insurance market. It reports that  "generally Japan's `keiretsu' companies conduct transactions  with insurance companies of the same 'keiretsu' in an  overwhelming number of cases."    Because the process of easing controls is continuing, we  believe that this problem must absolutely be dealt with. At  least regarding the "keiretsu," it is a problem that Japan's  Fair Trade Commission should investigate.  <H3>  Trade Sanctions Will Not Be Applied Despite Unattainment of  Figures; Concern About 2-Percent Foreign Share in Japan </H3>   Our goal in the framework discussions is results. We have  conducted negotiations with Japan regarding trade agreements  over a number of years, and procedures and processes have  changed during the period. Also, rules have been revised.  However, Japan's market itself has not changed, and such a  situation cannot be tolerated by the United States. We hope that  concrete results that can be approved will come out of the  Japan-U.S. trade negotiations. By using qualitative and  quantitative indices within the framework negotiations, it will  be possible to evaluate whether the agreed items will prove  successful.    There is one thing I would like to stress. We are absolutely  not contemplating a situation where figures are used to decide a  market share with a time limit and, if the share is not achieved  within the time limit, a trade measure is enforced with the  United States retaliating against Japan.    Our intention is rather to use a group of quantitative and  qualitative indices and, based on new rules and regulations, to  determine whether Japan's market is undergoing a change.    I would like for you to look at this table [not translated].  The shares for foreign insurers are as follows: 18 percent in  Canada, 10 percent in France and 2 percent in Japan. In the  United States, foreign insurers who are licensed in the United  States have a 7-percent share. In addition, foreign insurers are  able to offer unregistered insurance products called subline  products and, if this is included, it would exceed 10 percent.  In other words, these figures indicate an important fact that  Japan is an outsider positioned in a totally different location  than the other G-7 nations.    In July when the framework agreement was reached, the  judgment was made that, from the standpoint of macroeconomic  measurement criteria, Japan stood in a completely different  location from the advanced nations. In other words, looking at  the operating balance surplus versus the GDP [gross domestic  product] and the import ratio--particularly the product import  ratio versus the GNP, an extremely large gap exists between  Japan's level and the level of the other advanced nations.    It is extremely difficult to gather figures from other  nations for comparison. Consequently, the sources of these  figures vary in each nation. Also, we believe that the figures  submitted to the OECD are unusable. The reason is that the  figures reported to the OECD have different definitions used by  the respective nations in collecting data. Because there is  postal insurance in Japan, the denominator becomes larger when  postal insurance is included, and the share become lower than 2  percent.    Compared to the other G-7 nations, Japan's insurance market  is really closed. The share of foreign companies in Britain is  25 percent, 33 percent in Italy, and 10-13 percent even in the  United States, France, and Germany, so the gaps with Japan are  extremely large.    Our purpose is to see the Japan market gradually draw closer  to the other advanced nations. The Ministry of Finance says that  the share of Japan's insurers in the U.S. market is extremely  small, and that it is particularly small compared with the  market share of U.S. insurers in Japan. This is an interesting  statement, but we believe the figures are inappropriate or  unrelated for use in this forum.    That is to say, what we must look at is how open each nation  is vis-a-vis foreign insurers as a whole regarding a specific  market. We are not considering the problem of how a specific  nation's insurers are faring in a specific nation.    Also, what we indicated in our negotiations with the  Japanese  Government under the framework agreement are all based on what  we observed multilaterally, and can be applied to other nations  on a most-favored-nation base. The results of the negotiations  with the Japanese Government will generally be applied similarly  to all nations. It will be likewise regarding insurance,  telecommunications, autos, auto parts, and medical care  equipment.    According to the data prepared by the NAIC, Japan's insurers  are generally not very successful in the U.S. market, but the  insurers of other nations are successful in the United States.    Although we are told that Japan's insurers are not  succeeding  in the United States, the reason is not because the U.S.  insurance market is closed or because there is discriminatory  treatment.    We do not know the reasons why Japan's share is low in the  United States, but insuffficient efforts by the Japanese side,  indifference toward the U.S. market, or a lack of  competitiveness are conceivable reasons. Perhaps it is because  the Japanese companies do business only with the so-called  traditional customers who have advanced into the United States.  In any case, what is clear is that other foreign insurers  besides those of Japan are very successful in the United States,  and the criticism by Japan that the U.S. insurance market is  closed is inaccurate and unfair.</p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / EC, Asean seek to circumvent impasse on E Timor FOREIGN ministers of the European Community and the Association of South-East Asian Nations meet this week without being able to make progress on a planned new co-operation agreement. Negotiations on a new accord, to replace one signed in 1980, were halted earlier this year because of Portugal's opposition to Indonesia's human rights record in the former Portuguese colony of East Timor. Friday's meeting in Manila, to be chaired by Britain as EC president, will attempt to circumvent the impasse temporarily by attaching new areas of co-operation to existing arrangements. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, will arrive in Manila on Friday but Mr Alastair Goodlad, foreign office minister responsible for the region, will stand in for him in earlier sessions. The inability to proceed with a new accord, due to include provisions for resolving trade disputes and on European Investment Bank lending, is frustrating for both sides. At the Manila meeting, the EC and Asean are expected to agree on an enhanced consultative mechanism under which trade experts will meet more frequently. Access of Asean members to EIB lending is also expected to be supported, though not to the extent which would be possible under a full new agreement. Portugal and Indonesia are discussing their differences over East Timor, which was annexed by Indonesia in 1975, under the auspices of the United Nations secretary-general. Indonesian troops shot dead at least 50 civilian protestors in Dili, the territory's capital, last November.</p>

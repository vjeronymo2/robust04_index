			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Primaries to be held earlier THE US presidential party primaries of 1996 promise to be less of a marathon as a result of action taken recently by several states bringing forward election dates. This week Governor Pete Wilson of California signed into law a bill setting the last Tuesday in March, rather than the first in June, as primary day. Last week Governor George Voinovich of Ohio did the same with a bill that would have his state vote on the third Tuesday in March, the same as Michigan and Illinois, rather than in mid-May. Wisconsin and Pennsylvania may follow suit. March now looms as a pivotal month, with in effect three regional primaries  -the south at the start of the month, the Midwest around the middle and California, the biggest state, in the west at the end. Hitherto, states with late primaries have felt left out. California has not held a truly decisive primary since 1972.</p>

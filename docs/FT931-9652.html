			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Technology: Safety in the cot - Worth Watching A low-cost monitor intended to save the lives of babies at risk from cot death has won first prize in the Toshiba Year of Invention competition for an 18-year-old Scottish schoolboy. The Breathe Sure monitor should sell for about Pounds 60, compared with several hundreds of pounds for the monitors used in many hospitals. An Edinburgh company of medical equipment suppliers, JMW Systems, is already building prototypes. The Breathe Sure sensor, which is attached to a cloth belt, picks up the infant's breathing. Each time a breath is detected a green light flashes on the electronic monitor which is hung from the cot or pram. Should breathing stop or become irregular an alarm sounds. JMW Systems: UK, 031 440 3633.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Reports by </F> diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Voskoboinikov, Igor Porshnev,  Vitaly Trubetskoy, and others]    [Text] Moscow does not want to play any "special role" in  the talks between the Dushanbe Government and the opposition.  The talks will proceed by the two plus one formula, where two  are the Tajik factions and one is the U.S. under whose auspices  the talks are held.    According to a senior Russian Foreign Ministry official,  Russian diplomats will not be present at the talks unless UN  representatives want them to. "They attend the Wednesday  session because (Ramiro Perez)-Bollon, UN Secretary General's  special envoy, invited them. But as early as Thursday the talks  may continue without them," the diplomat said.    He said that Russia had probably played the decisive role at  the stage of setting the scene for the talks. "This does not  imply, however, that our role will be as important as that at  subsequent stages. We in Moscow believe that all the observers,  Russia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan,  Pakistan and Iran, have equal rights. We do not intend to  impose our views. Our goal is peace in Tajikistan and around  it."    The diplomat could not say how long the Moscow round of talk  will take. "No timetable for the talks has been set but we hope  that the two sides will achieve significant results in Moscow.  They seem to be in the right mood for that," he said.    The diplomat explained that a comprehensive solution was not  on the Moscow agenda. "What is important is that the two sides  have sat for a talk. If they could agree on ending the  hostilities, the Moscow round would be regarded as a success,"  he noted.    According to the diplomat, "the dialog that has started is a  positive event for the sole reason that it will show who really  wants a national reconciliation in Tajikistan. It will be an  acid test which cannot be  cheated.</p>

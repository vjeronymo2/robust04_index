			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Mexico Auctions Its Largest Copper Mine: The apparent winning bidder for the  bankrupt, government-owned Cananea mine was Grupo Industrial Minera de Mexico,  with an offer of $475 million.  </P> <P> The firm produces 57% of Mexico's copper. The only other bidder, a group headed  by construction magnate Bernardo Quintana, complained that awarding the mine to  Grupo Industrial Minera de Mexico would create a monopoly. The mine is in  Sonora state about 12 miles south of the Arizona border.  </P></p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Arts: The angry wasp of Victorian painting - A look at a landmark exhibition of the work of the artist James McNeill Whistler James Whistler - expatriate American, protege of Courbet, friend of Degas, verbal sparring partner of Oscar Wilde, open enemy of anyone who, like Sickert, crossed his path - still enjoys a reputation that buzzes through the anecdotal cultural life of late Victorian London like an angry wasp. He has always been recognised as a true and original artist, at least by other artists. Yet this full retrospective of his work is, we learn, the first since the international memorial shows of 1905, some two years after his death. It is, one feels, somewhat overdue. But then criticism has always had trouble with the maverick, always so difficult to put and keep in place. Whistler endured its hostility in his lifetime, and his mistake, perhaps, was to return like with like, devoting months at a time to literary skirmishing that had been better spent leaving the work to speak for itself. The name he thus made for himself as a posturing self-publicist haunts his reputation still. Not for the first time, the biography gets in the way of the true achievement. Yet Whistler would not have been Whistler had he not sailed into battle, courageous and alone to defend his cause, for he lived for his art. And his famous libel suit of 1878 against John Ruskin, beyond all the legal fun and repartee, had a most serious point to it. For Ruskin, in accusing him of 'flinging a pot of paint in the public's face', was accusing him of much more than mere charlatanry: he was saying that here was art that had no moral base, and no moral purpose to uplift and improve. To Whistler, the first article of faith was that art was art, to be judged and accepted in terms of art alone. 'Art for Art's sake' aestheticism may well now seem an empty concept, but the principle remains. In freeing painting, not from the possibility, but from the duty of narrative, finish, accurate representation and all the other false imperatives that Victorian criticism wished upon it, Whistler established a position which every modern artist since has been happy to exploit. To the question put by Ruskin's counsel: 'Do you say that this is a correct representation of Battersea Bridge?', Whistler replied: 'I did not intend it to be a correct portrait of the bridge. It is only a moonlight scene . . .As to what the picture represents, that depends upon who looks at it . . . My whole scheme was to bring about a certain harmony of colour.' This 'Nocturne: Blue and Gold - Old Battersea Bridge' hangs in the room full of 'nocturnes' that is the true heart of this exhibition, with the painting that gave Ruskin such offence, 'Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket' of 1875, given a wall to itself. It is a magnificent thing, as exquisitely effected and perfectly judged as the rest of them, with fireworks bursting, rising and falling over the deep shadows of the old pleasure gardens at Cremorne. We see clearly now why Whistler should have won his case, which he did to the tune of a farthing in damages, which he put on his watch-chain, and no costs. He was bankrupted by it. The puzzle is only that he continued to live in London through the last 20 years of his increasingly embittered life. He knew Paris well, was friends with his great contemporaries among the French painters, most especially Degas and Fantin-Latour. But perhaps it was the very isolation, embattled against the philistine, that was necessary to his combative temperament. Perhaps he felt himself, au fond, too close to Degas, to Manet, and the line that went back to his hero, Velasquez. He needed, perhaps, to feel alone. The otherwise estimable authors of this exhibition, Margaret MacDonald and Richard Dorment, draw a distinction between the 'French' method of the Impressionists, the paint thick and applied direct, and the 'English' method of Whistler, thin paint and lots of glazes. This accounts, so they say, for much of the subsequent misunderstanding and fall in reputation of the work. But it is nonsense. Glazing was quite as much a French as an English academic technique and is in any case a natural function of the use of thin paint. Certainly it is to be found in the work of such supposed Impressionists as Degas and Lautrec. The most intriguing room in the show is indeed the one that marks Whistler's move, in the later 1860s, from the more fully-realised subjects by which he first made a name - the 'Symphonies in White' with their 'White Girls' and thicker paint - to the more loosely and lightly-stated figure compositions and studies, with their Japanese references and open interest in the painted mark as a thing of itself. The step from them to the sea paintings, to the 'nocturnes' and the Venice pastels, and to the etchings with their radical experiments in the subtle wiping of the plates, was not so far to take. This is a magnificent exhibition, a true landmark. It brings us great works that we shall never see together again, not just the 'nocturnes' but the 'White Girls', the notorious 'Arrangements' that are the portraits of Thomas Carlyle and Whistler's mother, and so many of the prints and drawings over which the artist's hand dances like the butterfly by which he signed himself. But it is the artist who is the hero, the artist now seen whole and vindicated. Sickert, hurt by their last quarrel, could seldom resist a posthumous jibe, but respect and affection for his old master would always creep in. He perhaps should have the last word. 'The beauty of Whistler's painting is that he achieved its form purely by relations considered as opaque, between a restricted number of tones. This is not only extremely difficult, but . . . it is so rare that only the great painters can do it.'

			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOYFRIEND ARRESTED AS AN ACCOMPLICE IN DENISE DUERR DEATH  </P> <P> Robert Clyde Spontak wept openly last week as he talked with police  investigators and reporters about the brutal killing of his girlfriend, Denise  Marie Duerr of Garden Grove -- "the sweetest woman that ever lived."  </P> <P> On Monday, the 22-year-old Garden Grove man sat in the Riverside County Jail,  accused of acting in concert with a high school friend to stab the 21-year-old  Duerr 20 times, then dump her partially clad body in the hills near Corona.  </P> <P> Last Thursday, authorities arrested Cameron Seaholm, a 22-year-old transient  who went to high school with both Spontak and Duerr, in connection with the  killing after he was discovered driving Duerr's car. At the time, Spontak  lamented the death of his live-in girlfriend and angrily sought to understand  what had motivated the actions of his friend Seaholm.  </P> <P> But investigators say they never believed the boyfriend's display of grief and  kept an eye on him from the outset as a suspect in Duerr's killing.  </P> <P> "He just seemed patently unconvincing," Riverside Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel C.  Lough said of Spontak, who was arrested on suspicion of murder  </P> <P> early Sunday morning.  </P> <P> On Saturday evening, armed with a search warrant, Garden Grove police and  Riverside County sheriff's deputies went to the Garden Grove apartment that  Spontak had shared with Duerr, interrupting a neighborhood barbecue.  </P> <P> For the next 6 hours, they combed through the apartment and recovered evidence  that investigators allege links Spontak to the crime, Lough said. He refused to  discuss the evidence seized.  </P> <P> During the search, Spontak sat calmly on a sofa as more than a dozen law  enforcement officers scoured the apartment, an open bottle of champagne and  newspaper stories about the murder in view, Lough said.  </P> <P> "He was just waiting it out until the moment we arrested him (about 3:30 a.m.  Sunday)," said Lt. Nick Padilla of the Riverside Sheriff's Department. "Then he  became very emotional for a minute, then suddenly regained his composure."  </P> <P> Police handcuffed Spontak and led him outside in the view of shocked neighbors,  many of whom had tried to comfort him.  </P> <P> Investigators said that as soon as Duerr's partially clothed body was found  last Wednesday in a brush-covered area just off the Riverside Freeway at the  edge of the Santa Ana Mountains, they focused on Spontak's possible role in the  killing for a variety of reasons.  </P> <P> They cited apparent contradictions in his whereabouts in the hours leading up  to Duerr's disappearance last Monday, his rocky and sometimes violent 6-year  relationship with Duerr, and the fact that he may have been the last person to  see Duerr before she disappeared last week.  </P> <P> "It all just made you very, very suspicious," Padilla said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Lot Left to Figure Out'  </P> <P> Investigators say they have still not determined a motive for the slaying,  where she was killed, or the actual murderer. "We still have a lot left to  figure out on this one," Lough said.  </P> <P> But law enforcement officials alleged Monday that they have enough evidence to  show that Spontak acted in concert with Seaholm to carry out the crime.  </P> <P> Spontak's arrest shocked neighbors at his Garden Grove apartment complex, and  even the victim's mother reacted with disbelief.  </P> <P> Duerr's mother, Mary Ellen Ducharme, said: "I have a hard time believing that  he did it, unless it was an accident. . . . They had a stormy 6-year  relationship on and off, but this time, when Denise went back to live with  (Spontak), it was different. He treated her well and they didn't fight at all."  </P> <P> Ducharme said that Spontak and Duerr had problems in the past and that Spontak  occasionally hit the young woman, an assertion confirmed by police  investigators.  </P> <P> "He was extremely jealous of her. He didn't want her wearing short skirts and  wanted her to call him whenever she went somewhere. But she promised me that he  had changed and I think he did," her mother said.  </P> <P> Ducharme said that Spontak called her after his arrest and "swore to me on the  telephone that he had nothing to do with it and would never hurt her."  </P> <P> Spontak is scheduled to be arraigned on murder charges Wednesday in Riverside  County, law enforcement officials said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seahold in Court  </P> <P> Seaholm, who police allege was Spontak's accomplice, appeared briefly Monday in  Corona Municipal Court, but his arraignment was postponed until next Monday.  </P> <P> During parts of the proceeding, he appeared exasperated and shook his head as  he sat in custody in the jury box. But at other times, he flashed a brief smile  toward his mother, estranged wife and family friends in the courtroom audience.  </P> <P> Seaholm's family and his Santa Ana defense attorney maintained his innocence  Monday, and pointed to Spontak's arrest as affirmation that Seaholm did not  kill Duerr.  </P> <P> "We know he's innocent," said his mother, Joanne Sandor of Santa Ana. While  declining to discuss specifics of the case against her son, Sandor said: "She  just was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Unfortunately, Clyde (Spontak)  is a friend of his."  </P> <P> Seaholm's defense attorney, Gary L. Proctor, said that Spontak's arrest should  show that his client was not involved in the murder.  </P> <P> Proctor acknowledged that Seaholm took Duerr's car without permission, but he  said that his client did not realize that the young woman's body was in the  car's trunk. He added that he is hopeful that laboratory tests will conclude  that stains found on Seaholm's clothing were not, in fact, the victim's blood.  </P> <P> Investigators already have confirmed that Duerr died as a result of 20 stab  wounds to the upper body. A full autopsy report is not expected for several  weeks, but prosecutor Lough said Monday that "certainly the torn state of her  clothing would suggest a sexual attack."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Jeff Mitchell contributed to this story.  </P></p>

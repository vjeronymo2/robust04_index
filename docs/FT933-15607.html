			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Economic Viewpoint: An agenda for a real summit By proposing a special summit to discuss unemployment, President Bill Clinton at the time more or less wrote off the prospects of the Tokyo summit. Politicians in the Clinton interventionist tradition see job creation in terms of spending projects which create work, oblivious that almost any kind of spending will do just this if it is not absorbed by higher pay and prices. What they really have in mind is an enhancement of the role of the state - an outlook incorrectly called 'liberal' in the US. What, however, could a genuine economic directorate of the Group of Seven achieve? First, the work would be at the level of finance ministers and central bankers. Maintaining the directorate at that level would enable Germany to play a fuller part than it can at summit gatherings where the Bundesbank is absent. Above all, heads of government lack both the time and knowledge for the work. The Gatt breakthrough was a separate affair, owing little to summitry. Moreover, because a problem is worldwide, it does not mean that it is best tackled in international meetings. As the Nobel Prize-winning UK economist, James Meade, has never ceased to emphasise, the restoration of high employment requires a steady rise of total cash spending (conveniently measured by Nominal Gross Domestic Product), and severe pay restraint (combined, I would stress, with flexibility) so that increased money expenditure leads to increased output and jobs, rather than just higher prices. Meade has always said that the second objective is the harder; a new booklet gives his latest ideas for achieving it in an equitable way (Fifteen Propositions, Employment Policy Institute, Southbank House, Black Prince Road, London, SE1 7SJ, price Pounds 6.50). But because the first objective is less difficult, there is no reason to neglect it. Indeed, while labour market reforms are best carried out at the national, EC or local level, the regulation of total spending (or demand management as it used to be called) is easier if the world's main industrial leaders move in harmony. Moreover, almost for the first time since the second world war, inadequate growth of total cash spending is an important contribution to unemployment. A rate of measured price increase of 2 per cent to 3 per cent per annum is now probably the best working definition of minimum inflation. The underlying trend of real growth in G7 countries is, say, 2-3 per cent. Adding together the volume and price components, a satisfactory rate of growth for Nominal GDP would then be about 5-6 per cent a year - perhaps slightly more to catch up for shortfall. Now look what has happened. On OECD estimates, G7 Nominal GDP growth has dropped to 3 1/2 per cent in the past 12 months. It is clear that the leading industrial countries have been suffering, not quite from deflation, but from demand deficiency in the Keynesian sense. The OECD forecasts a return to 5 1/2 per cent nominal GDP growth by 1994. But few would like to rely on forecasts alone - and even they depend on assumptions about appropriate policies. The dangers, just for once, are of inadequate demand growth rather than of inflationary excess. Where should the largest stimulus be applied? Surely, to those countries whose demand growth has been exceptionally slow or where an exchange rate depreciation would be in order. The countries where demand has been growing most slowly are Japan and Germany and those EC countries whose currencies are tied in to the D-Mark. In Japan, a guarantee of further stimulus to domestic demand would be the best way to defuse the conflict with the US over the Japanese trade surplus. If Japanese domestic activity could be raised to normal levels, expenditure on imports would automatically rise. A big surplus would probably remain, reflecting an underlying rate of savings above domestic investment. But once Japanese activity returns to normal the rest of the world will have little reason to complain. Nor could the US continue to moan if Japanese expansion is accompanied by a fall in the yen against the dollar, so long as there is a net rise in Japanese purchases from the rest of the world. With respect to Germany, the logjam suddenly seems to have eased. The recent budget measures agreed by German political leaders are larger than realised. Spending cuts for next year, together with new tax revenue and higher pension contributions, are equivalent to 2 per cent of GDP, according to Kleinwort Benson - much more than the ill-fated Solidarity Pact. These measures are due to be followed by further fiscal tightening equivalent to 1 1/4 per cent of GDP in 1995. There will have to be many further interest rate cuts in Germany, simply to make up for the contractionary arithmetical effects of the package. In psychological terms, however, these cuts are a boost; and there has been a different tone to Bundesbank statements in the past few days. Better money supply numbers and belated union talk of pay flexibility have also brought joy to the Bundesbank. The effect of the whole package of fiscal economies and prospective interest rate cuts is likely to be positive for German 'animal spirits', but not necessarily for the D-Mark, which remains subject to downward influence. The Americans will just have to put up with some further downward drift of the D-Mark against the dollar if it occurs. Indeed, one advantage of a world economic directorate is that it might hope gradually to wean the Americans away from the belief that the dollar can never be low enough. The Bundesbank, too, will just have to grin and bear the possibility of some D-Mark depreciation, while industrialists in neighbouring DM-bloc countries will be delighted. POSTSCRIPT ON UK The downside risk on the D-Mark, and sterling's new position as Europe's strongest currency, will create complications for British policy. Sterling has already regained nearly half of its fall against the D-Mark since departing from the ERM and one-third of the ground lost on the index. Nevertheless, sterling could easily go higher. The dilemma of the winter of 1987-88 on whether to cut interest rates to restrain the pound looks, like all dilemmas, likely to recur, although against a much less inflationary background. It would indeed be absurd to endanger the still-fragile rebirth of confidence in the UK economy by heavy upward over-shooting of sterling. Like the majority of the chancellor's forecasting panel, I would unhesitatingly reduce interest rates if required to put a brake on sterling's rise. It is only in this context that there is a case for further fiscal tightening. But unlike at least two members of the forecasting panel, I believe it would be equally foolish to plan another devaluation from recent levels of sterling. The devaluationists' case is illustrated in the final chart, which shows a worsening payments deficit constraining real economic growth to a crawl. The result would be resumed upward movement of unemployment for years to come. Both the balance of payments projections and their implications for policy are highly disputable. Even if the UK does have to continue to turn the terms of trade against itself (which is all a successful devaluation can achieve) then it would be best done by maintaining a British rate of inflation below that of the main trading partners. That is no longer a pipe-dream. The case for either a large upward or downward movement of sterling is extremely weak; but it will no longer be possible to keep the issue under the carpet much longer.</p>

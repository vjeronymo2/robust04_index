			<p><P> October 12, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: 'NEW' CUISINE IS IN CAPABLE HANDS AT THE  TREND-SETTING PACIFICA GRILL  </P> <P> On balance, it seems well that Pacifica Grill executive chef Neil Stuart is a  restless soul.  </P> <P> Thanks to Stuart, this ever trendy, always stylish downtown restaurant changes  its culinary course about as often as Zsa Zsa Gabor changes spouses, which is  to say with some regularity. Over the years it has delved into the depths and  shallows of California cuisine, promoted the short-lived (and locally abortive)  "grazing" fad and introduced Southwestern nouvelle, and now has inaugurated a  style of its own invention, Pacific Southwestern.  </P> <P> Pacific Southwestern cuisine probably is one of those things that had to happen  sooner or later, and it has come to life in competent hands. The menu defines  this style as "blending the traditions and flavors of Mexico with the bounty  and flair of California," which is a reasonably accurate if somewhat full-blown  way of saying that Pacifica Grill has devised a varied menu of updated Mexican  classics and seafood preparations with Mexican flavor.  </P> <P> The cooking falls into the nouvelle category, and because the appetizers are  inventive and served in portions that discourage an entree follow-up, the menu  certainly seems suited to grazing. (This term means making a meal of several  small plates and is so out of favor as to cause shudders among at least some of  the restaurateurs who once took credit for inventing the idea.)  </P> <P> Tortillas, chilies, the succulent herb called epazote, salsa (at least as a  concept) and other familiar ingredients all play major roles in the  restaurant's new style, but in a liberated fashion that often leads in  intriguing new directions. A rather comprehensive example would be the entree  of tortilla-crusted chicken with Mexican beer salsa, which translates into a  crispy-crunchy bird with a flavor that suggests chicken breaded with crushed  corn flakes. The salsa is pleasant but has rather a milquetoast character  compared to some of the kitchen's notably hot creations.  </P> <P> Perhaps the best item in the hot category is the reasonably volcanic appetizer  described as "burnt cheese," a molten amalgam of buffalo-milk mozzarella,  onions and smoked chilies. Glazed under the broiler until the cheese acquires a  bubbling, brown crust, this variation on the classic Mexican queso fundido  features a heat that makes a sneak attack on the taste buds but leaves them  gratified by the experience. It is served with tortillas, meant as chewy  wrappers to be rolled around the gooey fondue and shared around the table.  (Pacifica Grill recognizes and helps along the contemporary practice of sharing  bites by stocking tables with piles of small dishes.)  </P> <P> The appetizers seem uniformly attractive and intelligently designed. A  longstanding house creation, the chili-crusted lamb ribs with burnt orange  dipping sauce, remains a savory masterpiece of tender, potently seasoned meat  set off by a dip of unusual pungency. The fajita of duck, sour cherries and  Maui onions makes a novel luxury of an increasingly common dish, a comment that  applies with equal force to the machaca of shrimp -- a thick, savory stew of  deep flavors that, like the burnt cheese, is served with flour tortillas for  optional rolling. As with the cheese, the tortillas make the dish so filling as  to render a following entree somewhat pointless; many appetites might be just  as happy succeeding the more substantial starters with a salad or a bowl of  soup.  </P> <P> In a lighter vein are such things as New Zealand mussels with tomatoes and  herbs; a Mexican blue crab "hand roll" (a sushi impersonator in  south-of-the-border garb) with tomatillo salsa; a pleasing, puree-like black  bean soup brightened with epazote, and an engaging carpaccio of smoked ahi with  goat cheese and fried capers. This last takes the concept of carpaccio rather  far, but it is a well-made dish of tender, meaty fish, colorfully sprinkled  with a fine dice of bell peppers, and given a savory accent by the caper-cheese  garnish. Fried won ton skins add a welcome crunch to the plate.  </P> <P> The entree list looks primarily to the sea and offers a swordfish steak asada  with tequila and sun-dried tomato salsa (we are definitely in the realm of the  wildly nouvelle here, but this unsampled offering sounds pretty good); grilled  sea bass with roasted yellow tomato salsa; mahi mahi steamed in a banana leaf,  and a remarkably delicious filet of king salmon barbecued in the style of  Yucatan. The flavors were deep and resonant, not particularly spicy but well  suited to the salmon, which was cooked not one moment more or less than  necessary.  </P> <P> The kitchen also barbecues long-cooked duck and sets it in a pool of corn  adobada, or crisp kernels stewed in a spicy sauce flavored with a good bit of  cumin. The bird itself is cooked to the falling-off-the-bones stage, which  works in this instance, and is spread with a highly seasoned, paste-like sauce  whose faint but noticeable bitterness implies the presence of bitter chocolate,  the ingredient that characterizes Mexico's famous mole sauce.  </P> <P> A newly introduced section of the menu titled "sabores mexicanos" ("tastes of  Mexico") offers a monthly three-course menu of traditional regional Mexican  dishes. These can be ordered individually or as a $19 fixed-price meal, but  frankly, this particular offering seems one of the menu's weak spots. The  mushroom empanada appetizer featured a fine, flaky crust, but the cultivated  mushrooms in the filling could not stand up to the strong accents of garlic,  chilies and epazote. The entree of spicy shrimp stew, or camaron en chile rojo,  was indifferent in flavor, and the rock-type shrimp were cooked to a rather  mushy texture that was less than pleasing. The dessert, a crisp rice flan  (dulce de arroz) won on all points and would more worthily follow any of the  other entrees.  </P> <P> This is a restaurant that makes much of desserts and turns out an excellent,  mousse-like cinnamon-chocolate torte and a grand burnt cream, the smooth creme  brulee that the Pacifica restaurants popularized locally and make better than  just about any place else.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS  </P> <P> PACIFICA GRILL, 1202 Kettner Blvd., San Diego. 696-9226.

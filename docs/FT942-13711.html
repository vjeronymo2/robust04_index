			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Shake-up at Ford: Senior managers face a gruelling eight months A team of 27 senior Ford executives faces a testing period during the next eight months, as they try to supervise one of Ford's most drastic upheavals. By January 1 Ford plans to have merged its European and North American automotive operations into a single operating unit, Ford Automotive Operations. The team of top managers led by Mr Ed Hagenlocker will not only supervise the transition but also continue to run the company's day-by-day business, an operation that last year had a turnover of Dollars 92bn selling 5.96m vehicles. Mr Alex Trotman, Ford chairman and chief executive, says the small automotive top management team will 'establish general policy and worldwide strategy, but all other decision making will be pushed deep into the operations.' Ford intends to reduce its committee structure to simplify and speed up decision-making. The restructuring was aimed at 'achieving the lowest possible coefficient of bureaucratic drag,' said Mr Trotman. It remains to be seen how deep will be the shock waves the reorganisation sets off through the ranks of Ford staff around the world. Mr Trotman warned: 'We are not simply changing the lines on an organisation chart. This is entirely about the processes that we use as we go about business around the world. As we simplify those processes, there clearly will be a need for fewer salaried people at today's business levels.' The number of jobs losses has not yet been quantified, but the world's second largest carmaker is hopeful that the cuts will be achieved through natural wastage and early retirement. The first task is one of communicating the scale of the changes envisaged. The company's 340 top managers have been briefed in person and 1,350 middle managers have heard the message by television. Now in the next two weeks Mr Trotman is planning to meet all the group's senior, and middle management in Europe and in North America. 'We're not kidding ourselves by thinking this will be a walk in the park. Some people will find themselves in new jobs, others will be assigned different work in their old jobs.' The global reorganisation will be disruptive and costly. Mr Jacques Nasser, the new group vice-president for product development, says that Ford has 'a very international group of managers, probably more than any other world automotive company, but this is the tip of the iceberg compared with what we need now to optimise this change. 'The home market concept has gone. In design, sales and marketing, purchasing or engineering the number of people we will be allocating across borders will multiply by a significant factor.'</p>

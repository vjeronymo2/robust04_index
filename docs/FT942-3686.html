			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: de Volkskrant - Editorial union Austria's 'yes' to Europe would appear to run counter to the lukewarm and dull elections campaigns for the European Parliament held in those countries that are already members of the European Union. Still, this contradiction is largely illusory. The Union may have its flaws, but it is indisputably a zone of peace, stability and prosperity. This, combined with the large common market, exerts a strong attractive pull on European countries outside the EU. Within the member states themselves, these achievements are taken for granted. The main parties do not differ fundamentally on the usefulness of European co-operation. . . .These elections have hardly increased the legitimacy of the European Parliament. . . The EU states must allow the formation of European parties and make the Europarliament a full- fledged representative body.</p>

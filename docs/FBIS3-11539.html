This time this group's  electoral popularity dropped considerably; it even lost in  districts, which until recently were considered undefeatable  bastions of this PLRA faction.    The "Lainists" by last night had obtained 60 percent of the  national votes, while in last year's elections it received more  than 80 percent.    The general trend showed that the appearance of independent  lists (not aligned to national movements), in addition of  becoming the third force, were the main element draining power  from the Change for Liberation Movement headed by Domingo Laino.    The "Saguierists," [supporters of Deputy Hermes Rafael  Saguier and Senator Miguel Saguier] which at the closure of the  vote count were in second place (with more than 10 percent of  the votes), increased their power in the capital where they have  taken over committees previously run by "Lainists."    The cities of Villarrica and Coronel Oviedo provided some  surprises for Laino supporters.    These two cities were considered bastions of the Change for  Liberation Movement, but the voters preferred the lists not tied  to the official leadership.    The "Change for Change" Movement headed by Senator Alfredo  Luis Jaegli is in third place (regarding national movements).  This movement mostly comprises dissidents of the Laino  movement, independents, and small regional movements. It  obtained results considered "excellent" by the movement's main  leaders.    The elections were held in a relatively calm environment  even  though conflicts almost developed over problems related to the  registered voters issue.    As it is known charges were made over the voters registry --  and the way it was distributed -- which did not include many  party members who were not able to vote because their names  "disappeared" from the lists.</p>

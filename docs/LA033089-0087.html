			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GREEN STREET, RAILING AGAINST RAIL LINE, WINS  </P> <P> The Green Street transit mall proposal is 'a planner's delight and a realist's  nightmare.'  </P> <P>  -- Mayor William E. Thomson Jr.  </P> <P> Business and property owners on Green Street won a victory Tuesday in their  battle to persuade the Pasadena Board of Directors to route a proposed regional  light-rail line down the center of the Foothill Freeway, (Interstate 210) and  keep it off their street.  </P> <P> Although they deferred a decision on the route until April 11, a majority of  the board made it clear that it agrees with owners of businesses and property  there that Green Street would be a poor choice. The board instructed the city's  light-rail alignment task force, which has been studying three potential routes  -- including two involving Green Street -- to consider the statements made by  board members and make a recommendation Wednesday so that the board can act the  following week.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Board's Choice Is Clear  </P> <P> D. Gordon Bagby, task force chairman, said it is clear that the board wants the  rail line to follow the freeway east through Pasadena.  </P> <P> The proposed rail line from Los Angeles would enter Pasadena along the Santa Fe  railroad right of way and proceed north. Then it would turn east, either on the  railroad right of way in the center of the Foothill Freeway or on surface  streets.  </P> <P> One plan would convert Green Street into a transit mall between Raymond Avenue  and Hill Street, eliminating most auto traffic. Another plan would use Colorado  Boulevard for the eastbound rail line and Green Street for the westbound line.  Both lines would turn north at Hill Street and follow a route east near Walnut  Street.  </P> <P> Leaders of an association formed to oppose the use of Green Street told the  board Tuesday that 95% of the business and property owners contacted along the  street are against the plan.  </P> <P> John Mangoni, a pediatrician with an office on Green Street, said: "When I  found out about the light-rail system possibly coming down Green Street, I was,  to say the least, horrified, disappointed and confused -- confused as to why  Pasadena would want to turn a beautiful tree-lined street into a train  corridor."  </P> <P> The light-rail line to Pasadena would be an extension of a rail line now under  construction by the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission between Long  Beach and Los Angeles. The system requires the use of station platforms that  are about three feet high and 300 feet long to board cars that are 90 feet  long.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission is studying a number of  possible extensions, including routes in the San Fernando Valley and along the  coast, between the Century Freeway in El Segundo and Marina del Rey.  </P> <P> Marcia Jacobs, a businesswoman and property owner, said the conversion of Green  into a transit mall could cost businesses 300 parking spaces and would restrict  access to 70 driveways.  </P> <P> Businessman Jacob Maarse said the impact on his flower shop "would be  disastrous." He would not gain any business from a commuter rail line, he said,  but would lose customers that now drive to his shop.  </P> <P> Douglas W. Fordyce, owner of a travel agency, said the effect on his business  "would be devastating during construction, and if I survive, would be of  minimal or no benefit" afterward.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PCC Support  </P> <P> Most of the support for the Green Street route at Tuesday's board meeting came  from a spokesman for Pasadena City College and from several handicapped  persons. PCC took the position that the Green Street route, which would pass  the college, would be more convenient than a freeway line three blocks away.  </P> <P> Three persons who are disabled said the freeway route would be a disadvantage  to them because stations would be remote from businesses and they would be  required to travel on street overpasses and elevators to reach the line.  </P> <P> Director Kathryn Nack said, "I'm sympathetic to the needs of handicapped people  and their means of using public transit, but I'm also optimistic that there can  be devised in this era of good engineering design ways of getting up and down  and back and forth from the freeway." She also noted that the freeway line "is  not that far from PCC."  </P> <P> Mayor William E. Thomson Jr. said that if light rail is intended primarily as a  commuter system, the clear choice is to put it along the freeway. He called the  Green Street transit mall proposal "a planner's delight and a realist's  nightmare."  </P> <P> Director Jess Hughston proposed that the city board instruct its light-rail  task force to drop the Green Street route and give priority to studying the  freeway line. Director Rick Cole said he would never support the Green Street  route, but warned against "short-circuiting" the planning process.  </P> <P> The light-rail task force is in the middle of engineering studies and had  planned to recommend a route this summer. But the board instructed the task  force Tuesday to speed up that process and make a recommendation Wednesday.  </P> <P> The city has been considering, in addition to the light-rail route, development  of a trolley or bus system to operate within the city. Officials have solicited  proposals for engineering studies and economic ones that would examine a  trolley system on both rails and rubber tires.  </P> <P> Even if it used rails, the trolley system would be vastly different from the  regional light-rail plan, since it would use smaller cars that could be boarded  from the street level.  </P></p>

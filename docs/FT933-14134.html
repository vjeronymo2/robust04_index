			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Second-term loss at Alcan Aluminium ALCAN ALUMINIUM, the Canadian aluminium group, faced with weaker ingot and fabricated product prices, posted a second-quarter loss of USDollars 35m, or 18 cents a common share, against a loss of Dollars 29m, or 15 cents, a year earlier. Sales and operating revenues for the quarter were 5 per cent lower at Dollars 1.86bn. For the first six months, Alcan's loss deepened to Dollars 55m, or 29 cents a share, compared with a deficit of Dollars 44m, or 24 cents, a year earlier. First-half sales and operating revenues were Dollars 3.6bn, against Dollars 3.8bn. Second-quarter fabricated products volumes were stable but realised prices were down 9 per cent. Ingot shipments were slightly higher but prices were down 10 per cent. The lower prices were partly offset by cost reductions and a weaker Canadian dollar. Interest costs were also lower. Total shipments of ingot and fabricated products in the second quarter were 641,000 tonnes, against 610,000 tonnes, and in the first half roughly the same at 1.22m tonnes. In Canada, where most of Alcan's primary production is located, losses were up in the quarter while US operations posted a loss, compared with a small profit in the 1992 period.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent ITAR-TASS Oleg Lukin] </F>   [Text] Ashgabat, 14 May -- The privatization of trade  outlets and industrial sites will begin in Turkmenistan on 1  June. This is stipulated in a resolution signed by Saparmurad  Niyazov on 13 May. The privatization of trade outlets will be  carried out through auctions, tenders, and sales. Retail trade  outlets selling consumer goods will be privatized in the first  instance.    The authorities in the capital and oblasts have been given  personal responsibility to ensure that newly privatized outlets  function effectively, while staying in the same line of business.    Small industrial enterprises employing up to 100 people will  be bought by members of working collectives, and will also be  sold to citizens of Turkmenistan and foreigners. Private  individuals and foreign firms will have to take part in  investment tenders and later ensure their own supplies of raw  materials. Enterprises employing more than 100 people will be  transformed into joint-stock companies with the controlling  packet of shares being retained by the government.    The president's resolution envisages subsidies for working  collectives during the destatification of their enterprises. In  particular, employees will receive some shares free of charge,  while state property will be sold to them with a 25 percent  price reduction with up to one year credit facility.    Income gained from privatization will be channelled to the  central government budget.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Challenge of moving mountains: The difficulty of tackling growing stocks of coal MIKE CHILDERLEY heaves a deep sigh as he peers down from the top of a 3m tonne heap of coal next to the Cottam, Nottinghamshire, power station which he manages. There is enough coal there for six months, he says, but 'today, like every day except Sundays, we have 17 trainloads of the stuff coming in'. His problems are unlikely to ease. The government's four-month review of the coal industry has come up with few solutions. But one almost certain to be adopted in an attempt to save some of the 31 threatened pits involves persuading the electricity generators to maintain or even increase stocks. UK coal mountains have grown because demand for electricity has risen more slowly than expected as a result of the recession, a mild winter, stronger competition from the nuclear industry and a rise in imports. Stockpiles in England and Wales are about 46m tonnes, enough to keep power stations going for six months and three times the level the coal and electricity industries believe is commercially justified. British Coal has about 11.2m tonnes, against the 5m it would ideally like; National Power has about 18m tonnes (against about 5m-6m) and PowerGen, which owns Cottam, has 16m tonnes (5m-6m). British Coal executives argue that maintaining or raising stockpiles would merely postpone pit closures. 'What we need is a bigger market, but the government does not seem prepared to create that,' says one. 'Leaving coal stocks where they are merely means that the market will collapse when the next five-year contracts with the generators end.' Some power stations may close before they burn all the coal they have. Even for those like Cottam, with a secure future, there are considerable penalties for being so overstocked. Before the coal review, Mr Childerley planned to reduce his mountain to about 750,000 tonnes in the next few years. Each tonne of coal added to the pile adds 50p to the company's costs in handling charges alone, on top of the cost of capital tied up in the stocks, he says, adding that the stockpile can take little more. 'Our preference would be that the coal stays in the bowels of the earth until it is needed,' says Mr Childerley. The government's preferred method of saving some pits hinges on persuading, or coercing, the generators to take an extra 65.5m tonnes of coal over five years. The generators say there is a firm market for 40m-43m tonnes. PowerGen has said it wants about Pounds 140m for keeping stocks at their current level; National Power, the larger of the two generators, has not specified an amount but would want at least as much again as the amount wanted by PowerGen. Whatever the generators get, British Coal is likely to suffer most if stockpiles remain high. By 1998, when the next set of contracts run out, the coal industry is likely to be in the private sector and the government will have less of an interest in preserving pits. In addition the 34m tonnes in generators' stocks then would last a lot longer than now because coal burning will have been reduced further as other sources of fuel grow in importance. 'Imagine if by then BC has by then been split into several companies,' says a BC executive. 'The generators will simply be able to pick one supplier off against another.'</p>

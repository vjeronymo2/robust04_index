			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / BA and Virgin 'dirty tricks' row nears end BRITISH AIRWAYS and Virgin Atlantic are moving towards a settlement of the 'dirty tricks' dispute which has soured relations between the two airlines, but Virgin says BA still has to make a firm offer. The impetus for the latest initiative to end the embarrassing public row between the UK companies has come from Mr Christopher Chataway, chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority. If a deal is agreed, compensation would be paid by BA to Virgin. This could, however, be less than the Pounds 9m suggested earlier this year, though neither would comment on the likely final sum. In return, Virgin would drop its court proceedings for compensation and end threats of legal action in the US. Virgin, which wants to expand its international services, said it had not heard from the CAA or BA about new terms to end the dispute. But it said Mr Chataway had made a useful approach, meeting Virgin several times. 'He helpfully intervened to try and avoid the two sides ending up in court again.' BA, which also confirmed contacts with the CAA, said it was keen to bring the affair to a close. As well as dropping legal action, Virgin would also accept a 'gentleman's agreement' not to exploit the details of the 'dirty tricks' - which involved the poaching of Virgin customers by using the airline's computer data - for its own further publicity. Virgin said that the original settlement proposed would have required Virgin and Mr Branson to refrain from making any statements, or using past evidence of BA's actions, to defend the company even if the matter was raised again or further such events occurred. BA apologised publicly to Virgin in January for claiming that Mr Branson had made up the 'dirty tricks' claims and paid Pounds 610,000 in libel damages, as well as high legal costs, after the revelations of the secret operations to lure away customers. But talks on a final settlement foundered in March on the 'gagging clause' issue, with BA seeking to get Virgin 'to agree not to rake over the events of the past'. Lex, Page 14</p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Govett rises 21% to Dollars 54.6m Govett, the fund management and insurance group, reported a 21 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Dollars 54.6m (Pounds 37.3m) for the year to December 31. Profits growth came largely from fund management fees and investments, after a good year for international equity and bond markets. The US profile of the group, which has half its assets and employees in the UK and half in the US, has been helped by gaining a Nasdaq listing last year. It is seeking a New York Stock Exchange ADR listing. Funds under management grew by 31 per cent to Dollars 8.5bn, but a large portion of the Dollars 2bn increase is attributable to the acquisition of North American Trust Company last August, which has Dollars 1.5bn under management. Other inflows came from four large new US institutional accounts, new investment funds, and sales of US mutual funds. Weekly sales of US mutual funds leapt from Dollars 250,000 to Dollars 10m, and Mr Ian Whitehead, chief financial officer, said that growth was expected to continue this year. The group is aiming to increase the US mutual fund business from Dollars 340m to Dollars 1bn in the near term. Govett has benefited from US investors' general move to international markets, driven by low interest rates and poor prospects for US stocks. Income from fund management improved to Dollars 19.6m (Dollars 15.4m), and investment income almost doubled to Dollars 18.5m (Dollars 9.7m). The contribution from the US life assurance and annuities arm slipped to Dollars 18.3m (Dollars 19m), but Mr Whitehead said this did not reflect significant unrealised gains. Income from development capital dropped to Dollars 4.5m (Dollars 7m). A share buy-back programme contributed to the improved fully-diluted earnings per share figure, up 38 per cent to 62.1 cents. There is a final gross dividend of 18 cents (14.5 cents), to make a total of 28 cents (24 cents).</p>

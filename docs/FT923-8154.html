			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Letter: A different impression of the situation in Cuba Sir, Having ourselves just returned from Cuba as independent travellers, we find it hard to agree with James Henderson's rather naive conclusion that the Cuban people '. . . certainly did not seem rebellious' ('Cuba: coping with inscrutable powers', August 9). This portrays an impression of ordinary Cubans impassive to what appeared to us to be an obviously deteriorating situation in their country. Our experience was very different. As Spanish speakers, we had little difficulty in striking up conversations with Cubans who expressed a feeling of hopelessness and desperation; imprisoned on an island and trapped in a political regime they fear and despise. Shops contain a bare minimum of rationed food - delivery of which is often haphazard. People are going hungry and admit only with embarrassment and shame that they have been reduced to supplementing their diet with cats. Daily, people attempt in desperation to escape on inflated tyres to Florida. The risks of death are tremendous. We met the father of one such young man who had heard nothing from his son in weeks. He had no way of knowing whether he was alive or dead. Too often, travel articles go by the unwritten rule that they be 'jaunty' and 'amusing' accounts of an unfamiliar system. Too often, this produces a superficial and inaccurate description of a country, its people and views. The people of Cuba certainly deserve better than this.

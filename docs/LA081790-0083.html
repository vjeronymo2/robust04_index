			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> VAN SLYKE IS A TONIC FOR PIRATES  </P> <P> Andy Van Slyke, cleared to play by team doctors shortly before the game, hit a  home run in the ninth inning Thursday to lead the Pittsburgh Pirates past the  Atlanta Braves, 4-3, in Pittsburgh.  </P> <P> The victory, only the third for the Pirates in the past nine games, let  Pittsburgh keep its half-game lead over the New York Mets in the National  League East.  </P> <P> Van Slyke, making his first start since suffering a badly sprained left ankle  Aug. 5, gave the Pirates a 3-2 lead in the seventh with a run-scoring single  against Tom Glavine.  </P> <P> In the ninth, Van Slyke, who is 16 for 31 (.516) in his past nine starts, hit  his 13th home run of the season against Kent Mercker (4-2), the Braves' third  pitcher.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh's Bob Kipper (5-1) worked a scoreless ninth and got the victory.  </P> <P> Francisco Cabrera's run-scoring double gave the Braves a 1-0 lead in the first  inning against rookie starter Randy Tomlin. The Pirates got the run back on  Jeff King's leadoff homer in the second. King went three for four and is  hitting .329 in his last 18 starts.  </P> <P> The Pirates turned infield singles by Bobby Bonilla and King, and Jose Lind's  sacrifice fly, into a 2-1 lead in the sixth.  </P> <P> Dave Justice tied the score in the seventh with his third home run of the  four-game series and 10th in 11 games. He has 20 runs batted in in his past 12  games.  </P> <P> Atlanta tied the score at 3-3 in the eighth against Stan Belinda after a  leadoff double by Ernie Whitt. Lonnie Smith beat out an infield single and Jeff  Treadway singled home Whitt.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 6, San Francisco 4 -- Von Hayes hit a two-run home run in the  ninth inning at Philadelphia, handing the Giants their fifth consecutive loss.  </P> <P> Hayes hit his 15th home run of the season against Mark Thurmond (2-3), giving  the win to Roger McDowell (4-6).  </P> <P> Darren Daulton hit a two-run single to give Philadelphia a 4-2 lead in the  fourth inning.  </P> <P> Two walks by relief pitcher Dennis Cook helped the Giants tie the score, 4-4,  on Will Clark's two-run single in the sixth.  </P> <P> Houston 4, St. Louis 2 -- Danny Darwin gave up four hits in six innings before  being ejected after a fight with Pedro Guerrero as the Astros won for the third  time in four games at St. Louis.  </P> <P> Darwin (8-1) won his sixth consecutive decision as a starter. He gave up one  run, struck out three and walked none. Dave Smith went 1 1/3 innings for his  20th save.  </P> <P> Darwin and Guerrero had words after an inside pitch in the sixth, and Guerrero  punched Darwin in the face at first base after the pitcher singled in the  seventh. Houston Manager Art Howe also was ejected.  </P> <P> Mark Davidson and Franklin Stubbs homered for Houston and Rafael Ramirez  doubled home a run off Joe Magrane (8-13).  </P> <P> San Diego 3, Montreal 2 -- Joe Carter's run-scoring single capped a two-run  rally in the 11th inning at San Diego to lead the Padres past the Expos, whose  seven-game winning streak ended.  </P> <P> The Expos, who have played the most extra-inning games (8-10) in the majors,  beat the Padres, 5-3, in 17 innings Wednesday night.  </P> <P> Carter drove in the winning run with his fourth hit of the game. He hit his  20th home run and doubled earlier, and leads the National League with 95 runs  batted in.  </P> <P> Rich Rodriguez (1-0) got the victory. Oil Can Boyd's streak of scoreless  innings against the Padres ended at 23 2/3 when Carter homered in the sixth.  </P> <P> Cleveland 7, Minnesota 5 -- Sandy Alomar homered and Greg Swindell won for the  seventh time in his past nine decisions as the Indians won at Cleveland.  </P> <P> Kirby Puckett, Minnesota's All-Star outfielder, played shortstop, third base  and second base in the eighth inning. He moved from position-to-position  between batters and did not get any balls in his first career infield  appearance.  </P> <P> "I was trying to save my pinch-hitters," said Minnesota Manager Tom Kelly,  referring to infielders Gary Gaetti and Kent Hrbek, who didn't start the game.  "I was trying to get by for one inning so I'd be able to get my pinch-hitters  in there in the ninth."  </P> <P> Milwaukee 8, Detroit 4 -- Darryl Hamilton had four hits and scored three runs  to lead the Brewers at Detroit. It was Milwaukee's eighth win in 10 games with  the Tigers.  </P> <P> Cecil Fielder went four for four, including his major league-leading 37th home  run for Detroit. He had two runs batted in, giving him 95, which tops the  American League.  </P></p>

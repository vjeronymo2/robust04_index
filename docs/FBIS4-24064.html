			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with RPF Chairman Alex Kanyarengwe by </F> Alain Frilet in Mulindi on 21 June: "Paris Wants To Maintain  the Regime at Any Price"]    [Text] Mulindi -- Ten kilometers from the Ugandan border,  on a eucalyptus-planted hill, is where the Rwandan Patriotic  Front (RPF) has established its headquarters since the beginning  of the war in October 1990. The deserted Mulundi village has  been transformed into barracks. The adobe houses where the tea  plantation workers used to live are now occupied by RPF  soldiers, whereas the managers' homes are reserved for the  general staff. It is in one of these houses that RPF Chairman  Alex Kanyarengwe received us yesterday, just as he learnt about  the arrival of the first French troops in Zaire.    [Frilet] Do you believe in the sincerity of the French  initiative intended to bring humanitarian aid to the civilian  victims of the massacres that took place in your country?    [Kanyarengwe] France has been present in Rwanda ever since  the civil war broke out in October 1990. Right from the first  few days, it sent a military contingent to evacuate French  nationals from Kigali, saying that it would withdraw its troops  as soon as they had carried out their mission. However, it  became immediately apparent that Paris did not want the RPF to  win. We had to wait for the Americans to intervene -- upholding  the implementation of the Arusha peace agreements -- before the  French accepted to leave.    [Frilet] Some analysts think that France's present  initiative  is mainly intended to enable it to reestablish itself in a  neutral position after its neutrality was called into question  because it supported a regime which is responsible for many  massacres.    [Kanyarengwe] The tragedy we are living through is the  result  of all of France's dealings and maneuvers aimed at keeping  President Habyarimana's ruling party in power. This was a  completely dictatorial regime which was repeatedly denounced for  having perpetrated massacres and political assassinations.  France propped it up by keeping troops and diplomats stationed  in the country, as well as by providing considerable funds. It  is only natural for France to feel responsible for this tragedy  and to try now to prevent the disappearance of the MRND  [National Revolutionary Movement for Development] (the former  single party), and, above all, prevent international inquiries  which might bring to light France's complicity in the actions  carried out by those in power.    However, these inquiries must be conducted normally and  those  responsible for the massacres must be brought to trial. Right  from the beginning of the reprisals, all the other countries  left once they had evacuated their nationals. France stayed on,  and it could have appealed to the United Nations not to withdraw  the 2,500 Blue Helmets. As an influential member of the  Security Council, it could have demanded a stop to the massacres  by requesting a strengthening of the UN presence. Furthermore,  considering that France continued to maintain military,  political, and diplomatic links with the government, it could  have asked its "acolytes" to put a stop to the massacres.    [Frilet] Therefore, in your view some secret plan lies  behind  the French humanitarian initiative...    [Kanyarengwe] In the French statements, you can always read,  behind humanitarian reasons and between the lines, the notion of  intervention. President Mitterrand himself suggested as much in  his televised statement on the occasion of the closing of the 6  June [D-Day] ceremonies. In this way, they want to link the  fighting between the RPF and the government forces to the  massacres perpetrated against the civilian population suspected  of supporting the RPF.    [Frilet] From a military point of view, does a link exist  between the imminent vote in the Security Council and the  stepping up of your military campaign?    [Kanyarengwe] Not in the least. The recent progress made by  our troops eastward and southward has nothing to do with this  decision. With regard to the battles we are waging for the  capital of Kigali, they result from our strategy which is based  on conducting an attrition war in the urban centers and a  blitzkrieg in the countryside, so as to save as many human lives  as possible.    [Frilet] If you continue your advance throughout the  country's territory, of which you now control two-thirds, would  you be prepared to accept the surrender of the government forces?    [Kanyarengwe] We would prefer a measure of consensus on  their  part in order to agree on the means to be used to reconstruct  the country. We are prepared to accept the MRND in the spirit  of the Arusha peace accords, which constitute a political  framework for reconstructing our country, provided that the  MRND's members are prepared to be held answerable for their  actions. Of course, the MRND's role as defined in the Arusha  agreements will have to be reviewed in the light of its  responsibility for the tragedy we are living through. This is  why we have insisted on an international inquiry being held on  the crimes that have been committed.    [Frilet] France's former ambassador to Rwanda wishes to come  here to present the French initiative. Are you prepared to  receive him?    [Kanyarengwe] All contacts are interesting. He is scheduled  to arrive on Wednesday, and I see no objection to receiving him.    [Frilet] What would be the consequences if, as you suggest  may happen, France becomes involved in the war in Rwanda?    [Kanyarengwe] If France intervenes militarily, the war will  change and may become worse. The population, which France says  it wants to help, will itself become the victim of this  situation. Moreover, the whole region may flare up. Both Zaire  and Burundi have the same geographical patterns and the same  types of population. The whole region would therefore feel  concerned.    [Frilet] In Paris, the RPF is considered a Tutsi minority  movement, with a 15-percent share of the vote at the most. It  is hard to imagine that you will hand over power to the winner  in the elections which you are committed to hold once peace has  been reestablished.    [Kanyarengwe] You Westerners tell us to follow your model of  democracy. I thought democracy must be judged from actions and  ideas. Democracy is acquired by adhering to a certain type of  politics and a social program. We cannot envisage democracy  under an ethnic mantle which fosters privileges and exclusion.  This, however, was the situation under the government which  France supported and is still trying to maintain in power at all  costs.</p>

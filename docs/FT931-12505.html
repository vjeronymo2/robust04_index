			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Size of population to decline after 2030 BRITAIN'S population is likely to start falling from about 2030 when, it is projected, the number of deaths will start to exceed births, Alan Pike writes. The effects of the ageing of the population are already being felt. Last year there were 10.6m people of pensionable age, a rise of 16 per cent since 1971. By 2021 nearly one in five of the population will be over 65, compared with one in 10 in 1951. Some of the most serious implications of this will be for employers. They will see the age structure of their workforces change considerably by the end of the century. In 1986 a quarter of the national workforce was aged 24 or less, but this will apply to only one in six by 2001 - by then more than a third of all employees available will be over 45. Social Trends says: 'Those employers who rely on young people as a significant source of their recruits face declining numbers over future years. 'Better use must therefore be made of alternative recruits, such as the unemployed, women returning to the labour market and older workers.' The ageing of the population is one of the main factors behind a radical change in household structure. By 1991 more than a quarter of all households consisted of one person living alone - double the proportion in 1961. Traditional images of households as a couple with dependent children are now most likely to be found among some of Britain's ethnic minority communities. Nearly two thirds of Bangladeshi and Pakistani households fit this model, compared with only a quarter of white and West Indian ones.</p>

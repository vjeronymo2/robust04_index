This event has attracted attention and aroused anxiety from  some Taiwan businessmen in Wuhan. This reporter went to gather  news on the event a few days ago.    Some time after 1400 on 7 January, six unidentified young  people rushed into Hansheng Computer Company, a Taiwan-invested  enterprise in Wuchang District, carrying a spanner, saw, and  other lethal weapons, and claiming that they had something to  discuss with Zhang Tao. Having identified the individual as  Zhang Tao, one of the gang said to him: "You assailed my wife  with obscenities, so I have come to give you a lesson today."  The gang then struck Zhang until his nose was broken and  bleeding. Seeing their colleague being beaten by the gang, a  guard and a staff member of the company went out to join in the  fight. As a result, the guard was hit on the back of his head,  injuring his skull, and the staff member's elbow was fractured.  They are currently hospitalized. After the incident, Mr. Lu  Shengrui, secretary general of the Association of Taiwan  Businessmen and general manager of the Hansheng Computer  Company, called an emergency meeting of Taiwan businessmen in  Wuhan to appeal to the public security department to handle this  event, and wrote a letter of appeal entitled "Protect the  Personal Safety of Taiwan Businessmen in Wuhan and Urgently  Handle the Case of Beating and Injuring Mr. Zhang Tao, Legal  Adviser of the Association," which was jointly signed by the  association members.    According to a briefing by Section Head Gui from the Hubei  Provincial Office for Taiwan Affairs, the director of the office  said that he would correctly handle this incident when he was  informed of it. After receiving the letter of appeal from  Wuhan's Association of Taiwan Businessmen, Governor Jia Zhijie  and Vice Governor Chen Shuiwen rapidly gave written instructions  that public security organs should ascertain the facts and  severely punish the assailants as soon as possible. However,  more than 10 days have passed since the case was filed and there  has not been any outcome from the investigation except a general  query of what happened at the scene, which was conducted by the  public security committee under the jurisdiction of the district  authority. This has aroused great dissatisfaction among the  parties concerned and the Taiwan businessmen in Wuhan, who said  that they would reveal the affair to the Straits Exchange  Foundation in Beijing [as published] and Taiwan media by fax.  According to the above briefing, relevant departments are  paying close attention to investigating and handling the affair,  and have assured the Taiwan businessmen of a fair result.</p>

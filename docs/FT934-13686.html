			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rank tumbles A raft of bearish rumours on Rank Organisation sent the shares tumbling to finish 25 down at 818p in busy turnover of 1.9m. The first to hit the stock as trading started was a strong rumour that the chief executive had sold shares this week in advance of a meeting with analysts prior to the group going into closed period. However, the company denied the story yesterday, saying the trade was a tax-related bed and breakfast deal and unrelated to the company's performance. The shares were further undermined by negative press comment over Rank's debt, together with rumours of an impending disposal. The talk added to nervous sentiment ahead of the analysts meeting a week on Friday, when Rank will issue a trading statement. Among oil issues, some US buying was reported in Shell Transport and BP, with the former climbing 7 1/2 to 708p and BP 4 1/2 to 333 1/2 p. Burmah Castrol eased a penny to 760p as BZW announced an auction of just over 1m shares that it agreed to take on via the recent enhanced share alternative. Enterprise Oil shares continued to enjoy the benefits of several recent buy notes and the stock price climbed 9 to 499p. Hardy Oil, which announced an oil discovery in Pakistan, firmed 3 to 176p. The market was twitchy over British Gas after a report by a group of independent gas companies pointed to the effect of a monopoly keeping the tariffs up. The stock lost 2 1/2 to 325 1/2 p. One analyst also pointed to some rotational buying moving through the sector. Tobacco and financial services group BAT Industries came under pressure late in the day after Philip Morris, its US rival, reported a 24.8 per cent decline in third-quarter income to Dollars 971m. The company blamed lower cigarette prices brought about by the current price war in the US market. BAT weakened 10 to 479p in trade of 3.7m. The long-awaited announcement of the appointment of executive directors at international trading group Lonrho was well received by the market. Active dealing brought turnover of 5.6m and the shares hardened 2 1/2 to 130 1/2 p. Favourable comment on construction and engineering group Trafalgar House helped to bring about a bounce in the shares and they moved forward 3 to 88p. Disappointing figures from plastics and metal components group McKechnie caused a slide in the shares. The 7 per cent increase in full-year figures to Pounds 24.5m was at the bottom of market expectations and accompanied by a cautious statement. At the day's worst the shares were down 19 at 426p. However, discussions with analysts and general bargain hunting saw some of the earlier gloom lifted and the stock closed a net 13 off at 432p. The news that US group Morgan Guaranty Trust had lowered its prime lending rate from 6 to 5.5 per cent, along with general profit-taking, led to a sharp decline in several banking stocks. The biggest fall was seen in Barclays, which lost 16 at 558p in trade of 3.3m. National Westminster slipped 10 to 559p. Profits downgradings for HSBC from several brokers to take account of Monday's Pounds 172m court judgment against its merchant banking subsidiary Samuel Montagu left the shares 16 cheaper at 747p. SG Warburg was also said to be cautious on the stock, while James Capel remains cool towards the sector as a whole. The recent profits downgrading from Strauss Turnbull for Abbey National continued to exact a toll on the shares and they gave up 8 to 414p. In a quiet property sector, Hammerson was the main focus of attention as it announced the restructuring of its shares. The details were well received and the ordinary stock advanced 14 to 413p and the 'A' shares 5 to 374p. News that BT could generate revenue of around Pounds 2bn a year by the end of the decade from video home entertainment services lifted the shares. The fully-paid stock closed 5 firmer at 464p and the partly-paid 6 up at 215 1/2 p. Profit-taking snipped Cable and Wireless back 22 to 952p, and Vodafone's strong run also ran out of steam, the shares ending 11 down at 560 1/2 p. Aero engine maker Rolls- Royce receded 4 1/2 to 147 1/2 p after securities house BZW was said to have downgraded profits expectations. Volume at the close was 4.6m. Defence stocks remained under a cloud as worries that the government would announce wide-ranging defence cuts in next month's Budget grew. Fears of such a move were heightened by Monday's announcement that the government is to sell two navy dockyards as part of a drive for defence savings. Rumours that a bear story is stalking Pilkington moved through the market, although many industry watchers seemed to be unaware of its nature. The shares declined 4 to 138p in a volume of 3m. Wolseley's results pleased the market and its shares forged ahead 18 to 692p. Bargain hunting pushed British Aerospace up 3 to 409p. But weakness was seen in Vosper Thornycroft, which lost 6 to 681p, and Vickers, 3 off at 151p. Among motor issues, Monday's visit to BBA Group by several analysts, which was initially seen as positive, led to caution yesterday. BZW was among securities houses that were cheered by the visit, but analysts at the securities house yesterday shaved the 1994 profits estimate by Pounds 5m to Pounds 75m, though they left the current year forecast at Pounds 60m. BZW cited continuing weakness in the European automotive sector for its move. BBA dipped 5 to 153p. Profit-taking clipped Airtours back by 5 to 450p. Thorn EMI remained friendless, declining 6 to 908p. Executive buying was said to have lifted Vardon, up 3 at 109p. Reflection on moves by Euro Disney to reduce its labour force left the shares under a cloud and 25 weaker at 595p. Compass Group fell heavily for the second session running, ending 18 lower at 552p. The company was said to be upbeat in the face of market talk of margin pressures in the catering industry.</p>

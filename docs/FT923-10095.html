			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / King's Cross plan advances THE LONG planning battle over a Pounds 3bn scheme to redevelop land beside London's King's Cross Station has moved a step nearer resolution after a decision by planning officials to give conditional approval. Next Thursday, Camden Council is expected to confirm the decision taken by its planning committee three days ago. Mr Phil Turner, joint deputy leader of the council, said the move was 'good for Camden and the people of this borough because it is a further step along the road to bringing this huge area into use'. The London Regeneration Consortium, which has been pursuing planning consent for four years, welcomed the decision. Mr Gordon Graham, a consultant to the consortium, said: 'We do not see any reason why in another six months or so we will not get an outline planning consent.' The consortium comprises Rosehaugh and Stanhope, two developers that have been badly affected by the property recession, and NFC, the freight company. To win approval, the developers have been required to reduce the proposed office space in the scheme by 615,000 sq ft to 5.25m sq ft. Development will not be possible until London office rents recover significantly. Mr Graham said he did not expect the scheme to start before 1995-96.</p>

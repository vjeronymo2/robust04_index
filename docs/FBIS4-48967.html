			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Guo Taiwen (6753 31412429): "The Undermining </F> of the Relations Between the Two Sides of the Taiwan Strait Is  Not Popular"]    [Text] Beijing, 29 Apr (XINHUA) -- Thirty-two compatriots  from the two sides of the strait died in the exceptionally  serious case of murder, robbery, and boat destruction which  occurred on Qiandao Lake. The people on both sides of the  strait feel the same pain for the unfortunate deaths of the  compatriots; they are happy that the case has been solved; and  compatriots on both sides of the strait are similarly indignant  at the crime perpetrated by the suspects. The feelings of our  fraternal compatriots cannot be separated.    None of the compatriots on both sides of the strait wanted  this unfortunate incident to happen. However, the unfortunate  incident has happened. After the grief, the first important  thing to do should be to try every means to quickly crack the  case and to punish the criminals in order to calm the people's  indignation. In fact, the public security departments and other  relevant organs in Zhejiang have acted in this way. Under the  concern of the Central Committee and the State Council and with  the vigorous assistance of the masses, the public security  cadres and police worked very hard and cracked the case in 17  days. The people on both sides of the strait felt some relief  after hearing this.    However, people have also noticed that after the incident  occurred, excitement lingered for quite a while on the island of  Taiwan. The Taiwan authorities and the "Taiwan independence"  movement seized the opportunity to exaggerate matters and create  incidents. Before the case was investigated, they spread all  kinds of rumors, created public opinion, and unscrupulously  fanned resentment among the people, and after exploiting the  incident again and again, they turned a criminal case into a  political matter, thus whipping up quite a big upsurge in  undermining cross-strait relations.    People have noticed that a person of high standing in Taiwan  shouted abuse at the Communist Party by employing remarks that  have not been used in decades. This was clearly an incident  committed by bad people, but some people slandered the mainland  authorities as "treating human life as if it were not worth a  straw and ignoring human rights." This was followed by calls  for the temporary suspension of the tourism trade, of commerce,  of exchanges, and of cross-strait talks on routine matters, as  well as calls for "a boycott" and "sanctions." A small number  of "Taiwan independence" elements, thinking that there was an  opportunity to exploit, once again openly called for "Taiwan  independence."    People cannot but ask: What do they want?    The answer is clear: They want to undermine the good  relations between the two sides of the strait.    Developing cross-strait relations to realize peaceful  reunification is the common desire of the people on both sides  of the strait. In the past few years, it was the common efforts  of the people of both sides that have enabled cross-strait  relations to develop rapidly. However, it should also be noted  that there are some people who go against the desire of the  masses. These people do not want to see cross-strait relations  continue to develop. They invariably try to find some pretext  to stop the relations from developing. After the "Qiandao Lake  incident" occurred, they thought that they had found an  opportunity to exaggerate matters. Therefore, they brought all  their skill into play and staged a vivid performance. However,  their performance has thoroughly exposed their true features of  undermining the relations between the two sides of the strait.    It should be pointed that some people on the island who did  not know the truth acted too excitedly or made excessively  improper remarks because of their indignation over the  criminals. This is normal human nature. Their frame of mind is  understandable. However, there are a small number of people with  ulterior motives who vainly attempted to exploit the incited  sentiments to realize their despicable purpose of undermining  cross-strait relations. The people on both sides of the strait  should heighten their vigilance against their scheme.    It is the trend of the times and the desire of the people to  realize the peaceful reunification between both sides of the  strait. No force can obstruct historical currents. To  accomplish the great cause of the reunification of the  motherland, the compatriots on both sides of the strait have  made unremitting efforts; they have done a great deal of work to  promote fruitful interaction through cross-strait relations.  Indeed, it has not been easy for cross-strait relations to  expand to the present level. All people who hope to see China  reunified should cherish cross-strait relations even more and  should never allow them to be undermined. A saying goes, "Green  hills cannot be hidden, and rivers will flow into the sea." The  relations between both sides of the strait were established by  hard work by the fraternal compatriots on both sides. Any scheme  to undermine the relations will be unpopular.</p>

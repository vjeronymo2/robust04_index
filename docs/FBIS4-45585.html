			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 23 Jun (MTI) -- In the first five months  of 1994, the number of violations on Hungary's borders was four  per cent lower than in the same period last year. However, the  count was still rather high, at 10,000 cases, Customs Guard  Brigadier-General Balazs Novaky told the press in Budapest on  Thursday. Most of the infringements were cases of trespassing,  but there have also been examples [of] organized crime, such as  smuggling people, weapons, and stolen cars, he added.    Border guards say the most frequent violation on the eastern  frontier sections was the presentation of false documents, while  at the western border there were many tourists who had legally  entered Hungary but tried to leave it via the "green frontier".  Most of the trespassers were Romanians, followed by Turks,  Ukrainians, and Bulgarians.    Hungarian frontier guards siezed about 200 kg of narcotics  and 1 kg of explosives this year, along with 13 hand grenades  and over 30 hand arms.    Brigadier-General Kalman Kiss summarized the experiences of  frontier guards in enforcing the latest legal measures  concerning foreigners, which became effective on May 1 of this  year.    He said that Hungarian frontier guards uncovered 37,000  violations in the first five months of 1994, and prevented  32,000 foreigners from entering Hungary. In addition, they have  taken 1,200 foreign citizens to a public camp to put them up  until they can be transported home. Frontier guards invariably  take measures against travellers who do not possess adequate  papers. They are also strict on people who do not have access  to enough money to cover the costs of their stay, as such  foreigners are likely to take black work or commit crimes,  Kalman said.</p>

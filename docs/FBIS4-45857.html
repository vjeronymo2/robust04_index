			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 25 (AFP) -- Sarajevo hospitals  Monday [25 April] took in a new load of wounded civilians with  more tales of hellish conditions in Gorazde.    "Hitler was an angel compared with these guys," a woman  escorting the evacuees, Ziba Hadzic, 62, said of the Serb forces  who had bombarded her home town in eastern Bosnia since late  March.    "He didn't go around setting hospitals and schools on fire."    The Kosevo hospital has set aside 500 beds, with 60 beds  also  available in the French City Hospital, Kosevo director Faruk  Konjhodzic said.    Four flights by UN helicopters delivered 91 more refugees  from Gorazde on Monday.    They were flown to a sports stadium which is being used as a  landing strip. Most of the wounded were missing limbs. One  woman had lost the whole of the lower half of her body.    Of 85 evacuees who arrived on Sunday, 36 had already been  operated on.    Most were very badly wounded or exhausted through loss of  blood, and others were in shock.    Some of the evacuees, having taken shelter in cellars, "have  not seen daylight for a fortnight or more," Konjhodzic said.    All but five or six of the cases involved in operations were  amputees. The great majority had shrapnel wounds.    Sixteen operating rooms were mobilised to deal with the  influx, the hospital director said.    Genevieve Begkoyan, a doctor with the UN High Commissioner  for Refugees, said that many of the wounded in Gorazde had  simply died through lack of medical care.    She said it had become more difficult to collect and prepare  evacuees for the flight because many of them had been taken back  to their homes, scattered around the town.    UN sources said that a breakdown of the figures of killed  and  wounded by gender and age indicated that local Bosnian  authorities had given priority to men of fighting age for  treatment in Gorazde hospital.    A UNHCR doctor who stayed in the town, Mary McLoughlin, said  there had "never been more that five percent of women and three  percent of children" in the hospital.</p>

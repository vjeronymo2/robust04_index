			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe, the federal judge hearing the stock  manipulation case against GAF Corp. ordered jurors to return next Monday in the  event a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that halted the trial is lifted. Sunday  night, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall temporarily halted the  trial and gave federal prosecutors until Wednesday to file arguments with the  Supreme Court. Marshall could possibly lift the stay or continue the halt while  the full Supreme Court continues to review the matter. GAF's first trial ended  in a mistrial two weeks ago.  </P></p>

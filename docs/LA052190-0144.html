			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Q&amp;A: WILLIAM B. FILBERT;  </P> <P> KEYING ON HIGH-TECH EXPORTS;  </P> <P> O.C. BUSINESSMAN ON ADVISORY PANEL PREDICTS CHANGES  </P> <P> As political tensions ease somewhat between Moscow and Washington, the business  world hopes to benefit from this warming of relations through increased trade.  </P> <P>  One sign of the benefits to come came last summer, when the U.S. Commerce  Department lifted export restrictions on a broad range of desktop personal  computers and cleared the way for their export to the Soviet Union and Eastern  Europe.  </P> <P>  But computer companies say this move, which cleared the way for technology  developed in the mid-1980s, is not enough. Clones of many other high-level  computers and computer peripherals are widely available from manufacturers in  the Far East and elsewhere.  </P> <P>  Earlier this month, President Bush unveiled a plan for a sweeping overhaul of  Western restrictions on high-technology exports to Eastern Europe. This  proposal will be up for discussion when the 17-nation Coordinating Committee on  Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom) meets next month in Paris. Cocom  administers export controls for the United States and its Western allies.  </P> <P>  Bush's plan is the result of suggestions gathered from government agencies and  the high-tech industry. Working behind the scenes is a group of 10 technical  advisory committees that cover the entire spectrum of technology, including  semiconductors, biotechnology, computers and telecommunications equipment. Each  committee is composed of various government agencies and industry  representatives who advise the Commerce Department on export-control policies.  </P> <P>  William B. Filbert, president of International Diversified Technologies Inc.  in Anaheim, sits on one of these panels, called the Computer Peripherals  Technical Advisory Committee. Filbert, an engineer by training, was appointed  to the committee by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher.  </P> <P>  In a recent interview with Times staff writer Cristina Lee, Filbert talked  about the nation's export-control policies and how computer companies, both  large and small, can have a say in influencing those policies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Q. What is the Computer Peripherals Technical Advisory Committee, and what are  its responsibilities?  </P> <P> A. This committee is one of 10 that have been in existence for many years. They  have been established to advise the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Export  Administration on how control should be established on various technical items.  It consists of eight members from the computer peripherals industry and nine  from the U.S. government representing the departments of Commerce, State and  Defense.  </P> <P> In this committee, there are two of us from California. I'm the only  representative from Southern California, and there is someone from the Bay Area  who works with Ampex Corp. in Redwood City. Ampex makes video recorders and  related equipment.  </P> <P> We're supposed to meet every other month at the Bureau of Export Administration  in Washington. But we've been meeting once a month during the past four to six  months because of all the changes taking place in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> We meet in both open and closed meetings. In the open meetings, there is the  opportunity for any company to present arguments to the committee about why a  particular commodity or group of commodities should be decontrolled.  </P> <P> This is not commonly known to the industry -- that there is this vehicle with  which to present your arguments to the committee and the U.S. government  simultaneously. The Federal Register announces committee meetings at least  three weeks ahead of their scheduled time. So this is an excellent opportunity  for members of the industry to present a description and the function of their  products and the problems they're having in exporting them.  </P> <P> There are many computer peripheral companies in Orange County. We have  Distributed Logic Corp., Emulex Corp., Western Digital Corp., AST Research  Inc., MAI Basic Four Inc. and Alpha Microsystems Inc. There are a number of  companies here that specialize in graphic workstations, which fall under the  computer peripheral area.  </P> <P> Q. What does the committee do with the arguments companies present during these  open meetings?  </P> <P> A. It is within the prerogative of the technical advisory committee to  formulate a position concerning those particular commodities. With assistance  from the various government agencies, we create a position that would represent  the U.S. government's position in Cocom.  </P> <P> Obviously, that procedure for approval can take a considerable amount of time.  It depends on the item and how critical it is. It could be a minimum of three  months and a maximum of forever. But a typical period might be in the order of  three to six months.  </P> <P> Q. Is this committee widely used by industry as a vehicle to loosen high-tech  export restrictions?  </P> <P> A. The larger companies take advantage of these open presentations. For  example, 3M made a presentation to us about two months ago. And they made a  presentation based upon the magnetic recording tapes they make. They came up  with a very strong argument that this tape is available through other sources  and, therefore, should be decontrolled. It made sense to do so. The technical  advisory committee took that under consideration.  </P> <P> I contacted a number of companies in Orange County that I felt could use the  CPTAC to express their concerns and the problems they've had in exporting. I  have yet to have one come and actually take advantage of the service.  </P> <P> The reasons, I think, are a combination of several factors. It's either  everyone does not realize that there is such a group, or they're too busy to  take the time to fight these kinds of problems. And there's the natural  reluctance on the part of many of us, whether we are in the engineering field  or just private citizens, to say that it's not worth the time to fight city  hall.  </P> <P> I was one of those kinds of people for many years, but I've since found that  there is some value if you can find the right approach, that there is a value  in challenging the government concerning some of the restrictions they put on  our exports.  </P> <P> Q. How does a high-tech company wishing to export its products know if its  products fall within the limits of export control?  </P> <P> A. First of all, each company in the electronics business should go through a  classification of their products to find out whether it's controlled or  decontrolled. You can do that by going to the regulations and looking through  the commodity-control list.  </P> <P> Generally speaking, that can be a problem if the technical people within a  company are not familiar with the regulations, and, in turn, the people with  the regulations background don't have the technical experience. That's the  first hurdle.  </P> <P> If it's determined that a particular commodity is decontrolled, then they don't  have a problem and that commodity can be exported under a general license to  anywhere in the world except the embargoed countries. Currently, there are five  countries on that list: Libya, Cuba, Vietnam, Cambodia and North Korea.  </P> <P> If they find that the commodity is controlled, then they should ask at what  level is it controlled and if other general licenses are available for that  export of controlled commodity.  </P> <P> Q. What are the different levels under which export licenses are granted?  </P> <P> A. There are several levels under the individually validated license. There are  applications for exports for which you are likely to get approval. This means  you will, in all probability, get approval.  </P> <P> There are situations where you'll be given favorable consideration, which means  you may or may not get approval.  </P> <P> And there are those applications such as supercomputers for which you know you  won't get approval, so why bother?  </P> <P> So you need to know which slot your products fall in. That way, your sales and  marketing force knows where to target (its efforts).  </P> <P> These various categories are not only determined by technical performance  parameters but also by geographic areas. This is an area that many companies  overlook. They don't look at the fact that they should make a decision as to  what I'd call the proper "slotting" of the products. And, therefore, they may  lose marketing possibilities.  </P> <P> It is important for companies that are dealing with controlled commodities to  keep current with these changes. That way, when something becomes decontrolled  or fits in the general license categories, they can immediately alert their  sales force and go in and attack those markets. You can be sure that our  overseas competitors, primarily the Japanese and the West Germans, are doing  that. They are very aggressive in these overseas markets, and it's important  for U.S. exporters to be equally as aggressive.  </P> <P> Q. How can companies keep current with export-control changes?  </P> <P> A. Companies can find changes in export-control regulations in the Federal  Register. This is the official government document that is published daily,  except on federal holidays. It announces all of the various changes that take  place within the U.S. government, not just at the Bureau of Export  Administration. And it's the government's position that when any change is  published in the Federal Register, then the public has been informed. The  government's position is: If you don't know about it, that's your problem.  </P> <P> Q. From your observations, are the technology companies in Orange County  well-informed of developments in export licensing?  </P> <P> A. I'd say many are not. It could be for a number of reasons, such as they're  too busy or they don't appreciate the need for this.  </P> <P> In my opinion, one of the problems that Orange County companies and other firms  throughout the nation face is that we're just not sensitive to the  opportunities and the need to export overseas. Many marketing and sales people  just aren't tuned in to the international events that are taking place and  don't recognize or appreciate the potential opportunities that are presently  there or may exist in the near future.  </P> <P> Not many companies send representatives to attend international business  meetings around the area. I feel that Orange County and the nation truly are in  the midst of an international trade revolution. During the last 30 to 40 years,  so many things have changed as the result of the electronics revolution. The  advent of transistor radios, fax machines and personal computers has changed  the world. With changes in the Eastern bloc, as well in the European Economic  Community and in Hong Kong with China's takeover in 1997, I believe there is  another major revolution about to take place in international trade. In the  United States, I believe, we are not sensitive to that.  </P> <P> If I walk in the streets of other countries in the world, they talk about  what's going on in the world. When you walk the streets in the United States or  in Orange County, nobody talks about what's going on in the rest of the world.  We're not sensitive to it. And that's reflected among the business people of  the area.  </P> <P> I think there are some companies that are on top of changes that are taking  place in the licensing regulations as well as politically throughout the world.  But they're in the minority.  </P> <P> Q. What are the different technical advisory committees at the Bureau of Export  Administration?  </P> <P> A. The 10 different committees cover the computer peripherals, components and  related test equipment; semiconductors, transportation and related equipment;  telecommunications equipment; computer systems; electronic instrumentation;  automated manufacturing equipment; and biotechnology.  </P> <P> Q. Should high-tech companies expect any changes in export controls in 1990?  </P> <P> A. I think that over the remainder of the year, you'll see small changes taking  place that will give relief to various segments of the technology base here in  Orange County. However, I would think that any significant changes will occur  toward the end of the year.  </P> <P> Companies should start immediately reading the Federal Register. For example,  there was a significant change that was announced in February in which many  integrated circuits were placed under a general license (allowing them) to be  exported without prior government approval to most countries in the Free World.  That was a significant change for the integrated circuits industry.  </P> <P> I expect to see some changes of a similar magnitude occur in the computer and  computer peripheral areas between now and the end of the year.  </P> <P> But aside from decontrol, one of the major problems in dealing with the Eastern  European nations is currency exchange. (Eastern European nations) have a  limited amount of hard currency. Companies in the United States, in general,  and Orange County, in particular, don't have the experience and expertise to  deal with nations on a barter basis.  </P> <P> Some of the more sophisticated Japanese trading organizations and West German  trading organizations know how to do that. They have the mechanisms in place,  or they'll set them up in order to do trading. They will take the time and  trouble to do that.  </P> <P> Our export controls are going to be influenced not in the next six months but  in the next two years by changes in the European Economic Community and by what  position it takes in high-technology exports. Cocom, which fundamentally  controls high-tech exports to Eastern Europe, is obviously going to change as a  result of the European Economic Community's unification and West Germany's  plans to bring East Germany into its economy. That represents fundamental  political problems and, no doubt, changes in the NATO countries. And that is  going to effect Cocom.  </P></p>

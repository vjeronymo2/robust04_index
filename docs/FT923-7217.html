			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / International Company News: Roussel-Uclaf heightens French corporate gloom ROUSSEL-UCLAF, the French chemicals group, yesterday announced an 18.7 per cent fall in interim net profits to FFr188m (Dollars 37.67m) in the first half of 1992, compared with the same period last year. The news of Roussel's decline in profits is the latest in a series of gloomy announcements from the French corporate sector. The CAC-40 Index, yesterday fell by 1.17 per cent to 1,737. Roussel fared well in some markets during the first half, notably in health care products, but suffered in others, particularly in veterinary products where it has been hit by the economic problems of the former Soviet states. The group mustered a modest 3.2 per cent increase in sales to FFr7.34bn in the first half, and held the fall in net profits to 5 per cent on a comparable basis, allowing for restructuring and exceptional items.</p>

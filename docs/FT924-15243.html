			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Sceptics warm to Euro showdown TORY Euro-sceptics were openly relishing the prospect of a head-on confrontation with the party leadership yesterday as they put the final touches to their tactics for rallying support among grassroots activists during the conference. Rebel MPs held a private meeting in the afternoon to plan their strategy for the conference debates proper and for the fringe. Mr John Major, however, used his speech to the annual eve-of-conference dinner for Tory party agents to reaffirm his own commitment to the Maastricht treaty. The prime minister told them that his aim was for a European Community run in British interests, and warned that abandoning the agreement would mean no British government was ever taken seriously again in EC negotiations. Evidence of dissent was again apparent with the publication of several emergency amendments to conference motions on Europe and the economy, urging that the Maastricht treaty should not be ratified and that sterling should not rejoin the European exchange rate mechanism. The amendments are unlikely to be voted on, but organisers promised that the full range of opinion would be reflected in discussion. Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, said 'every worthwhile facet of debate' would be expressed. In a signal that the leadership wants to play down the fringe meetings, at which former cabinet ministers are expected to be among those challenging government policy, he added: 'The major action at this conference will not be at fringe meetings, it will be at the conference itself.' Looking beyond the conference, the most outspoken Euro-sceptics predicted that if Mr Major proceeded with the Maastricht bill it might prove to be his downfall, with one hinting that revolt might spread to other issues. Equating such a move with 'opening up the Russian front', Mr Tony Marlow said the only way Mr Major could secure the bill would be by a coalition with the Labour party.</p>

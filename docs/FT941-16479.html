			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Hot property The speed of the revival in the UK property market, following its worst recession in decades, has been remarkable - in stock market terms, at least. The intriguing question is how much more there is to come. Since sterling's exit from the exchange rate mechanism, the market value of property shares has risen almost three-fold to Pounds 15bn. Some companies have shown even more startling gains. For example, British Land, boosted by the company's association with the omnipresent Mr George Soros, has seen its shares jump from 110p to 411p. Big property companies have taken advantage of the market's enthusiasm to raise Pounds 1.4bn of new equity. That has given them leeway to buy properties and shore up strained balance sheets, underpinning dividends and further enhancing the sector's appeal. Even the wave of new issues has scarcely dampened investors' ardour. Investment demand has been driven by comparative yield considerations. With long dated gilt yields falling below those on property, fund managers have shown a voracious appetite for both bricks and mortar and their paper substitute. Some estimates suggest Pounds 10bn of investment money is looking for a home in property, depressing last year's double-digit yields on prime London offices to 7 per cent. Likewise, the yield on property shares has been chased down from a peak of 9.5 per cent at the end of 1992 to 3.5 per cent - although part of that fall reflects dividend cuts. Share ratings have risen so fast that many property companies are trading at a premium to net asset values. The tacit assumption is that these asset values are significantly understated. However, the surge of investment interest has discouraged owners from selling both physical assets and shares, further squeezing up prices. Such is the level of demand that some segments of the market appear in danger of overheating. Yields on some prime retail sites have dropped as low as 4 per cent, within range of their historic lows, suggesting some worryingly indiscriminate buying. Property has traditionally been viewed as a quasi-equity investment, providing a good hedge against inflation with the prospect of capital growth. Yet investors currently seem to regard it more as a bond with a fixed income stream. That may prove reasonable if inflation remains low and the comparative virtues of property against gilts and equities remain solid. But current yields leave little by way of risk premium. The danger comes if the economy stalls, interest rates rise, rental growth remains elusive and the government starts tampering with the tenant law. Such doubts make it unlikely that property shares will keep rising at such a prodigious rate this year. But while there may be some bumps along the way, the longer term direction still looks assured. Property remains a highly cyclical investment and the upswing is still in its infancy. At its last peak in 1988, the property sector accounted for 4.2 per cent of the equity market's total capitalisation. Despite the recent surge, it accounts for just 2 per cent today.</p>

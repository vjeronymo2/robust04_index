			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A drenching thunderstorm reduced a 13,000-acre fire, much of it in the Osceola  National Forest in northern Florida, to only a few smoldering hot spots, fire  officials said. About 200 firefighters and 41 bulldozers remained on the scene  to watch the hot spots that remained from the fire, which doubled in size  Saturday after shifting winds drove an 80-foot-high wall of flames northward  toward State Road 2. The firefighters, including 40 members of a specially  trained squad from the Ozark National Forest in Arkansas, succeeded in stopping  flames from spreading northward Saturday night, ending the threat to virgin  pine land and the Okefenokee Swamp across the border in Georgia. Authorities  said that the fire apparently started when the transmission in a log-moving  vehicle used in commercial timber operations broke down and ignited woods just  outside the national forest.  </P></p>

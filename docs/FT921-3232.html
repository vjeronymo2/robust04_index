			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Slaughters tops league table of profitability SLAUGHTER and May, the City solicitors, has emerged as the UK's most profitable law firm last year according to a league table of earnings published by the magazine Legal Business. Slaughter and May had average net profits per partner of Pounds 377,000 on a turnover of Pounds 113m and profits per fee earner (lawyer) of Pounds 65,000. The firm has 542 fee earners. Its nearest rival was Linklaters &amp; Paines with profits per partner of Pounds 349,000 on a turnover of Pounds 144m and profits per fee earner of Pounds 69,000. Linklaters has 692 lawyers. The UK's largest law firm, Clifford Chance, not surprisingly had the biggest turnover of Pounds 232m. With more than 200 partners and 1,122 fee earners its profits per partner were Pounds 278,000. Most of the top 10 most profitable firms had gross fee revenues of about Pounds 1m per partner, according to the legal business statistics. The magazine says it has had the co-operation of partners in the vast majority of firms in compiling its figures, although there was a 'handful' of firms for which it made 'informed guesses'. None of the firms included in the league table would admit yesterday to having co-operated with the magazine. Categorical denials of co-operation were given by Slaughter and May, Freshfields, Lovell White Durrant, Allen &amp; Overy, Linklaters &amp; Paines and Clifford Chance. No firm was prepared to comment on the accuracy of the figures, however. The magazine stresses that profits per partner did not represent take-home pay. There are a few senior partners in London firms who earn more than Pounds 1m a year but in general earnings for partners in the top firms range from about Pounds 200,000 a year for junior partners to Pounds 500,000 for senior partners, it says. Most large law firms operate a 'lockstep system' which means their earnings are capped after a certain number of years in the partnership. Also, in many firms partners are expected to plough back some of their 'draw' to provide working capital.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------       THE TOP TEN LAW FIRMS RANKED BY PROFITS PER PARTNER 1991  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Firm                         profits per         Gross     number of                                  partner          fees       lawyers  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1  Slaughter and May      Pounds 377,000   Pounds 113m         542 2  Linklaters &amp; Paines    Pounds 349,000   Pounds 144m         692 3  Allen &amp; Overy          Pounds 344,000   Pounds  94m         519 4  Lovell White Durrant   Pounds 321,000   Pounds 111m         599 5  Herbert Smith          Pounds 312,000   Pounds  89m         448 6  S J Berwin &amp; Co        Pounds 302,000   Pounds  27m         151 7  Freshfields            Pounds 293,000   Pounds 115m         556 8  Macfarlanes            Pounds 291,000   Pounds  26m         175 9  Simmons &amp; Simmons      Pounds 281,000   Pounds  84m         444 10 Clifford Chance        Pounds 278,000   Pounds 232m       1,122  --------------------------------------------------------------------- The table gives a figure for the average net profit generated per equity partner within a firm.

			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEAMS ENTER MAJOR LEAGUE MEETINGS WITH LISTS OF NEEDS;  </P> <P> ANGELS: CAUTIOUS PORT LOOKING TO TRADE AN OUTFIELDER FOR AN INFIELDER. BICHETTE  SEEMS MOST LIKELY TO BE DEALT.  </P> <P> There is no trading deadline compelling them to make a deal at the annual  winter meetings, but the Angels say they feel pressure about shoring up the  many weak spots in their lineup.  </P> <P> "The urgency is there in that, certainly, our aspiration is to get better,"  General Manager Mike Port said Thursday. "But you have to balance that urgency  you feel and be careful it doesn't translate into foolishness."  </P> <P> The Angels are hardly an impetuous bunch. Over the years, they have made few  trades at the winter meetings and even fewer major deals. In 1988, they  acquired catcher Bill Schroeder from the Milwaukee Breweres for infielder Gus  Polidor, and in 1987 acquired pitcher Dan Petry from the Detroit Tigers for  outfielder Gary Pettis. Tim Foli was acquired from the Pittsburgh Pirates  during the 1981 meetings and dealt to the New York Yankees during the 1983  meetings.  </P> <P> Port said the deal he described as near completion 10 days ago has been put on  hold but hasn't fallen through. He wouldn't specify the object of his efforts  but did say the deal would bring the Angels an infielder. The cost would  probably be an outfielder, Dante Bichette the likely candidate.  </P> <P> "We'd like to be able to go forward with it, but if we don't get a, 'Yes, we  have a deal,' then it wasn't meant to be," Port said. "I hope that's not the  case."  </P> <P> A number of teams are interested in Devon White, and although the Angels have  grown exasperated with his inability to translate potential into production,  they may not be able to afford to trade him.  </P> <P> "I don't think we have a viable (replacement) candidate within the organization  at this point," said Manager Doug Rader, who will join the Angels' delegation  in Chicago today. "It's a moot point until there's a suitable replacement. . .  .  </P> <P> "It's very, very important for everybody to understand Devo's name is out  there, but that's not necessarily because we are bandying it about. His ability  and potential mean there's always going to be interest in him, and rightfully  so. Those inquiries are not coming because we're putting his name out there."  </P> <P> The Angels have made finding a regular second baseman their priority, although  they also are looking for a productive third baseman and a left-hander for the  bullpen. The Toronto Blue Jays reportedly are making second baseman Manny Lee  available and might also give up left-hander John Cerutti. They plan to move  Mookie Wilson out of center field, a position Bichette or White could fill. But  if the Angels need a center fielder in return, the Blue Jays can't accommodate  them.  </P> <P> Lee had a strong first half last season but tailed off in the second half and  finished at .243 with six home runs and 43 runs batted in. He made only four  errors in 550 chances for a .993 fielding percentage. Cerutti was 9-9 in 30  games -- 23 of them starts -- and had a 4.76 earned-run average.  </P> <P> The Houston Astros are said to be willing to trade switch-hitting third baseman  Ken Caminiti but supposedly aren't interested in White and want a prospect in  return. Caminiti hit .255 in 1989 with 10 homers and 72 RBIs, but his numbers  dropped last season to .242, four homers and 51 RBIs. He made 21 errors at  third in 382 chances for a fielding percentage of .945.  </P> <P> Steve Sax would solve the Angels' problem at second, but their chances of  acquiring Sax from the Yankees apparently have diminished.  </P> <P> "I think that's a dead issue," said Dan O'Brien, the Angels' senior vice  president for baseball operations. "I think the Yankees are going to keep him."  </P> <P> Port denied last week that the Angels were trying to acquire Cleveland's Jerry  Browne or Atlanta's Jeff Treadway.  </P> <P> The Angels are interested in third baseman Jim Presley, a free agent who hit  .242 with 19 homers and 72 RBIs for the Braves last season. Rader, however,  reiterated that the club considers dabbling in free agency the least attractive  of its alternatives.  </P> <P> "You can be very tempted by quick-fix free agency, but it has an everlasting  and devastating effect on the organization," Rader said. "We need to really  devote ourselves to sticking to our organizational philosophy. . . . There's a  few (free agents) who certainly would tempt us, but it's prohibitive."  </P> <P> Signing new-look free agents won't cost clubs a draft pick, as will be the case  when they sign re-entry free agents. Angel President Richard Brown said the  delay in announcing the list of new-look free agents hasn't affected his  maneuvering.  </P> <P> "We have not held up any potential trades based on who will be new-look free  agents," he said. "I wouldn't say we're less likely to make a deal because the  list hasn't come out yet. We know what our weaknesses are. We're going after  those holes and trying to fill them. We're talking. A deal or two may be  consummated before, during or slightly after the meetings."  </P> <P> Brown also said the Angels won't give free-agent left-hander Dave Righetti the  five-year contract he's seeking, but they remain interested in him. Brown said  the club has had no more than one or two meaningful conversations with  Righetti's agent, Bill Goodstein.  </P> <P> "They're talking perhaps four (years) firm," Brown said. "Are we interested?  Yes. We're interested in all quality free agents. Have we had negotiations?  No."  </P></p>

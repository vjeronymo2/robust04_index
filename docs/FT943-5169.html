			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Airbus will run project to build military aircraft Development and production of the Future Large Aircraft, Europe's proposed military transport, will be managed by Airbus, the civil airliner consortium, which announced plans to establish a new military equipment subsidiary yesterday. The move is designed to strengthen the FLA group and to help market the aircraft to potential customers - including the Royal Air Force, which is considering purchases of the FLA or the Hercules aircraft produced by Lockheed of the US. Announcing the move at the Farnborough International Air Show, Mr Dick Evans, chief executive of British Aerospace, said Airbus had an excellent record of managing aircraft development projects. He used the occasion to promote the merits of the FLA against its American challenger. 'The FLA is right operationally for the RAF. It is also right economically, with lower life-cycle costs, and right industrially, as it will protect 35,000 high-tech aerospace jobs in Europe. This is our only opportunity for 35 years to become a part of a large transport aircraft programme.' The separate military subsidiary will include the Italian aerospace company, Alenia, as well as the four Airbus partners, Deutsche Aerospace, Aerospatiale, British Aerospace and Casa, of Spain. The consortium estimates that there may be a market for 350 FLA in Europe over the next 20 years. The intention is to provide customers with a fixed-price, fixed-specification programme to reduce the risk of cost overruns. Exact shareholdings in the military subsidiary will depend on the financial commitments from the companies involved and their respective governments, and on the number of FLA each country requires. The share-out of work will be determined by similar criteria. British Aerospace hopes to make the wings for the new aircraft, while Italy and Spain are competing for the final assembly line. Shareholdings in the main Airbus Industrie consortium will not be affected by the move. Mr Evans said the rapid consolidation of the US defence industry posed challenges for European companies: 'Bringing FLA within the Airbus consortium is one way of deepening ties between European companies.' The FLA is competing with Lockheed's latest-generation C-130J Hercules to replace the RAF's ageing transport fleet. Lockheed has valid export licences for the UK, but it is under investigation in the US over alleged bribery, Mr Evans said the FLA would carry more equipment further and faster than the C-130J, at lower operating costs. In a separate announcement, Lockheed said that refurbishing the existing RAF Hercules fleet until the FLA became available in 2002 was not an option. 'Other Hercules fleet operators with newer aircraft have rejected the idea of refurbishment,' said Mr Mickey Blackwell, president of Lockheed Aeronautical Systems.

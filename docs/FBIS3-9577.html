			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Delegates to the fourth nationwide assembly of  the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] are gathered in  the district office in Presov today. Our correspondents Anna  Samelova and Ivan Samel report from Presov:    [Samel] Good morning to you from Presov. About 200 citizens  have been waiting for the delegates to the congress since this  morning. The movement's chairman, Vladimir Meciar, joined them  shortly before 1000 and addressed the gathering.    [Samelova] In his brief address, Vladimir Meciar recalled  that, with the voters' support, the HZDS had resolved the issue  of the Slovak Republic's statehood. Now, it is to resolve the  issue of the peace and prosperity of the state. Vladimir Meciar  thinks it would be sensible to complete what was begun in the  referendum or, in other words, the issue of early elections.  That is why one of the main points of the assembly's  deliberations will be to draft the movement's policy for the  election period 1994-98. The implementation of this policy will  begin next Monday. We lost a major battle in the parliament,  Vladimir Meciar went on to say, but we will win the war. The  HZDS chairman then handed the floor to Ivan Gasparovic [Slovak  parliament speaker], who, in essence, reiterated what Vladimir  Meciar had said.    [Samel] Following the gala opening of the assembly and  addresses by invited political parties, the agenda of the  assembly has begun.    Despite the fact that he has not been invited to the  assembly, the president of the Republic, who is still an HZDS  member, has at least sent a greetings message to the congress.  It says that the HZDS is a substantial political force in  Slovakia, whose position in the center of the political spectrum  attracts hundreds of thousands of citizens with most varied  opinions.    I quote from the letter: It would not be correct if I were  to  conceal the tension between the HZDS chairman and the president,  which gradually grew into open attacks against the president of  the Slovak Republic. Even though this tension does exist, its  nature is not personal. However, as a social and political  conflict, it had a negative impact on the developments in our  country as a whole. As president, I had to take a position on  this. I expressed my position in the National Council of the  Slovak Republic. At the same time, I urged all political  entities to support the policy of national, political, and civic  reconciliation. It is our duty to seek and choose decisions and  solutions that will satisfy not only us but, first and foremost,  our fellow citizens.    In the conclusion of his letter, Michal Kovac wished the  congress peaceful proceedings and expressed the hope that the  congress would be a continuation of the best policies that  yielded undeniable success for the HZDS over the past three  years.    [Samelova] According to the information we have, no one has  yet read the contents of the letter from the president to the  assembly delegates. [passage omitted]</p>

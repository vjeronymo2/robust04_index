			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Middle East and jobs news weaken Dow Wall Street DISQUIETING news about employment and continuing unease about developments in the Middle East drove US share prices sharply lower for the second consecutive day, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed off 17.29 at 3,251.67 after dropping more than 36 points at mid-day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 1.66 lower at 429.07, while the Amex composite finished down 1.28 at 395.84, and the Nasdaq composite down 1.00 at 677.21. Volume on the NYSE was 265m shares, and declines outnumbered rises by 1,175 to 677. Profit-taking was a factor in the morning decline, but there was no comfort to be found in the unexpectedly weak employment figures for December. The market had expected non-farm payrolls to rise by about 83,000, but the increase was a more modest 64,000, with the rate of civilian unemployment unchanged at 7.3 per cent. In addition, investors remain concerned about the prospects of renewed hostilities in the Middle East which could hurt US consumer confidence and interfere with economic recovery. In the retail sector, Woolworth fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 28 7/8 after the company had revealed a disappointing 1 per cent improvement in domestic same-store sales for the Christmas period. An analyst at Dean Witter downgraded his investment rating on the stock and reduced fourth quarter earnings estimates. Trading was also heavy in Wal-Mart, the biggest US retailer in terms of sales, which fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 59 3/4 in spite of a 10 per cent advance in same-store sales. A number of drug company stocks were actively traded including Merck, up Dollars 1 at Dollars 42 1/2 and Bristol-Myers Squibb, down Dollars 1/4 at Dollars 62 5/8 . Johnson &amp; Johnson added Dollars 1 to Dollars 46 5/8 . IBM lost Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 46 1/2 , a new 52-week low. On the Nasdaq market Intel slipped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 98 3/4 , Microsoft eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 87 1/8 and Novell fell Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 30 1/4 . The Federal Trade Commission plans to meet in early February to decide whether it will take anti-trust action against Microsoft, the world's biggest supplier of computer software, which has been expanding into a number of market segments. Biogen soared Dollars 4 to Dollars 43 1/4 following a strong endorsement by Bear Stearns, which rated the stock a top biotechnology issue. Canada TORONTO stocks ended a week of heavy trading on a losing note, as did most important world markets. The composite index fell 7.10 points, or 0.21%, to 3311.77, for a loss on the week of about 38 points. Declining issues were ahead of advances by 318 to 294. Volume fell to 50,887,000 shares from 58,131,000 shares yesterday, and trading value was CDollars 385.7m as compared with CDollars 457.6m on Thursday. Among the sub-indices, nine of the 14 were lower and one was unchanged. Industrial products were off 0.97% on index, while golds and energy fell moderately.</p>

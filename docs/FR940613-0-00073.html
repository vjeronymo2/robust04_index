			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comments Submitted to Docket 90&hyph;9  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Should ``beverage trailer'' and ``beverage semitrailer'' be defined in the proposed regulation?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Six respondents commented on defining the ``beverage trailer'' and ``beverage semitrailer.'' Two State DOT's (FDOT and VDOT) and the Port Authority requested that the terms ``beverage trailer'' and ``beverage semitrailer'' be defined in order to administer the regulation without erroneous interpretations. They see this terminology as a potential enforcement problem. The individual stated that the definition was incomplete as it was now written and should specify that the trailer has side access only for cargo. The trailer manufacturer requested that it not be defined because the trailers are also used for palletized cargo as well. Other types of cargo hauled on this type of trailer include automobile batteries, coin compartments from pay telephones, mushrooms, and nursery plants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The trailer manufacturer also suggested that the regulation read as follows: ``with the center line of the kingpin mounted not more than 28 feet from the rear of the semitrailer *&blank;*&blank;*.'' It requested the addition of the words ``the center line of'' because (1) in the semitrailer design under consideration, every inch is important, (2) this change would provide more swing clearance for the tractor under the gooseneck area of the semitrailer, (3) the length of the trailer body would not be increased, and (4) it is common in the industry to specify kingpin location by kingpin center. Based on these comments, the FHWA has modified the definition to state that the semitrailer have ``side access only'' and that the cargo be limited to bottled or canned beverages. The definition has also been revised to allow the 28-foot length to be measured from the centerline of the kingpin to the rear of the semitrailer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Is the proposed length limit for the upper coupler extension of the semitrailer clear?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The trailer manufacturer and the individual commented that the proposed length limit of the upper coupler was clear and in a workable location. They did not foresee any possible misinterpretation. The trailer manufacturer responded that by limiting the upper coupler extension to fall within the swing radius of the front corner of the semitrailer it is both clear and very workable. This approach has been allowed for the purpose of excluding other front-mounted items from length measurement and accordingly is to be used for this case as well. The FDOT commented that the proposed length limit was not clear as described in the June 25, 1990, NPRM. The FDOT also suggests that language is needed to assure that the coupler plate does not become a cargo carrier in and of itself and that the device stays reasonable in length. The MnDOT responded that its law currently allows semitrailers of 28.5 feet, in three vehicle combinations, and the proposed design would only minimally exceed the current standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with these comments, the FHWA concludes that not allowing the upper coupler plate extension to extend beyond the swing radius of the semitrailer is a clear and sufficient means to restrict the length of this device. The operational rules have been amended to specify that the upper coupler plate itself cannot be used to carry cargo.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Will the semitrailer, as configured, be as safe as one with the upper coupler plate positioned fully under the semitrailer?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Caltrans, MnDOT, trailer manufacturer, and individual agreed that the configuration would be as safe as the upper coupler positioned fully under the semitrailer. The FDOT commented that the final rule should include requirements similar to those found in 49 CFR part 393, subpart F_Coupling Devices and Towing Methods. These and other Federal regulations continue to apply to beverage trailers and need not be cross-referenced in every other applicable regulation. Due to the specialized nature of the equipment discussed here, however, reference to an applicable provision of 49 CFR part 393 is included.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The trailer manufacturer responded that the configuration would be safe because the maximum kingpin-to-trailer axle span will be 25.5 feet. A single 53-foot semitrailer can have a kingpin-to-center of trailer tandem-axle span of 45.5 feet and still be considered safe. The individual commented that there is no reason to believe that trailers produced to this configuration would be less safe than trailers with upper couplers fully under the trailer. Dump trailers and short container chassis often have configurations that place the kingpin forward of the body.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The VDOT commented that demonstrations should be conducted with each type of semitrailer to determine any difference between the two mounting plates. A demonstration is not necessary because this style of trailer has been in operation for several years, and the operating characteristics are known to be compatible to other trailers in current use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the comments, the FHWA concludes that the semitrailer as configured will be as safe as one with the upper coupler positioned fully under the semitrailer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Will the position of the kingpin, not more than 28 feet from the rear of the semitrailer, produce offtracking characteristics that are significantly greater than those of conventional 28-foot semitrailers?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Port Authority and the manufacturer responded ``no'' to the question. The Port Authority commented that it appears to them that the offtracking of the beverage semitrailer combinations set forth in the proposed regulation will not differ significantly from the conventional semitrailer combinations already permitted upon port authority vehicular crossings. The trailer manufacturer used a ``sum of squares'' method to determine offtracking (Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) J695) and does not find a great increase in offtracking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

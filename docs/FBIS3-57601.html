			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Professor Vasyl Tarasenko: "Ukraine Became </F> Proprietor of Nuclear Weapons Much Earlier Than Great Britain,  France, or China; Therefore, Ukraine Enjoys Full Rights of a  Nuclear Power"]    [Text] Ukraine is constantly experiencing high pressure  from different parties aimed at forcing Ukraine to eliminate its  nuclear weapons. Economic, political, and financial pressure is  followed by constant threats of increasing this pressure, though  the history and the essence of this nuclear issue is well-known  both in the CIS and the international community.    The reaction of public and state structures to this  blackmail  is diverse. A certain part, as the Supreme Council has stated,  is ready to surrender to the domestic and foreign pro-imperial  forces, which demand the elimination of nuclear weapons by  Ukraine, while the supporters of the absolute independence of  Ukraine refuse to eliminate nuclear weapons from Ukrainian  territory. This part of the public cannot ignore the sad  lessons from the history of Ukraine and the lessons connected  with the role of nuclear weapons in the domestic and foreign  policy of the imperial elite of the former USSR.    The international community knows that the leadership of the  erstwhile USSR regarded the nuclear weapons as their strategic  force, as effective pressure and their trump card in their  expansionist foreign policy. Political and military structures,  which existed in the USSR, specified the character of relations  between the empire and the Republic of Ukraine. The empire used  Ukraine's potential and suppressed its tiny sprouts of  democracy, persecuted the tendencies for the revival of the  national culture, and threatened all the attempts to gain  autonomy, saying nothing about the creation of an independent  state; it depressed Ukraine both morally and physically with the  help of penitentiaries, working camps, forced hunger, and the  murdering of the cream of Ukrainian humanitarian and  scientific-technical intelligentsia.    Have not you heard threats and claims from Moscow -- the  capital of the Russian Federation -- to divide Ukraine or to  liquidate its independence along with demands to do away with  Ukrainian national- democratic forces? Does not the notorious  decision of the Russian legislature from 9 June 1993 repeat the  black sides of Ukrainian history? Most importantly, this  decision was adopted practically unanimously with seven  abstentions and three rejections. Not only well-known  chauvinists and supporters of the revival of the empire voted  against it, but also the deputies who consider themselves  democrats. In my mind, a certain part of the Ukrainian  population, which has an ironical attitude toward this decree,  is making a terrible mistake. The fact that this decree on  Sevastopol was not implemented today means that it will be  implemented tomorrow.    We should not ignore the fact that tactical nuclear weapons,  withdrawn to Russia, have not been destroyed but have been  carefully stored. In the midst of all these frightening  circumstances, Ukraine is forced to repeat the same actions with  its strategic nuclear weapons.    It seems to me that the high Ukrainian authorities differ in  opinion on this issue. Otherwise, how could you interpret the  17 August 1993 statement of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev during his visit to Sweden on the fact that in several  days, Russia and Ukraine are going to sign an agreement on the  elimination of strategic nuclear weapons stationed on the  territory of Ukraine. In turn, our former Foreign Minister K.  Morozov negatively commented on Kozyrev's statement and refuted  it. Briefly, Ukrainian Foreign Minister A. Zlenko issued his  statement refuting Morozov's commentary. Therefore, my opinion  on the lack of unanimity in the Ukrainian Government has a  strong footing.    However, currently, only nuclear weapons can guarantee the  security and independence of Ukraine. We should not be so naive  and shortsighted as to take seriously the promises of the United  States to be our guarantor of independence because recent years  have demonstrated a real price of such "guarantees."    In addition, the issue is being discussed in a topsy-turvy  fashion. The statement, which says that Ukraine, by refusing to  eliminate its nuclear weapons, becomes an illegal nuclear power  and promotes the proliferation of nuclear weapons, is  ungrounded. Or, perhaps, you can compare Ukraine with the North  Korea, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq which have no status of being a  nuclear state but wish to gain it. In reality, Ukraine, as a  sovereign republic within the USSR, became proprietor of  nuclear weapons much earlier than Great Britain, France, or  China, because it became a nuclear state simultaneously with the  USSR. From the very beginning of its existence as a nuclear  state, Ukraine has been and is a sovereign subject of the  international community. Indisputable facts prove this concept.  For example, Ukraine participated in the San Francisco  Conference in 1945 and it signed the UN Statute. In addition,  Ukraine has also signed the peaceful post-war agreements with  Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, and Romania....    Ukraine, along with Great Britain, the United States,  France,  and other countries, is a member of numerous international  organizations. Twice, it was elected a UN Security Council  member. Moreover, the Russian Federation has never had such  international prestige. Therefore, the legal international  status of Ukraine after World War II has been similar to that of  other independent states.    I would like to add one more fact. Ukraine has suffered  materially, financially, and ecologically during the process of  the creation of the USSR nuclear missile potential. Most of  these nuclear weapons were produced on the territory of Ukraine  at Ukrainian factories, and by hundreds of thousands of  Ukrainian workers, engineers, and researchers. A considerable  amount of these nuclear weapons were stored in Ukrainian  territory. All this gives Ukraine the right to say that it has  been and is a nuclear power, along with Russia, and the nuclear  weapons stationed on its territory have been, from the very  beginning, the property of the Ukrainian state, though the  imperial circles of the former USSR cynically ignored Ukraine's  international legal status by making it a colony, while its  military potential with nuclear missiles was considered to be  the USSR's property.    These circumstances give no right either to Western or to  Eastern countries to demand that Ukrainian nuclear weapons be  eliminated. According to international law, Ukraine could demand  that the United States, the Russian Federation, Great Britain,  France, and China, simultaneously with Ukraine, eliminate their  nuclear weapons. Therefore, both West and East should realize a  certain reality: The existence of Ukraine as a nuclear state has  not upset the balance of power in the world; the formal  appearance of Ukraine on the list of nuclear states has not  added any additional units of weapons on the international  arena. In fact, everything has remained without any changes.  Political tricks will amount to nothing. West and East should  realize that they can discuss the destiny of Ukrainian nuclear  weapons only during the talks with other nuclear states, among  which Ukraine will be a full-fledged member.</p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKETS: A NOTE OF CAUTION: TIMING UPSWINGS ISN'T EASY  </P> <P> If you believe that the recession you've been hearing so much about is a  typical one, you had better hurry and give your broker a call. Stock prices  should start to rally this winter.  </P> <P> But if you are one of the growing number of people who feel deep down that this  recession will be longer and more severe than most postwar downturns, hold off  making that call.  </P> <P> "The rule of thumb has always been that a new bull market begins halfway into  the recession," says Allen Sinai, chief economist for Boston Co.  </P> <P> That's because the stock market always tries to anticipate events. In this  case, Wall Street is attempting to figure out when the Federal Reserve Board's  loosening of interest rates will begin bolstering the economy.  </P> <P> So if you believe the conventional wisdom that says the U.S. entered a  recession on Aug. 2, the day Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, and will start  pulling out of a recession in late spring, you'll want to start loading up on  stocks before you start loading up on New Year's champagne.  </P> <P> Of course, this time around the rule of thumb could turn out to be just a dumb  rule. For one thing, only with hindsight have experts learned that stocks start  rallying halfway through a recession.  </P> <P> When the nation is actually in a recession, the experts usually can't even  agree on when the downturn began, much less when it will end. And the peculiar  problems this time around -- like the 1980s surge in personal and corporate  debt, the fragile banking system and the unstable Middle East situation -- are  making it even more difficult for reasonable economists to agree.  </P> <P> Making the situation even tougher to scope out is the fact that a recession  hasn't even officially been declared, even though most experts would now agree  that one is under way.  </P> <P> A recession is commonly defined as having occured when the nation's output of  goods and services (gross national product) declines for two straight quarters.  So far there hasn't even been one quarter in which the gross national product  has declined.  </P> <P> Critics of the government's data-gathering system say the GNP numbers can't be  trusted. H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist of Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp; Co.,  recently told his clients that the 1.8% increase in GNP that the government  reported for the third quarter of 1990 was "as phony as a $3 bill -- artifacts  of an arcane algebra that bore no relation to economic reality."  </P> <P> That 1.8% gain followed a 0.4% improvement in the second quarter, a 1.7% gain  in the first quarter and a gain of just 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 1989.  That fourth quarter figure reflects a sharp downward revision by the  government.  </P> <P> Some experts believe Washington will eventually adjust all of this year's GNP  numbers lower -- maybe enough to show that a recession began in early 1990.  </P> <P> In trying to calculate the mid-point of the recession that hasn't been declared  yet, keep in mind that the average post-World War II recession has been 11  months long. But the 1970 and 1982 recessions each lasted 16 months. And  according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private group,  recessions during this century have lasted as long as two years (excluding the  Great Depression of the 1930s).  </P> <P> The middle of an 11-month recession that began in August would be mid-January.  But if an investor is trying to pick the mid-point of an 11-month recession  that began last January, he should have been buying stocks about the time  Saddam Hussein was causing trouble.  </P> <P> But what if this recession turns out to be one of the 18-month variety? Or  maybe the excesses of the 1980s together with recent tax increases and the  deliberate inflation-fighting style of the Fed will make this recession a  record breaker? Or maybe . . .  </P> <P> You get the picture. Picking the midpoint of a recession is about as difficult  as determining what Bo Jackson will do for a midlife career change.  </P> <P> But Wall Street experts say that's just what a lot of professional investors  have been trying to do. They contend that some of the stocks market's bounce in  recent weeks can be attributed to aggressive investors trying to anticipate the  economic recovery and events in the Middle East.  </P> <P> Gene Jay Seagle, director of technical research at Gruntal &amp; Co., is one of  those bulls. Seagle isn't trying to time the recession, but he does have  another angle on this whole "when-to-buy" question.  </P> <P> Stock prices have generally fallen 28% to 30% during post-World War II  recessions. In the past year, says Seagle, more than half of all stocks listed  on the New York Stock Exchange are down at least that amount.  </P> <P> "The market, for all intents and purposes, has hit bottom," claims Seagle. So,  this bull says, buy stocks now.  </P> <P> The bulls, of course, are playing in dangerous territory. Only four months ago,  blue chip stocks were at record levels. Is it possible that the stock market  could be at its bottom after so short a time? Or is it possible that, like last  spring's fake rally, this recent upturn could be a trap that will cost  investors dearly?  </P> <P> "All of a sudden we have a lot of bulls coming out of the woodwork," says Peter  Eliades, who writes the newsletter Stock Market Cycles.  </P> <P> "If someone thinks the recession is going to end in the first quarter of next  year, you'd want to be buying here," says Eliades.  </P> <P> But Eliades does not concur with that assessment, although he does agree with  the rule of thumb. "You should buy (stocks) three to six months before the end  of a recession. I just disagree when it will end," says Eliades, who thinks  this recession is going to be deeper and more severe than any postwar  recession. So no sense buying stocks just yet.  </P> <P> Adds Boston Co.'s Sinai: "Myself, I think the safer time to invest in stocks is  when 1992 is in sight."  </P> <P> As far as I'm concerned, I agree with a trader friend named Bill, who says:  "What's the hurry? Stocks are too dangerous right now. People aren't buying  stocks rationally."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Meaning of NCR Talks Is Unclear  </P> <P> Wall Street has paid Charles Exley the ultimate compliment. No matter what type  of deal Exley's company, NCR Corp., happens to be negotiating with AT&amp;T  Corp., traders say they are certain that it will be beneficial to NCR  shareholders.  </P> <P> That confidence, however, may be based on a faulty interpretation of some past  Exley statements. If that is so, Wall Street could be in for another big  disappointment.  </P> <P> NCR's stock began rising a few weeks ago when the Wall Street Journal reported  that NCR and AT&amp;T were in some sort of negotiations. The paper said the  talks might involve AT&amp;T buying NCR.  </P> <P> But the Journal also mentioned the possibility that the two companies might  only be discussing a merger of their computer businesses, or some other  less-desirable transaction.  </P> <P> As would have been expected, NCR's stock rose on the idea that the company  would be acquired. But, ordinarily, NCR's shares might have retreated as  investors mulled the possibility of one of these lesser transactions occuring.  But NCR's stock has generally remained strong. Why?  </P> <P> Traders said it is because of the reputation of Exley as a proponent of what he  calls "stakeholder rights." The feeling on Wall Street is that whatever the  60-year chairman decides, it will benefit NCR shareholders.  </P> <P> Stephen K. Smith, the computer analyst at Paine Webber Inc., says Exley  "wouldn't be doing it unless it was good for stakeholders."  </P> <P> But Exley has said on numerous occasions that NCR has several stakeholders --  the company's customers, suppliers and employees, as well as its shareholders.  </P> <P> What if the best interest of NCR's customers, suppliers and employees doesn't  jibe with the interests of its stockholders? In other words, is Wall Street  being too cocky by placing so much faith in Exley?  </P> <P> On the whole, Wall Street doesn't really think AT&amp;T wants to buy NCR. But  nobody would be surprised if AT&amp;T somehow put its troubled computer  business into the hands of NCR in some sort of joint venture.  </P> <P> And while that prospect would ordinarily worry Wall Street, Exley's presence  seems to have calmed everyone's nerves.  </P> <P> "He does have an excellent reputation," adds Wendy Abramowitz, who follows NCR  for Argus Research. "He's a good financial man. He's very different from the  other computer executives. Some of the others say, 'I don't care what Wall  Street thinks.' "  </P> <P> If Wall Street is reading Exley's mind correctly, it can make a lot of money.  But if it isn't -- watch out. Exley wasn't available for comment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Utility Shares May Yet Prove Electric  </P> <P> Want a hot investment idea? Buy shares of electric utilities.  </P> <P> Sorry, this isn't the takeover-crazy 1980s. The investment motto that'll get  you furthest these days is: Stay conservative.  </P> <P> You can't get much more conservative than investing in electric utilities. They  don't usually get taken over. But they also don't make a product that goes out  of fashion. They aren't, in short, prone to highs and lows like other  companies.  </P> <P> But experts say electric utilities can be pretty sexy when you look at them in  a certain way. Falling interest rates could boost utility stocks. In fact,  Prudential-Bache Securities figures that every 50 basis point drop in interest  rates (that's one half of 1%) would push the average utility stock up 7%.  </P> <P> The experts also say that utility stocks are still cheap. And several electric  utilities may actually be raising their dividend in the coming months.  </P> <P> Barry Abramson of Prudential, in fact, says the electric utility industry is in  its best shape in the past 25 years.  </P> <P> Arnold Belosic, of Bear Stearns &amp; Co., says: "We've been recommending  utilities because of their defensive characteristics. They tend to do well in  this type of market environment."  </P> <P> Despite uncertainty over the state of the economy, Belosic expects electric  utility dividends to rise 2% to 3% annually for the next few years.  </P> <P> Specifically, Belosic is recommending New England Electric Systems, Scana Corp.  (formerly South Carolina Electric and Gas), Florida Progress Corp., Dominion  Resources, Cilcorp (formerly Central Illinois Light), and Kentucky Utilities.  </P> <P> The only thing that could go wrong, the analysts say, is a sudden pickup in the  economy and a sustained stock market rally. Even though electric utilities will  actually be helped by a healthier economy, investors will start ignoring these  conservative havens again. And their stocks might go down.  </P></p>

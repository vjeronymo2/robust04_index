			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Macao To Keep 'Great Autonomy' After Hand-over GENERAL Vasco Rocha Vieira, Macao's Portuguese governor, said after talks with Chinese premier Li Peng yesterday the enclave would maintain 'great autonomy' after it reverts to Chinese rule in 1999, agencies report from Lisbon. 'Macao will have its own laws, its market economy, with all the rights that are guaranteed today,' Gen Rocha Vieira told Portuguese journalists. In a 1987 accord Portugal agreed to hand over the tiny territory on the south China coast after almost 500 years of rule from Lisbon. Under the agreement Beijing agreed to maintain the capitalist economy and give a 'high degree of autonomy' to Macao for 50 years after the transfer. 'The sovereignty of China will only show in defence and foreign affairs,' Gen Rocha Vieira said. Known as the Las Vegas of the east, the 16 sq km Macao has grown rich as a gambling and tourism haven, mainly for visitors from nearby Hong Kong, which Britain has agreed to return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Li was on the final day of a three-day visit to Portugal, after visiting Italy, Switzerland and the United Nations. He was due to fly to Spain last night. Sidestepping the sensitive issue of human rights, Li said on Monday night that ideological differences should not prevent western Europe normalising relations with China. Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister of Portugal, which is the current president of the European Community, told Li that China would have to guarantee respect for human rights before relations with the EC could improve, Li is one of the leaders widely held responsible for the killing of hundreds of pro-democracy protestors in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in June 1989.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Li Zhenghong (0632 2973 1347) entitled: "The </F> Goal: An International Capital Market"    [Text]Though securities markets are volatile, and fast  changing, as the years elapse in the end they leave a mark. In  1993, when the Shanghai securities market developed at its  fastest pace, the number of stock listing leaped by 2.2 times,  and the total shares on the market surged some 4.5 times, and  when it came to companies listed on the market, they went from  only two earlier in the year and expanded to 36, and there was  2.8 fold increase in the number of member securities traders,  while in particular, the market's annual transaction total  reached a volume of 500 billion yuan, making up half of the  total volume of Shanghai market transactions.    Shanghai's planned development target for this century is to  again ascend to the position of being one of the country's, and  even the Far Eastern region's, economic, financial, and trade  centers. Shanghai's securities transaction market has in a  period of just over three years, been the first to take the lead  in tracing out a market domain that extends to the entire  country. The Shanghai Stock Market has already broken through  regional barriers, and extended over national borders,  converging into the systemic circulation of the international  capital market.    More than three years ago, on December 19, 1990, in the  Shanghai city government's tall gray building, the Shanghai  Stock Exchange opened for business. This was the new China's  first Stock Exchange, and from this emerged China's first new  and developing capital market.    What history must tell later generations includes: on that  day, within the 477 square meter exchange hall, 46 dual broker  seats, the hall's main wall contained a 4.7 meter long, 2.7  meter high electronic screen, which immediately displayed the  transaction situation of 8 stocks and 22 bonds, while the  transaction center computer network linked up more than 100  terminals. The first batch of member stock brokers amounted to  only 25 people, while the first market volume of business  totalled 10.3 million yuan.    Today, looking at the Shanghai Stock Exchange, at this  location there are 6 transaction halls in use, with 2600 seats,  and the number of stocks on the market has increased to 119,  while there are now 481 members.    In the space of three years, the Shanghai stock market  overall volume of business has exploded from 280 million yuan to  reach 20.1 billion yuan, and the market price total value has  also gone from 1.3 billion yuan to 250 billion yuan. At the same  time, the number of securities investors has expanded from 30  thousand to over 4.6 million people.    The volume of trade on the Shanghai Stock Market, from the  early day totals of 20 million yuan has grown to the present  greatest volume of business close to 4 billion yuan. According  to an analysis by experts, this is comparable to the 1992 level  of the 100-year old "world class" Hong Kong Stock Exchange. This  means that the "three year old child" Shanghai Stock Exchange is  comparable to the "one hundred year-old man " Hong Kong Stock  Exchange, and it's "appetite" is only different by a year's  level.    At present, more than 90 percent of the members of the  Shanghai Stock Exchange are securities traders from various  locales throughout the country; more than 70 percent of the  investors are from provinces and cities outside Shanghai, spread  over cities and towns and even reaching the border regions; in  the Shanghai securities market, there are already more than 1100  securities business sites. The Shanghai Stock Exchange at  present has already established links with the Fuzhou Securities  Trading Center and succeeded in operating for 3 months, and also  plans to complete major links with 10 securities trading centers  including those in Guangzhou, Haikou, Chengdu, and Shenyang.    What this series of numbers represents is the fact that  there  is no doubt that Shangai has already started down the road to  becoming the radiation center for China's securities market. In  addition, its rapid development has also gotten the attention of  securities circles in New York, London, and Tokyo, and they are  saying "this is a fastest new and development capital market in  history." There are some foreigners in the business who predict  that between 2010 and 2020, the Shanghai Stock Market will  become one of the largest stock markets in the world.    Since the emergence of Holland's Amsterdam Stock Market in  1613, in stock trading activity there have been 380 years of  development in world economic history, and in the three year  period since the opening of the Shanghai Stock Exchange, through  the use of modern high technology methods, the operational  methods and market efficiency of the Shanghai securities market  stand in the front ranks of current world stock markets. At the  moment, the Shanghai Stock Exchange possesses an electronic  computer system that handles 1800 transactions per second, and  securities transactions are comprehensively implemented by  computer automatic competitive price transactions, while a  special purpose space satellite and earth laser fiber optic data  transmission stereo communications network has been established;  there has been a comprehensive implementation of a no-paper  system for securities transactions, and an automatic ownership  transfer system has been implemented, along with same day  accounts settling, and a central registration accounts closing  system comparable to international standards has been formed.    Taking the emergence two years ago of new China's first RMB  special stocks on the Shanghai securities market as an  indication, the Chinese mainland's securities markets in reality  are already moving towards international capital markets, and  last year the Shanghai Stock Exchange's B shares listings went  from 9 to 22, while the market overall volume increased from 800  million yuan to more than 1.8 billion yuan; in addition, at  present 50 overseas securities trading house representatives  have seats on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, and this means for  foreign circles that the door to China's securities market is  wide open. Last year, the mainland directly entered overseas  capital markets with six large enterprises including Qingdao  Beer, Shanghai Petrochemical, Guangdong Boat International,  Magang Shares, and Kunming Machine Tools, and at the same time  on the Hong Kong market H shares, their A shares also started to  trade on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Media circles will view  this as the erection of bridges between the Chinese mainland and  overseas capital markets.    As China's first capital market launched during reforn and  opening, the Shanghai securities market is already having an  ever greater deepening effect on China's economic activity. Last  year the Shanghai Stock Exchange ignited the "Baoyan  Disturbance," following on the heels of this was the "Wanshen  Incident," which was a precedent for new Chinese enterprises to  use market methods for transferring property rights. It  indicated that China's securities market, in the same way as the  international securities market, is striding towards the  function of becoming a multifaceted capital market. Stock  markets not only serve as vehicles for enterprises to raise  funds, but also provides a concrete method for thousands and  thousands of investors to directly participate in financial  investment, and participate in share enterprise management; they  also serve as a mechanism for enteprises to transform  management, and better allocate property rights and resources.    Shanghai Stock Exchange General Manager Wei Wenyuan [1414  2429 3220], describes prospects for the development of the stock  market in Shanghai over the next two or three years as follows:  acceleration of the process of market internationalization, and  the attraction of international capital; the promotion of the  opening of the government bond market to the outside; the  struggle to have large, well-known foreign corporations list  stock on the Shanghai market. When it comes to development of  the bond market, taking government bonds as primary, we need to  create new types of trading products, and not only have a  futures buy back business, but also there is a need for having  option dealing, to supply services for reform of the financial  system, and coordinate central bank regulation of the currency  supply.    In Shanghai's most glamorous Pudong New Zone, the "Shanghai  Securities Tower" has invested US$120 million and is each day  "adding brick, adding tile." In 1995, this 3000 trading seat  integrated securities services tower will use the world's most  advanced information handling and transmission system in dealing  with the market.</p>

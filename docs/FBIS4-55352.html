			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] On 18 April, despite President Walesa's  decision to veto a new electoral law for local governments,  Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak announced that new local  elections would be held on 19 June. As a result of Walesa's  veto, these elections will be conducted according to the  existing electoral law, dated June 1990 and updated with special  provisions for the city of Warsaw passed earlier this year.  (Polonia TV Network, 18 Apr 94)    The most important difference between the current electoral  system and the vetoed alternative is the threshold at which  proportional representation applies. According to the current  law, election by simple majority applies in gminas  (municipalities, the smallest administrative units) of up to  40,000 residents and proportional representation in those over  40,000. The proposal approved by the Sejm but rejected by Walesa  would have lowered the cutoff to gminas with 15,000 inhabitants.  The president criticized the new law as "an attempt by the  governing coalition to politicize the elections by putting its  own people into the local governments." Walesa also expressed  dissatisfaction with a provision that "forbids conducting  campaigns in churches," arguing that "separation of church and  state is a political fact that the church fully respects. There  is no need to emphasize this any further." The presidential  statement met with strong support from the secretary of  Episcopate Bishop Tadeusz Pieronek, who "was very pleased with  the presidential veto." (GAZETA WYBORCZA 13 Apr 94)    Depending on the gmina's population, between 15 and 100  council members will be elected in single- or multiple-seat  districts in the following manner: 15 council members in gminas  with fewer than 4,000 inhabitants; 18 in gminas with 4,000-7,000  inhabitants; 20 in gminas with 7,000-10,000 inhabitants; 24 in  gminas with 10,000-20,000 inhabitants; 28 in gminas with  20,000-40,000 inhabitants; 30 in gminas with 40,000-60,000  inhabitants; 36 in gminas with 60,000-80,000 inhabitants; 40 in  gminas with 80,000-100,000 inhabitants; and up to 100 members to  those gminas (exclusively in Warsaw, which is divided into  several gminas) with more than 1 million inhabitants.  ("Panorama" newscast, Second TV Network 18 Apr 94)    The deadline for submitting the names of candidates for the  local councils is 20 May. Candidates in single-seat voting  districts are required to provide petitions with at least 15  signatures supporting their nomination; petitions with 150  signatures are needed for candidate lists in multiseat  districts." Residents of Warsaw will vote according to the new  "law on the administration system of the capital city of  Warsaw," which divides the city into several gminas.

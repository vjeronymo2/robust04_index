			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Directors' dealings The largest transaction of the week was at Gerrard and National Holdings, a financial house that announced interim results on October 27 showing a good increase on the same period last year, writes Vivien MacDonald of The Inside Track. Chairman Robert Williamson was also upbeat in his message to shareholders. For personal reasons, however, executive director Mark Davies has sold 359,000 shares at 470p. Hewden Stuart, a Glasgow-based plant hire company, announced improved interims last month. The sale by Ronald Stuart, deputy chairman, leaves him with more than 750,000 shares.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                    Value       No of Company                   Sector      Shares    Pounds '000  directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES Gerrard &amp; National        OthF       359,000       1,687        1 Hewden-Stuart             BCon        20,100          30        1 Land Securities           Prop         3,000          18        1 Monument Oil              OilE        50,000          35        1 RMC                       BM&amp;M         2,000          20        1 Smith (WH)                RetG         3,500          16        1 Stylo                     RetG        20,000          33        1??

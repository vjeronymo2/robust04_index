			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: DEL MAR, SARATOGA RACE TO NECK-TO-NECK FINISH  </P> <P> As a sporting controversy, it may not reach the volume of debate engendered by  comparisons of Mantle and Mays, or Payton and Brown, or Magic and Larry Bird.  </P> <P> But the question of which track offers the better brand of summer racing -- Del  Mar or Saratoga -- has been known to occupy many a liquid hour among the  horse-race set.  </P> <P> Now Andrew Beyer, track writer for the Washington Post, has ventured a  point-by-point comparison. His verdict: Saratoga, if your only concern is  animals running counterclockwise around an oval; Del Mar, if your desires are  somewhat broader.  </P> <P> The track at Saratoga Springs in Upstate New York gets the nod for quality of  competition and race-track facilities, but Del Mar wins for climate and  off-track entertainment. Overall ambiance is a photo finish.  </P> <P> Beyer says he enjoys Del Mar's "relaxed, unfrantic atmosphere that contrasts  with Saratoga's intensity." But he has two gripes with the turf near the surf.  </P> <P> One is the paucity of nearby drinking establishments. He finds Bully's in Del  Mar "a dark and dreary place." Beyer's second beef is the condition of the Del  Mar facility, which he rates as "inexcusable."  </P> <P> "A track that handles $7 million a day in betting should be able to afford a  cosmetic coat of paint," he wrote, "an adequate number of television monitors  in the grandstand and a few other amenities."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Spring Valley Dream  </P> <P> Political notes:  </P> <P> * A group in Spring Valley is planning an incorporation drive. Its cry: Better  recreation programs and tighter zoning than under county government rule.  </P> <P> * The Rev. Billy Falling, the fundamentalist minister who tried to block "Death  of a Salesman" from being read aloud in classrooms, may run for the high school  board of education in Escondido.  </P> <P> * The local chapter of the National Women's Political Caucus has backed Bob  Trettin against Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer.  </P> <P> The caucus, which rarely backs a man against a woman candidate, endorsed  Wolfsheimer four years ago but this year preferred Trettin's ideas on child  care and the homeless.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Handoffs to Handouts  </P> <P> When he went to court in San Diego, Marlin Oliver Briscoe was a common  defendant with an uncommon history.  </P> <P> He pleaded guilty last month to possession of crack cocaine and was sentenced  to 120 days in Camp West Fork, the county's honor farm outside Ramona, where he  will undergo drug rehabilitation. It's standard treatment for first offenders  who admit guilt.  </P> <P> Briscoe, 43, was disoriented and slurred in speech when arrested near midnight  in a seedy part of downtown last May. He was unemployed and living in a cheap  hotel.  </P> <P> It's been a long time since his glory days as a star quarterback for Omaha  University and then nine seasons with five teams in the National Football  League.  </P> <P> When he was drafted by the Denver Broncos, he received considerable media  coverage as the only black quarterback in the NFL. Later he shifted to wide  receiver, including part of a season with the Chargers.  </P> <P> After leaving the NFL in 1977, he was an assistant football coach at the  University of Colorado, a car salesman, a math teacher and construction worker.  He told a probation officer that he began using crack after his divorce in  1982.  </P> <P> Just how far Briscoe had tumbled became apparent when Times staff members began  comparing notes in the wake of Briscoe's sentencing: No less than nine had been  hit up for money by Briscoe in the last year.  </P> <P> The pitch, delivered in or around the downtown Imperial Bank Building where The  Times has its office, was often the same: I'm Marlin Briscoe, down on my luck,  I need money for gas or a car part, I've got to get my daughter back to my  ex-wife in L.A.  </P> <P> All but one of the nine came across with money. The highest offering was $20.  </P> <P> Briscoe also asked reporters from other newspapers for money, including one for  a San Diego paper who was assigned to cover Briscoe the day he appeared in  court.  </P></p>

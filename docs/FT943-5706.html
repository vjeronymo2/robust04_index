			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Tiny escapes again One cannot fail to admire Mr Tiny Rowland's ability to prevail in boardroom battles. Nevertheless, his defeat of the campaign to oust him as one of Lonrho's chief executives leaves outside shareholders in an uncomfortable position. The company now faces the possibility of a long power struggle between two rival chief executives. Mr Dieter Bock, the other chief executive, may hope that Mr Rowland will retire after a decent interval. But there can be no guarantee that, having won yesterday's skirmish, he will now vacate the battlefield. Mr Bock stands accused of poor judgment by mounting his attack against Mr Rowland at this time. He clearly over-estimated his chances of winning. It would have been better to wait two months until the balance of the board had shifted further in his favour. It is hard to see how the two men can now work together. The main damage to shareholders is that Lonrho's corporate strategy will remain unresolved. There is significant potential to enhance shareholder value by streamlining Lonrho's ragbag of businesses. Minority stakes in some of the African operations could be floated to reveal the full value on the group's assets. Alternatively, businesses could be completely demerged or sold to trade buyers. Some analysts believe the group's break-up value is 180p-200p a share, compared with last night's close of 143p. Mr Bock, a trader of assets at heart, seems keen to embark on some such programme. But so long as Mr Rowland still wields power at Lonrho, radical restructuring looks unlikely.</p>

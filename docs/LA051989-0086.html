			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN CENTER CELEBRATES ANNIVERSARY  </P> <P> "Heisei Gannen" -- celebrating a new beginning -- was the theme when the  Japanese American Cultural &amp; Community Center held its ninth anniversary  and Pacific Pioneer Awards dinner Wednesday night at the Century Plaza.  </P> <P> The group, a consortium of businesses dedicated to community service, was also  celebrating the fact that its new $14-million facility in Little Tokyo in  downtown Los Angeles has finally been paid for and was now, in the words of  JACCC president Toshikazu Terasawa, "the foremost ethnic art and cultural  center in Los Angeles." Cards set at each place bore a drawing of the building  under the caption, "By George We Did It!"  </P> <P> Mistress of Ceremonies Kathryn Doi Todd, representing the JACCC board of  directors, welcomed guests and introduced a dais of dignitaries, including  Japanese Consul General Hiromoto Seki, and the recipients of the group's  President's Awards, Madame Sohwa Hitomi and Madame Sosei Matsumoto.  </P> <P> After a calligraphy demonstration by Hiroko Ikuta, who used a large black brush  on a 10-foot-high white screen, Terasawa presented the awards to Hitomi and  Matsumoto. The women are two of Southern California's most widely respected  practitioners and teachers of the ancient Japanese tea ceremony.  </P> <P> </P> <P> From Japan to Wyoming  </P> <P> Hitomi, 94, moved from Japan to Wyoming in 1917. In 1935, she moved to an  apartment building in the garment district of Los Angeles, where she still  resides and manages the building. At the age of 60, she returned to Japan to  study Tea under a master. In 1974, she was awarded the Fifth Degree Order of  the Sacred Treasure from the Japanese government, and one year later was  rewarded with the highest-ranking certificate available to Tea practitioners by  a Japanese Tea grand master.  </P> <P> Matsumoto teaches Tea extensively all over Southern California, and assisted at  the serving of tea at the signing of the U.S.-Japan peace treaty at the end of  World War II. With her help, Tea has been a regular part of the curriculum at  UCLA since 1981.  </P> <P> Both women bowed, but did not speak, as the audience gave them a round of  polite and sustained applause.  </P> <P> Also honored with the JACCC's Pacific Pioneer Awards were Fujiko Ushiba, wife  of the late Japanese ambassador to the U.S. Nobuhiko Ushiba, who accepted the  award for herself and her husband, and AT&amp;T, which sent AT&amp;T Foundation  President Reynold Levy to accept.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bradley Keynote Speaker  </P> <P> Guests dined on American hotel-style fare (filet mignon, asparagus, sponge  cake) before congratulatory remarks by Consul General Seki and a keynote speech  by Mayor Tom Bradley, who arrived 45 minutes into the meal.  </P> <P> After dinner, soprano Hiroko Kitano performed selections from "Madama  Butterfly" and "Lohengrin," followed by a musical medley by Lisa Joe and Scott  Nagatani.  </P></p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: First Nat'l of Boston sells Turkish stake FIRST National Bank of Boston has sold its 25 per cent stake in Turk Boston Bank to Oyak, the Turkish armed forces pension fund. The deal, the value of which was not disclosed, is believed to have raised around Dollars 7m, and ends the US bank's presence in the Turkish market. This the second recent decision by a US bank to wind down its Turkish operation, a measure of the growing maturity of the domestic banks with which foreigners have to compete. American Express Bank sold its stake in Koc American Bank to the local Koc industrial group earlier this year. The bank has since been renamed Koc Bank. Bank of Boston's move also underlines the growing corporate power of Oyak, nominally entrusted to handle assets on behalf of the army. Oyak has a joint venture with Renault in the country's second largest car assembler, a collaboration with Elf Aquitaine, the French oil company, controls around 10 per cent of the domestic market, and has a brokerage house and an insurance company, and now a bank. The Turk Bank of Boston sale still has to be approved by the treasury. Turk Bank of Boston announced it is to increase its capital to TL200bn (Dollars 16m). Bank of Boston has also announced a Dollars 50m credit line for its former subsidiary. The bank has two branches and made profits in 1992 of TL32bn on assets of TL372bn.</p>

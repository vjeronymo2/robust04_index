			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 23 (YONHAP) -- Kim Chong-pil, chairman of  the ruling Democratic Liberal Party, warned Monday of social  unrest next month, citing such issues as labor-management  disputes, the outlawed teachers' union and the parliamentary  probe into the Sangmudae scandal.    Speaking at a senior party members' meeting, Kim said,  "social unrest is expected in June whether we want it or not....  labor unions and campuses are restless and the matter of the  national teachers' union, which vows to rearm itself once it is  organized, also is uneasy."    Moreover, the North Korean nuclear problem poses many  unanswered questions, although a breakthrough seems to have been  reached, Kim said.    The ruling party chairman demanded that the parliamentary  investigation into the Sangmudae scandal be concluded in a firm  and rational way with the party floor leader playing a central  role, expressing concern that the probe will create an uproar.    Kim's remarks were considered a call for the party to  address  domestic political issues next month when President Kim  Young-sam pays a state visit to Russia.    The comments, however, also reflected ruling party  lawmakers'  view of the current political uneasiness arising from radical  campus activities and labor unions striving to form a new  national alliance, experts say.</p>

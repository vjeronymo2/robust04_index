			<p>BFN     [Text] In a Wednesday interview for Interfax a high-ranking  official in the Yeltsin administration assumed that the final  text of the agreement on accord in Russia will be ready in about  10 days. He said the working draft of the agreement submitted to  Boris Yeltsin has been basically approved by the president.    Interfax has not received confirmation of the information  from official sources. At the office of the presidential  advisor Satarov our reporter was told they do not know "the full  reaction" of Yeltsin to the working document.    The official who was involved in drafting the agreement  confirmed that one of the main provisions renounces the  introduction of destabilizing constitutional amendments, in  particular concerning the procedure and time of presidential  elections. In keeping with the draft, the organizers of rallies  and demonstrations shall assume the responsibility for the  peaceful nature of the actions. The draft also calls for  refraining from making evaluations of the 1991 attempted coup  and developments in October 1993 in a manner which hightens  public confrontation.    The official found unrealistic the idea expressed by certain  creators of the draft to pass a special law to better control  the observation of the agreement by its sides (the president,  government, parliament, trade unions, political parties and  public movements).    Still he admitted that the mechanisms provided for by the  draft rely primarily on the moral capacity of those who are  going to sign it. Under the draft a permanent conciliatory  committee will be formed. If the agreement is violated it will  call for the resignation or dissolution of the person or group  in question through the media.    In the opinion of the administration member, the document  should be widely discussed after the president approves its  text. He spoke of the possibility of a debate at a regular  session of Public Chamber under the president due on April 9.  He said it would be useful to involve some organizations which  have gained a reputation for being extremist in the work on the  agreement.</p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Markets: Sceptics feel a bit more optimistic - Wall Street THE DRAMA running on Wall Street this week could be entitled Waiting for Clinton. And, like Samuel Becket's play Waiting for Godot, it has been a case of many words and little stock market action. The Dow Jones industrial average has moved little over the past five trading days as the market has awaited further clarification of president-elect Clinton's economic policies. The stock market has now been treading water for three weeks, ever since it factored a Clinton election victory into its calculations, with the Dow fixed in a narrow trading range between 3200 and 3300. The next movement out of the range could be down, in part because the market has a historical tendency to drop around the end of November as private investors sell stock for capital gains tax purposes. An initially sceptical Wall Street now seems to be warming to a Clinton presidency. Some analysts are beginning to predict a rise in the indices around the year-end or in January, which is traditionally a period of strong stock market rallies. Byron Wien, chief market strategist at Morgan Stanley, predicts that Clinton will be inaugurated in January under a new high for the market. Several factors are encouraging optimism. The most important are economic signals emanating from Little Rock, Arkansas, where Clinton is fixing his Cabinet and drawing up the legislative programme. Clinton has repeatedly said measures to boost the economy, such as investment tax credits, are at the top of his policy agenda. However, whatever he puts before Congress will hardly be an economic panacea and will take many months to have any impact. Yet the very fact that some stimulus is in the offing could spur stock market optimism. Economic and financial statistics over the next couple of months may also give the market marginally more cause for hope. True, the US economy is still growing extremely weakly, and remains weighed down by excessive debt and a glut of unwanted commercial property. True, too, that there are signs of a slowdown in continental Europe, which will weaken America's export performance. Yet many economists expect the pace of US recovery to pick up gradually next year and more robustly in 1994, which is where the stock market's gaze will be fixed. Furthermore, the wave of corporate restructurings across the US over the past two years should feed through into some handsome profits increases once demand revives. Fourth quarter corporate results, due in mid-January, are not expected to show a sharp improvement, but they could give a foretaste of profits to come and help underpin a relatively high-priced market. The greatest threat to this stock market picture comes from the bond market, where the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue moved up from a low of 7.23 per cent in early September to nearly 7.8 per cent in early November on fears that a Clinton fiscal stimulus would reignite inflation and sharply boost the federal government's borrowing needs. A sustained rise in long-term rates would eventually hurt the stock market, both because it means higher borrowing costs for companies and encourages investors to move funds from equities to fixed income securities. However, over the past few days the bond market has (at least temporarily) put aside its fears of Clinton and the yield on the long bond has dropped from 7.73 per cent to less than 7.60, reacting to statistics showing weak inflationary pressures and to the latest words from Little Rock. Clinton went out of his way at a news conference this week to stress concern at the reaction of financial markets to his policies and to insist he wants a 'disciplined reduction' in the federal budget deficit. Wall Street is far from convinced. The tone of the bond market, and thus of the stock market, should be powerfully influenced by the individual Clinton names as treasury secretary, probably later this month. The man the market would really like, but suspects the Clinton administration could not live with, is Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve and a strict financial disciplinarian. With him at Treasury, both stocks and bonds might really rally.  ----------------------------------------- Monday          3240.87   +    0.81 Tuesday         3225.47   -   15.40 Wednesday       3240.33   +   14.86 Thursday        3239.79   -    0.54 Friday          3233.03   -    6.76  -----------------------------------------</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Presonal Finance (28): A bond to provide an income from property - What's new? / In spite of good capital growth prospects, investors may have to delay cashing in if the fund's assets are not readily saleable WITH COMMERCIAL property currently yielding more than equities or gilts, property investment appears to be edging back on to the agenda for financial managers designing new products for personal investors, writes Barbara Ellis. In launching a property income bond recently, Hill Samuel brought together its investment portfolio bond and the property fund run by the group since 1969. The minimum investment is Pounds 10,000, and the charges are an initial 5.5 per cent and an annual 0.75 per cent. Starting with a yield of 5.9 per cent, net of basic rate income tax which cannot be reclaimed, the property income bond will pay out at the intervals investors choose: monthly, quarterly, four-monthly, six-monthly or annually. The Pounds 49.9m Hill Samuel property fund, ranked 11th out of 59 insurance company property funds tracked by Micropal over the 10 years to October 1, turning Pounds 100 into Pounds 224.28, against the sector average of Pounds 186.87. Over five years to the same date, the fund ranked 35th out of 90, with a 14.85 per cent gain, against a sector average of 11.31 per cent. In the past year, the property fund has ranked 68th out of 98, gaining just 0.73 per cent, on an offer-to-offer basis, compared with the 11.07 per cent average gain for the sector. Hill Samuel emphasises what it sees as excellent prospects for income and medium to long-term capital growth for the bond, but warns that neither the income nor the value of the bond is guaranteed and may fall as well as rise. The group also cautions investors that they may not be able to cash in the bond when they want to: because property held by the fund may not be readily saleable, Hill Samuel is reserving the right to impose a six-month delay on switches or encashments of units in the fund at any time without notice. SAVE &amp; PROSPER's Monthly Income Portfolio Pep has its main selling point in its title. As the estimated 4.5 per cent gross income comes through a personal equity plan, it is tax free. The minimum investment is Pounds 3,000, and the maximum through a Pep is Pounds 6,000. Ninety-five per cent of each investor's money buys units in four of Save &amp; Prosper's unit trusts, with the 5 per cent balance held on an interest-earning account, which will also take in dividends from the unit trusts. Investors are to receive level monthly payments, reviewable each year, from the account, but S&amp;P emphasises that capital will not be run down to keep up payments. The charges are those on the four unit trusts, ie an initial 5.5 per cent and an annual 1.25 per cent, with no extra charges for the Pep or the cash account. The Pep will hold fixed percentages of its investments in the four unit trusts selected: 30 per cent in Scotyields, 25 per cent in S&amp;P Income Units, 20 per cent in S&amp;P High Return and 20 per cent in the S&amp;P Smaller Companies Income Fund. Scotyields and S&amp;P High Return ranked 74th and 92nd respectively out of 93 unit trusts in the UK Equity Income sector over the five years to October 1, according to Micropal. Scotyields gained 52.97 per cent over that period, while S&amp;P put on 29.74 per cent against the sector average gain of 67.64 per cent. S&amp;P Income ranked 24th out of 26 unit trusts in the UK Balanced sector over five years, showing a gain of 41.03 per cent, compared with the sector average of 66.66 per cent. S&amp;P Smaller Companies Income ranked 25th out of 49 trusts in the UK Smaller Companies sector over the same period, gaIning 35.01 per cent, slightly ahead of the sector average of 34.08 per cent. A UNIT trust launched by Foster &amp; Braithwaite this month caused something of a stir among fund management groups by seeming to circumvent regulations previously imposed by the Securities &amp; Investments Board (SIB). The F&amp;B High Income Portfolio Fund, the unit trust concerned, was structured so that the annual management charge of 1.25 per cent would be deducted from the capital account, boosting the amount of income available to unit-holders. Other unit trusts have long wished to take management fees out of capital instead of income, in the same way as investment trusts, and used to be allowed to do so. But for the past three years, they have been obstructed by a standard of recommended practice from the SIB. F&amp;B chairman John Vintcent explained that it had taken his firm about a year to persuade SIB to approve the new unit trust: 'The statement of practice is not binding as long as the trust deed allows the management fee to be charged to capital and everything is disclosed to investors,' he explained. But even before F&amp;B's trust had come on to the market, SIB appeared to have second thoughts and wrote to the Association of Unit Trusts &amp; Investment Funds saying that it would be recommending a change in the regulations preventing fees being charged to capital. 'They may well take away our opportunity to run the fund in the way we want,' said Mr Vintcent, 'That would leave investors no worse off than they would have been with any other unit trust.' However, he added that his firm's move had a lot of support within the unit trust industry, and forecast determined lobbying to allow it to continue and be copied by others. IN NOVEMBER, Kleinwort Benson is to launch its second investment trust specialising in second-hand endowment policies. The Kleinwort Endowment Policy Trust, launched in July 1992, raised Pounds 30m and has traded at a premium of between 5 per cent and 8 per cent to net asset value since then, indicating good demand. The new trust, with the same managers and advisers as the first, will aim to raise between Pounds 20m and Pounds 25m, and will have a life of 12 1/2 years. Managing director Simon White explained that this life-span would enable the trust to avoid head-on competition with the BZW trust, which is buying policies with shorter-dated maturities. He said KB would be able to buy policies with 15 years to run and shorten them to 10 years on good terms. LLOYDS BANK has launched a treasurers account, aimed at small clubs, charities, societies and trustees. The account provides current facilities, including a cheque-books and statements. All credits and the first 10 debits in each month are free. Debits beyond 10 in a month are charged Pounds 2 each. The account pays interest at tiered rates, starting at 1 per cent gross for balances between Pounds 1 and Pounds 500 and rising to 3.2 per cent on amounts over Pounds 25,000.</p>

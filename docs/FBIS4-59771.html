			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and U.S. </F> Secretary of State Warren Christopher, following their meeting  at the Prime Minister's Office in Jerusalem; broadcast in  progress -- live]    [Excerpts] [Rabin, in English] ...dialogue, even though  indirectly, hopefully that in the future it will be directly.  There are lots of problems. We had a beginning. Still a long  way to go. We appreciate very much the efforts of Secretary  Christopher by traveling between Damascus and Israel, and his  efforts to find ways to bring the parties closer in their  positions and by that to facilitate real breakthrough. [passage  omitted]    [Qol Yisra'el's political correspondent Shlomo Raz] Today we  heard of remarks by PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat regarding jihad  and a commitment he received from Israel regarding Jerusalem.  Would you care to comment, sir?    [Rabin] If he speaks of a letter issued following the Cairo  agreement, then I wrote this letter on 8 May. It was presented  before the Knesset. It makes no mention of Jerusalem. There  was no other letter which I or any other Israeli wrote following  the Cairo agreement which relates to Jerusalem. At the same  time, the Document of Principles, signed on 13 September 1993 in  Washington, states that there are issues that pertain to the  permanent solution. It lists several issues, as examples,  including Jerusalem. There will be issues that can be raised  during the negotiations on the permanent solution.    As for to his remarks regarding jihad, if indeed he called  for jihad, it is a grave violation of his commitment, made in  the letter he had signed, which resulted in the mutual  recognition between the PLO and Israel. If indeed he made that  call, it would cast doubt on the continuation of the process  between the Palestinians and ourselves. We cannot accept a  violation of a commitment regarding the PLO undertaking not to  be involved in violence and terror. [passage omitted]    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew, which joined the relay of the  news conference at 1530 GMT, carries a reply by Rabin to a  question on the answers Christopher brought from Damascus, in  which he says: "It is not my duty to present the details. I  believe that if the secretary decided to return to Damascus and  to attempt to continue the dialogue in Syria, perhaps there is a  glimpse of hope. I believe that exploiting every opportunity is  the right thing to do. I believe the secretary is clear  regarding our stands and the components required on our part in  order to attain peace."]</p>

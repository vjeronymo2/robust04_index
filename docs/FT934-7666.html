			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (16): Astonishing record - China's share of world trade has doubled in a decade WHEN US President Bill Clinton and Chinese premier Jiang Zemin sit down together at this week's Apec summit, trade relations will be among the key items on their agenda. In March, on a visit to Beijing, Mr Douglas Newkirk, the assistant US trade representative, spelled out the trade liberalisation measures which the US said were minimum condition for China to enter the Gatt. These included a single national tariff policy, full transparency of trade regulations, the gradual removal of non-tariff barriers and a commitment to move to a full market economy. But the following month, President Clinton added to these list a string of political conditions upon which China must make 'significant progress' before its Most Favoured Nation trading status could be extended, and thus, implicitly, before China could join the Gatt. The conditions include the end of exports to the US of products made using prison labour, the release of political prisoners and adherence to the Universal Declaration on human rights. The World Bank estimate that failure to renew MFN status could cut Chinese exports to the US by between Dollars 7bn and Dollars 15bn. Chinese government officials can barely conceal their outrage - 'it is already eight years since China applied for resumption of our contracting party status in Gatt and we have made great efforts to bring our trading system in line with others,' says Mr Li Lanqing, vice-premier. 'The major obstacle is now the US. We are against linking political issues such as human rights with trade - these should be settled by political negotiations.' IT is easy to see why the Chinese government in Beijing baulks at this explicit linking of trade concessions to political issues, such as human rights. While limited progress has been made on the latter since reforms began in 1978, open trade and export-led growth have been at the heart of its post-Maoist economic reforms. Up to now, China's trade record has been astonishing. Exports volumes grew at an average rate of 12 per cent a year between 1980 and 1991, making China the world's thirteenth largest exporter in 1991, up from 26th place in 1980. China's share of world trade has doubled in a decade. Merchandise trade as a ratio of gross national product GNP, measured using the official exchange rate, has increased from 12.8 per cent in 1980 to 38 per cent in 1992. China has gradually dismantled its restrictive trade regulations, allowed a substantial depreciation of the exchange rate and encouraged foreign investors and the growth of the non-state sector to take advantage of cheap Chinese labour. The result are reflected in the changing pattern of exports. The share of labour-intensive manufactures in total exports has risen from 36 per cent in 1975 to 74 per cent in 1990, while the share of capital-intensive manufactures has fallen from 50 per cent to 19 per cent over the same period. By 1990, 20 per cent of exports now come from foreign funded enterprises, while the share of township and village enterprises had risen from less than 5 per cent in 1985 to over 20 per cent. China still has a long way to go in replacing direct administrative intervention with indirect price measures and removing opaque regulations before it will have a liberal trade regime. But the result of decentralised decision-making has been, according to the World Bank, to make China's trade system de facto more open than its 32 per cent average nominal tariff rate and the plethora of import controls, licenses and non-tariff barriers would suggest. Western diplomats in Beijing, while complaining that China is not dismantling its quota system fast enough, say there are are encouraging signs. In the area of intellectual property, while enforcement has lagged substantially behind new copyright legislation and abuse is widespread, the government recently raided an illegal CD manufacturer in Shanghai. Similarly, while China's trade regime is far from transparent, the trade ministry last month started to publish a periodic journal of regulations relating to foreign trade and stated that any state council directives which are not made public are henceforth invalid. One sensitive trade issue in Sino-US relations, with textile quotas up for re-negotiation at the end of this year. is the illegal trans-shipments of textiles through Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Dominican Republic in order to evade China's trade quotas. Officially, Hong Kong alone receives 54 per cent of China's total exports. But, according to the World bank, adjusting for re-exports raises the US share of Chinese exports from 8.7 per cent to 25.6 per cent and the EC share from 9.2 per cent to 19.2 per cent, while the Hong Kong share slips back to a mere 6.2 per cent. Yet, regardless of progress on the trade front, the operative condition for MFN renewal is 'significant progress on human rights.' Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said last month that China still has a long way to go before significant progress has been made, a sentiment that Mr Clinton is likely to echo this week in Seattle.</p>

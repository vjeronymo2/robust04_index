			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Merger issues The battle for Midland looks the biggest test yet for the EC's still relatively untried merger rules. Lloyds' intervention, after all, raises the possibility of two bids for the same target being scrutinised by different regulators, with all the scope for unwitting prejudice which that might involve. When Sir Leon Brittan recently referred the Tarmac/Steetley joint venture back to London - where it was considered alongside Redland's simultaneous bid for Steetley - he emphasised that related cases ought to be dealt with by a single authority. But though that principle may yet prove significant, the issues this time are much more complicated, and the political and financial stakes considerably higher. As of last night, the chances of the Lloyds offer reaching first base appeared to hinge on its efforts, via the UK government, to persuade Brussels that responsibility for investigating the Hong Kong bid should also be returned to the UK. The widespread assumption is that under the special criteria applied to banks, the EC authorities are automatically excluded from Midland/Lloyds. Their right under the same legislation to deal with the Hong Kong bid is far from clear either, notwithstanding confirmation yesterday that a preliminary one month investigation is to go ahead. The investment community should therefore be prepared for a fierce battle for turf in which politics may well play as big a part as strict interpretation of the law. Brussels is every bit as jealous of its sovereignty as the British government, and in any case the EC's merger team has long been thirsting to get its hands on a juicy British bid. Sir Leon will hardly want to end his term as Competition Commissioner with a whimper. The reaction in London in any case might conceivably be to let him get on with it. The UK would not be the first EC member state to allow Brussels to handle the political hot potatoes.</p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Pressac shows sharp decline to Pounds 605,000 Pressac Holdings, the electro-mechanical components manufacturer, saw pre-tax profits decline to Pounds 605,000 in the six months to January 31. The outcome, struck after an exceptional debit of Pounds 169,000 for redundancies and reduced interest charges of Pounds 279,000 (Pounds 480,000), compared with profits of Pounds 1.15m in the corresponding half of the previous year. Turnover dipped some 7 per cent to Pounds 16.4m (Pounds 17.8m), although Mr Roger Boissier, chairman, pointed out that the sales decline was only 2 per cent against last year's second half. Earnings fell from 3.9p to 1.53p but the interim dividend is maintained at 0.75p.</p>

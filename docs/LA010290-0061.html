			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST TROOPS PULLED OUT OF PANAMA;  </P> <P> DEPLOYMENTS: 141 ARTILLERYMEN FROM FT. ORD ARE ON THEIR WAY HOME. BUSH SAYS  THERE ARE NO NEW DEVELOPMENTS ON THE NORIEGA STANDOFF.  </P> <P> The Pentagon has begun withdrawing the U.S. invasion force from Panama, sending  141 soldiers on their way home to Ft. Ord, Calif., the White House announced  Monday.  </P> <P> The withdrawal, the first since President Bush launched an invasion of Panama  in the early morning darkness of Dec. 20, was announced aboard Air Force One as  the President flew from Montgomery, Ala., to Andrews Air Force Base outside  Washington at the end of a New Year's holiday.  </P> <P> "The President is glad to see some of the troops coming home and hopes the rest  can leave as soon as possible," White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater  told reporters.  </P> <P> Bush made no public comments about the withdrawal, but the White House  indicated that more troops are likely to return home within the next few days.  </P> <P> The troops were among the units that overthrew the regime of Panamanian  strongman Manuel A. Noriega.  </P> <P> After eluding capture for 4 1/2 days, Noriega sought refuge on Christmas Eve in  the Vatican's embassy in Panama City. Vatican, Panamanian and U.S. officials  have been involved since then in negotiations in an effort to solve what Bush  has called a "conundrum" over the former Panamanian leader's future.  </P> <P> These talks, initially conducted through diplomatic channels in Washington,  Panama City and the Vatican, intensified beginning Saturday, with  representatives of all three parties reported to be holding sessions in Panama  City in an effort to come to a solution.  </P> <P> The United States wants to bring Noriega to trial in federal court in Florida  on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering contained in indictments  returned by grand juries in Miami and Tampa. Panama's attorney general has  announced that he is preparing murder charges against Noriega in the killing of  10 Panama Defense Forces officers involved in a failed attempt to topple the  strongman last Oct. 3.  </P> <P> Asked on Monday whether there were any developments leading to a resolution of  the Noriega question, Bush replied, "Nope."  </P> <P> He has carefully sought to avoid any comment on the matter in recent days in an  effort to avoid angering the Vatican.  </P> <P> The Vatican traditionally grants sanctuary to persons fleeing religious or  political persecution. But the United States maintains that Noriega is fleeing  criminal indictments and is not entitled to political asylum.  </P> <P> The first unit to be withdrawn is made up of 56 soldiers forming part of an  artillery battery from Ft. Ord. The troops arrived at Kelly Air Force Base in  San Antonio late Monday night and are scheduled to leave for Ft. Ord. early  today, an Army spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Pentagon official said another plane carrying troops ultimately bound for Ft.  Ord was due at Kelly but the timing was not immediately clear.  </P> <P> Asked whether the first pullout was large enough to be considered a withdrawal,  Fitzwater said: "You've got to start with one. We want them all to come out as  soon as possible. Chances are they'll come out piecemeal like this."  </P> <P> Bush, asked Sunday about how soon the troops would start coming home, gave no  hint that a withdrawal was about to begin, saying only, "The sooner the  better."  </P> <P> Speaking with reporters aboard the presidential jet, Fitzwater said on Monday  that "we want them all to come out as soon as possible, except the 12,000 there  permanently."  </P> <P> Quarry Heights, Panama, is headquarters of the U.S. Southern Command, which has  jurisdiction over all American military forces south of the U.S. frontier with  Mexico. About 12,000 service people are permanently stationed at Quarry Heights  and at other U.S.-operated bases extending along the Panama Canal. Their  primary mission is the defense and protection of the canal under the Panama  Canal Treaties of 1977.  </P> <P> As it built up its forces for last month's invasion, the Pentagon dispatched an  additional 12,000 troops and support personnel to Panama, and once the invasion  was under way, up to 2,000 additional troops were sent there. The operational  force encountered difficulties during the first days of the invasion in  combatting civil disorders that followed the defeat of the Panama Defense  Forces, up until then Panama's sole military, police and security force.  Noriega was commander of the now-disbanded PDF.  </P> <P> "My guess is we'll see small groups like this coming out on a continuing basis  from now on," Fitzwater said. "The chances are that they'll come out piecemeal  like this because of varying duty assignments and mop-up details."  </P> <P> Fitzwater's expectation was confirmed in Panama by an official of the Southern  Command who said that an unidentified contingent with 15 vehicles will be  leaving there today and that "additional redeployment" will take place over the  next several days.  </P> <P> Under standard military operating procedure, withdrawal of combat troops begins  within weeks of a successful invasion, after initial objectives have been  achieved. The remaining troops are assigned a mixture of duties, including  taking over the operations of decimated military units in the invaded country.  </P> <P> In recent days, Bush has encountered public demonstrations protesting the  invasion and demanding that the troops be called home.  </P> <P> He ran into such demonstrations over the weekend in Texas. These included  protests that took place during a short trip made by the President between  three military bases in San Antonio -- one of them Kelly Air Force Base --  during a morning he spent visiting with soldiers and Marines injured in the  invasion and brought back to Texas for treatment.  </P> <P> In addition, about three dozen protesters demanding a withdrawal from Panama  greeted him Sunday afternoon in Houston outside the hotel where he maintains a  residence.  </P> <P> In visiting the wounded troops, Bush made a point of telling them: "The country  . . . is behind what you did. (Although) every once in a while, somebody might  take a shot at all of us."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Kenneth Freed, in Panama City, contributed to this story.  </P> <P> NEW CANAL CHIEF -- A Panamanian quietly takes over the top post.

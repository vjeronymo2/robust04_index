			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SETTLEMENT OF COUNTY REMAP SUIT UNLIKELY  </P> <P> Supervisor Pete Schabarum's decision not to seek reelection is unlikely to lead  to an immediate settlement in the multimillion dollar redistricting lawsuit  against Los Angeles County, officials close to the case said Saturday.  </P> <P> But they agreed that Schabarum's move will make it far easier to redraw the  district lines if the county loses in court.  </P> <P> Democratic Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, Schabarum's ideological opposite on the  board, said he will press for a settlement, but others suggested that is  doubtful unless U.S. District Judge David Kenyon orders the parties into  negotiations.  </P> <P> "I would not be overly optimistic at this point on settlement," Supervisor Ed  Edelman said. "I think it is a little late in the game."  </P> <P> Only a few weeks remain in the trial, which began in early January. The suit  was brought by the U.S. Justice Department, the Mexican-American Legal Defense  and Educational Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union. The plaintiffs  charge that the county supervisors intentionally split the Latino community  into three districts in 1981 in order to dilute their voting power. If the  county loses in court, the lines are expected to be redrawn.  </P> <P> Schabarum did not file for reelection by Friday, the deadline for incumbents.  The political ramifications of his decision continued to be felt Saturday as  potential candidates met with supporters and discussed whether to enter the  race. The filing deadline was extended until Wednesday, but by late Saturday no  additional candidates had filed nomination papers for the race.  </P> <P> With the balance of power in the now conservative-dominated board riding on the  election, both Democrats and Republicans were lobbying their favorites to enter  the race. The upcoming election gives Democrats their best shot at holding  three seats on the five-member board since the Republicans, led by Schabarum,  took control in 1980.  </P> <P> Both plaintiffs and defendants on Saturday suggested that the trial will  continue unless Kenyon reopens settlement talks.  </P> <P> The judge could not be reached for comment Saturday. But when the trial began,  Kenyon said he would not entertain any settlement discussions, and plaintiffs'  attorneys said Saturday that they expect him to maintain that position.  </P> <P> "Our position has always been that we would be willing to entertain settlement  discussions," said Richard Fajardo, a MALDEF attorney. "The problem right now  is that I'm not sure the judge is going to entertain discussions."  </P> <P> Among board members, there was disagreement Saturday about what course to take.  </P> <P> While Hahn favored settling the case by redrawing the lines "in order to save  the taxpayers' money," Supervisor Deane Dana said he would not go along with  any such move.  </P> <P> But there was nearly unanimous agreement that if the county loses the case, it  will be easier to redraw the lines, because supervisors will not have to worry  about offending a colleague.  </P> <P> Hahn agreed, pointing out that settlement talks collapsed last December after  Schabarum objected to a redistricting plan that would have placed him in a new,  predominantly Latino district.  </P> <P> "The argument before was (that drawing new lines) would jeopardize Schabarum,"  said ACLU attorney Mark Rosenbaum. "That is no longer an issue."  </P> <P> Dana predicted that if a Latino is elected in the the upcoming contest, the  lawsuit could be a moot point. But the plaintiffs and officials representing  the larger Latino community insisted that the lines must be redrawn.  </P> <P> "The problem isn't who the representative of the First District is," Fajardo  said. "The question is what does the First District look like. The basic  problem of fragmenting the Hispanic community is still there."  </P> <P> Under the current lines, the district, which covers the San Gabriel Valley and  some of the southeastern part of Los Angeles County, is 41% Republican and 50%  Democrat. But in the past, the district has largely voted Republican.  </P> <P> Now, however, without a strong incumbent, Republicans are fearful that they may  lose the seat and thus control of the board.  </P> <P> Dana said Schabarum's closely held, last-minute decision prevented other  Republicans from lining up for the seat. "The normal thing to do, as a courtesy  to the party, is to bow out early," he said. "I am concerned about one thing --  maintaining the conservative majority."  </P> <P> Prominent Latino Democrats were meeting this weekend to try to consolidate  behind one person and thus avoid a fragmented effort. Among those considering a  bid are U.S. Rep. Esteban Torres (D-Pico Rivera) and Los Angeles City Council  members Richard Alatorre and Gloria Molina.  </P> <P> But Molina and Alatorre apparently could not run unless the lines are redrawn,  because they live outside the current district, associates said.  </P> <P> Republicans also were scrambling for support Saturday.  </P> <P> Among the most frequently mentioned was Sarah Flores, a Schabarum deputy who  worked her way up through the county bureaucracy to become assistant chief  deputy.  </P> <P> Current and former elected officials also were weighing in. Dr. Forest Tennant,  a Republican, the former West Covina mayor who runs a string of medical clinics  and has had a controversial tenure as the National Football League's drug  adviser, said he was considering the race.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Greg O'Brien, appointed to the Municipal Court in 1984 and  raised to the Superior Court in 1988, also has been mentioned as a potential  candidate.  </P> <P> Several San Gabriel Valley mayors -- Terry Dipple of San Dimas, Don McMillan of  El Monte and Donna Smith of Pomona -- also were among those being touted for  the supervisor's seat.  </P> <P> It is also possible that Judge Kenyon could grant the Justice Department's  request to delay the June 5 supervisors' election until a new redistricting  plan can be drafted. If districts are realigned, Schabarum could conceivably  run in a new district, ACLU attorney Rosenbaum said.  </P> <P> Schabarum has refused to discuss his plans before a news conference Monday.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Frederick M. Muir and Jenifer Warren contributed to this  story.  </P></p>

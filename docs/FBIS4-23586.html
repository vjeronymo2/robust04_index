			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, June 9 (AFP) -- Security forces Thursday [9  June] detained Beko Ransome-Kuti, the chairman of Nigeria's  Campaign for Democracy, an umbrella grouping of human rights and  pro-democracy groups, a source close to Ransome-Kuti said.    The detention came a day after his organization called for  mass protests next week in an effort to bring down military  ruler General Sani Abacha.    The source said security agents showed up at Ransome-Kuti's  residence in Lagos, took him to police headquarters for  interrogation, brought him back to the house and ransacked it  for about an hour.    After the search, which lasted about an hour, they took him  away and detained him, the source said.    Ransome-Kuti was the 11th prominent opposition activist  detained in a crackdown launched last week.    The struggle between the Nigerian Government and the  opposition has intensified in recent weeks, with the opposition  accusing the regime of dragging its heels over a return to  democracy after annulled elections and a military coup last year.    The elections were held on June 12 last year as part of  then-  military ruler General Ibrahim Babangida's pledge to restore  democratic rule. But he annulled the election, citing fraud,  appointed a non-elected interim government then stepped down.    Abacha overthrew that government in November and dissolved  all democratic institutions.    The Campaign for Democracy groups about 40 human rights and  pro- democracy associations.    In a statement Wednesday, it said that from next week,  "market women and men should lock their shops, drivers and  transport owners should remove their vehicle from the streets.  Workers should stay off their offices.    "Our brothers and sisters in the armed forces and the police  are advised to take side with the civil society."</p>

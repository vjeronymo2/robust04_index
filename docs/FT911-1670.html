			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Lloyd's court case A LETTER written in 1982 by the new manager of the troubled Oakeley Vaughan Underwriting Agency to the Lloyd's of London insurance market Names (members) on its books gave an inadequate account of the agency's situation and was a 'travesty of the truth', it was alleged in the High Court yesterday by Mr Michael Lyndon-Stanford, QC, representing 24 members of syndicates formerly managed by Oakeley Vaughan. A total of 33 Names are claiming compensation from Lloyd's over losses of about Pounds 5m. They allege that Lloyd's failed to protect them from the consequences of mismanagement at Oakeley Vaughan. The hearing continues on Tuesday. Revolt of the Names, Page 16</p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / European ruling on Guinness questions UK fraud procedures The legality under European law of the UK's procedures for the investigation and prosecution of fraud has been called into question by a European Commission of Human Rights ruling that the Guinness trial was unfair. The commission has upheld a complaint by Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chairman jailed for his role in the 1986 takeover of Distillers, that his prosecution was an abuse of the European convention on human rights. The ruling, which is not binding, agreed his trial was unfair because evidence given by Mr Saunders under compulsion to Department of Trade inspectors was used against him in his trial. The case is set to go to the European Court of Human Rights for a final resolution. A win for Mr Saunders there would, most lawyers believe, have wide implications for the fight against financial crime in the UK. The main issue would be the Section 2 powers of the Serious Fraud Office, which compel suspects to answer questions. However, a European court judgment might also affect the government's recently introduced policy for combating crime generally by restricting the right to silence of all suspects. The government is expected to fight hard to maintain the system of allowing the limited suspension of the right to silence. It is expected government lawyers will argue this provides an essential weapon against financial crime where investigations are particularly difficult. The commission's ruling, due to be published later this week, was welcomed by defence lawyers specialising in white-collar crime. Mr Rod Fletcher of Russell Jones &amp; Walker, a London law firm, said: 'It is extraordinary that a minority group - of financiers or businessmen accused of financial fraud - are discriminated against by our legal system. The right to silence is a fundamental safeguard of anyone accused of a crime. The onus is and should be always on the prosecution to prove guilt and there is no basis for violation of such principles.' The three other prominent City figures jailed for their parts in the Guinness affair, Mr Gerald Ronson, Mr Tony Parnes and Mr Jack Lyons, are understood to be considering the implications of Mr Saunders' success for their own positions.

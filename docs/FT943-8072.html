			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Lloyd's agents optimistic on capacity Agents at Lloyd's of London expect the insurance market's capital base to fall in 1995 but forecasts issued yesterday are more optimistic than had been expected in some quarters. The Lloyd's Market Board, which directs the market's business, said members' agents and licensed Lloyd's advisers expected to be able to provide capacity  -the amount of premiums syndicates can underwrite - up to a maximum of Pounds 10.3bn in 1995. Agents handle the affairs of individual Names, whose assets have traditionally supported the market, while the advisers look after corporate investors. This year Lloyd's syndicates have an estimated Pounds 11bn in capacity. Some agents have predicted that the amount of capacity provided by the Names - about Pounds 9.3bn - would fall as much as 30 per cent after another year of heavy losses. Lloyd's reported losses of about Pounds 2bn for the 1991 year of account in May, in line with its three-year accounting system. Several hundred of the 17,624 trading Names are expected to be unable to pay their losses, forcing many to resign. Corporate investors, who raised more than Pounds 800m last year, are expected to raise more this year, partially compensating for the decline in support from individuals. It is still likely, however, that some syndicates could find themselves short of capacity. The market board said agents were seeking about Pounds 11.5bn in capacity. It said the market was 'not experiencing significant overcapacity although premium rates have softened in an increasing number of areas'. Separately, Lloyd's said that legal claims by hundreds of its Names from North America were 'unfounded'. More than 400 Names allege that they are victims of systematic fraud. They will ask a federal judge in San Diego, California, to rescind their Lloyd's contracts and discharge their multi-million dollar liabilities. Previous cases against Lloyd's in the US failed when the courts there agreed with Lloyd's that all grievances should be settled in a British court. In the biggest action to date in the US, the Supreme Court ruled last November that American investors could not sue Lloyd's for securities fraud. A federal judge in New York had dismissed their action without ruling on the merits of the case. More than 100 US Names were involved.</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> POLO MATCHES RETURN TO EQUIDOME;  </P> <P> VETERINARIANS, EXPERTS DEFEND HORSES' TREATMENT AFTER DEATHS OF 2 PONIES  </P> <P> It was a horrifying scene played twice that night at the weekly polo match at  the Los Angeles Equestrian Center in Griffith Park.  </P> <P> Just two minutes into the match between the Los Angeles Stars and a Buenos  Aires team at the indoor Equidome arena, a chestnut mare named Whisper  stumbled, breaking a front leg.  </P> <P> Minutes later, it happened again before the hushed crowd of 2,500. This time a  bay gelding named Rubio snapped a front leg as he spun around. His rider, a  prominent Argentine player, sat on the ground, cradled his head in his hands  and cried as the horse was removed from the arena.  </P> <P> As the game resumed -- with the crowd stunned and the players subdued -- both  horses, two of the Stars' top mounts, were put to death by veterinarians out of  view of the spectators.  </P> <P> The tragedy on March 11 cast an even more ominous cloud than usual over the Los  Angeles Equestrian Center, a facility that at times has faced an uncertain  future because of financial and legal woes. The horses' deaths raised pointed  questions about the operation of the center and its treatment of horses.  </P> <P> But polo officials, veterinarians and equine experts defended the equestrian  center. They said in interviews last week that the center has a commendable  safety record and is regarded as an outstanding training, boarding and  exhibition facility.  </P> <P> Recent complaints about the polo club "have been blown way out of proportion,"  said Dr. Madison Richardson, a Los Angeles neurosurgeon who is safety committee  chairman for a Western polo circuit and a member of the Los Angeles Polo Club.  "The equestrian center is getting a bum rap."  </P> <P> Some critics had charged that polo ponies at the center were mistreated and  that polo at the Equidome might be too fast-paced and brutal, endangering both  horse and rider.  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Department of Animal Regulation officials launched an  investigation. For three days last week, the polo program was in jeopardy as  officials examined the arena's condition and treatment of the horses.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Long-Term Investigation  </P> <P> The center was quickly cleared of the accusations. But the mystery lingers  about what led to the injuries of two horses in one match. A long-range  investigation into those injuries will continue.  </P> <P> The experts described the accidents as flukes or freak occurrences. While it is  not uncommon for horses in this rigorous sport to be injured, they said, it is  uncommon that two horses would be injured in the same way on the same night  within minutes of each other.  </P> <P> Allan Scherer, executive director of the United States Polo Assn., called the  deaths "a very unfortunate accident . . . just a happenstance."  </P> <P> He said the association does not keep statistics on horses' injuries and  deaths. But he added, "It is not a very common thing, nor is it uncommon for  horses to get hurt. It happens."  </P> <P> Since 1983, when the center first started holding polo matches, at least six  horses have died because of injuries suffered in the games, officials said.  </P> <P> On Saturday night, when the first match since the deaths was held, avid fans  who had feared that the sport would be halted instead celebrated its return.  </P> <P> "I feel so happy now because I was so scared it would be shut down," said Mabel  Dippold, 62, who has attended every center match since 1984. "I know there are  pros and cons about the sport, but things are really well taken care of here."  </P> <P> Frank Rich, 42, a construction executive, said he has never seen anything  remotely approaching abuse of the horses and he is glad the games have resumed.  "I'm relieved it's going on, and I hope people don't get the wrong impression  about what's happening here," said Rich, who has been attending matches for two  years. "It's a great sport, and all I see is concern for the animals."  </P> <P> Polo accounts for about 15% of the activities at the equestrian center, which  sits on 70 acres owned by the city of Los Angeles, officials said. The center  houses a polo riding school, stables for boarding polo ponies and facilities  for the Los Angeles Stars' fleet.  </P> <P> Other center activities include horse shows and lessons where members of the  public can learn other forms of riding, such as dressage and jumping.  </P> <P> The center owns the 27 polo horses used in the Saturday night polo matches,  which often are attended by movie stars and other entertainment figures. During  a match, 18 horses are ridden. The players are professionals ranked in the  United States Arena Polo League and are based locally and in other cities.  </P> <P> The horses are thoroughbreds obtained from private owners or dealers. Some were  bought from Wyoming cattle ranches, center officials said.  </P> <P> Vince Azzaro, the center's director of polo, and Tom Goodspeed, captain of the  Los Angeles Stars, test ride the horses to see if they have polo ability before  they are selected. If a particular horse is chosen, it is then inspected by a  veterinarian for soundness.  </P> <P> Dr. J. David Wheat, the center's veterinarian, inspects the polo ponies about  three to four times a week, giving them vaccinations and other types of  preventive health care. Wheat also cares for Los Angeles Police Department  horses.  </P> <P> Wheat said the two ponies who were fatally injured were in top physical  condition and had no history of health problems.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Exceptional Equine Athletes'  </P> <P> "They were two of our best horses, with no past instances of lameness or  anything," he said. "They were both exceptional equine athletes. The accidents  happened in the first few minutes, so it wasn't because of fatigue that these  things happened."  </P> <P> He said that in addition to inspections during the week, match horses are  examined by him before, during and after an exhibition. If a horse has a  problem or any soreness, that horse doesn't play, he said.  </P> <P> "To put a player on a polo pony that has any sort of injury is taking a  significant risk," he said.  </P> <P> Wheat makes the final determination. He said he has argued, sometimes bitterly,  with riders who wanted to mount ponies he did not think were healthy enough to  play.  </P> <P> Dr. Robert Walton, a Modesto dermatologist and chairman of the polo  association's arena committee, said indoor polo is "a young man's game that  involves more body contact" than outdoor polo. But he denies allegations that  horses are constantly subjected to injuries by bumping into arena walls.  </P> <P> "Horses have quick reflexes and turn very rapidly," he said. "It is more likely  that a rider will be thrown into a wall."  </P> <P> Both of the horses injured on March 11 were away from the main action of the  game when the accidents occurred.  </P> <P> Goodspeed, who was riding Whisper, said he was trying to maneuver the horse  toward the main action. "I was moving the horse in a slow circle toward the  ball, and it just took a bad step," said Goodspeed, a top-ranked player.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Holding Lame Leg  </P> <P> Whisper buckled, and Goodspeed fell forward to the ground. When he saw the  horse in front of him holding up its lame leg, he knew what had happened.  </P> <P> "It's happened to me before, and it's a truly awful thing," he said. "These  animals are like our friends. We're emotionally attached to them and don't want  to see them hurt for anything in the world."  </P> <P> Polo players insist that their mounts, which cost from $2,000 to $40,000, are  far too valuable to be abused.  </P> <P> Wheat said both of the injured ponies broke bones in the lower part of their  legs. He said horses sometimes break those bones trying to catch themselves  after taking a bad step.  </P> <P> "We're talking about a 1,200- pound animal here that's on little legs," he  said.  </P> <P> Some critics wonder whether the injured horses might have been saved by the  technology of modern equine medicine. But owners and veterinarians say that  while broken bones can be mended, requiring a horse to stand immobile for  months is not easily accomplished and injuries usually permanently impair the  animal.  </P> <P> Valiant efforts to save the famed racehorse Ruffian after she shattered her  foot in a 1975 match race failed when the mare fought violently to scramble to  her feet after surgery. And the cost of surgery and rehabilitation, which may  exceed the horse's value, is a consideration, owners said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Severe Injuries Uncommon  </P> <P> "Severe debilitating injuries among polo ponies are relatively uncommon," said  Dr. Calvin Kobluk, assistant professor of large animal surgery at the  University of Minnesota and an authority on injuries in performance horses.  </P> <P> "But let's be realistic. They're athletes, and athletes suffer injuries," said  Kobluk, who conducted a recent survey on racing injuries that was financed by  the Morris Animal Foundation for the American Assn. of Equine Practitioners.  </P> <P> He said that by far the most dangerous sport for horses is racing, which places  tremendous stress on the immature limbs of 2- and 3-year-old horses driven at a  pounding gallop for more than a minute.  </P> <P> Polo ponies are highly trained and highly conditioned performers whose muscular  bodies are more capable of withstanding physical stress, he said.  </P> <P> Insurance experts place the mortality risk of polo ponies below that of  racehorses but equal to hunting and jumping, the second most risky equine  sport. Bob Pringle, a vice president of American Bankers, a leading livestock  mortality insurer in Florida, said few owners of polo horses insure their  mounts because the rates are high. Most choose to be self-insured.  </P> <P> The indoor polo games are played in the 3,500-seat Equidome, which is 150 feet  wide by 300 feet long. The playing surface is a mix of dirt and sand loam that  is watered, cushioned and smoothed before each game. Azzaro said about two  inches of cushion on the field is allowed to help the horses pivot.  </P> <P> The 4 1/2-foot Equidome walls are made of concrete blocks. Azzaro said that  despite the game's intense action, the horses rarely slam into the walls. "A  horse is smart enough to know where the wall is, and they won't go where they  don't want to go," he said.  </P> <P> Polo games at the Equidome consist of six 5 1/2-minute periods, called  "chukkers," in which three players on each of two teams attempts to hit a  rubber ball through a goal with a mallet. A single horse usually plays for one  chukker, although an exceptionally good mount may play in a second chukker  after resting for at least two periods, officials said.  </P> <P> Horse experts say the Equidome has been used as a model for the design of other  arenas in the nation and the world.  </P> <P> Outdoor polo is played on a field, usually grass, 160 yards wide and 300 yards  long -- three times the length of a football field. Each team consists of four  members and a chukker lasts 7 1/2 minutes. A hard ball is used.  </P> <P> The game consists of much bumping of horses and riders, although strict rules  prohibit bumps at angles of more than 45 degrees.  </P> <P> Polo enthusiasts say that horses in all sporting events are subject to injury.  George Haas Jr., chairman of the polo association's safety committee, said  horsemen "do occasionally have to put a horse down. It happens on the race  track, in the show ring, in every horse-related event I know of."  </P> <P> The experts say indoor polo places horses at no greater risk than outdoor polo  or a number of other equestrian sporting events. Critics have likened outdoor  polo to football and indoor polo to ice hockey.  </P> <P> Scherer said the risk may even be greater for players and horses on the  traditional polo field because the game is played at greater speeds than in the  arena, increasing the risk of a serious fall.  </P> <P> Sue Sally Hale of Moorpark, a 40-year player, trainer and pioneering woman in  the sport, is a member of the Los Angeles team. She said critics sometimes  complain that the horses are thin.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Marathon Runners'  </P> <P> "They are marathon runners," she said. "Have you ever seen a fat marathoner?  They eat twice as much as a show horse and are conditioned and trained every  day. It breaks our hearts when something happens to one of these horses."  </P> <P> Spectators say they are attracted to arena polo by the sport's action and the  skill of horses and riders.  </P> <P> Los Angeles radio personality Michael Jackson and his family often attend the  Equidome games "because polo is probably more spectacular as a spectator sport  indoors than out," he said. "Spectators sit right up close to and looking down  on the horses and riders. I truly believe the horses like it as much as the  riders."  </P> <P> Hollywood celebrity Johnny Grant said arena polo "is right in your lap. It  takes two great athletes to make a play in polo, both horse and rider. That's  exciting to me."  </P> <P> But spectators and horse owners scoff at the idea that the equestrian center  caters only to the wealthy. "People at the equestrian center are from all walks  of life," Jackson said. He called the center "80 drug-free acres in Los Angeles  where whole families are able to recreate together."  </P> <P> Dr. Robert Bradley, an equine veterinarian who has been practicing in the San  Fernando Valley for 26 years and has owned polo horses, said any mount without  a taste for the game could never be trained to perform. "If those horses didn't  like the game," he said, "you damn sure wouldn't get them to play it."  </P></p>

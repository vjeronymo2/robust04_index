During the meeting which lasted  for about an hour, they keenly discussed prospects for political  reform debates and desirable directions of the coalition  government. According to Yamaguchi, Hosokawa expressed his  resolve to stand out firmly to enact the political reform bills.  Regarding his strategies for the next ordinary Diet session,  Hosokawa reportedly clarified his stance to maintain and further  strengthen cooperative relations among the eight coalition  parties. After the meeting, Yamaguchi told reporters that,  "while some quarters in the coalition are seeking new grouping,  the prime minister still considers the eight-party alliance must  be the foundation of the coalition government."    It is believed that those remarks by Hosokawa were made to  check moves by Akira Yamagishi, chairman of Rengo who recently  proposed a unification of liberal parties except Komeito and  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party].</p>

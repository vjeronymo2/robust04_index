			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Kuchma backs greater presidential power: Ukrainian parliament urged to give Kravchuk control over economy UKRAINIAN prime minister Leonid Kuchma yesterday urged parliament to support President Leonid Kravchuk in his bid to assume extraordinary powers over the economy. Mr Kuchma also repeated his offer to resign, despite parliament's refusal to accept his resignation 10 days ago. He said that the president should have the right to choose his own prime minister. Mr Kuchma's move is likely to resolve the political stalemate which began two weeks ago when the president and prime minister put forward conflicting proposals to create a single centre of executive authority in Ukraine. Today parliament, which in the past has put more faith in the prime minister's economic leadership than the president's, is due to decide whether or not to grant Mr Kravchuk's request for additional powers. Now that Mr Kuchma has withdrawn his own proposal to be granted extensive control over the economy and backed the president's bid, parliament is more likely to support Mr Kravchuk. Mr Kuchma justified his decision to support the president - whose commitment to the tough economic reforms Mr Kuchma has championed has been lukewarm - on the grounds that without a single source of executive power Ukraine would be unable to cope with its deepening economic crisis. But the future direction of Ukrainian economic policy remains unclear. Although Mr Kuchma repeated his offer to resign he left open the possibility that he would serve as Mr Kravchuk's prime minister, if the president were willing to back the harsh economic decisions Mr Kuchma believes Ukraine must make. Mr Kuchma yesterday painted a bleak picture of the economy in the aftermath of Russia's decision to charge world prices for fuel sold to Ukraine. He said that many chemical and metallurgical factories are now unprofitable and must be shut down, that 45 per cent of coal mines should be closed and that even Ukraine's defence industries might go bankrupt. 'Whether you like it or not, the reality is that we have already entered into a hyper-inflationary spiral,' Mr Kuchma said. 'We have no alternative but to introduce a system of ration cards for some basic foods.' Mr Kuchma also insisted that political considerations must give way to economics. As an example, he said that Ukrainian leaders must 'be honest and recognise that in the near future Russia will never leave Sevastopol (the disputed Black Sea port).' He said that Ukraine 'must recognise this reality and make money from it' by charging Russia for the use of the harbour.</p>

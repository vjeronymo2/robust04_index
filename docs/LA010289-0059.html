			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SMOKE FROM RUBBISH FIRE FILLS JAIL  </P> <P> Burning rubbish and debris was placed inside a ventilation system duct at the  federal Metropolitan Correctional Center Sunday afternoon, sending a large  amount of smoke wafting through several levels of the high-rise jail building  downtown, San Diego fire officials reported.  </P> <P> Fire Capt. William Middleton said there were no injuries to inmates but the  incident presented some problems for jail officials because smoke was blown  through several stories of the complex. He said the burning material had been  placed inside a duct on the 8th floor.  </P> <P> "Other than that, it was a relatively small fire and easy to contain,"  Middleton said.  </P> <P> The fire was reported about 2:30 p.m., he said. Because the location was a  high-rise, 24-story structure, the Fire Department sent a large number of units  to the scene, including eight engine companies, four truck companies, a rescue  rig, three battalion chiefs and one division chief.  </P> <P> Jail officials declined to comment on the incident.  </P></p>

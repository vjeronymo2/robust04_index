			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Burton at top of expectations - Cost savings based on replacing full-time with part-time jobs BURTON GROUP, the clothing retailer, announced first half profits at the top end of expectations following a wide-ranging cost-cutting programme including 4,000 job cuts and an unexpected pension fund holiday. Pre-tax profits for the six months to February 27 were Pounds 24.7m, against Pounds 21.8m. Sales were ahead 14 per cent from Pounds 934.6m to Pounds 1.07bn. The pre-tax figure was taken after higher than expected redundancy costs of Pounds 11.9m. However, Mr John Hoerner, the former Debenhams chief and now Burton chief executive who has been credited with pulling the group from the brink of collapse, said he did not expect further charges in the second half. The charges were partially offset by the absence of a Pounds 3.8m payment to the pension fund. The holiday was expected to contribute a further Pounds 3.8m in the second half of the year. Mr Hoerner said Burton's best practice programme, which entails the reduction in the number of full-time jobs and an increase in part-time employees, was expected to contribute cost savings of between Pounds 25m and Pounds 30m next year. In 1993, Burton expected to make about half the savings. The chairman said the first half had been focused on improving the group's competitiveness, while maintaining better control over discounting. This meant introducing lower initial prices through both better buying and a decline in margins. The trading pattern showed that sales had been largely discount driven. As a result, gross margins fell by 2.3 percentage points. The multiple retailing division, which includes Top Shop, Principles and Dorothy Perkins, showed a significant improvement with trading profits rising from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 14.4m. Debenhams, the department store, increased its contribution by 36 per cent to Pounds 40m. The proposed final dividend is maintained at 1p. Earnings fell from 1.9p to 1.4p. The shares advanced 4p on the day to 85p, a little below the high point for the year. COMMENT The pension fund holiday comes as a handy damper to the unexpected costs of paying for almost 4,000 redundancies. The big question now will be to what extent Burton has managed to put a floor under its gross margin. Even Mr Hoerner is prepared to say the trading environment is, and looks likely to remain, severely competitive. On the other hand, optimists point to the high degree of operational gearing, the benefits yet to be reaped from the redundancy and store refurbishment programme. The prospects in the second half are for a reasonable profit, on a modest sales increase. Forecasts for this year are for Pounds 40m, on what appears to be a towering prospective p/e of 35 times. The potential looks better further out, when the p/e falls to a more approachable 23 on a conservative profits forecast ofPounds 70m.</p>

Krivchenko, chairman of the Commission </F> for Reforming the Local Organs of Power, by Nikolay Belyy in  Blagoveshchensk under the rubric "Organs of Representative  Power"; date not given: "Provinces Want To Think"]    [Text] Long before the election of the new Russian  parliament preparation of documents for the reform of the local  organs of power began in Amur Oblast. Now they are already  prepared. What will the new organs of power look like away from  Moscow? A. Krivchenko, chairman of the Commission for Reforming  the Local Organs of Power, replies to ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI.    [Belyy] Albert Arkadyevich, here in Amur the people have  seen and experienced various organs of power provided by God,  the czar, and the Bolsheviks. Here were military governors  appointed by the sovereign; subsequently in Blagoveshchensk  there was a city public administration, a city, that is to say,  petty bourgeois, administrative office [uprava], a city duma, a  committee for public safety -- I'm talking about 1917 now -- and  soviets of various levels. What now? And anyway, was a reform  of the local power so necessary? After all, on a mundane level  the old power got in no one's way; it just scribbled one or two  things here and there, being only a pale shadow of the other,  pro-party power, as we know.    [Krivchenko] It is this power that we are reforming -- a  window-dressing, a sham power, incapable of thinking properly  and seeking compromises. A new parliament has been elected in  the country; what are we supposed to do in the provinces --  press on with the soviets, which could offer nothing but the  imposition of struggle against reforms, the government, and the  president? Incidentally, long before the elections the activity  of the soviets at various levels in Amur Oblast was suspended by  the head of the oblast administration, and only new elections  can resolve the situation legitimately. Yes, in Amur, as,  moreover, in Mother Russia as a whole, people have experienced  various organs of power, and our commission -- which  incidentally, consists of 17 people, including former deputies  of various levels, academics, and public figures -- recommends  the revival of the ancient Russian forms of statehood and  self-government which the Bolsheviks destroyed by force. Our  commission has prepared a package of documents aimed at  reorganizing the representative power and local self-government.  All experience of power was thorougly studied -- from the epoch  of military governors in Amur, to our own times; all the best  was taken from the long history and practice of power. So far  we have elaborated a provisionary statute on the fundamentals of  the new power; it will be ratified at the first session of the  newly elected oblast duma.    [Belyy] So you are having a duma anyway. But no such body  existed in Amur before 1917...    [Krivchenko] Yes, that is right, and here we are restoring  historical justice. We have a governor -- albeit not a military  one -- but he does not have a system of checks and balances, as  the local procommunist press writes. Now there will be one, in  the shape of the oblast soviet. Yes a duma -- how is the  Russian "dumat" [to think] worse than the bureaucratically  soviet "soveshchatsya" [to consult]? In line with the  fundamentals of the Russian constitutional structure, power in  Amur Oblast is exercised by the organs of representative  (legislative) power and executive power. The oblast duma is the  representative structure of state power, the administration the  executive structure. The duma is elected by the population on  the basis of universal, direct, equal suffrage by secret ballot  every two years -- it has 15 deputies. It carries out its  activity on a permanent and nonpermnaent basis. The procedure  for the organization and holding of elections to the duma and  its powers have been elaborated.    [Belyy] And what specifically stands behind the concept of  "local self-government"?    [Krivchenko] It will operate within the limits of population  centers -- cities, microrayons, settlements, villages, stations,  farmsteads [khutory], and other centers of habitation, and also  in rayons. We have revived that ancient Russian concept, the  volost [smallest administrative division of czarist Russia]. It  is a territorial administrative unit uniting a few population  centers for which the terms "rural soviet" and "settlement  soviet" were formerly used. Farmsteads and stations also belong  to our history. They are names which, if people so desire, can  be restored not only to old cossack settlements, but to new ones  as well.    In cities under oblast jurisdiction and rayons the organs of  local self-government are the elective representative organ (the  city or rayon duma) and the head of local self-government (head  of administration], appointed by the oblast governor. The  elective representative organ of local self-government is formed  by means of the election of between nine and 12 deputies,  working, as a rule, on a nonpermanent basis.    I believe that the following is a very important factor.  Only citizens of the Russian Federation who have been living on  the territory of the given electoral district for not less than  three years can be elected to the oblast duma and to the organs  of self-government. This will stop the nomination and election  of "Varangians" [Norse invaders and founders of Kingdom of Rus],  on whom not so long ago the soviets were wholly built, seeking  "true people's power" and endlessly flouting the rights and  dignity of citizens.</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Sinn Fein conditions 'sank peace plan' THE British and Irish governments flatly rejected the Hume-Adams peace initiative for Northern Ireland because it attached conditions to a cessation of violence by the IRA, according to high-ranking British officials. On the eve of a Downing Street meeting this afternoon between Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, and Mr John Major, the officials said the initiative linked an end of IRA terrorism with a place at the negotiating table for Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. That link - implying that IRA violence was being rewarded with a role for the nationalists in any future settlement - could not be accepted by London or Dublin. Mr Major and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, last week rejected the initiative put forward by Mr Hume and Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, as a basis for their efforts to restore peace to the province. They instead pledged to press ahead with their own initiative, although Irish officials said it might incorporate 'elements' of Hume-Adams. Neither government has been ready to discuss the details of the plan or the reasons for its rejection since it was handed to Mr Reynolds last month and later reported by him to Mr Major at their Brussels meeting last Friday. Mr Hume, who insists that it represents the best hope for more than 20 years of a permanent cessation of violence, has stressed repeatedly that the plan offered the prospect of a permanent end to the IRA's armed campaign. Colleagues of Mr Hume have suggested that he will consider publishing his agreement with Mr Adams if the two governments continue to rebuff him. For his part Mr Major will seek this afternoon to draw the SDLP into round-table talks proposed for the province's constitutional parties. But the officials said the Hume-Adams proposals left unanswered a range of questions about the intentions of Sinn Fein. Mr Adams appeared unwilling to modify the nationalists' central claim - which is anathema to London - that the future of Ulster should be determined by the majority of all Ireland. Even if those differences could have been 'finessed', the proposals contained the fatal flaw of assuming that an end to IRA violence could be part of the process in which Sinn Fein was drawn into negotiations. Mr Major agreed with Mr Reynolds last week that a permanent end to IRA violence would receive an 'imaginative' response from the two governments. But the officials said that both prime ministers had agreed there could be 'no question' of any understanding with Sinn Fein in advance of such a move. Mr Major was determined any cessation should be unconditional and permanent, a stance accepted by Mr Reynolds in the two leaders' joint statement.</p>

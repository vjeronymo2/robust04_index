			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. MILITARY FACING TERROR OF CHEMICAL WAR  </P> <P> As U.S. Army forces take up positions in the Saudi Arabian desert, each soldier  wears two awkward adornments strapped firmly to his thigh: a gas mask and a  needle tinged with medicine. They are standard-issue antidotes for the horror  of chemical war.  </P> <P> Absent from American combat since World War I, the threat of poison gas now  lingers over the Middle East in a looming battle over oil. According to war  planners and outside experts, it could raise major complications for the U.S.  mission in the region.  </P> <P> Iraqi President Saddam Hussein used nerve gas in his eight-year war against  Iran and chemical weapons against rebels in Iraq. Whether he actually would  risk an American counterblow by unleashing the weapons again remains a topic of  dispute.  </P> <P> But analysts warned that Hussein's capacity to play the chemical card will  further hinder U.S. forces in an already hostile theater, requiring them at  times to don rubber protective gear in already unyielding heat.  </P> <P> "The whole object of chemical war is to degrade the other side's performance,"  one intelligence official said. "In the desert, the threat alone may degrade  U.S. troops from the start."  </P> <P> With proper precautions, the analysts said, the current contingent of elite  American ground personnel confined to airfield duty probably could escape  serious harm in the event of a first-strike Iraqi attack.  </P> <P> But they warned that an expected American escalation -- and particularly any  step to dispatch infantry forces to positions near or across enemy lines --  could find itself bogged down by the overarching need to guard against chemical  attack.  </P> <P> Despite a $9-billion U.S. effort aimed at fending off poison gas attack,  experts express agreement that such a task remains "extraordinarily difficult,"  in the words of former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger.  </P> <P> And the problem is compounded by an adversary like Hussein, whose history  reflects a willingness to use chemicals not merely in desperation but as a  calculated instrument of attack. For Hussein, said Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.),  chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, chemical warfare represents "an  ace in the hole."  </P> <P> Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, emphasized  Wednesday that U.S. soldiers in Saudi Arabia are well-equipped and well-trained  in the protective tactics designed to survive a chemical attack, even in  searing desert heat.  </P> <P> But he also acknowledged grimly that still-ambiguous intelligence reports of  Iraqi commanders distributing chemical weapons to their troops are being taken  very seriously. "It's a threat we're concerned with," Powell said. "I treat it  as a capability that is there to be used."  </P> <P> The prospect of chemical war has been high on the minds of U.S. military  planners for more than a decade, and rapid-deployment units like those  dispatched to the Saudi desert have practiced poison-gas scenarios in war games  in the Mojave Desert and in Egypt.  </P> <P> Such operations have become more intensive with growing concern about an  Iranian or Iraqi threat. And amid heat, sand and other desert hardships, they  represent the best rehearsal for current operations.  </P> <P> But periodic assessments by government investigators and intelligence officials  repeatedly have concluded that the devastating properties of chemicals as arms  still leave American forces threatened. Indeed, midway through the U.S.  chemical defenses buildup, the General Accounting Office concluded bluntly in  1986 that American defenses were inadequate.  </P> <P> Among those the government auditors found to be particularly at risk: Navy  ships at sea and command posts on the ground -- and the rapid-deployment troops  like the 82nd Airborne, operating in the open with only light equipment.  </P> <P> Military officials said Wednesday that each of the U.S. soldiers dispatched to  the Middle East is carrying a Mark I combat kit containing atropine, an  injectable common drug that serves as an antidote to the effects of nerve gas  -- perhaps Hussein's most potent threat.  </P> <P> The needle-ready kit, worn strapped tight across the thigh, is designed to  provide emergency aid to a soldier who comes under surprise nerve gas attack. A  hard slap to the thigh sends atropine into the victim's system, serving as a  muscle relaxant.  </P> <P> They also carry so-called MOPP kits -- the heavy charcoal-lined suits whose  mask and head-to-toe cover provide the only guarantee of safety against a  chemical attack. An acronym for military operational personnel protection, MOPP  suits are "hot as blazes" in even temperate heat, according to former a soldier  who has worn them.  </P> <P> "If you had to wear one in a desert situation," the former soldier said, "I  don't think you could last more than an hour."  </P> <P> According to military sources, the "ready brigade" of some 4,000 paratroopers  from the 82nd Airborne also includes a special company designed to combat the  effects of chemical war. The unit carries special devices to detect the  presence of poison gases and would seek to decontaminate men and their  equipment.  </P> <P> The desert heat would also hamper an Iraqi chemical attack, because poison  agents would dissipate more quickly. But analysts said that the hot-weather  burden on American ground troops would be far more severe, in part because  Hussein could overcome evaporation by increasing his chemical attack.  </P> <P> CIA estimates recently provided to Congress show that Iraq has amassed a vast  stockpile containing as much as several thousand tons of chemical weapons,  including both nerve and mustard gas.  </P> <P> Iraqi forces used the chemicals with increasingly devastating effect in its  eight-year war with Iran, escalating from purely defensive use of the weapons  to gas-bombings and shellings to open the way for major ground attacks.  </P> <P> Nerve gas, generally used in aerosol form, attacks the nervous system of its  victims by inhibiting the normal action of a body enzyme. Difficult to detect,  it poses severe dangers from inhalation and from contact. In severe cases it  results in convulsion, coma and -- unless properly treated -- death.  </P> <P> Mustard gas is a liquid agent whose blistering power and other horrors became  part of the numbing history of World War I. With effects that can last for  hours, it has no antidote other than staying out of its way.  </P> <P> Because Hussein has used explosives and poison gases on civilians, American  analysts expressed uncertainty about where he might aim an anti-American  chemical attack.  </P> <P> And because U.S. chemical weapons already may have been shipped to the region  -- and the United States, unlike Iran, also maintains potentially overpowering  weaponry -- many of the analysts expressed doubt as to whether Hussein would  take the risk of opening a chemical war.  </P> <P> "I'm not convinced that Saddam Hussein is going to use chemical weapons," said  Elisa Harris, a Brookings Institution expert. "He must recognize that that  would be suicidal."  </P> <P> But the experts said it was conceivable that the Iraqi leader might use gas,  firing bombs or shells at ground troops or attacking ships at sea.  </P> <P> They said such an overarching threat could impose severe limits to U.S. forces,  particularly on the desert floor, a world where blowing sand can wreak havoc on  aircraft engines and 110-degree heat creates a need in man for six gallons of  water a day.  </P> <P> "You have to add the morale factor that chemical weapons seem to bring," said  Steve Bowman, a congressional weapons expert with the Congressional Research  Service. "It makes for a very high anxiety factor."  </P> <P> Staff writers Melissa Healy, Thomas B. Rosenstiel and Karen Tumulty contributed  to this report.  </P> <P> </P> <P> KEY U.S. WARPLANES IN GULF CRISIS  </P> <P> F-111:  </P> <P> Type: Tactical fighter-bomber.  </P> <P> Primary Purpose: Ground-hugging "penetration" missions to surgically remove  specific enemy positions.  </P> <P> Combat radius: About 1,600 miles.  </P> <P> Armament: Equipped with 20-millimeter cannon and a variety of rockets,  including air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles.  </P> <P> Capabilities: Can carry about 17,000 pounds of bombs and other weapons.  </P> <P> Miscellaneous: At least 14 on training maneuvers at Incirlik air base in  Turkey.

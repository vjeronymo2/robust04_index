			<p>BFN     [Text] The Dutch minister for overseas development, Jan  Pronk, has called for aid to be airlifted to Rwanda to provide  food for the hundreds of thousands of refugees there.    Mr. Pronk made his appeal shortly after visiting the Rwandan  capital, Kigali. The minister called on the United States to  take the lead in organizing the airlifts. He also called for  the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to protect  relief convoys.    After his visit to Kigali, Mr. Pronk compared the situation  in Rwanda with the killing fields of Cambodia, where huge  numbers of Cambodia's population were slaughtered in a civil war.</p>

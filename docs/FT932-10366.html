			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Books: Dashed good yarns THE LOVERS by Morris West Heinemann Pounds 14.99, 314 pages IN THE PLACE OF FALLEN LEAVES by Tim Pears Hamish Hamilton Pounds 14.99, 320 pages DAUGHTERS by Paule Marshall Serpent's Tail Pounds 9.99, 408 pages MORRIS WEST does not tell stories. He spins dashed good yarns. His 28-volume, 60 million copy career has propelled a sequence of lean, brawny heroes under desert and ocean skies to wrestle with and to vanquish their moral adversaries. Forty years on the formula, which owes as much to Graham Greene as to Wilbur Smith, is as engaging as ever. The Lovers, promised by the publishers to be his last book, shows the maturing of West's craft. The setting is a sumptuous yacht in the unspoiled Mediterranean of the early 1950s. As to be expected, the cast of characters is larger than life: a haughty contessa, a sadistic Irish-American millionaire, a Vatican financier. Into their intrigues plunges one Bryan de Courcy Cavanagh, a virile multilingual Australian late of the Pacific campaign. Cavanagh loses his innocence but wins the affections of the contessa and the respect of Big Money. In the meantime the Old World proves itself irredeemably corrupt, willing to sell its soul for Yankee dollars. It is racy stuff, lucidly written and spiced by allusions to the Vatican's hand in securing the escape of Nazi war criminals and in promoting the plunder of the Italian coast for tourism. The romance is less convincing, however, and so is the dialogue, which resonates oddly in Orson Wellesian mock-Irish, irrespective of who among the motley crew is speaking. The flourishes in the slick narrative mostly work well, giving a dreamy cadence to this grown man's fantasy. At other times, as when we are told that the ship 'handled like a contented woman,' one fears the wine dark sea is merely purple. Such lapses are not to be found in Tim Pears's delightful, smooth flowing first novel In the Place of Fallen Leaves. Here the landscape is Devon, green and rolling though scorched by the hot summer of 1984. The drought will not break and the schools are closed by a teachers' strike. For Alison, a 13-year-old farmgirl, time seems to have stopped, and even to slide backwards through three generations of her family's lives. The characters peopling Alison's village become vehicles for an exploration of the different facets of love. For one brother it is a coldblooded hunt, for another pure intoxication. For the thoughtful village rector it comes as light from an unexpected source. For mother it is sheer endurance. From this small valley Pears unearths passion, jealousy and betrayal. Gently evoking the daily toil of farm life, he punctuates it with moments of magic realist whimsy. Reminiscent of Faulkner and Garcia Marquez, the writing retains a very English scale, closely observed and lyrical, never straining credulity. The West Country speech is skilfully rendered, and there is a wealth of description. One memorable passage grippingly details a caesarean birth performed by the taciturn village gelder. If there is a flaw it is that Pears dabbles somewhat unconvincingly with Marquesian circularity. Overall, however, the book is a triumph. Jackets on subsequent editions, one imagines, will be well plastered with adjectives: sensitive, heartwarming, hallucinatory. It is a very different voice that comes from Paule Marshall, warm, African-American, strident, polemical. Her seventh and latest book, Daughters, arrives loaded with praise from across the Atlantic, and with good reason. The novel is well written, its characters compellingly portrayed. Its subject is the central issue facing black Americans in the post civil rights era, which is no longer white racism but rather the question of identity. Ursa Mackenzie, the protagonist, stands between a rock and a hard place. The rock is the Caribbean island where she grew up and where her father is a politician whose ideals are increasingly compromised by the reality of dependence. The hard place is New York City, where she struggles to contribute to black advancement in the face of indifference and betrayal. She finds that courage can make a difference, but it is a lonely road. The book is enlightening about the pain of being black and female in a hostile world. It is particularly good about Caribbean politics. There is a tendency to sententiousness that speaks of overindulgence in the two PCs plagueing modern America: political correctness and the personal computer. Every touchstone of gender and race politics must, it seems, be cited, from rape to abortion to male infidelity to police harassment. And at 400 pages the book is excessively word processed.</p>

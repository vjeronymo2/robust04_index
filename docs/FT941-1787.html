			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Belgium makes plans for telecom sell-off The Belgian government yesterday took its first step towards privatisation of the state telecommunications group Belgacom by announcing a review of options for selling parts of the company. However, Mr Jean Luc Dehaene, the prime minister, warned that privatisation was unlikely before 1995, and said the government would retain a majority stake. The government and Belgacom will now appoint consultants to draw up plans for privatisation, which is expected to include proposals for the company to link with 'strategic' partners, create synergies with other telecomunications groups, and float shares on the Belgian stock market, probably by 1996. Mr Bessel Kok, chief executive officer, said yesterday Belgacom was holding informal discussions with several leading European and US groups with a view to forming these strategic alliances. Although the privatisation of Belgacom is at the centre of Belgium's privatisation programme, which is expected to raise BFr40bn (Pounds 754m) in 1994, the government warned that the sale of Belgacom was unlikely to contribute much this year, and noted that several obstacles still remained to the sale. These include a requirement that the company raise more than BFr100m to cover future pension liabilities. Mr Kok said Belgacom was 'not dissatisfied' with the conditions the government was imposing on the privatisation and welcomed an end to the uncertainty about the company's future that has dogged it in recent months. 'I am pleased that the floating technique has been mentioned as a vision for the future and that they have recognised the need for international alliances,' he said. However he admitted that it remained unclear what the government was proposing in its recommendation that Belgacom should seek more 'integration' and synergies with other companies. Mr Dehaene refused to set any timetable for the implementation of the consultants' report, but said that privatisation was 'more likely to occur in 1995 or 1996 than 1994'. 'We must not act too quickly or too slowly,' he said, stressing that the government wanted to take a 'calm' approach to the sell-off, which has provoked considerable controversy in Belgium. Nevertheless, he added that the privatisation would need to occur before the end of 1998 - the deadline for the EU-wide liberalisation of voice services.</p>

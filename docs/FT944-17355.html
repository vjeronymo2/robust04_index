			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Switch in busy oil sector Oil stocks, one of the quietest areas of the market in recent months as investors have focused on interest rate sensitive areas, suddenly moved centre stage, providing some of the biggest individual trades yesterday and also responding to developments in the Middle East. Reports of big Iraqi troop manoeuvres close to the Kuwaiti border helped crude oil prices move up, stimulating all sorts of activity in oil shares which were already responding to strong overnight buying from the US. The biggest move in the market involved one institution switching its entire holding of Enterprise Oil into BP. The switch was said to have been carried out by NatWest Securities and involved 7.4m Enterprise shares, some 1.5 per cent of the group, and 7.1m BP shares. Speculation as to the seller of the block of Enterprise centred on the Prudential, Scottish Widows and Legal &amp; General insurance companies . Enterprise shares have performed badly this year retreating from a 1994 high of 457p, reached around two weeks before its ultimately unsuccessful bid move against fellow oil exploration group Lasmo. BP shares, on the other hand, have gone from strength to strength hitting a record 430p last month, as the market responded to the company's strong earnings recovery and a string of exploration successes. BP were additionally helped by talk of a buy recommendation from Cazenove and on hints of further exploration success west of the Shetlands. At the close BP were 9 higher at 415 1/2 p on turnover of 20m shares while Enterprise settled 7 off at 386p with 15m traded.</p>

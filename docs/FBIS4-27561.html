			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- The Ministry of Finance  [MOF] plans to allow a portion of the revenues collected from  the consumption tax to be handled by local governments, ministry  sources said Monday [30 May].    The ministry will soon offer a compromise proposal to the  Home Affairs Ministry, which, along with local governments, has  urged the introduction of a local consumption tax.    Currently, the state government collects all consumption tax  revenues and distributes 20 percent of revenues to autonomies.    Under the Finance Ministry proposal, the same proportion of  income from the consumption tax will be collected by  municipalities and then pooled and distributed according to  population and consumption levels.    Introduction of a local consumption tax is one of the  focuses  in the planned tax system overhaul the government plans to work  out by late June.    The Finance Ministry initially opposed the idea but has  conceded in the face of mounting calls for the need to boost the  financial base of local governments.    Its proposal is slightly different from that of the Home  Affairs Ministry, which requested that Japan's 47 prefectures  collect the tax and the money gathered be distributed in  accordance with the number of workers in each prefecture.    If the Finance Ministry's plan is accepted, the share of  revenues for such major cities as Tokyo and Osaka will be much  smaller than the original plan because many people who work in  the major cities live outside city limits.</p>

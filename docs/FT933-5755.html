			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at risk (17): A great risk of missing the boat - Southern Africa / The future of a region racked by political turmoil, civil war and social upheaval 'IF YOUR neighbour doesn't eat, you don't sleep peacefully.' That adage, from veteran South African entrepreneur Anton Rupert, forms the rationale around the world for regional integration: the argument is that a sated neighbour is a stable neighbour, unlikely to turn belligerent. And with peace and stability come economic development. Four years ago, southern Africa's prospects looked unrelievedly bleak, with Angola and Mozambique sunk in civil war, Zambia in turmoil, Zimbabwe in economic decline and South Africa exhausted by decades of repression. Today hopes are high that South Africa will prove the region's economic saviour. But the post-apartheid government in Pretoria is likely to pay little attention to the problem of hungry neighbours until it can solve the far more dangerous problem of hungry citizens. And that could take until the end of the decade, even on an optimistic timetable, dampening hopes that South Africa will be the 'locomotive' of rapid growth in southern Africa - at least in the short term. First among the problems is the political transition in South Africa itself, where violence and instability have severely depressed economic activity and deterred foreign and local investors. Until South Africa is stable, accelerated economic growth in the region remains a pipe dream: and achieving stability in the republic may prove a lengthy process. Similarly, political upheaval in other countries of the region will inevitably delay growth. The most economically promising country outside South Africa - Angola - looks set to languish in civil war for the foreseeable future; Mozambique's future is far from certain, in spite of plans for multi-party elections; Zambia is struggling under the burden of decades of past mistakes, economic and political; Zimbabwe is weak economically. The economic basis for regional integration is also shaky. Prospects for significantly increasing trade within the region are uninspiring: first and foremost, because most of the countries of southern Africa simply cannot pay, at least not with hard currency. To get around the payment problem, South Africa could extend the rand monetary area to include other countries - a far too costly option, given the lack of monetary discipline exhibited by most of the region's central banks - or resort to countertrade. But it will be difficult to boost two-way trade links given the fact that South Africa's neighbours are far less developed than the republic (in a market worth Dollars 130bn, South Africa already has an 80 per cent share) and because regional complementarities are few, outside of a limited range of raw materials. Little can be expected from the lifting of sanctions in this area either: even under sanctions, regional states grouped together under the Southern African Development Coordination Conference (since renamed the Southern African Development Community) imported R2.4bn of goods from the republic, or almost 60 per cent of Pretoria's African exports. The most promising areas could well prove inter-regional trade in services, such as power and water, with Eskom, the South African electricity utility, proposing a southern African electricity grid; Pretoria already imports water from Lesotho through the Highlands Water project. But important as this co-operation is, the record to date suggests there is little evidence that SADC politicians in the region are prepared to relinquish enough economic autonomy to form a truly integrated regional community. In the longer term, there is no alternative to regional integration. In a world of economic and political power blocs, southern Africa cannot hope to prosper in its present fragmented state. The risk is that, unless the region achieves political stability soon, it will simply miss the boat.</p>

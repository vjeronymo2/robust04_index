			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Survey of Korean Financial Markets (2): Industrial empires still dominate - Seoul's efforts to curb the economic power of the chaebol have come under fire THE South Korean government's tight regulation of the financial system is closely linked to its industrial policy. Officials argue that they must retain control over the financial system in order to curb the economic power of the family-owned conglomerates, or chaebol. The government wants to make the chaebol more efficient by forcing them to prune their sprawling industrial empires and instead concentrate on a few important core businesses. It also seeks to reduce what it considers the pernicious influence of the family owners on corporate management. But critics contend that the state's use of the financial system to achieve these goals has failed and should be abandoned. 'The economy has become too developed for the government to rely on the financial system as an effective instrument for industrial restructuring,' said Mr Jwa Sung-hee, a researcher at the Korea Development Institute (KDI), the government-affiliated policy centre. The government originally used its power over the financial system to promote the growth of the chaebol in the 1960s and 1970s by providing them with cheap loans. Then President Park Chung-hee believed that the emergence of the business groups would help the country to industrialise quickly. But by the 1980s, the government of President Chun Doo-hwan decided that the chaebol had grown too large. They were monopolising bank loans and their economic dominance was hindering the development of small and medium businesses. Moreover, the chaebol were criticised for spreading their resources too thinly by competing in many of the same industrial sectors, from cars and ships to construction and electronics. The intense competition reflected the personal rivalry among the chaebol's family owners. Credit restrictions were introduced in the mid-1980s, which limited the percentage of bank loans that could be given to the chaebol. However, the export boom of the late 1980s weakened the impact of the credit controls and had little appreciable effect on the growth of the chaebol. They still enjoy lower financing costs than smaller companies, which must often borrow from the secondary 'kerb market' at higher interest rates. The chaebol believe that the government's attempts to regulate them are misguided. They argue that industrial diversification is important because profitable subsidiaries are able to support the emergence of new industries. The credit restrictions also hinder the chaebol's international competitiveness since they are forced to pay higher financing costs than their competitors in Japan and Taiwan. A new round of reform measures was recently introduced by the government of President Roh Tae-woo after the chaebol were criticised for using some of their profits from the 1980s boom to invest in property, which helped increase land prices and caused public protests. Although the chaebol engaged in property speculation to help raise funds that were denied them through the banking system, the government argued that the companies should have invested more of their earnings in research and development or improving industrial facilities. The government last year stipulated that the 30 biggest chaebol should each select three core businesses that would form the focus of their future activity. The intention was to continue to use the chaebol as vehicles for economic development by lifting credit restrictions on the designated core companies, while squeezing credit given to other subsidiaries in compliance with the government's goal of reducing the size of the chaebol. But this compromise solution has been called a failure by the KDI in a recent report. Instead of selecting high-tech business areas as the government hoped, the chaebol picked either financially weak or capital-intensive subsidiaries for the unlimited bank loans. A number of core companies were in the same business sectors, contributing to a duplication of industrial operations. Twelve chaebol, for example, selected petrochemicals as one of their core activities, even though Korea is suffering from excess production capacity and unprofitability in this sector. Another weakness with the system is that there are few controls to determine whether the core companies are funnelling the bank loans to non-core concerns. The proportion of bank loans to the top 30 chaebol has barely changed since the policy was first introduced, and the number of chaebol subsidiaries continues to multiply instead of shrink. 'We haven't found the optimal policy yet toward the chaebol. We are still in a transition phase,' admits Mr Suh Sang-mok, an influential government MP. 'The chaebol are an important part of the Korean economy. We cannot apply shock treatment to them.' The government now wants to reduce cross payment guarantees among chaebol subsidiaries. This could threaten some financially weak units since reduced guarantees could discourage banks from lending to them. Most chaebol are in a financially vulnerable position, with the average chaebol having a debt/equity ratio of 350 per cent, a legacy from the days of easy credit. 'The chaebol's heavy debts have made hostages of the commercial banks, which fear that the collapse of one chaebol company would lead to downfall of the entire business group as a result of the cross-payment guarantees,' explains Dr Suh. The KDI report argues, however, that the government should abandon its attempts to regulate the size and diversification of the chaebol through credit controls, explaining that the strength and maturity of these groups makes such efforts 'dubious and even anachronistic'. Instead, attention should focus on widening their ownership, which will eventually loosen ties among the chaebol subsidiaries. It would also reduce the influence of the family owners, who would be replaced as corporate executives by professional managers. A stronger inheritance and gift tax system would encourage the family owners to sell shareholdings to their employees or the general public. Mr Kim Young-sam, the next likely president of South Korea, has indicated that he would make this approach the centrepiece of his chaebol reform policy. Further steps could be taken to encourage banks and other financial institutions to become main chaebol shareholders. One proposal being discussed is that the banks convert some of their outstanding chaebol loans into equity holdings. This would be combined with tougher rules that would prevent the chaebol from taking control of the banks. The chaebol have already succeeded in gaining ownership of about half of the country's non-bank institutions, including insurance companies and brokerage firms, and used them to bypass the controls on bank loans. About two-thirds of chaebol loans are provided by banks, while the remainder comes from secondary financial institutions.</p>

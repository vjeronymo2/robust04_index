			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / People: Coleman: the favourite for BankAmerica At 63, and with two of the biggest US bank takeovers under his belt, Richard Rosenberg shows no sign of letting up. The BankAmerica chairman was in ebullient mood recently as he announced the Dollars 1.9bn acquisition of Continental Bank, a Chicago-based corporate bank. The money must now be on his completing at least one more - perhaps of a big retail bank in his native New England - before handing over the reins. Rosenberg came late to the top job at the US's second-biggest bank. He was already 60 when he took over in May 1990 after a retail banking career spent largely at Wells Fargo, but also with brief spells at Crocker and Seafirst (a BankAmerica subsidiary). Age is unlikely to curtail his career soon. Tom Clausen, BankAmerica's last chairman, did not step aside until he was 67. The two men have little else in common; Clausen, who had led the World Bank, was one of the most prominent international bankers of his generation. Rosenberg, on the other hand, has earned a formidable reputation building retail banking businesses first at Wells Fargo and more recently at BankAmerica. When Rosenberg does decide to go, there is a clear favourite to follow him: Lewis Coleman, a vice chairman of the bank and its chief financial officer. Coleman, 51, is one of a group of senior Wells Fargo executives brought into BankAmerica along with Rosenberg in the mid-1980s, and who now form the core of the bank's management. Unlike Rosenberg, Coleman has spent his career largely in wholesale and international banking. That could prove no bad thing if BankAmerica seeks to grow further from its west coast base to become more like the international banking group that Clausen first moulded in the late 1970s.</p>

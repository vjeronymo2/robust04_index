			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V.I. Staroselskiy, V.A. Bratov, V.I. Suetinov, </F> Moscow Electronic Engineering Institute; UDC 621.382]    [Abstract] The principal active element of GaAs integrated  circuits--a field effect transistor with a Shottky barrier or  p-n junction serving as the control barrier  junction--is described, and the constraints imposed by the  presence of the gate-source barrier junction are discussed. A  method is proposed for limiting the gate current in field effect  transistors with a barrier junction which amounts to using a  composite transistor produced by inversely connecting the gate  and source electrodes of two like transistors whereby the  auxiliary transistor is connected to the gate circuit of the  main transistor so that when the composite transistor's  gate-source voltage rises, the main transistor's gate-source  voltage rises but the auxiliary transistor's gate-source voltage  decreases; the auxiliary transistor is cut off before a  measurable current appears in the main transistor gate circuit  under certain conditions. The use of composite FETs makes it  possible to expand the functional capabilities of digital IC  logic elements and lower their electric power consumption; their  shortcomings include a certain decrease in response speed due to  the use of additional auxiliary transistor elements in the  switched transistor gate circuits. This drawback is partially  compensated for by the bootstrap effect and automatic negative  voltage level limiting. Figures 4; references 4.</p>

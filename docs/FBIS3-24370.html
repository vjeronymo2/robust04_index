			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Matochkin, Kaliningrad Oblast </F> administration chief, by Eduard Govorushko, under rubric "The  Economy, Numbers, Analyses, Society": "Why Not Create a Baltic  Republic?"; place and date not given]    [Text] Yuriy Semyonovich Matochkin, born 1931, doctor  of economic science, member of the Russian Federation Federal  Assembly. Kaliningrad old-timer. Cruised the Baltic and the  Atlantic as a navigator and later captain of large ships, was  chairman of a fishing kolkhoz. After receiving his doctorate  became president of one of Kaliningrad's institutes. Appointed  chief of the Kaliningrad Oblast administration in August 1991.  Says that he will not leave his position until he creates a  normative and legal basis for the development of the Yantar  [Amber] Free Economic Zone.    [Govorushko] Yuriy Semyonovich, is it easy for the oblast to  be a Russian enclave?    [Matochkin] A component of the Russian Federation. But  unfortunately, not everyone in the government understands what  it means to live two countries away from Moscow. The problems  that arise during transit through Lithuania are known and, on  the whole, understood. But suddenly we learned that, the same as  last year, our own Ministry of Railways introduced international  freight rates for us... And we had thought, naively, that the  question had been settled once and for all.    In general, we can only hope that it will be recognized at  all governmental levels: there is a foreign territory of the  Russian Federation. Any document signed with the Baltic states,  Belarus or other of the oblast's neighbors--even for  intra-Russian use--must take our geopolitical situation and  interests into account. But sometimes Russia forgets about us.    [Govorushko] So it seems that most of the problems for the  oblast are created not by Lithuania or other adjoining states,  but by the Russian government itself?    [Matochkin] No, I wouldn't say that. Lithuania creates  problems, but it would be easier to resolve them if Russia  helped actively. Because Lithuania, as a sovereign state, quite  justifiably is interested in negotiating at the national level,  regarding dialog with us as merely preparing the ground.    [Govorushko] Why not give the oblast greater authority in  negotiating with its neighbors?    [Matochkin] We count on this happening after passage of the  law on the status of Kaliningrad Oblast, which the Russian Duma  is to consider soon. But there had never been any enclaves in  Russian history, so we can only guess what the deputies will  think of the bill. A new statute for the oblast is only a first  step. In future I do not preclude formation of a Baltic Russian  Republic, in the framework of a single state. I think the  administration chief or governor--the name doesn't  matter--should be appointed by the president so as to stress  that the region is inseparable from Russia. The president's  vicegerent should be authorized to negotiate with neighboring  countries on all the territory's problems. Incidentally, the  government has given me such authority with regard to the  northeastern provinces of Poland.    We would like to use the future status law to become, for  example, an associate member of the community of Baltic and  northern states, representing Russian interests there. This  process has already begun in some measure. I came to this  conclusion after a meeting of officials of the Baltic region in  Helsinki, in which I took part as a member of the Russian  delegation. But so far our relations with Poland are developing  more dynamically. Yet we would gladly accede to an understanding  on, say, a non-visa regime for inhabitants of the three Baltic  states. Besides, restoration of a new type of Hanseatic Union  would be impossible without Kaliningrad Oblast, its ports and  transit routes as a connecting link between East and West.    [Govorushko] What is the socio-economic situation in the  oblast? Did it gain anything from the free economic zone status?    [Matochkin] Actually, benefits for the free economic zone  began to accrue only since the first quarter of last year. At  the same time, due to high transportation costs per unit of  output produced in the oblast, it is not competitive. That is  why the rate of decline of production in industry and  agriculture is higher than the average for Russia. At the same  time, customs benefits for the free economic zone stimulated  external economic ties and led to increased investment in  construction, which is higher here than the all-Russia average.  Trade and commodity reserves have increase substantially. The  rate of price increases is lower than in the country: at present  Kaliningrad is among the cities where goods and services are  cheaper. The difference between the living minimum and average  income has changed for the better. Small and medium businesses  and tourism are developing actively, and many small private  enterprises are being set up. The oblast now holds third place  in Russia for foreign investment, after Moscow and St.  Petersburg.    This year, however, began with difficulty, as in the entire  country. It can't be helped: we get 90 percent of our  supplementaries from the Russian Federation. The oblast remains  subsidized, and will continue to be for a long time. We depend  in many ways on the federal budget, which owes us 18 billion  rubles for last year, while in the first quarter we didn't get a  kopeck of 14 billion. What saves us, once again, is the free  zone regime and the additional regional quota for exports of our  own oil. This has helped build up small hard-currency reserves,  on which we live, and we also invest in development of the  infrastructure.    [Govorushko] The forced militarization of the oblast, as far  as I know, not only complicates relations with Baltic countries  but is also, probably, a deadweight on the economy?    [Matochkin] Our relations with Lithuania and Poland are not  affected by this, though inter-governmental relations certainly  are. But the population of the oblast supports the army and  feels safer in its presence. From the economic, social and  ecological aspects the armed forces are indeed a heavy burden on  the oblast, something which ranking bureaucrats also sometimes  fail to understand. In addition, relations between the army and  local governments are another blank spot in our legislation. I  can say that cuts in the armed forces of the region are already  taking place, but the strategic interests of the state will not  suffer.    [Govorushko] Does the name of the erstwhile all-union  headman  trouble the oblast?    [Matochkin] Of course. We don't know how to get rid of it  yet, or how to call this now Russian city. Besides, we have many  more important problems: energy resources, food, transportation,  in short, at present there is no time for renamings and removing  communist monuments. On the other hand, we are seriously  considering reconstructing the historical image of the oblast  center and other cities and towns.    For this we are planning to build plants based on Italian  technology in the near future to manufacture high-quality bricks  and durable roof tile.    [Govorushko] I can't help asking about the "secrets and  mysteries" of Kaliningrad Oblast: flooded German plants,  attempts to locate the Amber Room...    [Matochkin] No one has either confirmed or refuted the  legends about flooded aircraft plants in the Mamonovo area,  because so far it has been impossible to discover where the  flooded area connects with the bay. The mistake was that no  serious investigation of the territory in connection with  secrets of the Reich was ever undertaken and things were left to  drift. Now interest in all this has subsided. Interest in the  Amber Room is periodically rekindled, in particular in 1991,  when a major operation was undertaken with the participation of  the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Not long ago the Germans,  together with the Japanese, proposed undertaking a search with  the help of state-of-the-art equipment, but so far we have not  yet defined the legal basis of such a search or the fate of  future finds.</p>

			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOODWILL  </P> <P> On behalf of the disadvantaged and disabled people Goodwill would like to  express appreciation to all those who have in some way given assistance to  people whose main desire has been to be able to help themselves.  </P> <P> These are (people) who have hired the disabled, who have given cash donations  and who, when we sent a plea for help when donations were down, came to our  rescue.  </P> <P> These include the donors of repairable materials and the businesses that have  contracted for packaging, assembly, etc. in our industrial contracts  department.  </P> <P> We want to commend you and your readers for the assistance you have given this  past year. Through your help disadvantaged and disabled people have had daily  work here at Goodwill. Many of them have gone on to full-time jobs in local  businesses.  </P> <P> RUTH C. STEINMETZ  </P> <P> President  </P> <P> Goodwill Industries  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

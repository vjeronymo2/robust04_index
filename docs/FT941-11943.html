			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / OECD criticises Belgian policies Belgium's economy needs a 'fundamental overhaul' to improve growth prospects and resolve uncertainties stemming from its high fiscal deficit, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said yesterday. In a bleak assessment of the country's prospects, the Paris-based organisation called on Belgium to give top priority to redressing public finances. Unless this was achieved, above all through further cuts in social spending and greater flexibility on the labour market, the OECD hinted that the Belgian franc could come under pressure on the foreign exchanges. The OECD said Belgium's fiscal position was suffering from a 'snowball effect', with high interest rates causing a self-sustaining rise in public debt as a proportion of gross domestic product. The OECD gave cautious support to the Belgian authorities' policy of maintaining a firm link between the franc and the D-Mark following the widening of ERM fluctuation bands last August. A formal Belgian franc devaluation would not solve the country's problems, as it would lead to higher inflation, little gain in competitiveness, and higher interest rate differentials compared with other ERM countries. However, the OECD warned that 'sentiment on the foreign exchange markets can change abruptly'. Belgium faced the risk that 'a policy of high interest rates to defend the currency (could become) ineffective'. The OECD repeated its December forecast that GDP will rise 1 per cent in 1994 after shrinking 1 1/4 per cent in 1993 - more than the European average. The economy of neighbouring Luxembourg, which has currency parity with Belgium, was seen faring better. But the OECD warned the authorities to be careful not to let public spending grow too quickly.</p>

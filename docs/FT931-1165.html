			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Revised strategy holds back Reckitt - Extra marketing costs for brand promotion could be found from productivity gains A CHANGE in strategy towards more promotion of its brands and new product development held back 1992 profits at Reckitt &amp; Colman, the household goods group. Sir Michael Colman, chairman, said that despite difficult trading conditions the results 'exhibited the strength of the brands behind this business which have held up remarkably well'. Pre-tax profits for the year to January 2 on the old accounting basis were slightly lower at Pounds 248.3m (Pounds 252.3m), although profits reported under FRS 3 were down sharply to Pounds 181.7m (Pounds 234m). The FRS 3 figure included trading losses of Pounds 9.6m from the US spice and seasoning business. The Pounds 47.3m cost of selling it last summer hit profits as did a Pounds 9.6m reorganisation charge. Sir Michael said the proposed increase in the final dividend to 10.25p would give a 7.3 per cent increase in the total to 16.2p (15.1p) reflecting the policy of consistent dividend growth. He said the rise also showed the board's confidence in the revised strategy, although he admitted that the short-term effect would be to hold back profits. Mr Vernon Sankey, chief executive, said extra marketing costs could be found from productivity gains and margins had been maintained at high levels. Operating margins from continuing businesses were 15.2 (15.1) per cent. Group sales were Pounds 1.9bn (Pounds 1.99bn) although those from continuing business were virtually unchanged at Pounds 1.85bn. Operating profits from continuing operations were Pounds 281.7m (Pounds 280.7m) and total operating profits were Pounds 272.1m (Pounds 292.6m). Interest charges were Pounds 33.5m (Pounds 40.3m). Earnings fell to 25.16p (37.9p) on an FRS 3 basis or 40.51p (41.76p) on SSAP 6. Operating profits in the UK rose 2.2 per cent to Pounds 70.1m, with improved productivity raising margins from 18.8 to 19.7 per cent. In the rest of Europe profits fell from Pounds 79.1m to Pounds 71.6m as recession began to affect the business. North American profits fell 5.5 per cent to Pounds 39.6m as the costs of launching a new electric air freshener cut the margin. Profits from Australasia and Asia fell from Pounds 42.3m to Pounds 40.5m, despite strong growth in south-east Asia. Profits from Africa rose by a third to Pounds 28.2m and from Latin America by 14.6 per cent to Pounds 31.7m. Mr Iain Dobbie, finance director, said exchange rate moves had added Pounds 58.1m to its foreign currency borrowings, though the profit and loss account, which uses average rates, had hardly been affected. There should be a significant currency benefit this year. COMMENT Reckitt's solidity is ideal in recessions. The new strategy, first outlined last year, appears sensible. And the conservatism of the management is comforting. However, unlike Colman's mustard, the shares are not going to light fires in investors' hearts for a while. Once the brand promotion strategy begins to come through to profits, though, the shares should do well, especially with the progressive dividend policy. Forecasts are in the Pounds 280m to Pounds 290m area, for a p/e of about 13.5.</p>

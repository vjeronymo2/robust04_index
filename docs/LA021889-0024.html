			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORALITY AND LYLE WHEELER'S MISSING OSCARS  </P> <P> I too am searching for a lost Oscar -- the one presented to my uncle, Victor  Young, in 1956 for his original musical score for "Around the World in 80  Days."  </P> <P> Because I am now the only living blood relative of Victor Young, I want the  Oscar for me and for my children and their children.  </P> <P> No one can put a price on the Oscar; it means more than money to me. My uncle  was a pioneer in the field of motion picture music -- the originator of movie  theme songs such as "Golden Earrings," "Stella by Starlight," "Love Letters"  and "When I Fall in Love."  </P> <P> BOBBIE HILL FROMBERG  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Unions back Labour links THE LEADERS of six of Britain's largest trade unions stressed yesterday that they want to avoid any confrontation with Labour leader Mr John Smith at this autumn's party conference over the issue of union-party links. They met yesterday in an attempt to hammer out an agreement on principles for the relationship between the unions and the Labour party. The leaders represent the Transport and General Workers, the GMB general union, the Public Employees, MSF the technicians union, UCW the communications union and RMT, the main rail union. The union leaders do not accept one member, one vote for the selection of Labour parliamentary candidates. They are meeting again next week to try to find an alternative. All agreed to back a demand by Mr Bill Morris, the TGWU's general secretary, for the publication of a joint union statement emphasising why the union links are essential for the Labour party. Other union leaders, however, are concerned about a draft of the proposed statement Mr Morris wants to have approved at today's executive meeting of Trade Unionists for Labour (TUFL), the party's trade union funding body. The draft statement says 'Labour's individual membership is small' and those that belong to the party are 'unrepresentative of Labour voters as a whole'. The draft says it is 'the affiliated unions that give the party a much broader, more representative base and a wider appeal among electors'. The number of women joining unions in Britain rose last year as union membership fell to less than a third of the employed workforce, statistics published yesterday in the Employment Gazette show. In 1992 female union membership rose by 20,000, taking it to 3.7m. Male membership fell 382,000 to 5.8m.</p>

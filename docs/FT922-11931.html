			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Technology: Iranians build their own software house The Islamic Republic of Iran is hardly the most natural setting for cutting-edge computer software development. But if your language is rarely spoken beyond native shores and the US has refused to trade openly with you for a decade, you have little choice but to do the work yourself. Pajoohesh, a systems design company in Teheran, has developed a comprehensive Persian language environment to support any well-known word processing or accounting package. Four years' development has produced an impressive array of tools, from an English-Persian dictionary with a choice of 20 different technical vocabularies, to accounting and graphics programs. Each package comes with a one-touch switch from English to Persian script and back. While Iran's software industry is still embryonic, prospects for expansion look good. Iran's private sector is overcoming its initial reluctance to computerise and is showing interest in the new software. 'It's a very young market but it has been growing steadily,' said Kaveh Salehi, technical manager at the Teheran Computer Centre. Five main operators compete in a country-wide market estimated at Rials 10bn (Pounds 4m). Ebrahim Kojouri, of Pajoohesh, predicts the size of the market will quadruple during this coming Iranian year (March 1992-March 1993). 'We have so many orders that we may not be able to fill them all,' he said. Prices of Pajoohesh's products range from Rials 80,000 (Pounds 32) for the dictionary to a full English-Persian office organiser at Rials 250,000. But the company's proudest achievement is a CD-Rom containing the entire Koran in sight and sound. Using an IBM scanner and voice card, which the company also sells, Pajoohesh has linked a taped rendition of the Koran sung in Arabic with a full-colour graphic of the decorated text. By adding a Persian translation with an authentic mullah's lilt, the user can choose a chapter and verse from any part of the full 48 hours. The company has also incorporated the voice card into its dictionary package. Designed for Iranians doing business overseas, it will pronounce (with an American accent) a word typed in English and give a full definition in Persian. A facility is also available for word processing packages which offers a Persian definition for any highlighted word. The fledgling industry has so far been plagued by pirates. Iran has no copyright laws and many packages are copied and distributed without licence within a purchasing company. Illicit operators also copy unprotected software, undercutting the developers' costs and selling cheaply to the end-user. Some companies have suggested a copyright law to the government but few believe it could be effectively enforced. At the moment the computer culture is almost non-existent in Iran. Imported hardware is prohibitively expensive for private individuals, though lucrative for importers who can exploit a healthy free market rate for the Rial. The country's pri-vate sector is still experimenting with computerisation and the biggest buyer by far is the Iranian government. But Teheran-based Maskan Bank recently invested Rials 7m in Persian software and other banks are likely to follow suit. Many young Iranians are exposed to computers at university and most emerge computer literate. As they take jobs in Iranian companies, they are expected to demand modern computer facilities. Most software researchers receive initial instruction abroad or at Teheran's Institute of Technology but their research techniques are self-taught. While Pajoohesh's research has been innovative, future development will be slow without the resources of a foreign backer. To complement its Persian-English software, the company is planning a CD-format introduction to Iran aimed at foreign businessmen, combining 10,000 photographs with a spoken commentary. Pajoohesh and other Iranian computer companies are on show until April 26 at the second Electricity, Electronics, Computer and Communications Fair in Teheran.</p>

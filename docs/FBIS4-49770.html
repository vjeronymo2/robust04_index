			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 11 (AFP)--Chinese Foreign Trade  Minister Wu Yi launched a thinly veiled attack Wednesday on the  United States for politicising trade issues in a keynote speech  mapping out China's trade strategy for the 1990s.    Describing the next seven years as a "crucial period", Wu  outlined plans to shift the focus of China's export production,  narrow regional economic disparities in the country and complete  the construction of a legal framework governing foreign trade by  1997.    She made the speech at an international symposium organised  by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations.    While China is committed to the "extremely heavy and arduous  task" of economic development, Wu said progress was being  threatened by countries exerting economic pressures for  political ends.    "Some countries politicise economic issues and follow  unilateralism," Wu said in a clear reference to China's  long-running MFN-human rights debate with the United States.  "They often exert pressures on their trading partners with  unilateral measures, which pose a direct threat to the operation  of the multilateral trade system and is also detrimental to  China's foreign economic and trade development," she said.    Despite strenuous objections fom Beijing, Washington has  made  the renewal of China's most-favoured-nation (MFN) trade status  in June conditional on progress in human rights.    Wu also made it clear that trade disputes with Beijing could  penalise other countries, predicting that total imports to China  in the next seven years "may well reach one trillion dollars."    In a further statement clearly directed at Washington, Wu  thanked "most" members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT) for supporting China's bid to re-enter the world  trade body. However, she added that China "hopes that a certain  contracting party will really fulfill its commitment and support  China's return to GATT with real actions."    While the United States has voiced its backing for China's  readmission, Beijing has accused Washington of setting overly  demanding requirements and allowing the MFN issue to hamper the  negotiating process. "I hope our trade partners will adopt an  objective and fair attitude towards Chinese exports, earnestly  abide by international trade rules and practices and eliminate  discriminatory treatment against China," Wu added. China has  made enormous efforts to facilitate re-entry to GATT, Wu said,  highlighting "remarkable market access improvement and  considerable rise of transparency in foreign trade regime."    Wu met here Tuesday with GATT secretary general Peter  Sutherland, who made it clear that China must provide more  concrete assurances on the issues of transparency and market  access if it is to rejoin GATT by year's end.    She said priority would be given over the next seven years  to  realising the transition from light industrial products and  textiles as the main exports to machinery, and electronic, heavy  industrial and chemical products.    "We also intend to establish a relatively complete system of  foreign economic and trade legislation within a period of three  years or so," she said.    At the same time, "more attention and support" will be given  to inland areas through the adoption of preferential policies  that will allow them to close the gap on the economically  developed coastal regions.</p>

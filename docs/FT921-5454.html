			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / International Company News: Bank of Spain steps in to rescue Banco Ibercorp THE BANK of Spain was yesterday forced to rescue Banco Ibercorp, an investment house linked to several prominent members of the country's financial establishment. Financial regulators moved quickly following a series of damaging allegations in the Spanish press and the breakdown of takeover negotiations between Ibercorp and Banco Inversion, a rival financial services institution. The Bank of Spain said it was intervening in order to 'prevent the grave financial deterioration' of Ibercorp and to safeguard shareholders' interests. Ibercorp's mutual fund deposits have reportedly dropped from Pta3.9bn (Dollars 37.8m) to Pta1.1bn, and it has been unable to renew credit lines on the interbank market. At the centre of the Ibercorp scandal are allegations that the institution engaged in insider dealing and protected a privileged group of shareholders, among whom were several prominent public figures. Yesterday's intervention is especially embarrassing for the governor of the Bank of Spain, Mr Mariano Rubio, whose share portfolio was handled by Mr Manuel de la Concha, Ibercorp's co-chairman and a close friend of Mr Rubio. Mr Rubio presented his resignation two weeks ago but it was turned down by the government. He then attempted to find a buyer for Ibercorp. Several leading retail banks turned down the offer. The conservative opposition party, Partido Popular, has accused the government of 'covering up' the potential political impact of the collapse by blocking a parliamentary inquiry into the affair. The ruling Socialist party had earlier said that an inquiry was unnecessary because Ibercorp's stockbroking activities were already under investigation by the CMNV, the securities watchdog. Banco Inversion's last-minute initiative failed in part because banks refused to offer Inversion sufficient credit guarantees to mount the takeover. Ibercorp's book value was also called into question.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Indonesia (16): Committed deregulator - Manuela Saragosa interviews the minister for trade and industry Mr Hartarto was promoted to be Indonesia's co-ordinating minister for trade and industry last year after serving as minister of industry for two consecutive terms. He explains the government's policy on deregulation of the economy. Question: The government is working on a trade deregulation package to complement its hosting of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) conference later this year. Could you give any hints as to what might be expected in this package? Answer: The deregulation package is actually linked with a trend in the world for globalisation. It is a basic need to further deregulate the economy. As you know, we are always implementing prudent macro-economic management. That is very important, and then to enable our economic growth we emphasise investment and exports. On investment we have recently issued new regulations which will hopefully boost foreign investment and this is also linked to the restructuring of the economies of certain countries in this region such as Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Australia. We have to compete globally. The latest deregulation package is not enough. We must also deregulate export and import procedures and then deregulate tariffs. This will also be announced very soon because we have to comply with Asean's (Association of South East Asian Nations) free trade requirements and also Gatt (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) requirements. Unilaterally, we will reduce our tariffs, probably in the near future. The final tariffs will be between 0 and 5 per cent. And then we also will remove, hopefully, all the non-tariff barriers. Q: How much of a threat are the economies of Vietnam, China and India to Indonesia? A: We should not think about threats. What we have to do is deregulate the economy and I do believe that investors take note of the experience of Indonesia in the past 25 years during which we have been able to maintain 6.6 per cent growth on average every year. So this is actually a trust which we can use to attract more investment. Q: The petrochemical, aircraft manufacturing and agricultural sectors remain highly regulated. Do you foresee any changes in these sectors? A: Certain areas of agriculture are still protected but we have to follow the rules. They cover six commodities, such as rice, soyabeans, cloves, white onions. But we have to change. Q: Many sectors of the economy are dominated by well-connected businessmen. Do you think that deregulating them could evolve into a big political battle? A: No. We have to deregulate every sector, reducing tariffs. Q: The government recently announced some drastic changes to restrictions on foreign investment in Indonesia, but opening up the media sector to foreigners was not well-received. Did you expect such a reaction? A: Well, from the beginning the media sector was not opened. Explanation was rather late and that created the reaction. When the team explained about the latest deregulation package they did not explain fully that media was not included. Q: Foreign investors here complain that while the government is committed to deregulation, they often have to fight with a bureaucracy that does not have the same intentions as ministers. How will you tackle this problem? A: The next deregulation package will follow this up. Hopefully it will be issued very soon. They are now working on that. It will deal with new investment, foreign investment, domestic investment, export and import procedures. Q: When can that package be expected? A: Within this month or next. Q: There appears to be a real urgency about it. A: Yes, it is urgent. It is for our own sake. Q: What sparked off this urgency? A: The fact that we had problems with our domestic banking system. The requirements for capital investment for the next six years are so huge and we have to maintain growth of 6.5 per cent. So we have to do this. Q: How important do you think high technology industries such as aircraft manufacturing and ship building are to Indonesia's economic development? A: This is of strategic value and so we maintain we have to develop these sectors also. But as far as ship-building is concerned, it is not only relying on the state but also on the private sector. We are not only exporting textiles and shoes, we are also exporting capital goods, something that is not well-known. We are exporting paper plants to Iran and Iraq, turnkey plants to Northern Ireland and France, chemical plants to China. We have the engineers to do that. We are exporting ships, which cost Dollars 55m each, to Sweden. We are also exporting helicopters. Q: There has been much talk and controversy surrounding the development of a nuclear power industry in Indonesia. How likely do you think it is that Indonesia will build a nuclear power reactor? A: Our power requirements for the next six years are the same as required during the past 25 years. So it means that power requirements need to be developed and relying on thermal power only is not sufficient. We have to go nuclear one day. There is no doubt about it. Q: What role will foreign capital play in domestic power generation? A: Mostly we will rely on foreign investment. Once we agree on the transfer price on the power entering our national grid system I think it will be clear enough. Q: Indonesia has embarked on a policy to privatise many of its state-owned industries, and privatisation of the telecommunications industry is already under way. What is the next step in this process and what other sectors will be included? A: Sectors which have good prospects. Those sectors which have good returns and reliable returns. State-owned companies are among the biggest taxpayers in this country.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vienna, March 24 (AFP) -- Visiting Slovenian  President Milan Kucan warned Thursday [24 March] of the  emergence of a two-speed Europe, saying the split between a  highly developed West and underdeveloped East spelt increased  danger.    In a speech to the Austrian parliament in Vienna, Kucan said  "two or three Europes" could emerge, including a "para-Europe"  of which Russia would be the prime component, which would be  distinct from the European Union and those states hoping to join  it.    Kucan, speaking during a one-day visit, said the Russian  presence in parts of former Yugoslavia may signal the creation  of two separate "Byzantine" and "West" European civilisations.    The divergence between East and West Europe was becoming  "more and more dangerous," Kucan warned.    The president of the former Yugoslav republic also met  Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and his Austrian counterpart Thomas  Klestil.    Kucan backed Austria's planned admission to the European  Union, adding that he expected Slovenia to receive the same  support for its own eventual membership.</p>

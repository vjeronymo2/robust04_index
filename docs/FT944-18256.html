			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (9): Markets approach saturation - Christopher Parkes examines restructuring tactics in Germany The recent downgrading of Daimler-Benz's long-term debt by the Standard &amp; Poor's ratings agency came as an unnecessary but timely reminder for the German automotive industry that this year's expected recovery in profits, however welcome, has yet to be underpinned by an enduring improvement in competitiveness. As S&amp;P said, despite a 6.8 per cent increase in European car registrations in the first half, long-term demand growth was likely to slow as markets approached saturation. At the same time, increasing economic integration within the region, the erosion of world trade barriers and intensifying price competition would probably heighten the impact of future ups and downs in the economic cycle. Profits are set to increase across the board this year after last year's slump into losses by all but BMW, and most analysts expect further improvements as the end of the decade approaches and the savings wrought by rationalisation in the past two years show up. The most striking change in German factories has been on the shop floor, where automotive company's workforces have been slashed and reorganised. From a peak of 788,000 employees in July 1991, the industry had reduced its headcount by 150,000 in July this year, and a further 50,000 jobs are scheduled to go. Team working and continuous improvement processes have become commonplace methods of increasing productivity. BMW, earliest into restructuring and the most advanced down the road to modern production methods, has managed a job-cutting programme which started in 1989 through natural wastage and limited early retirement. Flexible working times, short-term contracts for production workers and weekend shifts have been introduced to cope with fluctuations in demand. This policy reflects BMW's determination to establish a new order in its domestic manufacturing processes. In short, long-term investments in domestic fixed plant will be based on long-term prospects and plans, while short-term demand shifts will be countered by the flexible use of manpower. But even the most bright-eyed optimists recognise that the savings to be gained from cutting and shuffling staff and reordering working methods are not enough to compensate for Germany's ingrained labour cost disadvantages. In the most extreme instances, each DM1 in basic pay is supplemented by a further 80 pfennigs in tax, health, and statutory and voluntary welfare and social benefit contributions. One common response has been an increase in foreign components sourcing - a possibility enhanced by the development of market economies in relatively low-wage countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic - which has increased the estimated average proportion of non-German parts built into German-made vehicles from 25 per cent in 1992 to about 35 per cent this year. There is also an accelerating trend towards outsourcing of components formerly made within car manufacturers' works to specialist suppliers which can increase their economies of scale and reduce unit costs. Hence, for example, Mercedes-Benz's recent decision to hand over seat construction at its Bremen works to Leister Recaro. Even more significant is the emergence of new partnerships between vehicle makers and their suppliers which is creating a new hierarchical structure among components makers. Accordingly, Mercedes has in the past two months set up two trend-setting joint ventures dedicated to supplying Mercedes and outside customers with key component modules. Accordingly, its future supplies of complete power steering units will be supplied from an operation set up with and to be operated by ZF. Volkswagen has said it may join in later. Mercedes has also bundled its engine valve systems manufacture, currently focused in a factory in Bad Homburg, into a separate arrangement with two parts suppliers in a three-sided operation to be known as MWP. But the most telling change in German management thinking has been wrought by the realisation that its traditional sales ground, western Europe, is virtually saturated. Average annual growth for the next few years may reach 2.5 per cent, according to some estimates, but average expansion for the 1990s as a whole is expected to be only 1 to 2 per cent. According to Achim Diekmann, chief executive of the VDA industry association, the situation in the 1980s when 90 per cent of world market growth sprang from Europe, the US and Japan, has been virtually reversed in the 1990s with 70 per cent coming from the Asean region, newly-industrialised countries and Latin America. While motor vehicle sales in Latin America alone are expected to double to 5m units a year by 2000, the VDA estimates that vehicle output in Asia - a mere 2m units in 1990 - will have increased four-fold by the end of the decade. As has been recognised in other German boardrooms in other industries, the chances of carving out a substantial share of such markets via exports out of high-cost Germany are slim. The upshot has been an acceleration in the flow of capital investment into the developing regions. Announcements of joint ventures in assembly and to a lesser extent full-scale manufacturing are becoming regular occurrences. Although over-shadowed in terms of scale by such investments as BMW's and Mercedes' first US manufacturing plants, due to open shortly, the trend is now clearly set. Mercedes, targeting the Chinese bus market, has three joint manufacturing ventures under development or study. In India it has a majority stake in a new concern to manufacture E-Class executive saloons. Volkswagen was early into the Chinese car market and is now enjoying rapid sales growth. But it has had less luck elsewhere as continuing shake-outs at its ventures in Spain's Seat and Skoda demonstrate. Autolatina, a collaborative venture between VW and Ford in Brazil is also on the verge of restructuring. Meanwhile, its arch rival in the German market, Adam Opel, is stretching its wings into every accessible corner of the emerging global market for passenger cars. A network of Opel assembly plants stretching from Poland to Indonesia is being established around a central hub at the company's Russelsheim technical development centre near Frankfurt. While other German manufacturers' plans appear less clearly defined, they share the same logical basis as Opel's: while their high domestic costs and the expensive D-Mark militate fiercely against exports, Germany's high reputation for technical excellence is the passport which will give them a fighting chance in the new markets needed to secure their long-term future.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Selection of Format for the Proposed Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The February 11, 1991 NSPS described a format for MWC acid gases (SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and HCl), MWC metals (PM and opacity), MWC organics (dioxins/furans), MWC operating practices (CO, load, and flue gas temperature at the PM control device inlet) and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and that same format is being adopted by today's proposed NSPS except for dioxins/furans. The selection of the format for the standards for the above pollutants, is described in previous  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notices (54 FR 52251, December 20, 1989 and 56 FR 5488, February 11, 1991). The specific formats of the proposed standards for Cd, Pb, and Hg are discussed below. For dioxins/furans, the revised format is in units of either TEQ or total mass dioxin/furans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As required by section 129(a)(4) of the Act, the proposed standards would establish numerical limitations for Cd, Pb, and Hg. For the purpose of regulating Cd and Pb, the format selected in the proposed NSPS for the numerical emission limitations would be numerical concentration limits (mg/dscm) at 7 percent O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . For the purpose of regulating Hg, the format selected would be both a numerical concentration limit (mg/dscm) and an alternative percentage reduction requirement. The numerical Hg emission limit reflects the emission level that can be achieved based on activated carbon injection in combination with SD/FF controls. An alternative Hg percentage reduction requirement may be met instead of the numerical emission limit because emissions of Hg can be highly variable and dependent on the Hg input level. Even at the same MWC, test data show occasional spikes of high Hg emissions due to variability in the waste feed. In cases where Hg levels are temporarily elevated, the 0.080 mg/dscm level may not be consistently achievable; however, the control devices could achieve the 85-percent reduction during such episodes. Therefore, a combination of a concentration limit and an optional percentage reduction format best assures the maximum achievable Hg control while accommodating potential spikes in Hg emission levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, the proposed standards for SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , HCl, and Hg include two formats: (1) a percent reduction format, and (2) an emission limit (concentration) format. The EPA requests comment on and test data supporting the appropriateness of promulgating final standards for SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , HCl, and Hg which include only the emission limit format. For each pollutant, the commenter should specify an appropriate emission limit (without an associated alternative percent reduction format) and provide rationale for the limit. Based on the comments received, the EPA may promulgate final standards for SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , HCl, and Hg in the form of emission limits that are higher or lower than the proposed emission limits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA has proposed emission limits that reflect the performance levels achieved by MWC's equipped with properly designed, constructed, and operated air pollution control systems. The proposed standards would apply during all periods of MWC operation. To comply with the proposed standards, the air pollution control system would be designed and operated such that actual emissions are less than the proposed emission limits. Where continuous monitoring systems are available, such as for SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the proposal would require their use to determine compliance on a continuous basis. For other pollutants, an annual stack test would be required. The EPA requests comment on whether continuous monitoring methods exist for any additional pollutants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA also seeks comments on alternate formats of the standard that would encourage optimal control system operation and optimal performance, thus minimizing emissions. For example, the standard could provide incentives, such as reduced testing and reporting, for MWC's that operate well below the emission limit. One approach would be to structure the standard such that, for an MWC with multiple units, if all units demonstrated emissions at least 30 percent less than the limit, then only one of the units would be tested each year. The unit selected for testing would be rotated such that each unit would be tested during its rotational cycle (e.g., once every three years, for an MWC plant with three units).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another potential regulatory approach to assure optimal performance would be to supplement the current emission limits (which must be demonstrated by annual stack tests) with more stringent emission limits calculated for each pollutant based on long-term average emission levels. Compliance with this supplemental limit would be determined by continuous monitoring, where applicable, or by the average of the annual emissions tests from the current year and one or more preceding years. The current limits account for variability from one emissions test to another, whereas the composite average emission limits would reflect the mean performance level over the life of the plant. This may be a preferable measure of environmental performance for some of the pollutants because it is their long term or cumulative emissions that are of most concern. Other formats of the standard that encourage optimal performance would also be possible. Comments and suggestions are requested. Based on the information and comments received, the EPA may change the form of the rule to include a long term emissions average, an alternative compliance testing schedule, or other alternative format to encourage optimal performance of the air pollution control system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

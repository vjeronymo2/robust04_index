			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Jamaica PM calls poll for March 30 MR P J PATTERSON, prime minister of Jamaica, has called a general election for March 30, eleven months before it is constitutionally due. He said he was seeking his own popular mandate, a year after he took office on the resignation of Mr Michael Manley. The early election, however, appears to have been determined by opinion polls showing a healthy lead for the incumbent People's National Party. Last month, polls gave the PNP a 12-point lead over the opposition Jamaica Labour Party, led by Mr Edward Seaga, a former prime minister. The JLP started to campaign a fortnight ago after indications that Mr Patterson was considering a snap election. The main issue in the campaign will be the economy of the Caribbean island of 2.3m. Mr Patterson's administration has continued the programme of extensive deregulation started by Mr Manley, including the liberalisation of the island's foreign currency market. Mr Seaga has argued, though, that the government has gone overboard in deregulating the economy and was abandoning some of its responsibilities. The incumbent party's support has been lifted in recent months by indications of stability in the economy. The Jamaican dollar has depreciated rapidly after its flotation 18 months ago, and inflation for the first nine months of the current fiscal year was 17.9 per cent, against 73.1 per cent for the equivalent period of the last fiscal year.</p>

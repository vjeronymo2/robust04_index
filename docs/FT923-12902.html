			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Gatt rules against US in cement dumping row A GATT dispute panel has recommended the US return millions of dollars in anti-dumping duties that it wrongly imposed upon Mexican cement producers. The still-unannounced ruling - under the anti-dumping code of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) - comes as the US and Mexico, along with Canada, are in the final stages of negotiating a free trade agreement. The cement case will be closely watched in Mexico and Canada for evidence that the US is prepared to abide by international rulings. The decision by the Gatt panel - if accepted by the US - would mean a big victory for the Mexican cement companies, principally Cementos Mexicanos (Cemex), the largest Mexican cement exporter. The anti-dumping decision helped reduce Cemex's exports to 1.4m tonnes last year from 2.26m tonnes in 1990. Cemex redirected many of its exports to Asia at low margins. The panel finding did not address the question of whether or not Mexican companies had 'dumped' or sold at 'less than fair value' cement and cement clinker, but it ruled that not enough US companies had come forward to support the complaint. It was brought in the US as a regional injury case, supported by 61.7 per cent of the producers in parts of an 11-state region. The panel found that 'US authorities did not satisfy themselves prior to initiation that the petition was on behalf of producers of all or almost all of the production in the regional market.' Cemex had been, in 1989, the largest exporter of cement to the US, accounting for 28 per cent of the total. Under the terms of the anti-dumping suit, Mexican companies had to pay 58 per cent duties on their exports to the US. Cemex was operating at 81 per cent of capacity at the end of 1991, mainly in meeting demand at home, so it may have only small scope to expand exports. In the longer run, though, the decision should benefit Cemex, which plans to spend Dollars 1bn to increase output by 35 per cent in three years.</p>

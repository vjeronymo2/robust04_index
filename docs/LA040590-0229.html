			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WATERFORD CRAFTSMEN STRIKE OVER BONUS  </P> <P> Ireland's world-renowned Waterford crystal workers today staged the first  all-out strike in their history amid fears that the company's craftsmen could  lose their glass-cutting jobs to Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> All 2,300 workers at Waterford's three plants went on strike over management  cost-cutting plans at the debt-ridden firm, hit hard by a slump in its crucial  American and British markets.  </P> <P> The workers, who say they are scapegoats for chronic mismanagement, put down  their tools when the company stopped bonus payments for 500 glass cutters.  </P> <P> Waterford chief executive Paddy Galvin warned that the lifeblood is being  drained out of the company after three consecutive loss-making years.  </P> <P> "The future of the company is in the balance. We are not in a viable situation.  Seventy percent of our costs are labor costs. The cost of our product has gone  too high," he said.  </P> <P> Waterford parliamentarian Austin Deasy said there is a real danger now that the  company will consider moving production to East Germany or Czechoslovakia,  which have work forces skilled in glass-cutting.  </P> <P> "Investors in my view are not too concerned where the glass is manufactured as  long as they get a dividend from their investment," he said.  </P> <P> Galvin said it would grieve him to move the company out of Ireland but he told  reporters: "If we can't produce our products at a price we can sell to the  marketplace, we might be forced into this situation."  </P> <P> A union spokesman angrily condemned the suggestion, saying: "This is an empty  threat."  </P> <P> Last month a group of investors led by Tony O'Reilly, the Irish-born chairman  of U.S. food giant H. J. Heinz, and New York investment bank Morgan Stanley  &amp; Co. took a 29.9% stake in the Waterford Wedgwood crystal and china group.  </P> <P> Waterford took control of the British china maker Wedgwood in a 1986 takeover  that united two of the most prestigious "table-top" names in the world of  luxury goods.  </P></p>

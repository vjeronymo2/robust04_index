			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Washington life takes its toll of Clinton's team: Two aides who will be staying home after Thanksgiving Thanksgiving is the ultimate American holiday because far more than any other, including Christmas, it reunites families. The Wednesday before and the Sunday after it are the year's busiest travel days. For 96 hours, the country pretty much shuts down. Even the hyperactive President Bill Clinton and his family are ensconced for today's holiday in Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains he is said not to like very much. Before leaving he shared the traditional turkey at a Washington church hall providing free dinners for those without homes or families to go to. There is a particular poignancy at this Thanksgiving for Mr Clinton and those who sweat loyally for him. For he has just lost two senior members of his team - Mr Howard Paster, White House head of congressional liaison, and Mr Roy Neel, deputy chief of the White House staff - who have declared that they want to spend more time with their families than one turkey dinner might allow. It might seem odd that they should go after the great Nafta triumph for which both, with Mr Paster particularly visible, worked so hard. But for once this classic political excuse may be valid and no one in Washington, an eternally suspicious town, was seriously questioning it this week. Mr Paster put it best. 'There are no recesses or weekends. The beeper and the phone respect no private time. And we have added a new standard of intensity.' For those with children and, as in his case, a spouse with her own career, balancing the priorities of life can get skewed, as the suicide of Vincent Foster, Mr Clinton's old friend and legal counsel, horribly demonstrated this summer. Mr Clinton, like President Jimmy Carter before him, has publicly urged his staff to take more time off, but he takes little himself - 10 days on Cape Cod this summer and regular games of golf notwithstanding - and nor does his highly professional wife, Hillary. They both reckon they have a lot to do and not much time to do it in. Similar motivation inspires the White House staff, many very young and more than willing, given the chance of a lifetime, to put in the seven-day weeks, 15-hour days, that have become routine. Most of their favourite bars and cafes are those that stay open very late and their attendance at private dinner parties around town can never be guaranteed. Mr Paster and Mr Neel, both Washington veterans, knew what they were letting themselves in for and ultimately got out, without apparent regrets. Yet they will be replaced by people of comparable experience, like Mr Harold Ickes, the experienced New York operator whose own political lineage includes a father who was FDR's interior secretary.</p>

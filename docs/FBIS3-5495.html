The 2000cc RAV4 model will be introduced domestically after  May and on the European market in summer, Toyota officials said.    They refrained from revealing the price, but industry  sources  project it will be around 2 million yen in Japan.    The new model marks the first subcompact off-road car  offered  by Toyota, which has previously marketed the cars with larger  capacity, the officials said.    The smaller off-road cars have gained popularity among young  people because they can also be easily driven about town.    Suzuki Motor Corp. has enjoyed monthly sales of more than  1,000 units of such cars.</p>

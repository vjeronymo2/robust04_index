			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias, 14 Jun (PL) -- Cuban President  Fidel Castro met with Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez  here today at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit. The Cuban  president arrived for the meeting at 0700 dressed in civilian  clothes. He wore a white long-sleeved guayabera shirt, which is  Cuba's typical dress.    The revolutionary leader's appearance in public without his  classic olive drab uniform, which he has worn since the struggle  in the Sierra Maestra mountains, caused a veritable commotion  among the virtually 1,000 reporters covering the conference. It  was undoubtedly one of the most important news stories of the  summit's opening day.    After meeting with Felipe Gonzalez, the Cuban president left  for the summit, which was to begin with the participation of 22  heads of state and government of Latin America, Spain, and  Portugal, in addition to the vice president of the Dominican  Republic.    PRENSA LATINA learned during a conversation today with Cuban  Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina that President Fidel Castro  will participate in the entire program of the summit and will  also hold bilateral talks with other presidents and  personalities.    This confirmed that Castro will meet with Chilean President  Eduardo Frei on 16 June and that Castro is arranging meetings  with five other chiefs of state. There is also a possibility  that he will meet with businessmen, congressmen, and  representatives of organizations that have expressed solidarity  with Cuba.</p>

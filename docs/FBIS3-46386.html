This system will play a positive role in stepping up the  pace of linking China's economy with the world economy, and in  restoring China's status as a contracting party of GATT at an  early date.    To open wider to the outside world, China canceled import  permits, quotas, and control on some products as well as  readjusted and reduced tariff rates on 3,371 taxable items and  products in the past year, 1993. Also spurred by its speedy  economic growth, China imported machinery and electronic  products worth $49.46 billion in 1993, up 41.7 percent from  1992, and far higher than the 29-percent growth of total  imports. The total import value of machinery and electronic  products accounted for 47.6 percent of the total, up 5  percentage points from the previous year. With the State  Council's approval, China officially promulgated the  "Provisional Rules Governing the Import of Machinery and  Electronic Products" in the fourth quarter of last year and, in  the meantime, formulated the supporting "Catalogue of Products  Subject to Quotas," "Catalogue of Specific Products," and  corresponding rules for implementation. Thus, a new system  governing the import of machinery and electronic products was  preliminarily formed.    According to Xu Bingjin, who is in charge of the State  Machinery Import and Export Office, this new management system  has brought about significant reform in four aspects:    1. It has largely shrunk the scope of management on the  import of machinery and electronic products, and regulated  import mainly through quotas, tariffs, openly inviting tenders,  and means conforming to international practice. The  internationally accepted import quota system will be imposed on  a handful of key machinery and electronic products -- the 18  products include automobiles, motorcycles, video cameras,  computers, and air conditioners -- which will seriously harm the  development of relevant industries, and directly affect the  readjustment of industrial structure and product mix in China if  they are imported excessively. The 171 kinds of machinery and  electronic products, in which China has invested a great sum of  capital to develop and manufacture or has imported the  technology to produce them and which are still at an early stage  of industrial production and need to speed up their development,  will be placed in the catalogue of specific products, whose  import will mainly be done through international bidding.  Meanwhile, the rules on machinery and electronic products  temporarily banned from import, and the import permit system for  them, all statements of import substitution and relevant  measures, the catalogue of products imported under unified and  centralized planning, the catalogue of controlled import goods,  and the regulatory tax on imported machinery and electronic  products have been canceled. It is estimated that if the  aforementioned significant lessening in administration is  realized, the proportion of import value of state-controlled  machinery and electronic products to China's total import value  will drop under 10 percent.    2. It has simplified the import procedures by canceling the  system of examining and approving the import of machinery and  electronic products according to quotas, and establishing an  automatic registration system which not only conforms to the  international practice but also is conducive to strengthening  macroeconomic regulation and control.    3. It has increased the transparency of import management.  All policies and measures involving import management will be  released in time. In addition, all the old documents concerning  import management will be screened according to the new  management measures; those incompatible with the new measures  will be abolished, and those requiring revision or continuing to  be enforced will also be announced.    4. According to the GATT rules, it has set up a system of  indemnification measures to eliminate or reduce the harm or  threat of harm to relevant domestic industries when certain  products are increased sharply. Where necessary, temporary  measures to limit the import of certain products will be taken  according to the relevant rules of GATT and legal procedures of  the state.    Xu Bingjin told this reporter: From now on, the State  Machinery Import and Export Office will focus its work on  strengthening overall import management, examination, and  supervision of key products in the catalogues of controlled  items. As for this year's overall import regulation and  control, it will emphasize readjusting the import structure,  ensuring the needs for construction of the state's basic  industries and infrastructure and the technical transformation  of large and medium-sized state enterprises, continuing to  control the import of consumer goods, supporting the import of  advanced technology and equipment, and supporting  export-oriented projects.</p>

			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / British food aid delayed by Russian red tape A Russian-built Antonov aircraft waits on the tarmac at Stansted Airport, Essex, unable to load nearly 300 tons of meat to help ease Russia's food crisis. The British Ministry of Agriculture said yesterday the flight, which was postponed yesterday for the second time, had been 'delayed because of Russian red tape': Russian officials had been seeking assurances the meat was not contaminated by 'mad cow' disease.</p>

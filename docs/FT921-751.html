			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peruvian mine to be privatised THE CONDESTABLE mine, which produces about 4,000 tonnes of fine copper concentrate a year, is to be Peru's first wholly state-owned mining concern to be sold off to the private sector. Mineroperu's 100 per cent holding will be offered on the Lima stock exchange between 27 April and 8 May. Condestable has been in state hands since 1976 when its previous Japanese owners (Nippon Mining, Mitsui and Hidemasa Kubo Fukomara), decided it was no longer worth exploiting. Since then, however, it has become one of the Peruvian state's few mining success stories - at least in relative terms - having turned in profits almost every year. According to Mr Luis Palacios, Condestable's general manager, the mine - one third open pit and two-thirds underground - has above average productivity despite its relatively low grade ore. The concentrator plant has capacity to treat 1,200 tonnes of ore a day and it has its own electricity generating plant. Before the privatisation announcement, the company had planned to be producing copper cathodes by 1993. Another attraction of the mine is its location only 90 km (56 miles)from the capital, Lima, and 5 km from the Panamerican Highway. Production last year totalled 3,952 tonnes of copper concentrate, bringing in revenue of around Dollars 6.3m. The company has been selling all its output recently to Brainco, the Peruvian branch of Brandeis. The cash-strapped Peruvian mining industry received a small boost with this week's announcement that the Andean Development Corporation (CAF) will provide a Dollars 20m credit line for the sector. Bladex, the Latin American Export Bank is to come up with a further Dollars 30m, mostly for mining companies, according to local sources. The Peruvian government has requested a further Dollars 200m from CAF to establish a special fund to refinance short-term company debts. Much of this would be directed to the mining sector. The credit request is due for discussion at the next CAF board meeting. A call for Cipec, the copper exporters' group, to be disbanded was made at its meeting in Paris yesterday by Chile's mining minister, who cited dwindling membership and lack of income.</p>

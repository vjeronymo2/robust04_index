			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Arab plea to cool Libya row THE ARAB League secretary-general yesterday appealed to western countries not to take hasty action in their row with Libya, writes our Middle East staff. Mr Esmat Abdel-Maguid told an emergency meeting of the Arab League, called by Libya, that he would hold extensive contacts with Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, and others. The US, Britain and France want UN sanctions against Libya unless it hands over two men suspected of the Lockerbie bombing.</p>

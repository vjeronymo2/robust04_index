Muhyi-al-Din Nimr, the spokesman of the Chamber of Commerce,  told our correspondent Moti Amir that the dignitaries asked the  officers to lift the curfew on the city and to allow the  residents to return to work and resume normal life. According  to Nimr, Major General Shahaq voiced his sorrow over the  massacre in Hebron, and said he knew that the enemies of peace  had become stronger as a result of this deed. Shahaq pointed  out that after the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement  it will also be Hebron's turn to attain Palestinian self-rule.    The dignitaries asked the IDF officers to reduce the  friction  between IDF troops and the local population in order to avert  confrontations and riots once the curfew is lifted.</p>

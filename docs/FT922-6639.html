			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / White House rejects charge of Iraq cover-up SENIOR members of the Bush administration yesterday angrily rejected Congressional charges that the White House was trying to cover up improprieties related to more than Dollars 4bn of loans to Iraq by Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro. In testimony before the House of Representatives banking committee, Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state, attacked the committee's release of classified documents which, he claimed, had led to 'distortions of the record, half-truths, and outright falsehoods, all combined into spurious conspiracy theories and charges of a cover-up.' He was referring to a series of Bush administration documents made public by Mr Henry Gonzalez, committee chairman, who has argued that the documents show a pattern of administration financial assistance to Iraq and possible knowledge of the secret BNL loans, made from the bank's branch at Atlanta, Georgia. Mr Gonzalez criticised President George Bush for failure to provide Congress with a series of BNL-related documents. In reply, Mr Eagleburger said the administration would not permit the further release of documents without fresh assurances that they would be kept confidential by Congress. Mr Eagleburger and Mr John Robson, deputy treasury secretary, testified that there had been insufficient evidence of any Iraqi wrongdoing in the BNL affair, in November 1989, for a senior White House meeting to block the extension of Dollars 1bn of separate, government-guaranteed loans to Baghdad. Mr Eagleburger stated that these US government-guaranteed loans for Iraqi purchase of US agricultural goods were seen by the Reagan and Bush administrations as a tool to moderate Iraq's President Saddam Hussein. 'It didn't work,' admitted Mr Eagleburger. Mr Edward Kelley, a member of the Federal Reserve's board of governors, made clear that, at the White House meeting, the Fed had firmly opposed more US export credit loan guarantees for Iraq because of concern about the BNL case and Iraq's credit-worthiness.</p>

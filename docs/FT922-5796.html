			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bigger silver deficit expected DEMAND FOR silver has outstripped new supply for the past two years and 1992 promises a further widening of the gap, according to the World Silver Survey 1992, published by the Silver Institute, a producers' association. But the disparity between supply and demand has failed to nudge prices upward because of large stocks held by investors. In 1991, total new supply of 495.1m troy ounces fell short by 46.2m ounces, or about 9 per cent, of total demand of 541.3m ounces. This compares with a shortfall of 37m ounces, or 7.3 per cent, between supply of 505.1m ounces and total use of 542.1m ounces in 1990. This year, a total supply is expected to be stagnant at 495.6m ounces while demand rises to 548.6m ounces, resulting in an increased deficit of 53m ounces, or 10.6 per cent. Both mine and secondary (recycled) output fell last year. Mines produced 366.6m ounces, 1 per cent less than 1990. Mine production is expected to increase just 1 per cent this year to 390m ounces. Recovery from secondary sources dropped 5.8 per cent last year, to 111.2m ounces, and will fall slightly to 111m ounces this year, the report says. Supply last year was boosted somewhat by government sales and exports from the former Soviet Union, Poland and other Eastern European countries. The bulk of 12m ounces in government disposals was from the US. Total silver fabrication demand fell marginally last year to 541.3m ounces from 542.1m ounces, largely because of the Gulf War and recession in major markets, the report said. A sharp decline in electronics and electrical products use was offset by a rise in photographic demand. Overall 1992 demand is expected to climb as major economies recover. So far this year, however, prices have stayed in a Dollars 3.90 to Dollars 4.40 range, about the same as in the latter half of last year, when prices averaged Dollars 4.03 for the full 12 months. The price was down 16 per cent in 1991 from the average of Dollars 4.82 in 1990 and has fallen steadily since 1987, when it last broke Dollars 7 for the year. Mr Jeffrey Christian, managing director of CPM Group, which prepared the report, said that stocks held by investors - which he estimated at 1bn ounces of mostly good market delivery metal - had held down prices and would continue to do so. Reported market stocks stood at 313m ounces last year. Mr Christian believes that, like the 1970s, the 1990s are shaping up as a period of deficits in the silver trade. He does not, however, expect prices to rise this year or even next year to a significant extent.</p>

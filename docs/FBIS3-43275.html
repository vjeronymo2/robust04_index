			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Monrovia, Dec 31 (AFP) -- The rebel National  Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), the country's main armed  faction, said Friday [31 December] that [it] would only disarm  its troops when transitional institutions were officially  established. This position, announced by NPFL radio, is  diametrically opposed to that of the Interim Government of  National Unity (IGNU), which has said that such institutions can  only become functional once disarmament begins.    According to the inter-factional peace accord signed by the  IGNU, the NPFL and ULIMO (United Liberation Movement) on July 25  in Cotonou, Benin, disarmament should be carried out  simultaneously with the setting up of transitional institutions.    The NPFL also contested the presence in Liberia of the  ECOMOG  [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring  Group] peacekeeping force deployed by the Economic Community of  West African States (ECOWAS), which -- assisted by the UN  Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) -- is to supervise the  disarmament process.    "Only the five-member State Council (the tripartite interim  governing body) can provisionally authorize the deployment of  foreign troops throughout the country," the NPFL said.    "For UNOMIL and ECOMOG to be deployed throughout the  country,  an agreement between the legitimate government of Liberia and  the United Nations and another between the government and ECOWAS  must be signed," it added. "Only the State Council has the  authority to order the parties to remove checkpoints, gates, and  the actual physical disarmament of all parties."    "Men, women, and ordinary citizens took up arms against the  past government because it was not representative and did not  address their concerns and grievances," said the NPFL, which was  behind the rebellion that began on December 24, 1989, against  the government of President Samuel Doe, who was assassinated in  September 1990.    "Now that they have decided upon a legitimately accepted  government in which they are represented, they are prepared to  peacefully and voluntarily surrender their arms to that  authority," it said. "Give them their government and they will  give up their arms."    In the meantime, France on Friday condemned recent attacks  against humanitarian organizations in northern Liberia, which  forced them to withdraw from the area, calling on all factions  to "show restraint."    Lucette Michauyx-Chevry, the French minister in charge of  humanitarian aid and human rights, demanded "that confiscated  materiel and equipment be returned to the organizations, that  civilian populations be protected, and that the security of  humanitarian organizations' personnel be guaranteed."    The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Medecins sans  Frontieres (MSF), and several other humanitarian organizations  announced their withdrawal from northern Lofa County on December  27, citing harassment from the armed ULIMO faction.</p>

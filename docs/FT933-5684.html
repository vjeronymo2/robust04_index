			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Insurance sales practices attacked: Building societies accused of 'unfair tie-in' of mortgages with home policies BUILDING SOCIETIES were yesterday accused of 'unjust' practices in the way that they sell home insurance policies on behalf of the UK's biggest insurance companies. Direct Line, the telephone-based insurer, makes the accusations in a report submitted to the Office of Fair Trading. It says that building societies continue unfairly to 'tie-in' the purchase of building insurance policies with mortgage agreements. The report also accuses societies of not providing sufficient information about charges to their customers. It says this would enable them to shop around for cheaper policies. Direct Line, the Royal Bank of Scotland subsidiary launched in 1986, sells more than 1m motor insurance policies and is now aiming to break into the Pounds 4bn a year home insurance market. Ms Jane Dickson, company secretary of Direct Line, said: 'If consumers knew that in some cases up to a third of the money they pay to insure their homes was going to their building society as commission, they'd vote with their feet.' Building societies and other intermediaries sell nine out of 10 home insurance policies, taking a commission of up to 30 per cent of the premiums they charge. Although the societies have voluntarily agreed not to link the sale of insurance to the sale of standard mortgage products, more than 40 per cent of mortgages consist of 'packages', a mortgage loan conditional on the purchase of other products. Legislation passed in 1990 which aims to make societies provide full information about packaged products and their true costs has not yet been implemented. Mr Adrian Coles, director general of the Building Societies Association, defended the payment of commissions, which he said reflect the work that building societies carried out for insurers. He said that building societies were concerned that too much information might 'confuse' consumers. Direct Line says that the sharp rise in the cost of insurance premiums in recent years has aggravated the problem. 'Increased premiums may reflect increased risk. However, increased commission, paid as a proportion of these larger premiums, does not reflect increased work or responsibilities. Nothing has been done by commission-based insurance intermediaries to reduce commission levels,' says Direct Line. Meanwhile the Consumers Association, which has itself criticised 'tie-ins' in the past, today accuses insurance companies of increasing house contents insurance premiums by 'staggeringly high amounts'. The latest edition of Which?, the association's magazine, says the cost of house contents insurance premiums has more than doubled since 1987, while house buildings premiums have risen by more than half. Insurance companies have 'bumped up the price of home insurance over the past few years with swingeing increases that more than outstrip inflation - partly to pay for their past blunders', says Which? Mr Simon Hinde, a senior editor, says the increases are 'simply unacceptable. Which? says insurers are 'worryingly reluctant' to cover homes which have suffered from subsidence. Asked if they would insure a house which had been underpinned one year ago, more than three quarters of insurance companies contacted by association researchers refused a quote or said that they needed more information.</p>

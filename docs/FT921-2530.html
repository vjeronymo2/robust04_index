			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Book Review: Germany comes home THE GERMANS: WHO ARE THEY NOW? By Alan Watson Methuen, Pounds 17.99 TOMORROW BELONGS TO ME By Peter Millar Bloomsbury, Pounds 17.99 THE ECONOMY OF UNITED GERMANY By W R Smyser St Martin's Press/Christopher Hurst, (no price indicated) A larger Germany has become of larger interest to its neighbours. The rest of Europe is now well aware that events in united Germany have a crucial influence on a continent in transition. At the same time, it is apparent that, in its efforts to make a success of unity, Germany faces a task of epic proportions. Germany may well be on the way towards strengthening its financial and industrial dominance, as well as achieving new political sway too. But the sheer psychological, as well as economic, challenge of integrating the two parts of a two-tier nation is considerably greater than optimists like Chancellor Helmut Kohl believed 18 months ago. For all these reasons, books on Germany are a welcome addition to reading lists. These three diverse volumes share a common merit: they set out the material in a way likely to appeal both to casual and specialist students. Watson, a broadcaster and businessman, examines German history, culture and geography with sympathetic rigour. His book, which grew out of the recent four-part Channel 4 documentary on Germany, suffers from an inevitable drawback: its somewhat stilted prose reads like something meant to be spoken in front of a camera. Yet perhaps this is no bad thing. Watson strips Germany down to its basic parts - Heimat and Hitler, Congress of Vienna and Catholic church, Deutsche Bank and Daimler-Benz - and reassembles the components before the TV lens. No stone has been left unturned, in both east and west, to track down interviewees, from the Bundeswehr serviceman who opposes conscription, to Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the president of the Bundesbank, who admits a little too readily that his institution would only sanction the creation of a European central bank if it were 'almost exactly' a copy of the Bundesbank itself. The result is a very thorough anatomy, ending with the optimistic conclusion that the united Germans have now at last 'come home' in Europe - for the good of the whole continent. Millar's book is also a very visual narrative, in a wholly different - and highly original - manner. A journalist who first lived in East Berlin when working for Reuters in 1981, Millar has assembled a fascinating cast of real Berliners who compellingly relate stories of their own lives - and of Germany. The tale starts in Millar's favourite East Berlin haunt, a agreeably melancholic bar which forms a beery meeting point for disgruntled locals. And the story keeps returning there throughout a series of meandering episodes leading to Millar's own escapades in East ill-starred 40th birthday celebrations in October 1989, when the Wall was breached a month later. Millar's incursions into contemporary politics can sometimes be injudicious. But, in a book which brings together a sharp eye for incongruous detail with the racy flair of a novel, Millar convincingly sums up the bitter-sweet atmosphere of East German life, shabby but somehow secure, before and during the fall of communism. Through the rotating prism of the beer glasses in the Metzer Eck pub, Millar shows the excitement, frustrations and pathos of his Berlin friends - and discovers the emotions running through a nation embarked on an unexpected adventure. Smyser's book focuses on the same adventure, illuminated this time entirely through the economic eye-glass. This is one of the first manuals on the economy of united Germany, and it presents all the facts and figures - most of them up-to-date  - that are necessary to examine the outlook for business and finance. Smyser, a Washington-based analyst, has no literary pretensions; there is something curiously mechanistic about the sentence: 'Although Karl Marx was a German, many modern west Germans have departed radically from Marxist thinking.' Smyser's view of Germany is occasionally rather too obviously that of the well-informed but distant outsider. The book, however, rates a place on the shelf of any businessman trying to come to grips with Mitbestimmung (co-determination), German social security regulations or the Treuhand. Smyser also pinpoints a dilemma which appears bound to become more acute in coming years - Germany's struggle to decide on its priorities towards eastern and western Europe. The Germans, he writes, must decide how they wish to 'shape' Europe. Neither he nor anyone else expects any very clear answers - one eminently good reason why books on Germany will continue to flow freely off the publishers' production lines.</p>

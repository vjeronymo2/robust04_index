			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EASED LIMITS ON CHILD CARE TENTATIVELY OKD  </P> <P> The Glendale City Council, which last month rejected a proposed law to  encourage the operation of large child-care centers, tentatively approved a  limited measure Tuesday that would lift restrictions in all areas except  single-family neighborhoods.  </P> <P> City staff members said the new law will streamline the rules for opening large  child-care centers in multiple-family neighborhoods and in commercial and  industrial zones.  </P> <P> It would also reduce the parking requirements for such centers because most  parents simply drop off and pick up their children during a brief stop, city  officials said.  </P> <P> The new ordinance does not allow centers handling more than 12 children to open  in neighborhoods zoned for single-family houses. Council members Carl Raggio  and Ginger Bremberg objected to such a proposal Oct. 9, defeating a child-care  measure than required four affirmative votes.  </P> <P> The two council members expressed no objections to the revised ordinance  Tuesday. It will be returned for final approval next week.  </P> <P> "I haven't seen any serious concerns on their part about this one," said Jane  Whitaker, president of the Greater Glendale Child Care Council. "We still are  very concerned about getting some ordinance on the books that will encourage  people to open child-care centers."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington (DPA) -- Social Democratic Party of  Germany [SPD] Chairman Rudolf Scharping has warned the Bonn  coalition parties, the Christian Democratic Union  [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] and the Free Democratic Party  of Germany [FDP], not to drag foreign policy into the election  campaign. Such attempts to distract from the Federal  Government's failure in the sphere of domestic policy will not  be successful, Scharping told journalists on Wednesday night [13  April] in Washington, where he is currently holding talks with  U.S. politicians.    It is not in Germany's interest to "challenge" longstanding  traditions in foreign policy "for crude calculations of party  politics." The SPD's chancellor candidate said it was an  "astonishing coincidence" that the coalition parties were using  his absence to schedule two important foreign-policy debates in  the Bundestag. "This is not necessarily proof of a great degree  of self-assuredness," Scharping said.    At the end of his talks in Washington he rejected the  impression that his assurance of continuity in German foreign  policy if the SPD wins the Bundestag election would only mean  the continuation of the policy of the current Federal Government.    It completely underestimated, for example, the importance of  worldwide problems such as the North-South gap, the population  explosion, or environmental problems for foreign policy. He  concurred with his U.S. partners in the talks that these issues  must be tackled more intensively and with more commitment,  Scharping said.    On Friday, Scharping will travel to New York and meet, among  others, Jack Smitz, the president of General Motors.</p>

			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTLAKE VILLAGE BANS MENORAH NEAR CITY HALL;  </P> <P> RELIGION: OFFICIALS BAR DISPLAY BESIDE CHRISTMAS TREE ON GROUNDS THAT EIGHT-DAY  HANUKKAH CELEBRATION IS NOT A NATIONAL HOLIDAY.  </P> <P> A Jewish center's request to display a Hanukkah menorah next to the Westlake  Village City Hall Christmas tree has been denied by officials who said that the  eight-day celebration is not a national holiday and that it lacks the secular  appeal of Christmas.  </P> <P> City Manager Larry Bagley, who rejected a request this month to display the  menorah, also said the City Hall reception area was too small to accommodate  decorations for cultural holidays not endorsed by the state or federal  government.  </P> <P> The decision has ignited fears of anti-Semitism among Jews and prompted dozens  of concerned telephone calls to Chabad of the Conejo, a community group with  synagogues and cultural centers in Westlake Village and Agoura Hills, Associate  Director Rabbi Yitzchak Sapochkinsky said last week.  </P> <P> Sapochkinsky said he did not think the city's motives were anti-Semitic, but he  called the decision by Bagley "a shameful thing."  </P> <P> Bagley said he knew of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in July that a menorah,  like a Christmas tree, is a secular symbol and therefore could be publicly  displayed without violating constitutional bans on governmental endorsement of  religions. Bagley said the decision allowed -- but did not require -- that  menorahs be displayed.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't want anybody of any particular cultural group to feel we weren't  concerned or didn't have good thoughts for their religious or cultural  symbols," Bagley said.  </P> <P> In November, the Beverly Hills City Council decided to allow the display of a  menorah on public property but denied a request to display a cross.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills officials, in interpreting the Supreme Court decision, said the  display of a cross violates the separation of church and state because the  cross is an overt religious symbol with clear associations with the Crucifixion  and Resurrection of Christ, and thus Christian theology.  </P> <P> The 28-foot high menorah is on display in the Beverly Gardens, on Santa Monica  Boulevard between Beverly and Canon drives.  </P> <P> Sapochkinsky estimated that several thousand Jewish people live in the Conejo  Valley, mostly in Thousand Oaks and Agoura Hills. Both of those cities approved  Chabad center requests for permission to display a menorah, and the Thousand  Oaks City Council last week held a menorah-lighting ceremony at the start of  its meeting.  </P> <P> Westlake Village Mayor Bonnie Klove said last week that the council did not  plan to reconsider Bagley's decision before the start of the eight-day Hanukkah  celebration, which began last Friday. She said that while a Christmas tree is a  secular symbol, a menorah is a religious symbol.  </P> <P> Mayor Pro Tem Ken Rufener agreed in a Dec. 11 letter to Rabbi Moshe Bryski,  Chabad's regional director. "Christmas is a festive season shared by people of  all religions and ethnic backgrounds," Rufener wrote. "Surely you are aware  that Jewish families in our community, as well as Christian families, give and  attend Christmas parties."  </P></p>

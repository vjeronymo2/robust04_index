			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Tokyo turns to public works to lift economy: The Budget JAPAN'S so-called hidden budget, the Y40,000bn (Pounds 202bn) a year Fiscal Investment and Loan Programme funded by post office savings, will be the main stimulant for the flagging economy, according to a supplementary budget approved by the cabinet yesterday. Spending by the FILP, which is largely under the control of the Ministry of Finance and does not have to be vetted in detail by the Diet (parliament), will rise by 10.8 per cent to Y45,199bn. In contrast public spending will fall marginally from original plans reflecting a sharp drop in tax revenues. The supplementary budget, which is to be debated by the Diet, was drawn up to implement the Y10,700bn emergency economic package announced by the government in August. Apart from the FILP the other main stimulus will come from higher spending by Japan's 3,300 local councils, which are expected to increase their spending by between Y3,000bn and Y5,000bn. The supplementary budget will cut planned public expenditure by Y728bn to Y71,489bn, in a signal from the finance ministry that despite the economy's weakness it will keep a tight rein on official spending and borrowing. Senior ministry officials said that given the sharp fall in projected tax revenues the budget would have a marked reflationary effect. Tax revenues are expected to fall Y4,900bn below the level planned in the original budget approved in the spring. However the spending is broadly being maintained. The government plans to cover the revenue shortfall by borrowing an additional Y2,256 through issuing construction bonds which are linked to public investment. It plans to carry over a Y1,531bn surplus from last year's accounts which normally would be devoted to paying off government debt. The Bank of Japan's interest rate cuts this year have reduced government interest payments allowing a Y895bn cut in public spending. The supplementary budget could mark the start of an important shift in Japanese policy away from debt reduction towards investment in public works. It provides for an additional Y1,962bn to be spent on public works, Y88.5bn to help small and medium sized enterprises and a Y156.9bn subsidy to the housing and urban development corporation.</p>

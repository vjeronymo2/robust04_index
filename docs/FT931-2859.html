			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Buba still keeps the Continent guessing BOURSES seemed slightly worried about the absence of a Bundesbank news conference today, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT approached the interest rate prospect with something less than enthusiasm, the DAX index falling 12.75 to 1,685.08, its fourth consecutive decline. Turnover fell slightly from DM6.1bn to DM6.0bn. Carmakers fell after a bearish review of the industry from Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, BMW leading the rout with a fall of DM9 to DM478. Otherwise, shares which moved appreciably on the day were mostly speculative. Asko, the retailer, up from DM604 at the end of February, apparently on hopes that the Christmas quarter will produce good figures, fell DM50, or 6.8 per cent to DM685; and Deutsche Babcock, the engineer which indicated good orders, but poor profits prospects earlier this week, dropped another DM9.20, or 5.9 per cent to DM147. Among utilities, VEW put on another DM3.50 to DM245.50 for a gain of 11 per cent this month. Mr Patrick Shields at NatWest Securities said that there had been a story that VEW, which has the greatest dependence in the industry on gas for the production of electricity, could be in the market for Hoesch's 8 per cent stake in Ruhrgas, Germany's largest gas supplier. PARIS lost its way late in the day after the CAC-40 index had risen to a high of 1,980, falling back to close 7.97 lower at 1,967.28. Turnover was a modest FFr2.4bn. The decline was partly attributed to a feeling that the Bundesbank might not cut interest rates at its regular meeting today. LVMH advanced FFr78 to FFr3,369 ahead of today's results. Analysts are particularly interested in the group's expectations of 1993 performance, given the depressed state of some of its interests, such as champagne. However, since the shares having underperformed the market by some 16 per cent over the last three months, some analysts believe that there is room for a technical rally. Eurotunnel rose FFr1.05 to FFr41.00 following the UK government's reaffirmation yesterday of its commitment to a high speed rail link between London and the channel tunnel. MILAN saw some heavy selling by foreign institutions in early trading but there was a slight recovery in the after market. The Comit index finished down 9.68 at 492.74. The market was not moved by Tuesday's good results from Banco Ambrosiano Veneto. The shares fell L50 to L4,190 although the bank announced a 31 per cent increase in net profit, this in spite of doubling its reserves for bad debts. Olivetti continued to be the focus of investors' attention, but the shares managed a modest upturn: after fixing down L44 to L1,781 they rose to L1,845 on the kerb. Doubts over the future of the country's privatisation programme increased after Monday's announcement that Iri, the state holding group, was to take a loan from Stet in exchange for granting the latter the dividend rights in Banco Commerciale. Stet fixed down L62 at L2,083 while Commerciale was L49 weaker at L4,670. AMSTERDAM moved higher on better than expected results from the steel group, Hoogovens. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.7 to 106.2. Hoogovens reported a 1992 loss of Fl 595m but forecast a turnround in the first half of 1993 on improved demand for its products. The shares picked up Fl 2.30 to Fl 27.30. In contrast, Grolsch, the brewer, lost Fl 5.40 to Fl 204.50 on slightly disappointing results and plans for a five-for-one share split. Elsevier was Fl 1.30 down at Fl 126.50 ahead of today's results. ZURICH looked apprehensively at the Bundesbank, at other equity markets and, again, at plans for US healthcare reform. The SMI index fell 11.3 to 2,138.5 with chemicals particularly weak, Roche certificates falling SFr60 to SFr4,020. HELSINKI rallied on strong demand for industrial shares, local hopes of a German interest rate cut and by a rebound from recent losses. The Hex index rose 2.4 per cent to 985.0 in turnover of FM72.1m. ISTANBUL dropped 1.7 per cent for an aggregate fall of 3 per cent over the past two days, cautious ahead of a six-day holiday starting next Tuesday. The market index closed 96.45 lower at 5,620.37.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- March 17                                           THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes            Open       10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1149.99    1149.19    1148.44    1146.75 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1217.39    1216.69    1216.42    1215.03  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1147.07    1145.84    1145.63    1146.10 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1214.72    1213.90    1213.92    1214.92  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Mar 16    Mar 15    Mar 12    Mar 11    Mar 10  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1151.53   1153.62   1145.86   1163.60   1167.52 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1222.33   1219.52   1212.44   1232.53   1231.98  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1149.99 ; 200 -  1217.39 Low/day: 100 -  1144.90  200 -  1212.77 .  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Japanese bankruptcies decline Corporate bankruptcies in Japan continue to decline, but those companies that do collapse are getting bigger, according to Teikoku Databank, a credit research agency. The number of companies to close their doors fell by 6.8 per cent from a year earlier to 1,143 in September, for the third month in a row. But their debts piled up by 30.2 per cent to Y568bn (Pounds 3.8bn), the highest this year, a sign of how companies damaged in the recession can easily be brought down by the strains on working capital imposed by even a gentle upturn. A handful of large corporate collapses was to blame, including the Y100bn failure of Fasuto, a property developer, and a rise in bankruptcies in construction and manufacturing, Teikoku says. Of the total, 702 bankruptcies were caused by recession, while a surprisingly low 10 casualties were attributed to the strength of the yen.</p>

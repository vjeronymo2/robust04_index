			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Green light to avoid confusion (1) Sir, John Murphy (Letters, May 12) is quite right that supermarkets' 'look-alikes that assume the characteristics of market-leading brands are parasites'. May I suggest some changes to J Sainsbury's Cola which would avoid confusion? Dyeing the liquid a different colour from dark brown (perhaps green?) and serving the drink flat instead of sparkling would immediately differentiate the own-brand from its legitimate competition. Calling the drink 'Cola' is also objectionable. Extensive advertising by Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola has associated both with the word. 'Artificially flavoured sugar water' would be more descriptive and not usurp the brand-leaders' expensively won market share. Adopting these simple measures would prevent even the most sensorily challenged customer confusing their purchases. Adrian Jack, 2 Paper Buildings, Temple, London EC4Y 7ET</p>

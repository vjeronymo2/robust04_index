The Committee recognized that MSS spacecraft operating at power flux density (pfd) levels in excess of the levels prescribed by international radio regulation RR 2566 would be required to be coordinated with these ``grandfathered'' fixed terrestrial stations. <FOOTCITE>191</FOOTCITE>  It stated, however, that these cases should be infrequent and that, in any event, any interference problems should be resolvable through coordination. The Committee also noted that terrestrial operations could interfere with MSS operations, although no analyses were provided to quantify the sharing constraints needed to prevent such interference. The Committee stated that because there is no inherent reason why fixed services need to continue operating in this frequency band, the Commission should consider moving these fixed stations to a higher frequency band. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 191 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> RR 2566 specifies pfd values at the Earth's surface that may be produced by space station emissions.

International radio regulation RR 753F incorporates these limits. According to RR 753F, if the limits of RR 2566 are exceeded by the MSS, coordination with terrestrial services is required. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 147. In the Notice, we accepted the Committee's finding that interference problems between terrestrial fixed-services at 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz and MSS downlinks operating in excess of the prescribed pfd levels may be settled through the coordination process. <FOOTCITE>192</FOOTCITE>  We requested comment on this assessment. We also specifically requested comment from terrestrial operators, who did not participate in the Negotiated Rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 192 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Notice, note 2,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , at para. 62. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 148. In the RDSS Allocation Order, we recognized that fixed and temporary-fixed operations are unlikely to pose a serious interference threat to RDSS. <FOOTCITE>193</FOOTCITE>  We therefore grandfathered all existing station licenses as of July 25, 1985, permitting them to continue operations and subject only to license renewal. However, we acknowledged that coordination would be somewhat more difficult when temporary-fixed stations are involved since RDSS licensees would not have exact information regarding the location of these stations. Therefore, we required temporary-fixed licensees in this band to notify RDSS licensees directly whenever the station is moved to a new location. <FOOTCITE>194</FOOTCITE>  A similar interference environment is present with MSS operations. Consequently, we proposed to modify Section 94.61(b)(4) to extend the notification requirement for grandfathered temporary-fixed licensees to MSS licensees as well. <FOOTCITE>195</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 193 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See RDSS Allocation Order, note 190,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , at paras. 18&hyph;20. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 194 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See 47 CFR 94.61(b)(4). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 195 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Notice, note 2,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , at para. 62 (n. 104).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See also Allocation Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , note 1,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  (modifying NG 147 to the Table of Frequency Allocations, 47 CFR &sect;2.106, to recognize that ``grandfathered'' terrestrial stations may continue to operate on a primary basis with the MSS.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 149. The Big LEO parties argue that the Commission should adopt pfd limits for MSS transmissions that are less stringent than those of RR 2566 and that these limits should be implemented as ``triggers'' for coordination, not as ``absolute limits.'' <FOOTCITE>196</FOOTCITE>  This would work in the following manner: the relaxed pfd limit would be established as a ``trigger level.'' If the trigger level is not exceeded, no further action would be required. If the trigger level is exceeded, the interference level to terrestrial systems would then be examined, taking into account the individual system characteristics of the MSS system. Only if the protection levels of the second step are exceeded would coordination be required. <FOOTCITE>197</FOOTCITE>  According to the Big LEO parties, relaxing the pfd levels and applying the coordination trigger method would enable the MSS systems to enhance capacity and sharing with other MSS operators and avoid time-consuming and costly coordination. <FOOTCITE>198</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 196 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> LQP Comments at 75, Ellipsat Reply Comments at 24, TRW Reply Comments at 78. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 197 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> LQP Comments at 77, TRW Comments at 131. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 198 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> We note also that LQP has, in a separate proceeding, recommended that these limits be raised.

We adopt the pfd threshold of RR 2566 for our domestic Big LEO systems. The ITU Radiocommunication Study Group, Task Group 2/2 (TG 2/2), is studying the issue of relaxing the pfd limits of RR 2566, with the view to present a recommendation at an upcoming World Radiocommunciation Conference (WRC). The Commission participates actively in the work of TG 2/2. We do not believe it would be appropriate to adopt an increase in the allowable pfd limits for MSS downlinks in the 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz band in the United States before limits are agreed upon internationally. Indeed, even if we adopted a relaxation of the RR 2566 pfd limits in the United States, it is questionable whether MSS systems that are not designed for power controlled downlink transmissions would be able to take advantage of this relaxed limit worldwide. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 151. We also adopt the notification requirement for grandfathered temporary-fixed licensees to MSS licensees as proposed in the Notice and will not require these stations to relocate. No comments were filed with respect to a possible relocation of grandfathered terrestrial stations. We therefore have no record in this proceeding on which to base a finding that a move would serve the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Fixed Services above 2500 MHz (ITFS/MMDS) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 152. The instructional television fixed service (ITFS) and the multi-channel multipoint distribution service (MMDS) operate in the adjacent 2500&hyph;2690 MHz frequency band. The Committee found a potential for out-of-band emission interference into MSS downlinks at 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz from operations in the lowest frequency portion of the ITFS/MMDS allocation. It indicated that because both ITFS and MMDS transmissions are similar to those of television broadcast signals, they will cause harmful interference into MSS mobile user transceivers operating up to several kilometers away from an ITFS or a MMDS transmitter. The Committee concluded that stricter limits on ITFS and MMDS out-of-band emissions should be imposed, and recommended that the Commission initiate such a rulemaking. <FOOTCITE>199</FOOTCITE>  It acknowledged, however, that making these improvements would cost up to $30,000 per ITFS or MMDS station, and that this cost might increase if these stations are converted from analog to digital technology. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 199 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Specifically, the Committee concluded that out-of-band emissions from the lowest frequency ITFS/MMDS channel using an analog video signal at 2500&hyph;2506 MHz should be limited to ^90 dB relative to the carrier at a frequency offset from band edge between 1.25 and 2 MHz, assuming that the channel is operating at 30 dBW e.i.r.p. Adjustments could be made for higher frequency channels and for higher or lower operating e.i.r.p. Currently, ITFS out-of-band emissions extending more than 1 MHz below the lower band edge must be attenuated 60 dB below the peak visual carrier power.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  47 CFR &sect;74.936(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 153. We stated in the Notice that the record was insufficient to allow us to make a specific proposal in this area. <FOOTCITE>200</FOOTCITE>  No ITFS representative participated on the Committee nor did the Committee explore the economic and technical tradeoffs that must be considered in developing a solution. Therefore, we requested comment on all aspects of the ITFS/MSS sharing issue, noting that the regulations we ultimately adopt would be based on these comments. We noted that these regulations might require ITFS operators to improve out-of-band suppression, might require MSS operators to accept additional interference, or might require a combination of both. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 200 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Notice, note 2,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , at para. 64. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 154. Ellipsat and TRW contend that new out-of-band emission constraints on all ITFS/MMDS stations should be applied immediately to allow for a transition period for these transmitters to conform to new requirements and that, according to Section 74.936 of the Commission's Rules, the ``onus is on the ITFS operator to provide the required interference protection to adjacent band services.'' <FOOTCITE>201</FOOTCITE>  Further, TRW asserts the licensing of Big LEO systems or the initiation of service should not be delayed to permit ITFS operators additional time to modify their transmitters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 201 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> TRW Comments at 132, Ellipsat Reply Comments at 24.

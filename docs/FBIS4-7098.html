			<p>BFN     [Text] Three top executives of Rengo [Japanese Trade Union  Confederation] held an emergency meeting in Atami city, Shizuoka  Prefecture, on 26 April. Following the secession of the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] from the coalition, they  confirmed Rengo's policy of deciding whether or not to cooperate  with Hata's new administration "on a case-by-case basis, based  on policy." In a news conference, Rengo Chairman Akira  Yamagishi said: "If a minority ruling group is formed without  the SDPJ, it will be impossible to manage the political  situation in a normal manner. While it is not good to conduct an  election under the multiple-seat constituency system which was  `pronounced dead,' the Diet is likely to be dissolved soon." He  thus predicted there is a possibility of Diet dissolution under  the present multiple-seat constituency system after passage of  the 1994 budget bill.</p>

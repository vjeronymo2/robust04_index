			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Observer: Old school Still on the subject of the City's old training schools, Bryan Quinton of Invesco MIM has solved Observer's request for information on how many Conservative MPs honed their early business skills inside the Slater Walker empire which collapsed so spectacularly in the mid-1970s. Quinton, who was Jim Slater's first employee, has counted six ex-colleagues still making their way up the political ladder: Sir John Cope (paymaster general), Tony Nelson (economic secretary), Alastair Goodlad (foreign office) and Jonathan Aitken (defence) have made it to ministerial rank, while Alan Haselhurst and John Butterfill carry the torch on the back benches. Admittedly, none of them comes close to matching the success of Lord (Peter) Walker, Jim Slater's first deputy chairman. But unless one counts Lords Hanson and Sterling, who in their early days benefited from Jim Slater's charisma, far more Slater Walker old boys seem to have made their mark in politics, rather than the City. A subject for an explanatory doctoral thesis, perhaps?</p>

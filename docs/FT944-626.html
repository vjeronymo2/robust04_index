			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Books: A lust for possession - Christian Tyler falls for Gibbon It was VS Naipaul's Mystic Masseur, I think, who bought books by the yard to impress his visitors and - more important - to flatter himself. You will know the feeling. It overcame me, this unworthy, guilty desire, a couple of weeks ago when I found myself gazing at a boxed set as big as a breeze-block in the window of Thornton's bookshop in Oxford. It was Edward Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, the complete work in three volumes, seductively dressed in black and white designer jackets with chipped inscriptions and broken columns printed on the cover. 'It was at Rome on the 15th of October 1764,' wrote Gibbon, 'as I sat musing amidst the ruins of the Capitol, while the barefooted fryars were singing Vespers in the temple of Jupiter, that the idea of writing the decline and fall of the City first started to my mind.' Did I want to read Gibbon? I don't know. Like everyone else who has never done so, I had been taught to think of him as the father of modern history and the finest prose writer of his age. Occasionally, people would nominate the Decline and Fall as the book to take to the desert island. Fear of the question 'Have you read Gibbon?' has never kept me from mixing in polite society. After all, how many people could honestly answer 'Yes'? Did I, then, want to fill a gaping knowledge gap? Perhaps. At school we followed the Romans up to the time of Trajan and Hadrian. The Dark Ages remained dark and Byzantium was a brilliant blank. Nothing was allowed to happen until the Italian Renaissance. Also, I was conscious, standing outside that bookshop, of the youthful pretension which in the 1970s made me collect all 11 volumes of the definitive modern edition of Samuel Pepys's diary. They have stood, accusingly, on the top shelf ever since. There were any number of excuses for buying Gibbon's great tome, but no convincing reason. It was like buying a pair of shoes without trying them on, or an expensive wine just for the look of the label. The fact is, at that moment, I just had to have it. When I got the box home, I unwrapped it carefully and carried it like a baby to the bathroom scales, proudly watching as the arrow swung over 9lbs. I took out the three volumes, sized them up, smelt the chemical whiff of the pages and took off the jackets to inspect the chubby black bodies beneath. I even sampled some paragraphs, picked at random. The connoisseurs are right. Even read silently Gibbon's sentences have a majestic rhythm, like the gentle pounding of heavy machinery, which propels his meaning effortlessly off the page. It is not the familiar iambic rhythm of a Shakespeare, more the triple-time beat of Latin verse hexameters. If prose was music, Gibbon would be a Haydn or Mozart, showing off his wit and invention within the familiar limits of classical style. There are two modern editions of the complete Decline and Fall on the market now. The three-volume version is published by Allen Lane at Pounds 75, and is edited and introduced by David Womersley. For Pounds 50 Everyman is offering a six-volume, two-box set, a revision of its 1910 edition with an introduction by Hugh Trevor-Roper. The Everyman version is attractive, a bargain at the price, and a good deal more portable than the other. But Womersley's imposing edition has the advantage of a somewhat larger typeface, is stuffed with notes and appendices, and includes Gibbon's own Vindication, the reply the historian made to critics outraged by his secular account in chapters 15 and 16 of the growth of Christianity. Womersley's 100-page introduction, an essay on Gibbon's 'philosophic historiography' is hard going for the inexpert and had me running for the dictionary more than once. (Try 'stochastic' for size.) Not surprisingly, his own writing appears to have been infected by the Gibbonian beat - not always to good effect. But I liked his comment on Gibbon's way of life: 'Because of an amiable tendency to regard luxuries as necessities, his expenditure comfortably exceeded his income.' So it is the lust of possession, tempered by self-satisfaction, which has brought me at last to the foothills of Gibbon's prose mountain. All that remains is to climb it. I hope the view is as wonderful as they say.</p>

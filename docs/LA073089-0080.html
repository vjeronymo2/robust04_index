			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> DOES HOLLYWOOD HATE GENIUS?;  </P> <P> ROBERT ALTMAN JUMPING OFF THE CLIFF BY PATRICK MCGILLIGAN (ST. MARTIN'S PRESS:  $19.95; 480 PP.);  </P> <P> CITIZEN WELLES BY FRANK BRADY (SCRIBNER'S: $24.95; 655 PP.)  </P> <P> There is a vignette in Patrick McGilligan's biography of Robert Altman in which  Altman, at a low point in his career, is stumbling along a Paris street with a  pal. Ahead of them they see the massive, caped figure of Orson Welles, on whom  the young Altman once vowed to model his own film making. Altman starts to  hurry to catch up with the great man, then thinks better of it. They've got  nothing to compare notes on except failure and rejection, Altman explains  bitterly.  </P> <P> It is a historical moment so symbolically perfect as to be apocryphal (although  it apparently isn't). No film makers of comparable achievement -- not even  Francis Coppola, who comes close -- have failed quite so noisily to fit into  the Hollywood system and been condemned, as Welles was in his lifetime and as  Altman apparently still is, to scrabble in exile for the money to go on making  movies.  </P> <P> The two men, as revealed in two new biographies, are in some ways similar: in  their charismatic charm, which commanded the fierce loyalty of men and women  alike, their maverick and often self-destructive resistance to authority, their  impatient and innovative zest for the making of films, and their protean  appetites for all experience (also dangerous, again bordering on the  self-destructive).  </P> <P> But, aside from common geographical origins in the Midwest, Welles and Altman  are otherwise as unlike, in style and density, as the biographies themselves.  Welles had great and varied gifts as actor, writer and director for stage,  screen and radio. Altman is a film maker, neither pure nor simple, with  excursions to stage and opera.  </P> <P> Frank Brady, the author of "Citizen Welles," is a tenured professor of film and  writing at St. John's University in Brooklyn. His biography, which can fairly  be called monumental, authoritative and exhaustive, has been since 1977 in the  making. If it is not definitive, it is probably because Welles may not  ultimately be definable.  </P> <P> Brady's detailing of Welles' life is amazingly full, and it was an amazing  life. Proceeding on a combination of bravado, physical size, a prematurely  stentorian voice and uncommon intelligence and talent, Welles talked himself  into a job with Michael MacLiammoir at the Gate Theatre in Dublin when he was  only 16, occasionally playing old men.  </P> <P> In his researches, Brady found RKO time-sheets that indicated Welles had logged  111 hours working on the "Kane" script. In the Welles v. Herman Mankiewicz  dispute, Brady is firmly on Welles' side as the film's principal creator,  although he also has no doubt that the shared script credit is fair and  accurate.  </P> <P> Brady's accounts of the making of the various films are ample and knowing. The  turmoil surrounding the completion of "The Magnificent Ambersons" is described  in considerable depth, for example, and so is the furor that greeted "Kane" in  and out of the Hearst press.  </P> <P> The author reproduces some of Welles' cut-by-cut notes to his various editors.  From a standing start, when he compared film making to a boy's joy in an  electric train, Welles had become a meticulous and very well-informed  craftsman.  </P> <P> The facts of Welles' melancholy last years, when he held court at Ma Maison  while film projects appeared and vanished like apparitions, are all too  eloquent. There was talk of a "Lear," which could have been Welles' last, great  triumph but was never done. Sir John Gielgud located money for Welles to do  "The Tempest" but Welles knew he was too old to play Caliban and too infirm to  handle the project.  </P> <P> In a late interview with William Scobie of London's Observer, Welles said,  "I've always pretended to love Hollywood. Sour grapes are not my dish. But when  the day of judgment comes and the executives and the moguls are placed in the  balance against writers and directors, they will be found wanting."  </P> <P> It will do for an epitaph.  </P> <P> Patrick McGilligan, a young film maker and film historian who lives in  Wisconsin, is an unabashed Robert Altman admirer. You are tempted to say that  with such an admirer, the subject has no need of detractors. This is to say  that McGilligan's book gives new dimensions to unsparing candor.  </P> <P> His portrait of the private Altman -- the younger Altman at least -- is grungy,  bordering on the scabrous: a chronicle of incessant infidelities, chronic abuse  of alcohol and drugs, the casting aside of loyal friends and co-workers, the  poisoning of his relationships with most of the major studios in Hollywood.  </P> <P> "The biographer crosses the finish line with a sigh of relief," McGilligan  writes in a small gem of understatement. "Much has been found out -- but I am  happy to say that Altman, like any great subject, remains mysterious for me,  and that his best work remains a joy and a revelation. No matter the ungainly  strands of his life, his stature has not been diminished for me. Indeed, Woody  Allen seems to be the only other artist who could give him a run for his money  as the great American director of our time."  </P> <P> Welles, Francis Coppola, Stanley Kubrick and a few others could be alternate  nominees for that eminence, but a willful myopia is part of the biographer's  necessary equipment.  </P> <P> What is true, as McGilligan is saying, is that the work must stand on its own.  The private life, pristine or prurient, is of interest only as it is reflected  in the work or as it appears to have got in the way of the work.  </P> <P> It seems fairly clear that Altman's creative frustrations played a role in the  untidy life style he acquired. "His was a tormented debauchery," McGilligan  says loyally, "a searching for love and reinforcement."  </P> <P> Despite the frenzied playing, Altman learned his craft well. His films have  seemed the equivalent of gestural paintings, with a feeling of spontaneity and  improvisation, of a loose and quite personal immediacy, that is markedly  different from the ingenious technical invention of the most startling of  Welles' works.  </P> <P> McGilligan is a sharp and attentive appreciator of Altman's films. In some of  them the viewer senses that Altman has lost interest somewhat before the last  reel; the author does not deny that this is so, or that the meaning of some of  the films is as obscure to Altman as to the audience.  </P> <P> Yet Altman's most significant contribution to film making in the '60s and '70s  has been the kicking aside of the constraints and inhibitions of the so-called  well-made film, with its technical perfection and its acts all but defined by  curtains.  </P> <P> Altman's overlapped and sometimes indecipherable sound has infuriated audiences  accustomed to clarity and coherence, but it has created an emotional force that  makes the viewer feel the scene even if he or she cannot quite be sure what it  means.  </P> <P> The majority of movies remain collective and collaborative, seldom bearing,  like Altman's, a personal signature recognizable in the content as well as the  form. The occasional state-of-the-private-psyche films that do emerge, like  David Byrne's "Blue Velvet," owe something to Altman's damn-the-traditions  approach.  </P> <P> Several of his own films are now solidly in the classic repertory: "Nashville,"  "Brewster McCloud," "McCabe and Mrs. Miller" among them.  </P> <P> Lately, in his own self-determined exile from Hollywood, Altman has been making  low-budget independent films, always interesting if not always successful. One  of his proteges, Alan Rudolph, says, "Bob is like a huge furnace that will burn  forever." McGilligan says, "Robert Altman keeps a-goin'."  </P> <P> McGilligan's own researches, leaning heavily on interviews with Altman's  present and former friends and relatives, all of whom spoke with few  reticences, are extensive and central to the portrait.  </P> <P> His writing style is free, to say the least, as when he notes that the early  Altman had "an office where he was fronting a dog-tattooing business with some  broad as his supposed secretary."  </P> <P> It is a very far stretch from Brady's circumspect prose, also entertainingly  readable and congruent with the subject's free-form life style (now, one  suspects, down-cooled considerably). But so breezy a style has the negative  effect of undercutting the seriousness and weight of McGilligan's positioning  of Altman in film history.  </P></p>

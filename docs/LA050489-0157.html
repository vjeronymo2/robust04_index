			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRAISE IN MEMORY OF CAM BRIGLIO  </P> <P> Cam Briglio (the former Monterey Park mayor who died April 25) was a guy you  couldn't miss. He was as big as life, and he got you coming and going every  time. You couldn't ruffle his feathers or back him down, and you often came  away with a higher temperature or cursing under your breath.  </P> <P> But whether you liked him or not, agreed or disagreed with him, it was  difficult to doubt his sincerity. Honesty compelled, at the very least, a  grudging respect for Cam, who always displayed the courage of his convictions,  regardless of the heat.  </P> <P> With Cam, you always knew where you stood. . . . An adversary had to always be  ready for a rough and tumble affair.  </P> <P> But beneath Cam's tough exterior was a kind, considerate and lovable soul. He  was a devoted father and husband who gave to his family much of what he missed  as an orphaned child. And, as a friend, you could always count on him to be  there when you needed him.  </P> <P> Cam was a true gladiator who fought hard for what he believed in and gave  unselfishly to Monterey Park, as councilman, mayor and private citizen. . . .  He contributed four exciting, interesting and productive years to city  government, during which we successfully hosted an Olympic event and gained for  Monterey Park "All American City" status.  </P> <P> I liked Cam, my council colleague and friend of many years. We shall miss you,  old friend. May you rest in peace in a happier and better place. Monterey Park  will never be the same without you.  </P> <P> G. MONTY MANIBOG  </P> <P> Former mayor and councilman,  </P> <P> Monterey Park  </P></p>

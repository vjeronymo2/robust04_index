In a statement aired over the Yemeni Television last night  and relayed by the INA correspondent in Sanaa, Yemeni Deputy  Prime Minister Brigadier General Mujahid Abu-Shawarib and  opposition National Grouping Chairman Shaykh Sinan Abu-Luhum  said that they have become convinced beyond any shadow of doubt  that the scheme to effect an irreversible secession in the  country is being carried out with sure steps, and that secession  will be effected through bloodshed and a bitter infighting  between the two parties to the conflict.    The two Yemeni officials asserted that the all Yemenis are  responsible for safeguarding Yemen and its unity. They  indicated that the accord document recently signed in Amman is  the property of all the Yemeni people, and not that of a single  ruler, party, or group. They held the Yemeni people responsible  for protecting and defending this document.    The statement issued by the two Yemeni officials appealed to  the Yemeni Army not to get involved in acts that could shed the  blood of their fathers, brothers, and sons just to promote the  interests of certain persons or parties, as such a thing would  harm the interests of 14 million Yemenis. They asserted that  they have made persistent efforts to achieve a minimum  understanding between the parties to the conflict.</p>

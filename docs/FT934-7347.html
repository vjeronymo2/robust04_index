			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Apec envoys heave sighs of relief MINISTERS and officials at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation meeting in Seattle expressed relief at President Bill Clinton's Nafta victory in the House of Representatives on Wednesday night. Although delegates have carefully avoided saying that a defeat would turn Mr Clinton into a lame duck host for this 15-country gathering, officials clearly believe that the US president will now be in a much stronger position to provide leadership for Apec. 'He'll come here as a stronger duck,' said Mr Peter Cook, Australia's trade minister. Mr Roy MacLaren, Canada's international trade minister, said after the vote: 'Certainly, it seems to me to strengthen President Clinton's presentation of himself as a man committed to freer trade and liberal trade on a global basis.' Apec delegates had been at pains to point out a bright side for their organisation whether Nafta won or lost. Mr Philip Burdon, New Zealand's minister for trade negotiations, said that while Apec would complement Nafta, in the event of failure it would have become a fallback position.</p>

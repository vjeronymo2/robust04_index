			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Ecclesiastical Insurance tumbles to Pounds 0.85m LIKE OTHER general business insurers, the Ecclesiastical Insurance Office felt the impact of highly competitive trading conditions in 1990, coupled with a surge of claims as a result of adverse weather, subsidence, rising theft and several sizeable fires. As a result, the company said it was ' relieved rather than pleased ' to produce a small pre-tax profit of Pounds 853,000 for the 10 months to end-1990 (Pounds 5.14m for 1989) - a performance it considered better than the market average. Net premiums came out at Pounds 79.76m (Pounds 99.22m), of which Pounds 56.13m (Pounds 62.45m) arose from general business and Pounds 23.63m (Pounds 36.77m) from the life side.</p>

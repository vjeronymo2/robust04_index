			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [AFP, YONHAP From Vienna] </F>   [Text] According to diplomats in Vienna, the Board of  Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] has  convened a special meeting to discuss a draft declaration urging  North Korea to accept all inspections in relation to nuclear  weapons development.    The diplomats said that the meeting, which was held a day  before the official Board of Governors meeting scheduled for 5  June, reviewed a draft declaration denouncing North Korea for  violating the inspections provisions of the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] by removing fuel rods from the  five-megawatt experimental reactor without IAEA supervision.    They said that the declaration urges North Korea to fulfill  the obligations of the NPT and that the declaration will be  announced as an official result of the Board of Governors  meeting or a president's statement.    The IAEA Board of Governors is expected to discuss the North  Korean issue on 9 or 10 June when the UN Security Council makes  a decision on sanctions against North Korea.</p>

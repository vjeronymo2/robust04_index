			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Peter Schutz, Kosice-based correspondent  of the Prague right-of-center daily DENNI TELEGRAF, claims in  his 17 March commentary that Jozef Moravcik, who replaced  Vladimir Meciar as Slovakia's prime minister, had been  considered "a potential alternative to Meciar" well before his  appoinment on 16 March, possibly as early as a year ago. To  correct the "erroneous" characterization of Moravcik as "one of  the 1968 men," Schutz also mentions a number of biographical  details, "which quite likely will not be found in Moravcik's  official resumes."    Some commentators, writes Schutz, may have been surprised by  the emergence of Moravcik as the prime minister. After all, as  late as 12 March, halfway through the "hectic" coalition  negotiations, [chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement]  Jan Carnogursky still believed that, while it looked like  [former Deputy Prime Minister] Roman Kovac might be the next  Slovak prime minister, Lubomir Fogas [a prominent Party of the  Democratic Left deputy] was still in the running, because "the  SDL was fighting hard" for Fogas's candidacy. Nevertheless,  "knowledgeable observers" were not amazed when Moravcik was  finally chosen as the consensus appointee. They remembered, says  Schutz, that the March 1993 governmental crisis, which resulted  in the ouster of Milan Knazko as foreign minister and his  replacement by Moravcik, caused certain circles, "particularly  the circle around the Castle" [i.e., around President Michal  Kovac], to be alarmed by Meciar's increasing authoritarianism  and to begin thinking about replacing him. The choice ultimately  fell on the new foreign minister, Moravcik. As an article in the  weekly DOMINO EFEKT, 26 March 1993, quoted by Schutz, explained:  "It seems that certain influential circles are preparing [Jozef  Moravcik] to succeed Meciar. These are the same pressure and  interest groups that previously sanctioned Meciar's liquidation  of the federation, that supported by all available means his  ascent to power, and that assisted him via the information  media. Moravcik's joining the government gives him now an  excellent chance to start building and then to consolidate his  [political] base and offers him enough room for maneuvering  until such moment when his time will come." That time,  concludes Schutz,"is now."    Schutz argues that it is false to claim, as Moravcik's  supporters sometimes do, that he played a role in Alexander  Dubcek's 1968 effort to democratize the communist system--the  so-called Prague Spring. While Dubcek's actual supporters were  expelled from the party, Schutz points out, Moravcik remained a  party member and "did not renounce his membership until the end  of January 1990." Even as the communist regime was foundering  in the winter of 1989-90, Moravcik was "still trying to convince  people from Public Against Violence [the post-1989 Slovak  anticommunist movement] that the Communist Party represented the  only road to a bright tomorrow." Schutz also notes that,  "shortly before November 1989, together with the StB [Communist  Secret Service] officer Igor Cibula, who today heads Slovak  intelligence, [Moravcik] established the Club of the Leninist  Iskra (Spark) [an allusion to the name of the newspaper  published by Lenin while in exile], an association of Slovak  reform communists that was tolerated by the [former] regime.  Moravcik sheltered the club at the Bratislava University Law  School, where he taught."    It seems likely that Schutz's charges will be exploited by  the Meciar forces to score points in the coming election  campaign. This is indicated, for instance, by an unsigned  editorial that appeared in the pro-Meciar daily REPUBLIKA on 16  March under the title "Founder of Leninist Iskra Club Becomes  Prime Minister of Slovakia: Jozef Moravcik and His Developmental  Turns."    The editorial presents Moravcik as an ambitious and  opportunistic politician with the gift of predicting and  calculating the course of political developments. Moravcik is  alleged to have developed and honed this gift while "the founder  and leading personality of the Club of the Leninist Iskra." It  was there that he learned "the methodology of calculation," a  methodology focused on "the ultimate goal itself--the grabbing  of power"--and driven by "the spirit of Leninist and Bolshevist  methods, which had been validated by the success of the  legendary October Revolution" of 1917. According to the  editorial, Moravcik's interest in gaining power can be traced  back through his entire political career. He is said to have  made his calculated move first in the Club of Leninist Iskra,  when he bet on the Communist Party's turn to reformism, then,  while a member of Public Against Violence, when he sided with  Meciar's "centrists," and again later, when he assisted Meciar  in founding the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia. Allegedly,  it was this propensity for calculation that motivated also his  very latest move and drove him "to negotiate, behind the back of  his movement [i.e. the HZDS] with President Michal Kovac and the  leaders of the opposition in order to defeat the government of  which he was a member." Thus, writes REPUBLIKA, "with the help  and support of college-educated Marxist-Leninists from the Party  of the Democratic Left [former Communist Party]," Moravcik has  finally reached his goal, "which he had coveted as early as  1989, when he, humble-visaged, huddled at the Leninist circle's  bonfire in [the Bratislava] Law School. His development has its  logic. From the point of view of Marxist methodology, it is  faultless. It is even faultless from the point of view of the  power ambitions of those who have put together the current  government according to the principle: Shake before use, discard  after use."</p>

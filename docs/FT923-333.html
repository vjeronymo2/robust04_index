			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Special Report on Franchising (6): Rewards for ingenuity - The tricky process of obtaining start-up cash MR DAVID BLAYLOCK is one of the lucky ones. From an uncertain start with a relatively unknown franchisor providing courier services nine years ago, he has built a growing operation which ranges across Saffron Walden and Colchester. But - in common with many franchisees - obtaining finance was not easy. Blaylock, managing director and owner of the Interlink franchises for the two regions, had to resort to unusual sources to help him build up his business. 'I used my family and not bank support,' he says - blood ties allowed him to borrow Pounds 3,000. Since that time, he has been able to use Lombard North Central, the credit finance and leasing subsidiary of National Westminster Bank, to fund the purchase of a number of delivery vans. He has also obtained support via the bank through the government's small firms' loan guarantee scheme. Mr Ian Harvey of Stoy Hayward's franchising consultancy says the main source of finance for franchisees remains the clearing banks - particularly those which have a reputation for work with small businesses. For franchisors, venture capital and equity routes may also be available. Mr Tony Ellingham, franchise manager for NatWest, stresses that three elements remain essential for any potential borrower: a business plan, an operating budget and a cashflow forecast. 'No matter how big or small you are, we still expect you to go through the discipline of putting these statements together,' he says. 'We expect customers to have prepared them in advance of seeing us. It saves a lot of time.' For businesses interested in becoming franchisors, he recommends using a franchise consultant, preferably affiliated to the British Franchise Association, to help carry out a feasibility study. Both franchisee and franchisor will also need an accountant to help develop projections. A typical outlet might typically expect a return on investment within two to five years. He says that one frequent obstacle for businesses trying to raise finance is that the individuals applying do not have sufficient security to back their loans. That is where the small firms' loan guarantee scheme, which is backed by the Department of Employment, can help. It is available in addition to - rather than in competition with - normal commercial finance, and offers the lender guarantees for 70 per cent of the total loan in return for a 2.5 per cent premium to be paid by the borrower on the sum guaranteed. Eligible businesses must be small, with fewer than 200 employees and limits on turnover. Certain activities are not covered, such as agriculture, betting, banking, tied pubs and bars and estate and travel agents. All applicants must submit a thorough business plan and have a clear idea of how much finance they need and to what purpose it will be put. Ellingham remains optimistic about the future for the financing of franchises. 'More and more people are considering franchises, and we are certainly still committed to them,' he says. David Blaylock goes one step further back, and stresses that the best preparation for financing a franchise comes in the selection of the franchise itself in the first place. 'There are a lot of franchises on the market at the moment,' he says. 'You should check them out thoroughly and speak to the people involved.' His start-up problems illustrate the fact that it is never easy to obtain finance. Yet he had much in his favour. He had held a bank account with National Westminster since before he was 16. He ran a newsagents shop before decided to apply for a franchise. He also now plays football with his local bank manager. For Jenny Allen, owner of a Cullen's franchise in London, it was trickier still. 'Obtaining finance?' she says. 'It was incredibly difficult. I think frankly the fact that I was 27, single, a woman and with no equity, seeing a 40-year old bank manager didn't help.' She was managing a Cullens shop three years ago when she decided to buy the franchise. But the turnover was too large for her to be eligible for the business development loan. But there is an optimistic end to the story. She was helped by a sympathetic policy of support from Cullens itself. She then managed to obtain bank support and go ahead with a five-year loan. She has paid it off within 18 months.</p>

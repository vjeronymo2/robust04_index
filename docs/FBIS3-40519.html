			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Kamesaburo Matsunaga, Chairman, Chubu </F> Economic Federation; first paragraph is source introduction]    [Text] Chubu Aerospace Industry and Technology Promotion  Center, Inc., was established in late August with the aim of  promoting the concentration of the aerospace industry and its  research capabilities in the Chubu district (the area  surrounding Nagoya), as well as the sophistication of related  industries. It is a non-profit corporation for public interest,  and the successor to Chubu Aerospace Industry and Technology  Promotion Conference, which ceased to exist with the  incorporation of the other. The new corporation intends to  promote various business plans aimed at the realization of  ``Chubu Aerospace Technology Park Concept,'' to realize the  project in the very near future. As a start, it will work up a  plan for establishing a ``wind tunnel research facility'' and  will solicit the central government to bring it to this area,  and it will collect related information available from NTIS  (U.S. National Technical Information Service), especially in the  material science field, and from other sources to build a  database to provide the information to the local industries. The  following is the transcript of Mr. Kamesaburo Matsunaga's  answers to questions regarding future business plans and the  like.    NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: First of all, why was it  necessary for the Chubu Aerospace Industry and Technology  Promotion Conference, an arbitrary juridical person, to be  disbanded to be reborn as the Chubu Aerospace Industry and  Technology Promotion Center, Inc.?    MATSUNAGA: It has been three years and ten months  since the Chubu Aerospace Industry and Technology Promotion  Conference was established in October 1989. During that period,  (1) it held technology-exchange conferences and symposia in  order to familiarize the local industries with aerospace-related  technologies and to transfer the technologies to them; (2) it  conducted surveys and studies on the technology transfer and the  aerospace-related test-and-evaluation facilities; and (3) it  solicited the government for national projects (research  facilities such as a wind tunnel). While we were busying  ourselves in these activities, we began to hear the member  companies and the local governments voice their requests for our  organization to expand its activities and for the need for our  organization to increase its influence on the central government.    Upon hearing those requests and opinions, we studied the  method of expanding the activities, including the matter of  incorporation, at the study committee held in August last year.  In June of this year, a meeting of promoters for establishing a  non-profit corporation was held, officially initiating the  discussions on that matter.    The conclusion of the discussions that followed was that  what  was needed most was to keep the gist of the establishment of the  Conference and to further enhance and expand. More specifically,  we agreed that it was essential that we do the following: (1)  exchange research and offer information in order to acquaint  people with and promote aerospace-related technologies; (2)  vitalize the project planning and proposal activities, targeting  the central government and others (promotion of research  activities); and (3) enhance the organization, including the  administration office, in order to implement those activities. I  believe this will greatly contribute to the formation of ``the  central region of industrial technology,'' and to the  vitalization of the local communities.    NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: What are the future business  plans?    MATSUNAGA: In terms of our business plans, we have  the following five categories of activities we wish to pursue in  order to promote the concentration of the aerospace industry and  its research capabilities, as well as the sophistication of  related industries, in the Chubu district.    We will conduct, first, the surveys and studies, as well as  planning, necessary for the promotion of the concentration of  aerospace industry and its research capabilities, as well as the  sophistication of related industries; second, exchange of  research in order to achieve synergistic effects between the  aerospace industry and other industries; third, collection and  supply of information regarding aerospace industries; fourth,  familiarization and educational activities; and fifth,  coordination and cooperation with related organizations.    During the next two years, in terms of the activities of the  first category, we will concentrate our efforts on the  following: (1) studies on the preferred format for the  information network; (2) project planning regarding the wind  tunnel proposed in the Chubu Aerospace Technology Park; (3)  surveys on technology needs and seeds; and (4) project planning  in the aerospace-related arena. In the second category, we will  hold technology-exchange conferences (forums) with limited  members on various specific themes.    In the third category, we will work on expanding our  capability to collect related information available from NTIS  (the U.S. National Technical Information Service) and other  sources, particularly, on materials science data, in order to  build a database to provide the information to the local  industries. In the fourth, we will organize lecture meetings and  seminars and international aerospace symposia every other year  (beginning in 1994), and we will issue an information  periodical. As to the fifth category, in the next two years, we  will exchange views and information with aerospace organizations  in other areas, submit our opinions to the government so that  they be reflected in the national policies, coordinate and  cooperate with the government and its subordinate organizations,  and participate in various related events.    NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: How are your solicitation  activities on national research facilities working out?    MATSUNAGA: We believe it is not only necessary,  but also more effective to work with local government and  economic organizations when it comes to the solicitation  activities. Therefore, we think it is more appropriate for this  Center to assume the role of a coordinator. Of course, there is  a case when it is better that we be the principal player.    For example, in terms of the ``wind tunnel research  facility'' we have been pursuing as one of the focal points of  our own studies since the days of the previous organization, we  will continue our activities, carefully watching the move of the  central government. In order to achieve the objective in this  matter, we will try to collect information from related  government branches and their subordinate research organizations  through conferences (in Tokyo) and individual visits.    NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: How do you intend to proceed  on the Chubu Aerospace Technology Park Concept from now on?    MATSUNAGA: The concept consists of seven projects:  (1) Large Evaluation Test Center; (2) Space Technology Center,  (3) Earth Observation Center, (4) National Aerospace Research  Facility, (5) Aerospace Information Center, (6) Flight Test  Center, and (7) Aerospace Science and Technology Recreation  Arena.    Of those, the Information Center has already been realized,  as the gist of its activities is built into the activities plan  of this Promotion Center. As for the other projects in the  concept, we will be studying implementation plans and we will  move swiftly on to the solicitation activities when the plans  are completed; however, we will concentrate on the realization  of the wind tunnel research facility for the time being. In  addition to the above, we are also evaluating the  ``Aerospace-Related Arena'' as a part of next year's survey and  study activities.    NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: How many members do you have  at the moment, and what are the benefits of being a member?    MATSUNAGA: We have about 150 full members  (consisting of companies, local governments, economic  organizations, etc.) and a few supporting members.    There are quite a few merits to being a member. For example,  the members will be able to have access to NTIS research papers  (3,000-4,000 each year) free of charge. The members can meet  with various people from industry, government, and academic  circles, including people from different industries through  various technical conferences and forums.    Also, as a member, you can attend the lectures, seminars and  symposiums presented by authorities and specialists, and even  consult them on specific matters. We are planning to invite  authorities to our office as advisors once a week. The members  can participate in various field trips and visits to special  places, generally free of charge; the members will also receive  an information periodical (of the Center).    NIKKAN KOGYO SHIMBUN: Thank you very much for your  comments.    Address: 3-1-1, Sakae, Naka-ku, Nagoya.    [Box]    Chubu Aerospace Technology Park Concept    The intention of the Chubu Aerospace Technology Park Concept  is to bring a core research-and-development organization into  the Chubu district plus, at the same time, taking advantage of  the concentration of aerospace industry, sophisticated machining  and assembling technologies, research-and-production  technologies on new materials such as fine ceramics, which  already exist in this district, in order to form a general  research-and-production complex in this district.    It also aims at the integration and sophistication of local  industries through technology exchange with the aerospace  industry, which is an amalgamation of advanced technologies,  and, moreover, the creation of new industries based on such  advanced technologies in the district. The concept was generated  by the Chubu Aerospace Technology Park Concept Realization  Committee of the Chubu Regional Bureau of International Trade  and Industry in June 1990.    The Chubu district has the concentration of major aerospace  technology provided by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawaaski  Heavy Industries, and Fuji Heavy Industries, and the output of  that industry in this district represents more than half of the  national output. It claims a concentration of various  world-class frontier industry and research organizations, so  that the district has a great potential for becoming the leader  of the aerospace industry in the future.</p>

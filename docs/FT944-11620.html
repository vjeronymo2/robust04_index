			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Post Office seeks Pounds 100m cut in levy by Treasury The Post Office called yesterday for a Pounds 100m cut in its annual payment to the Treasury to compensate for the cabinet's refusal to back the privatisation plan put forward by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. Amid growing dismay among mainstream Conservatives at the cabinet's capitulation to a few rebels, senior ministers sought to dispel the impression of government drift by promising a 'radical' legislative programme in the next parliamentary session. But the uncertainty surrounding the future of the Post Office heightened as it became clear that many senior ministers, including Mr Heseltine, expect privatisation to re-emerge as the only viable option. As DTI and Treasury officials waited in vain for ministerial instructions to begin reviewing the remaining options for the Post Office, Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive, warned that only radical change could prevent a slow decline in market share. He said the Post Office 'urgently' needed a big cut in the Treasury levy, expected to amount to Pounds 213m next year, to finance an increase of up to Pounds 100m a year in spending on updated equipment. 'We will be saying to the government: 'If you bleed us white, we will not be able to deliver a first-class postal service'. That must mean leaving us with more of our profits to re-invest,' he told the FT in an interview. Friends of Mr Heseltine said he was still feeling 'sore' after his cabinet defeat on Thursday, and would not consider options for the Post Office until next week. Those options are likely to include a reduction in the levy, as well as changes to the rules governing capital spending and pricing. But Mr Heseltine was said to be convinced that support for privatisation will grow as it becomes clear that less radical changes are insufficient to protect the Post Office from private sector competition. Several senior Conservatives support this view, including Sir Norman Fowler, the former Conservative party chairman, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. Mr Clarke, who again ruled out changes to the Treasury rules covering Post Office borrowing, said he was 'sure the Post Office will one day be privatised'. Mr Heseltine, who dismissed suggestions that his political career had been soured by the privatisation debacle, mounted a strong defence of Mr John Major's continued command of the government. He said that the Queen's Speech on November 16, which sets out the government's legislative programme for the coming session, would be a 'relevant, radical, forward-looking speech by a government that is in charge'. However, the dispute over the Post Office appeared to have widened the gulf between Mr Major and the party's vituperative right wing.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 27 Jan (TANJUG)--Radovan Karadzic,  president of the republic of Srpska, has sent a letter to UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, in which he points to  facts showing that the Muslims in Bosnia are not interested in  establishing peace.    "Muslim Army Commander Rasim Delic reiterated threats  against  the Serb side on 25 January, while Muslim Prime Minister Haris  Silajdzic spoke of the concept of continuing the war in the  former Bosnia-Herzegovina on 26 January", Karadzic said in his  letter to Butrus-Ghali. "At the same time, Alija Izetbegovic is  visiting Muslim countries and is asking for their help, which  makes us believe that--despite their pretense that they want to  negotiate--the Muslims really never gave up their aspiration for  the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina", Karadzic stresses. According  to Karadzic, this aspiration is "in conflict with the interests  of the Serbian and Croatian people in Bosnia."    Recalling that the Serbs and the Croats signed an agreement  on the exchange of official representatives during the last  round of Geneva negotiations in order to resolve the  disagreements through political means, Karadzic notes that the  Muslims were also asked to sign a similar agreement, but did not  respond. "Muslim demands regarding territorial borders in  eastern and western Bosnia, which caused the breakup of the  negotiating process, rendered futile the cochairmen's attempts  to achieve a result in the peace process that would satisfy all  three sides in the conflict".    In his warning to Butrus-Ghali that Izetbegovic's strategic  objective is to halt the peace process, Karadzic notes that  Izetbegovic was essentially trying to buy time for importing  weapons and strengthening the military option.    "Tuzla airport is intended to be used for arms smuggling,  which would cause new incidents, for which--as usual--the Serbs  would be blamed", Karadzic warns and points out that the problem  of humanitarian aid deliveries can be resolved by widening the  land corridor to Tuzla. "Although humanitarian deliveries would  double this way, Muslim authorities still insist on opening  Tuzla airport in an attempt to create a crisis spot", Karadzic  says, and adds that the "problem" of replacing UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Forces] troops in Srebrenica has also proven to be  another Muslim insinuation. "This, however, does not decrease  the possibility of air strikes against the Serbs, despite the  fact that such an act could be catastrophic and could cause  far-reaching complications".    Karadzic goes on to say: "If we are attacked, we will  exercise our legitimate right to self-defense, in which we will  use all available forces".    "Now that Muslim intolerance is the only obstacle to peace,  I  cannot understand why the international community should discuss  such an absurd step for achieving absurd objectives," Karadzic  says. He adds that the Serbs have fought simply to be able to  live on the land they had succeeded in preserving through six  centuries of despotism under the Turkish and Austro-Hungarian  empires. "We shall fight for another six centuries if need be,  but we can have peace as early as tomorrow, provided the rights  of each side are respected", Karadzic says to Ghali.    In the conclusion of his letter the president of the Serb  Republic calls on the UN secretary general to do his utmost to  encourage U.S. diplomacy to clearly underline to the Muslim  government in Sarajevo the advantage of peace and the dangers of  continuing the war.</p>

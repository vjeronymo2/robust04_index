			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / The Long View: Garbage in, garbage out THESE ARE hard times for forecasters. Having got their 1991 economic predictions wrong by often 3 percentage points of national income - an enormous margin - it is beginning to look as though the same number-crunching disaster may be happening again in 1992. Take the Treasury, which is not actually the worst offender, in spite of all the political pressures on it last year to be starry-eyed. Last November its computer served up a forecast of 2 1/4 per cent economic growth in calendar 1992. By the time of the March Budget this had been revised down to 1 per cent. The Treasury has no reason to publish another official forecast until November, but the average growth in independent forecasts appears to have come down to under  1/2 per cent and this week the Treasury was warned by manufacturers that output, far from beginning to recover, is turning weak again. Elaborate computer models disguise the fact, but economic forecasts actually look backwards rather than forwards. This is because the model is designed to emulate past situations which appear to parallel those of the present, and it is then assumed that economic events will unfold in more or less the same way. The trouble comes when some crucial factor is different. There has been no recession like the present one since the 1930s, long before forecasting became popular. The memory chips have no relevant entries. This is why the uncomprehending electronic boxes have been cranking out empty promises of growth while the economy is locked into a declining trend. In the stock market, too, optimism is a hard habit to break. I remember being struck by the extraordinarily upbeat attitudes of stockbrokers at their seminars towards the end of last year. Brokers are always bullish, of course: no surprises there. But they normally predict a rise in share prices of 10 to 15 per cent over the ensuing year. Yet firms such as James Capel, Kleinwort Benson and Goldman Sachs were predicting gains of 25 to 30 per cent in 1992. On the back of a strong economic recovery, company profits were going to jump by up to 25 per cent. In fact the first half of the year has produced an advance of just 2 per cent in the All-Share Index, even including the boost from the Tory election victory. I never believed the economic recovery story, and last December I suggested that any profits upturn would be a story for 1993 rather than this year. But I thought that a fall in interest rates would encourage some modest share price gains. It turns out, however, that I was too optimistic in hoping that German interest rates would start coming down by the middle of the year. We will now be lucky to see any falls before 1993. Borrowers will remain badly exposed. Regular readers of this column will know that I have been appalled at the relentless build up of debt. Personal debt, for example, doubled between 1980 and 1990 as a percentage of disposable income: the ratio has stopped growing but it is not falling. To begin with the Treasury regarded such borrowing as unimportant, merely marking a 'portfolio shift' of assets and liabilities following financial market deregulation. By last year it realised it might be wrong, but politically could not afford to draw the logical conclusion that this debt mountain might prevent economic recovery. If house prices and national income continue to slide during the second half of the year the computer model will, however, surely have to be reprogrammed. But no serious policy changes are possible while the UK stays within the European exchange rate mechanism; and the ERM is surely sacrosanct during the UK's six-month presidency of the European Community. Government ministers are notoriously fond of saying that the economy is just about to pick up. Like the desperate company chairman who writes in his annual report that 'your company is extremely well-placed to benefit from any recovery in demand' Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer, is fond of saying that 'all the classic elements of recovery are in place'. Unfortunately they are not. The money supply is scarcely growing. Mortgage demand is weak. House prices are heading south. Without buoyancy here a sustained recovery will not happen. Tim Congdon of Lombard Street Research has supplied me with some interesting figures on housing debt. Mortgage indebtedness as a percentage of housing equity has now reached an all-time peak of 43 per cent. If house prices were to fall by 6 per cent over the next year (as they have over the last 12 months) this ratio could climb to nearly 50 per cent. At the bottom of the last recession, the ratio was not much more than 20 per cent; this time around there will be no debt-financed recovery. How can we get out of this mess? For the time being we will not follow the Americans, who this week slashed short-term interest rates to 3 per cent to stimulate the economy regardless of what happens to the dollar - now heading towards two to the pound. We could save our way out, and indeed this week's first quarter personal sector figures showed a saving ratio of 11.5 per cent, more than doubled in three years. Even so it would require many years of economic stagnation to pay down a substantial part of the debt burden like this. Perhaps the intolerable will lead to the unthinkable. A less serious debt hillock in the 1970s was levelled through inflation. In 1975 inflation was 25 per cent but the net interest rate on debt was only 7 per cent. That neatly chopped 18 per cent off real indebtedness in a year. But the debt is much bigger now, and we would need three years like that to halve it. It probably will not happen like that. But if you are an economic forecaster you might do well to give your computer some practice on data from the 1970s as well as the 1930s - if, of course, you still have a job.</p>

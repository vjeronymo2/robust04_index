			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Reject first-half losses deepen Mr Anthony Hawser, joint chairman of the Reject Shop, yesterday strongly condemned government policies which he said had helped deepen his company's first half losses from Pounds 301,000 to Pounds 587,000. The costs of the higher uniform business rate had offset virtually all savings on job cuts in the period, while raised VAT charges had been 'a terrible piece of timing. He said that despite drawbacks, the group had performed in line with expectations. This was achieved through strict attention to costs, and tighter control of working capital. Sales on a like-for-like basis fell by 16 per cent excluding VAT, and 14 per cent inclusive, for the 28 weeks to September 29. Total group sales were Pounds 8.9m (Pounds 9.2m), excluding VAT. Losses per share were 3.97p (2.1p) and the interim dividend again 1.05p.</p>

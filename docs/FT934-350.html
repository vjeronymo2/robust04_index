			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Private-sector pay rises 'are continuing to slow' Pay increases in the private sector are continuing to slow, says Incomes Data Services, an independent pay monitoring body. But it adds that they are still ahead of those in the public sector, where the government's 1.5 per cent ceiling has held firm. IDS says in research published today that many private-sector wage deals recorded in the fourth quarter have been worth less than 2 per cent. 'This represents a further edging down from levels of settlements which were already very low by the standards of recent decades,' says the report. IDS records the size of pay settlements, but does not cover earnings, which are higher because of bonus pay, overtime and other extras. IDS says public-sector bargaining groups have settled this year within the government's 1.5 per cent limit on the increase in wage bills. As a result, public-sector wage levels have generally trailed those in the private sector. It says that two-thirds of pay deals reported from the private sector since October recorded wage rises between 1 per cent and 2.9 per cent. In the July-September quarter, two-thirds of private-sector settlements were worth 2 per cent to 3.9 per cent. While pay freezes remain uncommon - only three were reported in the last quarter - just three wage deals were worth about 4 per cent or more. IDS says: 'Most current settlements are still comfortably ahead of the cost of living.' The pay databank published by the Confederation of British Industry today shows manufacturing pay deals averaging 2.2 per cent in the three months to the end of November, compared with 2.3 per cent in the previous quarter. But payrolls in manufacturing were up by less than 1 per cent in the year to September, reflecting improved efficiency. Manufacturers cited inability to raise prices and low profit levels as the main constraints on pay. In the quarter to November, pay deals in services were down from 2.6 per cent to a provisional 2.4 per cent. The CBI said pay freezes of up to 12 months had been reported by a quarter of manufacturers and one in six service companies. Incomes Data Services, 193 St John St, London EC1V 4LS.</p>

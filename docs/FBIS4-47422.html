Malykhin and S.A. Toropov (Sea Transport </F> Hygiene SRI, St.Petersburg); received 5-20-92; UDC 613.632.4-074]    [Abstract] Air environment in electronic industry  production premises andhermetically sealed production equipment  zones (PSPEs), which form a closed ecosystem,affects ergonomic  production conditions, personnel efficiency and product quality.  It is therefore necessary to continue to improve methodological  support of systems for measurement and control of air  environment. It is also important to control air pollution  levels (APLs) to prevent ecotoxicants (ETs) from entering the  personnel's organisms through inhalation. A procedure for  forming information on size distribution of aerosol particles  that can enter human body was developed. The methodological  principles are used for deriving matrices of forming measurement  information (MFMIs) are presented; estimates of the input of two  fractions to the distribution of aerodispersed ET carrierphase  are obtained as an example. Then the procedure is generalized to  the case of three to four fractions, by introducing additional  equations for constructing MFMIs. The procedure described in the  article is aimed at measuring air pollution in PSPEs using  impactors (devices that perform separation of aerosols by  dispersion fractions). It makes it possible to construct MFMIs  and estimate the input of individual consolidated dispersivity  ranges and total concentration, in order to control labor  conditions in an enterprise or to study new production processes  aimed at developing recommendations on improving the processes  in terms of their technological and hygiene criteria.

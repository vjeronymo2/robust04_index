"I don't know if we're close."  </P> <P> Claire, reached at his home in Pasadena, declined to comment.  </P> <P> Devereaux, 25, a right-handed hitting outfielder, was one of the players who  was supposedly heading for Baltimore in the Eddie Murray trade in December. But  the Orioles opted instead for pitcher Brian Holton.  </P> <P> Last year at Albuquerque, Devereaux batted .340 with 13 homers, 76 RBIs and 33  steals. With the Dodgers, he batted .116 in 43 at-bats.  </P> <P> Morgan was 1-6 for the Orioles last year. He began the season as a starter but  after going 0-5 through 7 starts, he went to the bullpen.  </P></p>

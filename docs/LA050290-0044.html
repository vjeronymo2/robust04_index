			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTRY MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> LOVELESS LEFT POINTLESS AS EMOTIONS ELUDE HER  </P> <P> As Patty Loveless was singing Monday night at the Crazy Horse Steak House and  Saloon, more than a couple of gentlemen in the audience looked at the  down-home-glamorous lass and shouted: "You're beautiful!" Between that and the  ring on her finger, one would guess that hers is not entirely the most apt of  names. But there was something lacking in Loveless' enjoyable -- but nearly  entirely forgettable -- 80 minutes of country-lite.  </P> <P> The late Buddy Rich, if memory serves, referred to country as "the sound of  ignorance," and within the limited confines of his purview, he may have had a  point. Most country music is simple stuff, with neither lyrics nor notes  generally requiring a degree in think-ology. But, perhaps because he had no  particular flair for it himself, Rich never realized that the music could  contain a wealth of understanding and expression about the human condition.  Within its simple framework can be shadings and inflections as illuminating as  any rarefied music.  </P> <P> Those personalizing details were missing from Loveless' show. The Kentucky  native seemed earnest in her delivery and displayed a capable voice in her  18-song set. Actually, it may have been those songs, more than a lack of  emotion on Loveless' part, that hampered things.  </P> <P> Drawn from her three albums and a pending new one, most of the tunes sounded as  if they had been glopped out of the same Nashville Jell-O mold, being  indistinguishable and not much to bite into. Among these were "Lonely Days,  Lonely Nights"; the recent single, "The Lonely Side of Love"; the mock-rock  "Blue Side of Town"; the new "Blue Memories," and the hit "Timber, I'm Falling  in Love." Far removed from country's grit, the latter's lyrics ("Right time,  right place / Right body, right face") would have sounded inane even in a '70s  disco.  </P> <P> Though still several dry counties removed from the emotional landscape Kathy  Mattea had explored on the Crazy Horse stage the previous Monday, a few songs  indicated that Loveless could develop a more individual voice. She has a strong  upper register, and when she let her high notes fly freer on "The Night's Too  Long" and the bluegrass ballad "Slow Healing Heart," they came close to  soaring. Loveless' finest moment came during "Baby's Gone Blues," a moody  atmospheric number that she infused with a melancholy ache nearly worthy of Don  Everly.  </P></p>

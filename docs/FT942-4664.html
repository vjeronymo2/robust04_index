			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices struggle in thin trading volumes - Market Report The London stock market had to struggle to hold on to the Footsie 3,000 mark at the close of trading yesterday after renewed weakness in British government bonds undermined equities. Trading volume remained poor, matching Monday's retail business total of Pounds 764.1m, which was among the lowest genuine daily totals for the past 12 months. Low volume again brought volatility in a market in which many fund managers appeared to have backed off until next week, when the elections to the European parliament will be out of the way. Uncertainty is focused in London because of the likelihood that Thursday's poll will deal a further blow to the political standing of Mr John Major's governing Conservative party. The FT-SE 100 Index finished 4.6 down at 3,004.8, but had traded between 3,014 and 2,993 during the session. Across the wider range of stocks, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed at 3,577.6 for a net gain of 6.2. Seaq volume of 482.9m shares compared with 436.4m in the previous session. Although economic news came mostly in other securities markets, equities in London continued to move under the influence of bond prices. Unsubstantiated rumours of further corporate problems in Germany helped to unsettle the markets, and widespread falls in UK gilts kept share prices under restraint. At Panmure Gordon, Mr Robin Aspinall warned that the decoupling of European bonds from the US may serve to emphasise the sale of overhanging positions built up when investors were playing between transatlantic markets. London markets turned cautious yesterday afternoon when investors were waiting for the US consumer credit statistics. After opening a shade easier, the stock market fell sharply within minutes as government bonds began to ease. The Footsie 3,000 mark was lost but only briefly. By mid-morning the index had rebounded to what was to prove the day's high of 3,014.8. Chart analysts were relieved to see the Footsie 3,000 level held since any loss would again leave the market struggling to find a new foothold. But the poor trading volumes in the market undermined the credibility of the rally. The final picture showed a somewhat mixed performance by blue chips. One of the strongest areas was the regional electricity generating companies, which moved up as the market assessed prospects for the National Grid that belongs to the 12 regional companies. Bank and financial shares were largely unable to extend the recovery of the previous session. Consumer stocks struggled to throw off the market's continued doubts over the outlook for consumer spending, with only a handful of food retailers finding support. Unilever, however, bounced significantly in the second half of the session on news that a Dutch supermarket would continue to stock the new detergent product which has attracted public attack from its principal rival. Worries in the retail sector were taken up by analysts at Robert Fleming, who maintained that the sector will 'lose momentum' this year, dragging down GDP performance in its wake. Fleming believes that neither recovery in investment nor stockbuilding will prove sufficient to replace what it identifies as missing personal consumption.</p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Clyde Blowers Despite recording a first-half loss before tax of Pounds 17,632, against a Pounds 33,723 profit, Clyde Blowers hoisted its interim dividend from 0.83p to 4p. Mr JA McColl, chairman, said the decision was in recognition of progress now being made and would reflect 'the pattern of profit recognition that we have the potential to achieve'. In addition, he said there was a need to reduce the excessive imbalance between the interim and final dividends - last year's final was 7.07p. He said he expected the operating loss of Pounds 205,163 (Pounds 56,174) to be reduced in the second half, with improved profitability from boiler cleaning equipment beginning to come through during the latter part of this year. The factory workload was high until the end of the current year. Sturtevant Engineering, acquired in April, had a healthy order book and plans were currently being implemented to increase turnover and profits of its material handling and vacuuming systems. Turnover for the half year to February 28 was Pounds 2.27m (Pounds 2.01m) and losses per share came to 1.76p (2.52p earnings).</p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Brussels agrees protection plan for investors THE European Commission yesterday approved proposals for protecting investors in stocks and shares whose savings are at risk through shaky or bankrupt investment firms. The scheme would require minimum coverage of Ecu20,000 (Pounds 15,470) as a safeguard for stock investors throughout the Community. This would match the limits set under a similar EC-wide bank deposit guarantee scheme which was agreed by EC ministers a week ago. EC finance ministers are expected to consider the compensation plan for stock and shares in the first half of next year. If approved, it would become effective in January 1996. This is the date when share dealers will be allowed to operate throughout the EC, once they are licensed in one of the 12 member states - a move which the Commission hopes will stimulate the growth of small investors. Under the Commission proposal, EC member states would repay 90 per cent of the first Ecu20,000 at risk. Some member states such as France, Germany and the UK believe that this limit is too low; however, Commission officials pointed out yesterday that it would be difficult to change the figure in the light of the bank deposit guarantee scheme. 'Some banks are involved in selling stocks and shares,' explained one Brussels official who said the latest proposal reflected the need for consistency of treatment of banks and investment firms. The plan would require investment firms to belong to a national compensation scheme which would then cover all the firm's investment clients, including those in other member states. Because the plan sets only minimum cover, EC countries with higher levels of compensation would be allowed to keep them. Most EC countries now provide higher protection for stock investors, but others such as Denmark, Spain and Portugal have no schemes or minimal compensation.</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Why falling inflation is still good news Towards the end of last year, I wrote that the UK economy bore the shape of a 'drooping L'. The phase of steeply falling output had come to an end; but production was still falling slightly. Since then, little has happened to change the picture. This is illustrated by the chart of manufacturing output. It would be as foolish to be depressed by this February's gloomy Bank of England Bulletin (which apparently was gloomier still before the Treasury got to work on it) as it would have been to be reassured by the Bank's more upbeat assessment in November; and I owe an apology to one or two small businessmen to whom I sent the November Bulletin. But wouldn't it be just too convenient if a similarly gloomy forecast from the Treasury (forecasters tend to move in flocks) were used to justify a Budget giveaway before the election? Such a giveaway would have nothing to do with the real Lord Keynes who advocated state and state-supported investment in a recession and was always wary of lasting deficits on current revenue and expenditure. The election is cited as a reason for caution by home buyers and businessmen alike. This is probably just an excuse for delay when they feel uncertain. What vast revelation they expect to get after polling day escapes me. If Labour wins, there will be some highly inefficient social redistribution through the mechanism of across-the-board increases in pensions and child benefit. There will be a mixture of reasonable removal of the ceiling on National Insurance contributions and a vindictive and counterproductive increase in the top marginal income tax rate from an effective 40 to 60 per cent. There will also be the threat of a legal minimum wage, and more support for the anti-social Social Charter. But these are insidious longer-term dangers, and would not quickly transform the business outlook. Nor, for that matter, would any success in the education and training programmes about which Labour spokesmen talk so incessantly. There is, however, one unambiguous piece of immediate good news. That is the rapid fall in the rate of inflation, which is much steeper than anything to be indicated by tomorrow's Retail Prices Index. A much better indicator of trends is the Producer Output Price Index. It has now fallen - excluding food, drink and tobacco which are affected by Budget changes - on a seasonally corrected basis, to 2 per cent per annum, the lowest since the start of the series. The RPI is being dragged above this level by faster increases in the service sector. Retail prices of services other than housing and public utilities rose by 10 1/2 per cent in the year to last December. But some relief is coming on this front, too. Not only have reported pay settlements in manufacturing fallen, according to the CBI Databank, to 4.1 per cent in the last quarter of 1991, the lowest since the Databank began (in 1980). This series reflects, more than it causes, inflationary pressure. But in addition, the much more sluggish private services sector reports a fall to 6.1 per cent in the second half of last year, down from a peak of more than 9 per cent in 1989. Manufacturing productivity growth is now recovering strongly: to 5 per cent per annum, according to the CBI, and nearly 3 per cent according to official estimates. Even allowing for wage drift, the gap between pay and productivity is now close to the 2 per cent normal among Britain's main competitors. When inflation is low, the opinion polls show that jobs and recovery are the top priorities. But once the upturn comes, inflation goes back to the head of the agenda and unemployment is relegated. Thus those take as their motto 'I am their leader, I must follow them' will run from pillar to post. In fact low and falling inflation is still a blessing. For it provides headroom for a recovery of output. The postwar view that governments could spend their way into prosperity has been exploded. But nor is there any excuse for governments and central banks to stand idly by if the world looks like spiralling into depression. What they can do, especially if they act in concert, is maintain an expansion of demand in money terms sufficient to support a rate of real growth in line with the growth of productive capacity, but not to finance inflation. This common sense can be called reconstructed Keynesianism, or monetarism without mysticism. For most industrial countries a 5 per cent per annum growth rate of nominal GDP - that is, GDP in actual money  - will be something close to what is desirable. So if underlying inflation falls below this figure there is headroom for a resumption of growth. This is the case in the UK and in the Group of Seven summit countries as a whole. For the first time since the 1973 oil price explosion, worldwide demand expansion in money terms has been insufficient for normal non-inflationary growth and it is reasonable to think of a stimulus. The main exception is Germany where nominal GDP growth has been above 6 per cent because of the boom in the west following unification. In the UK, annual nominal GDP growth (at 'factor cost' to avoid tax distortions) is down to 3 or 3 1/2 per cent, the lowest since the early 1960s. Will, however, national authorities go in for this minimal degree of demand management? The excuse that nominal GDP estimates are late and erratic does not hold water, if one is concerned with responding to trends rather than fine tuning. Indeed the US and Japan are acting to maintain nominal demand growth, without using the terminology. So too, if a little less clearly, is the Bundesbank which wants to stamp on inflation but certainly not to produce deflation. I prefer to talk about policy rather than personal indebtedness, because nobody knows how far consumers and businessmen will want to reduce borrowing before resuming their normal spending habits. Suppose this takes a long time. What can governments do? I doubt whether fiscal policy can help - except by strictly temporary tax cuts  - if only because the budgetary outlook in so many countries is so bleak. Monetary policy is still the most promising route. The limits of interest rate policy have not been reached. But if they ever are, Keynes did speak of burying pound notes in the ground and leaving it to the forces of self-interest to dig them up. Milton Friedman has spoken of dropping dollar bills by helicopter. It is not time for these heroic devices yet, given that nominal demand is still only a little below a normal growth path - having descended from highly inflationary rates. Are countries such as the UK and France barred from either conventional monetary policy or more spectacular gestures because of the exchange rate mechanism? Yes. But they are not powerless. The weapons that the non-German ERM members must adopt are more like those of a peripheral region within a currency area that is not enjoying the boom conditions at the centre. The main recourse for these areas is frankly to price themselves back into work, which Britain and France are indeed doing. If the non-German ERM members can just hang on some while longer to the policies which have brought about low inflation, the heavy cavalry of the Bundesbank will come up from behind. They may not say so in Frankfurt; but once Germany is over the inflationary hump, interest rates there could fall quite quickly and the G7 would be ripe for another attempt at joint monetary management.</p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WIND-PRODUCED ENERGY IS ALREADY SUBSTANTIAL  </P> <P> James Flanigan's column, "Clean Air Act Will Fuel New Technologies" (Oct. 31),  about the benefits of the federal clean air legislation is off base on at least  one point.  </P> <P> Commercial generation of electricity by wind and solar power will not have to  wait until the next decade as Flanigan predicts.  </P> <P> It has been growing steadily in California during the past decade. In 1989,  wind energy produced 1% of the state's (the world's eighth-largest economy)  total energy demand for that year, enough to power a city the size of San  Francisco.  </P> <P> Commercial generation of electrical energy by wind power began in 1981. Since  then, turbine performance, energy production and the number of turbines  continue to grow, despite the lack of tax incentives or government subsidies.  </P> <P> Los Angeles and Kern counties are recipients of a major portion of this energy.  During windy days, wind turbines in the Tehachapis produce more than 200  million watts of electrical power, enough to satisfy demand in the Antelope  Valley.  </P> <P> The wind industry is not waiting for clean air legislation as an incentive to  begin commercial generation. We have been producing electrical energy without  air pollution for the past decade.  </P> <P> KEVIN COUSINEAU  </P> <P> The writer is manager of electronics research and development at Zond Systems  Inc., a wind farm development firm in Tehachapi.  </P> <P> </P></p>

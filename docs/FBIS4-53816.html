			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Pan Ying-chen and Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 23 (CNA) -- Vietnamese Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet said here Monday [23 May] he hopes to visit  Taiwan.    "I look forward to visiting Taiwan to see for myself the  general situation there, but so far I have not received any  invitation from Taiwan," Vo said after attending the opening  session of the 27th annual meeting of the Pacific Basin Economic  Council (PBEC).    Many Taiwan officials and business leaders, including  Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang and Chairman Ting Shan-li  of the Kuomintang-owned Central Trade and Investment Co., have  met with Vo in Vietnam during the past year. A number of  Vietnamese officials, including the head of its Prime Minister's  Office, have also visited Taiwan in recent years.    Despite the absence of diplomatic ties, substantive  relations  between Taiwan and Vietnam have grown steadily since the late  1980s. Taiwan is now Vietnam's largest source of foreign  capital, with an aggregate direct investment of about U.S.$1.6  billion.    Vo said he hopes Taipei-Hanoi economic cooperation can be  further strengthened.    Vo arrived in Kuala Lumpur Sunday to attend the opening  ceremony of the May 21-25 annual meeting of the PBEC, a  non-governmental forum for bankers and business leaders from  Pacific Basin countries to exchange views and forge cooperative  ties.</p>

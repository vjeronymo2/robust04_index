			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIDDEN HILLS TO SCRAP REDEVELOPMENT PANEL, SAYS IT SERVES NO USE;  </P> <P> AGREEMENTS: THE AFFLUENT, GATED COMMUNITY ADMITS A MISTAKE. IT WILL DISBAND THE  AGENCY IN DECEMBER AND RETURN A PORTION OF THE MONEY TO THE COUNTY.  </P> <P> The Hidden Hills Redevelopment Agency -- the target of criticism and legal  challenges since its inception six years ago -- will disband next month, the  Hidden Hills city attorney said Friday.  </P> <P> "The city had no use for a redevelopment agency," City Atty. Michael Jenkins  said. "It was a mistake."  </P> <P> Under a tentative agreement with Los Angeles County, the city will dissolve the  agency and return a portion of the redevelopment money it has received to the  county, which will use the money to build low-income housing.  </P> <P> The city no longer wants the agency because under state law a portion of the  redevelopment money it is collecting from the county must be spent for  low-income housing inside the boundaries of Hidden Hills, a gated, affluent  community of 2,000 residents. The requirement had infuriated many residents who  did not want such housing in their neighborhood.  </P> <P> The city created the agency in 1984 to raise money to build a storm drain along  Long Valley Road. County officials, however, filed a lawsuit contending that  the city was abusing state laws by declaring itself a redevelopment area, a  designation usually reserved for blighted inner-city neighborhoods.  </P> <P> The lawsuit was dropped in 1988 after the city agreed to spend 20% of the  redevelopment money on low-income housing and the county agreed to build the  storm drain project.  </P> <P> Some city officials then moved ahead with plans to use redevelopment money on a  combined residential-commercial-office complex that would have included  low-income housing. But residents objected when they learned that developer  Danny Howard's proposal included a 46-unit apartment building for the elderly  on city land outside its gates. The City Council failed to approve the project  in the face of the opposition.  </P> <P> In December, Howard filed a $10-million lawsuit against the city, contending he  had lost money because Hidden Hills had reneged on an agreement to let him  proceed with the project. The city agreed Thursday to pay Howard $1 million to  settle that suit.  </P> <P> As part of the agreement to disband the redevelopment agency, some of the money  will pay for environmental studies and easements needed for construction of a  storm drain. The remainder will be given to the county for affordable housing,  Jenkins said.  </P> <P> Deputy County Counsel Manuel A. Valenzuela Jr., who is working with Jenkins to  dissolve the agency, said although the county has agreed to build the storm  drain for Hidden Hills, the city will be responsible for buying easements and  completing the necessary environmental studies.  </P> <P> Jenkins also said the city will try to relinquish jurisdiction over the 26  acres it annexed from the county -- land on which Howard had planned to build  the low-income housing and an office building and retail center.  </P></p>

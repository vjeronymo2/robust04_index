			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / UK Company News: Smiths hints of expansion plans - Difficult trading conditions in aerospace side cut profits to Pounds 44.3m SMITHS INDUSTRIES, the UK defence and aerospace components group, which has net cash of Pounds 95m, yesterday hinted that it was preparing to go on the acquisition trail. Mr Roger Hurn, chairman and chief executive, told analysts the group's management was ready for 'a major challenge'. Although not ruling out anything, it seems likely Smiths would seek to diversify away from the defence and civil aerospace sectors. The group has a high reputation in the City and could easily issue more shares for a takeover. Difficult trading conditions in aerospace were blamed for a 12.5 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds 44.3m (Pounds 50.7m) in the six months to February 1, even though turnover rose from Pounds 288m to Pounds 307.4m. Medical systems lifted trading profits by 17 per cent to Pounds 11.6m and industrial profits rose to Pounds 8m (Pounds 7.1m), boosted by a US acquisition. Turnover in aerospace was slightly down at Pounds 184m (Pounds 186m) and trading profits fell from Pounds 24.6m to Pounds 18.2m. Smiths said it did well to achieve profit margins of almost 10 per cent against a background of defence cuts and reduced demand from large airlines. The group this week announced 450 redundancies among aerospace workers in the US and UK. Its overall workforce has been cut from 13,500 to 11,200 in the past two years. Mr Hurn said he hoped this would be the final round of job cuts in the present recession. Best performer was medical systems, which raised sales to Pounds 63.8m (Pounds 56.8m) and trading profits to Pounds 11.6m (Pounds 9.9m). European and North American operations performed strongly, and Middle Eastern markets recovered. Eastern Europe was also generating firm orders. The industrial side lifted turnover to Pounds 59.6m (Pounds 45.2m) and trading profit to Pounds 8m (Pounds 7.1m). This expansion was helped by the Pounds 33m acquisition of Flexible Technologies, a US manufacturer of hoses, pipes and flexible connectors, which made a significant contribution after financing costs and increased its share of a depressed market. The other industrial businesses performed creditably, with encouraging results from the UK engineering companies. Earnings per share fell to 10.1p (11.4p) but the interim dividend is 4.1p (3.9p). COMMENT What would Smiths buy? Market speculation has for some time singled out Dowty, the aerospace components manufacturer, but most observers think Smiths wants to reduce, not increase, its exposure to the woes of defence and civil aviation. Medical systems has proved a very lucrative niche, but would be expensive to expand by acquisition, rather than continued organic growth. The success of last year's Flexible Technologies purchase suggests industrial companies will provide the happiest hunting ground, with no shortage of recession-struck targets. Smiths is currently forecast to earn Pounds 109m this year, which puts the shares - up 16p to 309p - on a modest multiple of 12.4. The high regard in which Mr Hurn and his team are held in the City does not outweigh general pessimism about the outlook for defence and civil aviation. Some analysts consider the shares are already good value, but they are unlikely to enjoy a significant re-rating until the acquisition intentions are clearer.</p>

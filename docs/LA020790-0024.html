			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A TRUE COMPROMISE: 'NOBODY LIKES IT';  </P> <P> SCHOOLS: THE DECISION ON A YEAR-ROUND SCHEDULE WAS A WRENCHING ONE FOR THE L.A.  BOARD, BUT THE DISTRICT HAD TO DEAL WITH EXPLOSIVE ENROLLMENT GROWTH.  </P> <P> Los Angeles school board member Roberta Weintraub called it the board's most  difficult meeting in the last decade. At times, it deteriorated into  name-calling and was punctuated by yelling and tears.  </P> <P> But eight hours after they began the debate, board members voted early Tuesday  to put the entire 610,000-student Los Angeles Unified School District on a  year-round schedule, beginning in July, 1991.  </P> <P> The final plan was a compromise that ordered a common calendar for virtually  all schools, and allowed 109 schools originally slated to go year-round this  summer to remain on traditional calendars until the remainder of the district  converts in 1991.  </P> <P> "It was a true compromise in the sense that nobody likes it," board President  Jackie Goldberg said Tuesday. "But it does the things that had to happen. We  had to have more space, and we had to have a common calendar, and this does  both."  </P> <P> The plan satisfied many parents, who had feared that the board would force some  schools to go year-round this year, without enough time to plan for the switch.  But it left others uneasy that the result will be a district full of schools  crammed beyond capacity.  </P> <P> "I don't know that this solves the problems," said Laura Ziskin, parent of a  Canyon Elementary School student and one of the organizers of a rally last  weekend that drew hundreds of parents protesting year-round schools.  </P> <P> "What's going to happen in 1993 when everybody's on multi-track and we still  don't have room? I think our concerns are still the same -- the focus (in the  district) is not on education."  </P> <P> But board member Leticia Quezada expressed hope Tuesday that approval of the  plan -- after years of vacillation -- will spell the end of the era of  scrambling to find seats for students and allow the board to refocus on  instructional issues.  </P> <P> "It puts to rest the housing questions and allows us to deal with the  educational issues," she said. "My hope is there's enough people out there who  will say, 'This is a modest, sensible approach that mandates change, but does  not order it tomorrow.'  </P> <P> "I hope we can all get through the process by trying to make it work. The other  choice -- to do nothing -- is not a real choice."  </P> <P> The move to a year-round calendar and the requirement that all schools in the  district increase their capacities by 23% by 1993 is expected to generate about  60,000 seats in a district that is growing by about 15,000 students each year.  </P> <P> The switch to year-round will also help the district compete for more  construction and air-conditioning money from the state -- which offers  year-round districts priority in tapping the limited funds.  </P> <P> In Sacramento, state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig characterized the  year-round plan as inevitable in a district experiencing such explosive growth.  "If they didn't do something, they were in trouble," he said. "They postponed  it two years ago, and now 24,000 (students) are being bused" because they can't  be accommodated in their overcrowded neighborhood schools.  </P> <P> "Year-round may not be the best solution, but it's better than what the  alternatives would have been," he said.  </P> <P> The plan, approved 5 to 2 after split votes on many of its 19 separate  measures, requires 109 elementary schools to increase their capacities this  year, by either increasing class sizes, using a multi-track year-round schedule  or adding portable classrooms. The remainder of the district's 400 schools not  already on multi-track, year-round schedules must increase their capacities by  the 1992-93 school year.  </P> <P> Voting against the plan were West San Fernando Valley representative Julie  Korenstein, who said she does not support the concept of a common calendar for  all schools, and South-Central Los Angeles representative Rita Walters, a  perennial proponent of year-round schools.  </P> <P> "I still support year-round for the entire district, but I voted (against it)  as a protest to the actions (other board members) were taking," Walters said  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Walters accused several of her colleagues of trying to manipulate the  year-round calendar to provide the longest possible summer vacation for  students at single-track schools, while shortening the summer vacation of some  multi-track students.  </P> <P> "What is best for the 15% (the percentage of Anglo students in the district) is  driving the decision-making on what is best for 85% of the children," she said.  "My constituents are sick of being on the short end of the stick."  </P> <P> Monday night's acrimonious hearing reflected the highly charged nature of the  debate over year-round -- an issue perceived very differently by board members  representing overcrowded areas that desperately need the seats year-round  provides, and suburban areas that see year-round as a threat to neighborhood  stability.  </P> <P> While every board member acknowledged the need to increase space in the  district, it appeared at several points during the protracted debate that the  board would not be able to muster the four-vote majority necessary to approve  any plan to generate the seats.  </P> <P> In the board's first vote of the evening, the specific measure to adopt a  year-round schedule was rejected when board members could not agree on a common  calendar. Then, board members reconsidered the measure and approved it 4 to 3.  </P> <P> "When you get into emotional issues like this that are extremely political,  with such an enormous amount of public interest, things are pulling at you from  every area," said Roberta Weintraub, who represents the East San Fernando  Valley.  </P> <P> "There is no way you're going to make an unemotional, totally logical decision.  You're going to try and sit there and balance on the teeter-totter until you  can find a place to rest without falling off."  </P> <P> During the marathon discussion that began at 5 p.m. Monday and ended at 1 a.m.  Tuesday, the original plan was transformed by a myriad of amendments and  compromises to provide wider latitude to schools in choosing single or  multi-track calendars -- a victory for parents who had complained that they had  too little time to adapt to a year-round calendar and worried about fragmenting  the community.  </P> <P> "My thinking was if we could delay the plan a year to give people as much lead  time as possible, then . . . give them more flexibility for schools to work  together to come up with a plan . . . that was the core of a package that I  could support," said Mark Slavkin, who proposed an amendment giving schools  more flexibility in determining options to reach the 23% capacity increase.  </P> <P> District officials estimate that about 130 of the district's 600 schools will  be on multi-track schedules by September because there is no other way for them  to increase space.  </P> <P> Others will probably convert to multi-track during the next few years, if  enrollment growth projected at more than 15,000 per year materializes.  </P> <P> Nevin Avenue Elementary School in South-Central Los Angeles is one of the  schools that will probably go multi-track year-round this year. About 685  students attend the school, and another 300 are bused as far away as San Pedro  and Granada Hills because they cannot be accommodated at Nevin.  </P> <P> About 125 of those students could return to the school if it went year-round.  Principal Louis Owens said parents are not entirely happy with the year-round  proposal, but "they will adjust."  </P> <P> "The problem is we have run out of options," Owens said. "Even if we could  build schools at a record pace, we couldn't keep up. And who would pay? Nobody  would pay for the bond issues that will build new schools. We have no choice."  </P> <P> Parents at the nearby USC Performing Arts Magnet School worried that the change  to a year-round calendar would be incompatible with the school's mission.  </P> <P> "As a parent, I realize that the school district is between a rock and a hard  place," said Stanley Yon, father of two children at the school. "But  potentially, it is very disrupting."  </P> <P> His 9-year-old daughter may not be able to attend a special summer session of  the Joffrey Ballet school in New York next year because it could conflict with  the new year-round schedule, he said.  </P> <P> And teachers worried that scheduling music, dance or drama performances will be  difficult under a multi-track schedule that rotates students in and out of  school.  </P> <P> Besides the year-round provisions, the plan approved by the board also:  </P> <P> * Provides air-conditioning first to those schools that volunteer to go  multi-track year round.  </P> <P> * Orders Burton Street Elementary School in Panorama City reopened to serve as  a receiving school for children from nearby overcrowded neighborhoods. The  school was one of several closed because of declining enrollment in the 1980s.  </P> <P> * Reconfigures campuses in the Verdugo Hills High School area to shift ninth  graders to high school and sixth graders to junior high, opening up seats for  younger students in the elementary schools.  </P> <P> * Loosens requirements on how many portable classrooms a school can  accommodate, while restricting any school from using portables to push their  enrollment above 1,000.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Richard Beene contributed to this story.  </P></p>

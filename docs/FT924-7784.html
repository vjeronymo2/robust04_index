			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Deng pushes HK hard line DENG XIAOPING, China's senior leader, has told the Chinese leadership not to compromise in its opposition to the proposals of Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, for greater democracy in the territory. According to Chinese officials, the 88-year-old Deng has given instructions that any measures introduced without Beijing's consent should be repudiated after China assumes sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997. The disclosure that implacable hostility to Mr Patten's plans stems from the highest level in Beijing clouds the prospects for a visit to Britain by Zhu Rongji, a Chinese vice premier recently promoted to the Communist party politburo. Zhu arrives tomorrow for five days of meetings with British politicians and companies. He will meet Mr John Major, the prime minister, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. Mr Patten will be in London to consult Mr Major and Mr Hurd, and is likely to have informal contact with Zhu. Zhu, whose main role is in economic reform, will visit London's stock, futures and insurance exchanges and will see companies which have done significant business with China. He is expected to receive advice from merchant banks on how to privatise China's bloated and loss-making state industries. Beijing is anxious to take a 'business as usual' approach to relations with London, separating Hong Kong from other issues. However, Mr Patten's proposals have caused a rift in Sino-British relations and British officials expect Hong Kong to be raised. London and Hong Kong have urged Beijing to discuss the 1995 election plan suggested by Mr Patten, but it has responded with threats of turmoil after 1997. Chinese officials said that before Mr Patten visited Beijing last month, Deng met Li Peng, prime minister, Lu Ping, head of Hong Kong policy, and Zhou Nan, China's representative in Hong Kong, to decide how to deal with the governor's plans.</p>

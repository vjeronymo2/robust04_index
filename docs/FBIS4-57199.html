			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Text of Law No. 26301 on the application of Habeas Data] </F>   [Text] Law No. 26301    CONSIDERING THAT:    The Democratic Constituent Congress [CCD] has approved the  following Law:    THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC    Hereby decrees:    Article 1. Until a specific Law on the subject is dictated,  any petition concerning the Habeas Data Constitutional Guarantee  mentioned in Clause No. 3 of Article No. 200 of the Constitution  may be heard, at the plaintiff's choice, by a lower civil court  of either the venue where the plaintiff resides; or of where the  mechanical, automatic [telematicos], magnetic, informatic, or  similar records are located; or of the venue corresponding to  the address of the defendant, irrespective of whether the  defendant is an individual or a corporation, a public or private  company.    If the violation of rights stems from court records, be they  of a jurisdictional, functional, or administrative nature, no  matter where and how they are stored, the case will be heard by  the respective Civil Chamber of the Superior Court of Justice,  which will appoint a lower court judge to handle the procedure.  The lower court will then hand down the first ruling in this  case. This same precept will apply to functional or  administrative archives of the Attorney General's Office.    Article 2. The court ruling will merely order the  publication  of the rectification requested by the plaintiff, who must have  attached the wording of it to his original petition. If he fails  to do so, the court will offhandedly dismiss the petition. The  rectification--which must be reasonable and proportionate to the  offending article--will be published free of charge within three  days after the ruling has become final. Failure to do so will  result in violation of the law.    Any disagreement regarding the rectification, its  proportionality, and its content will be decided on by the  corresponding judge or civil chamber of the Superior Court,  after hearing the defendant within three days. The judge must  correct or restrict the requested rectification whenever it  entails a rebuttal or viewpoint that surpasses the limits of a  mere rectification. Although the aggrieved party may appeal, the  ruling will stand until it is reversed by a higher court.    Article 3. Provisions applicable to Laws No. 23506, 25011,  25315, 25398, and Decree Law No. 25433, and everything referring  to the right of Amparo, with the exception of the provisions of  Article No. 11 of Law No. 23506, will be applicable to the  Habeas Data Constitutional Guarantee in case of procedural  loopholes.    Article 4. The provisions contained in the above articles  will also be applicable to the constitutional guarantee known as  Action of Compliance that is mentioned in Clause 6 of Article  200 of the Constitution until the appropriate implementing law  is promulgated. In this case, the provisions contained in  Article 11 of Law 23506 will be applied when necessary.    Article 5. In addition to what is provided for in Article 27  of Law 23506 and supplementary instruments, a petition for a  Compliance Action Constitutional Guarantee will require the  following prior steps:    A. In the case of a habeas data petition based on Clauses 5  and 6 of Article 2 of the Constitution, the request should first  be made through a notary public no less than 15 calendar days in  advance, with the exceptions provided for in the Constitution  and in the laws.    B. In the case of a Habeas Data petition based on Clause 7  of  Article 2 of the Constitution, the request should first be made  through a notary public no less than five calendar days in  advance of the publication of the corresponding rectification;  and    C. In the case of an Action of Compliance, the request will  be made through a notary public to the pertinent authority  asking him to discharge what is considered to be his duty under  the law, or the fulfillment of the appropriate administrative  action or undertaking no less than 15 days in advance. Honoring  this request will not exempt the official from his  responsibilities under the law.    Article 6. A request concerning the Habeas Data  Constitutional Guarantee will be directed against the legal  representative of the respective institution or corporation,  except when the action is directed against an individual. In the  latter case, the individual will be summoned directly without  this having any bearing on the provisions of Article 12 of Law  25398.    To this end, legally constituted media organizations,  irrespective of the type of communication used--whether oral,  written, radio, press, or television--can name a Special  Judicial Representative, through a notarial deed, who will have  the full right, on the merit of his naming, to the powers  outlined in Articles 74 and 75 of the Civil Code, and no pact to  the contrary could be used to interfere with these powers. He  will be empowered to act in the name the media that has been  summoned or in the name of its editors, officials, journalists,  or employees in general even if they have been summoned as  individuals. The individual that is summoned by name will be  held legally accountable for his action.    The appointment of the special judicial representative need  not be registered in the public rosters, and his actions will be  fully valid, even though his naming has been previously revoked,  until the appropriate court or chamber has been informed of this  fact.    The authorization to empower a judicial representative will  also be extended to the actions pertaining to crimes against  honor (defamation, insult, or slander) when the crime is  attributed to a media organization.    Article 7. The Constitutional guarantee of the Action of  Compliance will be directly attended to by the official or  agency in charge of the required action. If the agency or  official could not be identified, or if there is no certainty as  to who should attend to it, the action will be directed to a  more senior superior without prejudice to what has been  established in Article 12 of Law No. 25398.  <H5>  Temporary Provision </H5>   A. Habeas Data petitions filed before the present law  becomes  effective, on which no ruling has yet been handed down by a  judicial authority having a different specialty from the one  described under Article 1 of the present law, will be officially  and under liability turned over to the civil first instance  judge who was on duty on the date the request was filed;    B. Habeas Data petitions that had been filed before the  present law becomes effective, and rejected by a final judicial  ruling, will have full effect. Those petitions on which no final  ruling has been passed will be turned over to the judicial  authority hearing those cases pursuant to what has been  stipulated in the above paragraph;    C. Habeas Data petitions approved by a final judicial ruling  issued by a judicial authority other than the one indicated  under Article 1 before the present law becomes effective will  continue with its procedure before the said authority. These  petitions will be dealt with and settled pursuant to the rules  of procedure set forth for a writ of Amparo and the present law  pursuant to the provisions of Article 2 of this law.  <H5>  FINAL PROVISION </H5>   The present law will come into force on the day subsequent  to  its publication in the EL PERUANO DIARIO OFICIAL.    Let it be known to the President of the Republic for its  publication.    In Lima, 18 April 1994.    Jaime Yoshiyama    President of the Democratic Constituent Congress    TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC    Hence:    I order it to be published and enforced.    Given at Government House, in Lima, on 2 May 1994.    Alberto Fujimori Fujimori    Constitutional president of the Republic    Fernando Vega Santa Gadea    Justice minister</p>

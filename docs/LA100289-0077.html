			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> UTAH GAME EASY TO LOOK BACK ON FOR AZTECS' LUGINBILL  </P> <P> After rehashing non-winning football games for three previous Sundays, San  Diego State Coach Al Luginbill was finally given a chance to discuss a  successful effort -- a 38-27 defeat of Utah Saturday night, featuring a  510-yard passing performance by quarterback Dan McGwire.  </P> <P> It was Luginbill's first victory as a major college coach. But instead of  talking about personal achievement, Luginbill seemed relieved that his team's  hard work had finally translated into a victory.  </P> <P> "I'm not into personal things too much, I'm more concerned with the team,"  Luginbill said. "We were improving every week, but we had nothing to show for  it. I was hoping that the improvement would eventually equate to wins. I was  also pleased that the team remembered the fight song after the game."  </P> <P> Luginbill seemed even more pleased with an improved running game that netted  149 yards in 49 carries against Utah. Darrin Wagner, a redshirt freshman from  Lincoln High, ran especially well, gaining 97 yards in 25 carries.  </P> <P> "We're going to be difficult to defend because of the run," Luginbill said.  </P> <P> But Luginbill could not help but note the importance of the forward pass and  praise the performance by McGwire, the fourth-best passing day in Aztec  history.  </P> <P> "I think he's gotten better every week," Luginbill said. "But he can still  improve. That's what makes this offense scary."  </P> <P> The defense also showed signs of becoming a bit more frightening, particularly  to opposing quarterbacks. They eclipsed their yearly sack total by two with  seven of Utah quarterback Scott Mitchell.  </P> <P> "Our defense came up with the big play when we had to," Luginbill said. "Our  600 yards would have gone right down the drain if we didn't play defense."  </P> <P> Nickel back John Wessleman, who had 16 tackles, came up with the biggest play  of the game when he intercepted a Mitchell pass late in the fourth quarter with  Utah trailing, 31-21.  </P> <P> One of the few negatives Luginbill detected was the Aztecs' continuing problem  with penalties. After being flagged 13 times for 135 yards, San Diego State is  averaging 9.5 penalties and 83 yards a game to its opponents' 5.5 and 39.5.  </P> <P> One of those 13 penalties was an unsportsmanlike foul on Luginbill for  insisting on a pass interference call that never came.  </P> <P> "I was wrong because I went on the field to question it," Luginbill said.  "There's no excuse for it, but (the official) was ready for me. He damn near  hit me in the face with the flag."  </P> <P> Luginbill also defended his decision to go for a first down on fourth and one  inch from his own 15 late in the first quarter.  </P> <P> "If you can't make one inch, you're not a very physical football team," he  said.  </P> <P> The Aztecs were never given a chance to show how physical they were. They  jumped offsides, which forced Luginbill to call in the punting team.  </P> <P> Aztec Notes  </P> <P> Wide receiver Monty Gilbreath became SDSU's all-time leader in all-purpose  yards with 3,658, passing Chris Hardy. With seven receptions for 142 yards, he  also passed Cleveland Browns receiver Webster Slaughter on the all-time yardage  list, moving into ninth place with 1,700. . . . Wide receiver Dennis Arey  pulled a hamstring early in the game, and his status will be reviewed  throughout the week. . . . Freshman kicker Andy Trakas, who missed two of three  field goals, was replaced on kickoffs by senior Tom Wurth in the second half.  Luginbill said the kicking and kickoff jobs will be decided during the week.  </P></p>

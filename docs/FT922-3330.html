			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Yeltsin in defence shake-up: Russia's young generals to overhaul the army PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday appointed army commanders to top positions in the new Russian defence ministry and called for effective borders with the Baltic republics in an attempt to stop western spies from infiltrating Russia. In a move going some way to restoring the land forces to their traditionally dominant role, Colonel-General Viktor Dubynin, former commander of Soviet armed forces in Poland, became first deputy defence minister and chief of staff. Colonel-General Valery Mironov, commander of Russian forces in the Baltics, will be deputy minister responsible for personnel and training. The two other new deputy ministers are Colonel-General Vladimir Toporov, until now the commander of the Moscow military district, and General Georgy Kondratiev, who has been in charge of the Turkestan military district which covers all of Central Asia. Since key army commanders supported the abortive August coup against President Mikhail Gorbachev, the army's influence has been curtailed with the air force supplying the Commonwealth defence minister, Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov. The Russian defence minister, General Pavel Grachev is a former paratrooper. Apart from loyalty to President Yeltsin and their contacts in politically sensitive areas such as the Moscow military district, another trait of the new men is their relative youthfulness, with most in their late 40s. Illustrating his difficult balancing act in pushing through unpopular economic reforms and keeping conservative forces happy, President Yeltsin told a meeting of top military men that there was no alternative to recent price rises but promised officers an 80 per cent pay increase. Speaking ahead of a trip to the US next week, during which both sides hope to conclude fresh cuts in long-range nuclear weapons, he also accused Washington of seeking unilateral advantage over Russia in current arms negotiations. Mr Yeltsin assured the top brass that he would resist US attempts to dictate nuclear arms cuts that would strip Moscow of its multiple-warhead, land-based missiles, the heart of its force, but leave Washington with potent sea-launched systems. 'If such a decision is taken, the United States would find itself in a more advantageous position,' he told the gathering at the white marble 'Russian Pentagon'. The existing accord would force the US to cut its arsenal from 12,000 to about 10,000 nuclear warheads and the ex-Soviet states to slash their arsenals from about 10,000 warheads to 8,000. Both sides are seeking further reductions, with Washington proposing a 4,700 ceiling and Moscow advocating 2,500. He also said in an interview that he had ordered a tightening of borders with the Baltics because their lax entry formalities allowed foreign agents access to Russia. He also said Russia needed a proper border with Azerbaijan because it had introduced 'visa-free entry from Iran and Turkey'.</p>

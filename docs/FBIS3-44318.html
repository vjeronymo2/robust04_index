			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, Jan. 3 KYODO -- The Hong Kong  Government on Monday [3 January] published a white paper  covering plans to set up a corporation to build and operate the  territory's proposed new airport.    The bill sets out the new corporation's powers and the  controls which the government will exercise over it.    Its purpose is to reconstitute the provisional airport  authority as a permanent government-owned entity known as  Airport Corp.    Hong Kong has decided to gazette the bill despite failing to  reach agreement with China on funding arrangements for the 21  billion dollar project.    A Chinese spokesman for the Joint Liaison Group, which  handles transitional issues with Britain, told KYODO NEWS  SERVICE that experts will study the draft bill for up to two  months before commenting on its contents.    "It (the white bill) is not a big problem," the spokesman  said. "The British side had already made the bill available to  us."    "Publication of this white bill is an important step forward  in the process of preparing for the new airport at Chek Lap  Kok," said Secretary for Economic Services Gordon Siu, in a  written statement.    The aim of Airport Corp. is to balance commercial viability  with necessary government controls to protect the public  interest, Siu said.    "This is a delicate balance to strike between commercial  freedom and accountability to government," he said.    The bill's public consultation period will run until  February  28.    The new company will be loosely modeled on Mass Transit  Railway Corp. which operates Hong Kong's domestic railway.</p>

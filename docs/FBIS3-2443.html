			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Chris Yeung in Beijing and Willy Wo-Lap Lam] </F>   [Text] Beijing has decided to scale down several market  reform initiatives unveiled at the watershed Third Communist  Party Central Committee plenum last November. In their reports  to be delivered after the National People's Congress opens to  morrow, senior cadres, including Prime Minister Li Peng, Finance  Minister Liu Zhongli and State Planning Minister Chen Jinhua  will underscore traditional themes such as bolstering the state  sector, bailing out poor regions, subsidizing agriculture, and  controlling prices to ensure political stability.    The three senior ministers have also mothballed the radical  exhortations that patriarch Deng Xiaoping recently made in  Shanghai to speed up the introduction of a market economy.  Moreover, Mr Li and his colleagues have given strong hints that  the three-month-long austerity measure last autumn will continue  in the coming year.    Sources close to the legislature said yesterday Mr Li and  other State Council stalwarts had bowed to last-minute lobbying  from the sectors of the polity that stood to lose from the  implementation of Mr Deng's radical reforms: Entrepreneurs and  workers in state enterprises, impoverished heartland provinces,  and the agrarian lobby.    In his Government Work Report, Mr Li highlights Mr Deng's  theory of the construction of a socialist market economy as well  as the need to proceed with just announced reforms such as  therestructuring of the ailing state enterprises. However, Mr  Li and finance chief Mr Liu, who will deliver a Budget report on  Friday, have made provisions for shoring up government-run  enterprises as well as boosting aid to workers laid off in the  interest of improving the efficiency of state firms.    For example, Mr Li indicates that "for the sake of helping  large and medium-scale enterprises get out of their plight,"  Beijing will exempt such units from levies including  contributions to funds for the construction of energy and  transport projects. The premier also discloses that the central  Government will set up special funds for the relief of laid-off  workers.    In deference to the old goal of "taking grain as the key  link", Beijing will assure the agrarian sector a new deal  including raising the procurement price for rice, wheat, cotton  and oil-bearing crops.    State subsidies will be vouchsafed 500 counties specializing  in producing "commodity grain" as well as 150 counties  specialising in cotton.    Mr Li pays a lot of attention to the plight of the rural  sector and the growing hardship of the 900 million peasants. He  acknowledges that the rate of growth of agriculture has fallen  further behind other sectors in the past few years. The senior  leader also pointed to bad harvest in the past few months which  is set to put addi tional strain on the supply of grain and  staple foods this year. Sources said Mr Li has promised to  boost the annual growth of agriculture to at least five percent.    The reports by the three senior ministers spell a temporary  end to price reform, a key component of Mr Deng's strategy for  economic liberalization.    Mr Li and Mr Chen, who will address the NPC on social and  economic development in 1994, endorse measures announced over  the past week concerning the strict policy of controlling price  levels by state price administration bureaus. Moreover, the  premier says that Beijing will introduce a "mayor responsibility  system" whereby leaders of municipalities will be asked to  guarantee the stability of prices in their cites.    Mr Li indicates that the central authorities will continue  to  use economic tools to control prices. "Prices of commodities  have to be supervised. We should seek further lifting of  control in the process of supervision. We cannot lift all  controls over price in one go," the premier says in his report.  Informcd sources said the State Council had succumbed to  intensive lobbying from heartland and western regions to ensure  a more equitable distribution of national income, particulally  increasing central-government aid to the poorer provinces.    The reports of Mr Li and Mr Chen will play up the centre's  willingness to provide equal opportunities for laggards in the  open-door policy. For example, a segment of the increased  contributions to central funds will be distributed to the less  well-off areas in the form of transfer payments.    NPC members who have read the reports said Beijing will  continue to implement a tight money policy this year to curb  speculative activities and avoid hyperinflation. In spite of  protests from coastal provinces, Mr Li is expected to insist  that the strict control over money supply and credit imposed  since mid-1993 will have to stay.    Unregulated loans for investment in real estate will face  severe curbs under the Government's development strategy for  1994. The freeze on development zones, high-technology  districts and industri al parks imposed last year will  remainintact.    Sources said Mr Li's Government Work Report spoke positively  about last year's austerity programme, which had been attacked  by liberal economists as a "plot" by central planners to  reimpose control in the name of curing economic dislocations.  The macrolevel adjustment and control measures have helped  tighten control over the surge of money supply and credit last  year, Mr Li's report says. Greater government control will be  imposed in order to establish "effective supervision" over the  property market, the report says.    According to a copy of the report the central Government  will  make further efforts to push ahead with the drastic fiscal  reform whose details have been laid down by Vice Premier Zhu  Rongji at the national financial work conference in mid-1993.</p>

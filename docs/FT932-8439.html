			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Bank says government inflation target achievable THE Bank of England is reasonably confident that the government will be able to hold underlying inflation below its 4 per cent target ceiling over the next year and a half. Contrary to some reports at the weekend the Bank's second quarterly inflation report, published yesterday, suggested that the outlook for underlying inflation to the end of year, as measured by the retail prices index excluding mortgage interest payments, 'is no worse, and probably slightly better' than indicated three months ago. Changes since the last inflation report 'have lowered slightly both the expected inflation rate and the probability of breaching the 4 per cent limit during the course of this year,' the Bank says. 'The probability of breaching the target next year may be a little greater than previously envisaged, but the Bank's central expectation still is that the target will be met.' The future exchange rate of sterling, however, will be crucial to the authorities' ability to meet the target. The report says that the 5 per cent rise in sterling against its trade-weighted exchange rate index since February 'has lowered somewhat' the risk of breaching the top of the target range towards the end of this year and early next year. Any further increase in the exchange rate would lower the probability of breaching the target, it says. Conversely, a decrease in sterling's value would increase that risk. The Bank expects Friday's retail prices figures for April to show a fall in the underlying inflation rate from March's 3.5 per cent level, reflecting the change from poll tax to the council tax. After that, however, the rate will go back to 3.5 per cent by June as higher import prices pass through into domestic retail prices. It believes that underlying inflation will remain in the 3 per cent to 4 per cent range in the next 18 months, largely because the inflation rate for domestically produced goods will remain low. The output gap - between actual output and a level of output in the UK economy consistent with a constant rate of inflation - is likely to remain negative for some time, also exerting downward pressure on inflation. The Bank believes that inflation would probably have been constant 'over the next year or so', had not the government announced plans to extend the scope of value added tax to domestic fuel and power from April 1994. This increase in indirect taxation means underlying inflation may rise next year. The report says the main uncertainty surrounding inflation after 1994 concerns the response of domestic costs, such as wages and profits, to the loss of purchasing power resulting from the depreciation of sterling since last September. If profit margins per unit of output or earnings per head do not rise, increased demand will feed through into greater activity, and possibly employment, without stimulating inflation, it says. The Bank expresses some concern that the credibility of the government's target of 1 per cent to 4 per cent underlying inflation over the life of this parliament is still not reflected in prices on financial markets or in opinion surveys. It is vital that the target should be seen as a framework for policy over a long period and that 'monetary and fiscal policy should be consistent with achieving the target on a sustained basis', it says.

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy If the chancellor had dreamt up the most favourable economic figures possible for the run-up to the budget, they would not have been much different from those published yesterday. The UK appears to be enjoying rapid economic growth with little inflation. Underlying inflation in the year to October was lower than expected, remaining at a 27-year low of 2 per cent. The sharp and politically desirable fall in unemployment might have indicated an economically worrying tightening of the labour market. But underlying wages growth remained unchanged for the fourth month at 3.75 per cent, while unit wage costs continued to fall. Meanwhile, the public sector actually repaid some debt. That was partly because of Pounds 1.5bn of income from the last tranche of the BT share sale, but it was also thanks to an impressive increase in tax receipts. A strong improvement in corporate profitability helped these rise 14 per cent during the first seven months of the fiscal year. The figures were so good some economists reduced their public sector borrowing requirement forecasts for next year. With economic growth above trend, interest rates will eventually have to rise. But yesterday's benign data reinforce the view that there is no current need for an increase. The outlook for the markets is fairly positive. Lower than expected inflation and reduced public funding requirements should sustain gilts, while equities should be buoyed by the strong growth of corporate earnings and dividends.</p>

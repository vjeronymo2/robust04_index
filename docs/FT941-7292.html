			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Third-degree scolding Take Mr Paddy Ashdown's word for it, Britain is in a profoundly depressed and bewildered state. 'There is a deep and almost tangible sense of a hope that has died and a leadership that has failed,' the leader of the Liberal Democrats says in his new book, Beyond Westminster*. 'There is a dangerous mood of fatalism, . . . a loss of national self-confidence and even self-respect,' he tells us. The promise of the last decade, it seems, is now revealed as an illusion. People are looking for a lead, but do not expect to find it within traditional politics. We get the picture. Ordinarily, one might dismiss this kind of talk as the lamentation of a man cursed with the honour of running the third party in a two-party system. The Lib Dems know more than most about the politics of frustration, unfulfilled dreams, broken optimism, unmet expectations. There was a time, little more than 10 years ago, when Labour appeared to be in terminal decline. The Liberals were given life by the sudden appearance of the Social Democratic party, part of whose support came from Labour schismatics. The Liberal-SDP Alliance became increasingly popular. It undertook to meet the aspirations of millions of people who had rejected socialism but could not accept what was becoming known as Thatcherism. Consider what has happened since. In the 1983 general election, the Alliance attracted a quarter of the vote, only two points behind Labour's 27.6 per cent. In the feverish imagination of its supporters, it was about to overtake the people's party. In 1987 the Liberals and SDP, counted together, crept up a point, but Labour moved ahead three, to 30.8 per cent. After that the partnership collapsed. The bulk of the SDP merged with the Liberals and the rump was wound up. When he became leader, Mr Ashdown had to build a new centre party out of burnt embers and ashes. He had half a term in which to do it. At the April 1992 election the score was: Labour 34.4 per cent, Lib Dems 17.8 per cent. The Labour party not only moved well ahead in popular votes; it also chalked up more constituencies in which it was placed an encouragingly close second behind the Conservatives. These figures can be interpreted in two ways. Labour optimists say that the third party is on its way out; that their natural prize is an overall majority in 1996. The early 1980s schism is healing. History is just being a little slow about it. Lib Dems respond that their April 1992 vote was a miracle, considering their disarray only three years previously. They came from nowhere to the votes of nearly a fifth of the electorate. They have since equalled or outperformed Labour in local elections and by-elections. Their support is, at last, geographically concentrated. This gives them the power necessary for success under the first-past-the-post system. An analysis of opinion polls and other statistical evidence published by the Electoral Reform Society yesterday suggests that the Lib Dems might be the biggest gainers in the elections to the European Parliament on June 9. Victories are also anticipated in the local council elections in May. All this, plus the possible capture of Eastleigh from the Tories at the forthcoming by-election would put the Lib Dems back in the headlines. Mr Ashdown's book must be seen in the context of this arithmetic. The two larger parties do not offer national salvation. The Lib Dems are tempted to offer something different in order to succeed. Their speciality has always been to act locally and think expediently. The Lib Dem leader has gone local, and thought through the consequences. During parts of 1993 he spent half his working week outside Parliament visiting and sometimes working with non-famous, non-political people in the worst areas of Bristol, London, Manchester and Liverpool. He went down the mine at Monktonhall and spent time with silk weavers in Suffolk. His 21 excursions in the British Isles, plus one in Bosnia, led him to the dark conclusions summarised above. He found optimism to balance the gloom. Where people were free to arrange things for themselves, through self-help, local community organisations, small business and the like, he discovered the theme for a subtitle: 'Finding hope in Britain.' He is clear about the direction in which politics should now travel. 'This country will not solve its problems unless we can unleash the power and imagination of Britain's communities,' he writes. Westminster, the home of the national Parliament, was not one of the solutions; 'it has become one of the problems'. It is too easy to point out that winning at Westminster has always been a particularly knotty problem for the Lib Dems. Mr Ashdown's book, which was worth doing and is worth reading, could then be dismissed. Let us rather address his effort with the seriousness it deserves. The policy implications of his experiences among the people are not particularly profound, but they are not insignificant either. Never mind the tedious details. Hours could be spent debating whether he is right about taxation or health, or questioning trendy terms like 'partnership'. The generality is what matters at this stage. It is as follows: the Lib Dem leader postulates a less hierarchical society, in which a better-educated population depends less on central government. Communities would take responsibility for their own actions. He would run against the administration just as Lady Thatcher did in her heyday. The difference is that he would not strengthen Whitehall's control over local initiatives. That is the mistake now being made, in spades, by Mr John Major's government. Sounds familiar, does it not? It is. Similar statements came from pre-Thatcher Conservatives. They are beginning to be heard, if slightly muffled, from the post-Thatcher Labour party. The Lib Dems will have a useful role while Labour's slow and doubtful conversion to getting central government off our backs remains untested. Meanwhile, Mr Ashdown has made himself the principal opposition spokesman on foreign affairs, eclipsing the Labour chap, whoever he may be, with his persistent and pointed questioning on Bosnia. It would, however, be a mistake to conclude that there is a seat in a Labour cabinet waiting for him. The voters will decide that. *Simon &amp; Schuster, London, Pounds 9.99</p>

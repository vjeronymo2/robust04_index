			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : HAYDEN SAYS HE WILL HEAD ASSEMBLY  EDUCATION PANEL  </P> <P> Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) said on Wednesday that when the  Legislature reconvenes next month, he will become the chairman of a new  Assembly Higher Education Committee. As a result, Hayden will give up the  chairmanship of the Assembly Labor and Employment Committee.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) would not  comment on Hayden's announcement. Brown is expected to announce new committee  assignments next month.  </P> <P> The apparent committee switch comes amid reports that Brown is being pressured  to strip Hayden of the labor post as punishment for several supposed political  sins. These include his championing of "Big Green," the sweeping environmental  initiative voters rejected last month. Hayden dismissed suggestions that he was  being punished, but acknowledged that his "Big Green" leadership role "may have  ruffled some feathers" in the Legislature.  </P></p>

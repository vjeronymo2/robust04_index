			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by announcer Carlos Mesa] </F>   [Text] The brief visit [by U.S. Vice President Al Gore] --  like all visits by U.S. personalities, who never have enough  time for a small country like ours, or even for countries like  Argentina and Brazil, for which there are but a couple of hours  in the middle of a huge show -- has left us some lessons.    The U.S. Vice President -- in this regard we agree with some  of the viewpoints that were raised by the press today --  probably gave us two messages. On the one hand, the U.S.  position on the antinarcotics fight has not budged an inch.  There have been neither essential nor substantive changes  between the Bush and Clinton administrations.    The U.S. ambassador soon realized that the coca leaf garland  [given to Gore upon getting off the plane] was a hot issue, and  asked the vice president to get rid of it. Gore wore it for  barely a few seconds. This clearly shows the U.S. position.  Drug trafficking, coca, and production remain vital and  essential and, unfortunately, decisive factors in bilateral  relations.    Yet a second, positive message, in which we may find the  most  important point of this visit, is that sustainable development,  the environment, and the preservation of ecological balance in a  region that is so important as the Amazonas, is of the utmost  importance for the United States, and especially for the U.S.  vice president.    In Santa Cruz, Gore ratified his support for the  construction  of a gas pipeline to Sao Paulo, Brazil, for conveying clean  energy for that very important Latin American city. He also  supported a set of projects that could become an option.    I do not know whether the development of ecology, or rather  I  should say the preservation of the environment, will become as  important as the coca issue. I don't believe so. Yet it is a  point on the agenda that can produce some changes, or give a  different touch to this dreadful and conditioned relation that  coca has produced between Bolivia and the United States.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Abu-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'], member of the  Palestinian National Authority, has announced that brother  President Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] and his aides will return  to Jericho and Gaza in late June.    In press statements published in the Tunisian capital  yesterday, brother Abu-'Ala' added that brother Abu-'Ammar and  senior Palestinian officials will not return to Jericho and Gaza  Strip prior to the meeting due to be held by donor nations in  Paris on 9-10 June.    It should be recalled that brother president Abu-'Ammar said  in a statement to a U.S. television network that he will not  leave for the autonomous areas unless the international  community quickly fulfills its financial commitments to the  Palestinian self-rule.    In his statements, brother Abu-'Ala' noted that the  [Palestinian] leadership is facing acute financial problems. He  added that this issue was raised by brother president Abu-'Ammar  during a recent meeting he had with a U.S. Senate delegation in  Tunis.    Brother Abu-'Ala' emphasized that the Palestinian  administration badly needs the required funds to pay the  salaries of Palestinian policemen and employees, and also to  rehabilitate and rebuild Gaza and the West Bank, particularly  since Israel has exploited the resources of these two areas and  caused immense damage there.    Brother Abu-'Ala' also hoped that the Paris talks, which  will  follow up on financial and economic issues regarding the  autonomy authority, will adequately and shortly settle the  problem pertaining to the disbursement of pledged funds, which  he said is worrying Palestinian leaders and strugglers.</p>

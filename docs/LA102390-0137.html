			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: JOYCE CRUZ  </P> <P> School: Rosary High  </P> <P> Sport: Tennis  </P> <P> Position: No. 1 singles  </P> <P> Class: Sophomore  </P> <P> Cruz, who has lost only one set in Angelus League play this season, led Rosary  to victories against its two toughest league opponents, which moved the Royals  into first place. Tuesday, Cruz won, 6-4, 6-0, 6-4, and Rosary defeated Santa  Margarita, 11-7. Thursday, she won, 6-1, 6-0, 6-0, in a victory over Mater Dei.  The Monarchs had defeated Rosary, 10-8, in the teams' first meeting of the  season when Mater Dei's No. 1 singles player, Erika Asmuss, who is Cruz's  friend and doubles partner in age-group competition, defeated Cruz, 6-4. Cruz  said she was ready for Thursday's rematch, but Asmuss played doubles because of  a hamstring injury that slowed her. Cruz easily defeated Asmuss' replacement  and the rest of her competition, and Rosary's No. 2 singles player, Mandy  Gomez, also swept her sets as the Royals won on games, 77-70, after the match  ended in a 9-9 tie. "We were really ready for them," Cruz said. The victory  over Mater Dei, the second-ranked team in the Southern Section 2-A Division,  gave the third-ranked Royals (13-3, 4-1 in the league), a half-game lead over  second-place Santa Margarita (3-1 in league). Santa Margarita and Rosary play  again Nov. 1.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other top performers:  </P> <P> * Marni Hichborn, who helped El Modena's volleyball team remain undefeated by  winning two Century League matches, defeating Orange in three games Tuesday and  Foothill in four Thursday.  </P> <P> * Martha Pinto, a Katella cross-country runner who ran three miles in 17  minutes 44 seconds to finished third in the individual sweepstakes race at the  Mt.

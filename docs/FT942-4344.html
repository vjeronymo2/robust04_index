			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Doctors to fight performance pay Two of the most powerful staff representative bodies in the health service will meet next week to discuss a joint campaign against the introduction of performance pay, the annual consultants' conference of the British Medical Association was told yesterday. Mr John Chawner, chairman of the BMA senior hospital doctors committee, said the government's plans to introduce performance pay were 'so dangerous that it is our duty to strongly resist them'. Leaders of the BMA, which represents 80,000 doctors and surgeons, will join leaders of the 300,000-strong Royal College of Nursing in opposing the plans. Mr Chawner said that there was mounting evidence that performance related pay demotivated staff and disadvantaged women and ethnic minorities. Simplistic incentive schemes would reward quantity rather than quality, encouraging doctors to rush their work and neglect counselling, he said. Mr Chawner also warned that allowing trusts to determine performance pay would end national salary scales, since some would not be able to afford the cost of bonuses. This would undermine the work of the health service pay review bodies, which would not know what doctors were earning. Nurses had as much to lose as doctors, he added. 'They remember pay bargaining and the turmoil it caused to their profession and the health service,' he said. 'This is why this government gave them their own review body which is now threatened by the same government.' However, the conference narrowly defeated a move to encourage consultants to resign from the health service and offer freelance services.</p>

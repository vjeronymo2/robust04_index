			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROBE OF ANY DOE DRUG EXPERIMENTS SET  </P> <P> Sen. John Glenn plans to question Department of Energy officials as early as  next week about whether they used experimental drugs on workers at the Rocky  Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant, an aide to the Ohio Democrat said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The FBI and Environmental Protection Agency, investigating illegal dumping of  toxics at the Energy Department-owned facility, revealed in an affidavit last  week that chemicals associated with medical experiments were found in trace  amounts in a stream that flows from Rocky Flats.  </P> <P> In Washington and Colorado, authorities were trying Tuesday to determine what  chemicals may have been used, what their health effects might be, and whether  or not they may have been used on Rocky Flats workers with or without their  knowledge.  </P> <P> "We are requesting that the DOE come in and explain to us the full extent of  the research involving humans at its nuclear weapons facilities," said the aide  to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.  </P> <P> Officials at the facility near Denver would not comment in any detail. But Dr.  Joseph Furman, Rocky Flats' medical director, said: "I'll tell you one thing,  we don't use any experimental drugs on anybody out here."  </P> <P> The drug found in trace amounts in a creek near Rocky Flats has been used in  experiments to determine whether it can protect humans from the effects of  radiation. The military long has sought such a chemical to protect troops from  nuclear fallout.  </P> <P> "One of the chemicals, 1,3-dihydro-2H-idol-2-one, has been experimentally  tested concerning its ability to protect against radiation-induced cellular  damage," the FBI and EPA said in the affidavit requesting court authorization  to search the 6,500-acre plant.  </P> <P> The chemical, identified in the 1800s, occurs naturally in low levels in the  human body, and can act as a depressant. Experiments with its potential use as  protection against radiation are relatively recent, said Niels Schonbeck,  chemistry professor at Metropolitan State College in Denver.  </P> <P> The DOE facility, operated by Rockwell International Corp., makes plutonium  triggers for nuclear warheads.  </P> <P> Department of Energy officials were unaware of any request to appear before  Glenn's committee, said spokeswoman Chris Sankey. Sankey said the agency had no  comment Tuesday on whether medical experiments had been conducted at Rocky  Flats.  </P> <P> A statement issued Tuesday by Rockwell's chairman at company headquarters in El  Segundo did not address the specific allegations against Rocky Flats, which  include possible cover-up of illegal dumping, incineration and storage of toxic  materials.  </P> <P> "In our judgment, the plant has been run safely and in compliance with  applicable laws and regulations," said Donald R. Beall, who heads the  $12-billion company.  </P></p>

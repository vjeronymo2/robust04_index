			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JAGUAR CHIEF TO BOW OUT IN JUNE  </P> <P> British luxury carmaker Jaguar announced today that chairman Sir John Egan will  retire from the company at the end of June to pave the way for expansion under  its new owner, the Ford Motor Co.  </P> <P> Egan, 50, has spent the last 10 years at the head of Jaguar, turning the  company around after a bumpy ride in the 1970s.  </P> <P> A Jaguar statement quoted him as saying: "My advice to Ford was that the big  growth opportunities available to Jaguar under their ownership could only be  fully exploited if the company was led by a senior Ford executive."  </P> <P> It said he is to be succeeded July 1 by fellow Briton William Hayden, appointed  today as Jaguar's chief executive. Hayden, 61, has been vice president of Ford  of Europe's Manufacturing Group for the last year.  </P> <P> The U.S. automotive giant bought Jaguar for 1.6 billion ($2.6 billion) in  December after unfavorable exchange rates and poor North American sales caused  profits to plunge.  </P></p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Deal on foreign debt: so near and yet so far ONLY MINOR points separate Brazil and its leading bank creditors from an agreement in principle on restructuring Dollars 40bn (Pounds 21bn) of medium-term foreign debt. However, the government's political crisis has raised questions whether the deal will ever be completed. Agreement on a Brady-style debt reduction deal had originally been hoped for in April, but became bogged down over the guarantees banks would be offered. Last week, in an attempt to speed negotiations, Mr Marcilio Moreira Marques, economy minister, flew to New York to meet bank negotiators. Afterwards, he said: 'Our positions are converging and we expect an agreement within weeks if not days.' Since then, a new wave of corruption allegations has surrounded President Fernando Collor. Even if he stays in office, will he have the political clout to push the deal through? For Brazil, an agreement would help offset a darkening political and economic picture. But some creditors are less certain. One group favours a quick agreement, hoping it will bolster Mr Moreira - without whom they may have to start negotiations from scratch - and aid a government sorely in need of confidence. Some big US banks want a deal to be able to write back provisions and to avoid being held responsible for the minister's possible demise. Others, particularly European and Japanese bankers, say an agreement amid so much uncertainty would be pointless and raise doubts about Brazil's ability to meet terms of any deal. 'At some point, one of these Brady deals will fail. The question is whether it will be Brazil's,' said one US banker. Argentina is the next Latin American state in line to secure a Brady accord - its detailed accord with leading banks must now gain approval from all creditors - but Mexico, Venezuela and Costa Rica have all secured theirs. According to Mr Moreira, his meeting with the banks overcame two main obstacles. The two sides agreed on a figure of Dollars 3.2bn for the collateral to be used initially to guarantee the concessional bonds to be issued under the accord. They also agreed that banks should be free to choose how to change their debt into the six types of bonds on offer, but gave Brazil the right to assess the feasibility of the deal after the selection has been made. Mr Moreira says the remaining sticking points are 'minor'. The Brazilian accord is the most complicated of all the Brady debt reduction deals so far, in both negotiation and execution. The waters are muddied by the rapid collapse of the previous restructuring in 1988 and Brazil's partial moratorium on interest payments since 1989. There are six options to banks compared with two in the Argentine deal. It is also possible - depending on US interest rates and the mix of options the banks choose - that the guarantees will have to be phased in, instead of all being available at the start as in the other Brady deals. Brazil is expecting to raise Dollars 1.6bn from multilateral institutions and new money from the banks, with almost half of this coming from the World Bank. But a senior World Bank official said: 'There is no way we will give money to Brazil until it gets its macroeconomic situation in order and we see no signs of that at present.' The country is again expected to miss the fiscal targets laid down in its accord with the International Monetary Fund for the quarter that ends this month and it is becoming increasingly difficult for Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF president, to sustain the agreement, despite his close personal relationship with Mr Moreira and his continued warnings that 'Brazil is too big to fail'.</p>

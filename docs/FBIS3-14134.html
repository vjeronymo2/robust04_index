The  successes and failures were not all similar and differences  stemmed from the distinctive conditions prevailing in the  respective countries.    However, in 1372, the United States achieved nothing but  overt defeat. The United States began this year with  apprehension of the future, and a bleak outlook on its strategy  for grappling with international issues in the aftermath of the  Cold War. In the last days of the year, most of this  trepidation persisted and Washington's quest for adopting a  comprehensive stand and policy on international developments has  failed.    Last year, the U.S. Government's policy in foreign crises  was  the target of intense criticism at the domestic and  international level. U.S. President Clinton's series of defeats  in his interventionist policies in many countries served to  undermine the people's trust and elicited the objections of the  Congress against those who implement the country's foreign  policy.    What is certain is that the U.S. foreign policy in the  aftermath of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union  continues to be based on continued interference in the internal  affairs of all countries and proliferation of this interference.  This objective was pursued in the period when the Republicans  were in power and has been continued by the Democrats.    Regardless of the U.S. hostility toward the Islamic Republic  of Iran, countries such as Iraq, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia,  and Haiti were the main focus of the U.S. foreign policy  activities. As regards Iraq, the United States ignores the  rights of the people and continues its policy of constant  pressure and the imposition of UN sanctions and has prevented  all kinds of balanced solutions.    The most conspicuous examples of the defeat of the U.S.  interventionist policies can be more clearly perceived in  countries such as Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia, and Haiti. After  a prolonged silence on the atrocities of the Serbs, and  indifference toward the killing of 350,000 Muslims in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the United States sought to extricate itself  from its political isolation by Europe and entered the fray.  What motivated the United States to intervene was the emergence  of conditions conducive to cooperation with Europe for  implementing the covert plan for partitioning Bosnia-Herzegovina.    For this purpose, the Serbs were threatened with a NATO air  strike within a propaganda display on the one hand, and on the  other, by means of suitable pretexts and with UN cooperation,  the matter of any direct military intervention was ruled out.  These actions by the United States brought new disgrace for the  West and the United Nations both of whom profess to be defenders  of the rights of the defenseless people of the world.    Another manifestation of the perplexity of U.S. foreign  policy was in Somalia. The United States entered the arena on  the pretext of responding to the crisis on humanitarian grounds,  but with the passage of time, the sinister motives of the United  States in launching these operations were apparent to all. From  the vantage point of the U.S. military echelons, the U.S.  military presence in the Horn of Africa was a guarantee for  controlling the crises in this vicinity that threatened its  interests.    However, with the resistance of the Muslim Somali people and  the killing of U.S. soldiers, Washington woke up to reality and  admitted to its vulnerability and the defeat of its policy in  Somalia. This resulted in a withdrawal of 5000 U.S. soldiers  from Somalia.    In the crisis in Haiti, U.S. foreign policy suffered a worse  fate as the efforts by the Clinton administration in the past  year to reinstate deposed Haitian President Jean-Bertrand  Aristide and to convince the military rulers of the country  failed. Initially, by coercion and in order to cover up the  disgrace of its retreat from Somalia, the United States  dispatched troops to Haitian shores. Right from the outset, it  encountered the resistance of the people and the armed forces of  that country. Ultimately, the United States forced the United  Nations to reimpose an oil and arms embargo on the military  government of Haiti. These sanctions were criticized vehemently  by the people of Latin America.    All these crises in 1372 exposed the effete nature of U.S.  foreign policy in such a way that, for months after the Clinton  administration took over, the fallout continued in the form of  the American people worrying at the trend in U.S. foreign  policy. Last year, a CBS television poll indicated that 61  percent of the Americans are apprehensive at the performance of  the Clinton administration in foreign crises.    On the other hand, the resignations by U.S. State Department  officials are another reflection of these fears. Some  congressional deputies even called for Warren Christopher's  resignation as he did not have any answer for the failure of  such interventions.    In any case, facts and figures confirm that the current U.S.  administration has no other recourse but to review the decisions  and objectives of its foreign policy. As the WASHINGTON TIMES  reported, Clinton has not been able to evolve a strategy for  U.S. foreign policy in the first year of his presidency.</p>

The St. Petersburg-based design bureau "Malakhit" which  previously designed power plants for nuclear submarines has  developed a new underground nuclear power plant which can  generate 220 megawatt of electricity and work for 50 years. The  generator will be assembled in an underground tunnel dug in the  rock at a depth of 100 meters.    The use of module-type generators and liquid-metal coolant  make these power plants especially safe and convenient as they  are secured against radioactive leaks and can produce as much  electricity as needed.</p>

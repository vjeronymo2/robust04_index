			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / People: Amstrad's new non-executive Jeoff Samson, a former senior GEC executive, has been appointed a non-executive director of Amstrad. During Alan Sugar's unsuccessful attempt last December to buy back the shares he did not already own, he agreed to appoint two non-executive directors to the board. After the bid was defeated by shareholders, Amstrad advertised for one applicant with sufficiently senior experience to be able to 'appraise all financial aspects of the company', and another who 'should be an industrialist with a consumer product manufacturing background, or be highly experienced in the distribution of consumer products to trade customers'. Samson fits both categories. He has considerable experience in the UK industrial electronics and consumer products industry gained with Plessey, Standard Telephones and Cables, where he was a main board director, and more recently at GEC, where he was managing director of Hotpoint and later managing director of GEC's consumer products group from 1985 to 1989. Samson, now 64, subsequently joined Yale and Valor where he was group managing director until two years ago when the group was acquired by Williams Holdings. Last August he joined the board at Hunterprint, the loss-making specialist printer, as a non-executive director after Sir Ian MacGregor was ousted as chairman, and in November became part-time chairman working alongside Tony Caplin, Hunterprint's chief executive, on the rescue operation. Commenting on his appointment yesterday Samson said it was 'very challenging, but a tremendous opportunity'. He was selected from a shortlist of 16 candidates drawn up by ProNed, the organisation which promotes non-executive directors. Amstrad's board is continuing to interview shortlisted candidates for the second non-executive post.</p>

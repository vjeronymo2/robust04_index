			<p>BFN     [Text] Defense Minister Datuk Najib Abdul Razak has signed  a memorandum of understanding with Sweden on military  cooperation in Stockholm. He said Sweden had pledged to  encourage its private companies to form joint ventures with  Malaysian companies in the defense industry.    The memorandum of understanding with Sweden is significant  as  Malaysia is planning a major upgrading of its naval forces,  including the replacement of obsolete patrol vessels with new  ones. The Navy is said to require 27 oceangoing patrol vessels.  He also discussed with Swedish officials on possible purchase  of submarines.    Today, Datuk Najib Abdul Razak will have a tight schedule in  Croatia, which would be his last leg of his seven-day visit of  the European countries.</p>

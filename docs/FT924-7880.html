			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report THE PLATINUM price staged a modest rally yesterday, underpinned by a mildly bullish interim market review from Johnson Matthey, the biggest marketer of the metal (see story above). The price was fixed in the afternoon at Dollars 351 a troy ounce, up Dollars 3.75 from Wednesday, but that was still Dollars 15.50 down on the week so far. Dealers said, however, that platinum would have difficulty making headway while gold and silver prices remained depressed. The GOLD price edged another 90 cents higher on short-covering to reach Dollars 333.05 an ounce, still 95 cents down on the week. SILVER closed at 368.5 cents an ounce, unchanged on the day but 24 cents lower on the week. Base metals were mixed at the London Metal Exchange, with LEAD, NICKEL and ALUMINIUM prices lower, but ZINC, COPPER and TIN registering modest gains. The zinc market reversed a sharpish early fall, which ran into trade buying, to close Dollars 8 up at Dollars 1,062.50 a tonne for three months delivery. Compiled from Reuters</p>

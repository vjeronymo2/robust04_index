			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NO PLANS FOR U.S. TROOPS IN LATIN DRUGS;  </P> <P> SUNUNU SAYS BUSH WOULD BE WARY EVEN IF ASKED BY VARGAS  </P> <P> President Bush does not plan to send U.S. troops to Colombia to fight the  cocaine industry, White House chief of staff John H. Sununu said today.  </P> <P> He added that Bush would be wary of doing so even if the South American  nation's president, Virgilio Barco Vargas, requested such help.  </P> <P> Sununu was backing away from comments made Sunday by Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh  that the Administration should consider sending troops to Colombia if invited.  </P> <P> The chief of staff said the Administration drug policy does not envision  sending U.S. troops to any Latin American country to fight drugs.  </P> <P> "There is a tradition in the Western Hemisphere, a reluctance for anyone to ask  for troops and a reluctance of the President to commit troops," he told  reporters after meeting with the vacationing Bush.  </P> <P> Sununu also said Bush will submit a $7.5-billion to $8-billion anti-drug  package to Congress next month that will include increased aid to Latin  American countries.  </P> <P> Bush will present details of his drug strategy in a Sept. 5 speech to the  nation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> First Specific Figure  </P> <P> Although there have been various reports on the price tag of the plan, Sununu's  reference to a cost of $7.5 billion to $8 billion marked the first time the  Administration has publicly offered a figure.  </P> <P> Much of the money will be rechanneled from other programs, Sununu said. He said  the main focus of the plan will be domestic, although it will contain funds to  help Latin American countries fight drug traffic at the source.  </P> <P> Sununu said Bush made most final decisions on the drug package today, sending a  series of directives back to budget director Richard G. Darman on where to  siphon funds from other programs.  </P> <P> On the subject of new threats to American hostages held by Islamic militants in  Lebanon, Sununu said there has been no change in U.S. policy.  </P> <P> "We are not going to react to each new threat," he said. "The policy remains  unchanged. The President underscored that the hostage-takers are responsible  for the safety of all the hostages."  </P> <P> A pro-Iranian group said Sunday that it would consider killing two American  hostages if the French navy intervenes in Lebanon.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Avoidance of Attention  </P> <P> "Basically it is our policy not to try to increase attention on the hostages,"  Sununu said.  </P> <P> Earlier, Bush spoke briefly with reporters on the golf course and said he had  been briefed by Sununu on the latest threat to U.S. hostages and was leaving it  to his staff chief "to explain our position."  </P> <P> A pro-Iranian extremist group believed to be holding American hostages Joseph  Cicippio and Edward Austin Tracy issued death threats Sunday against the two  men if French ships in the Mediterranean intervene in Lebanon's civil war.  </P> <P> The statement by a Shiite Muslim group, which calls itself the Revolutionary  Justice Organization, was accompanied by a photocopy of a photograph of Tracy  the group released Aug. 1.  </P></p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: A metamorphosis at Chrysalis - The group's move into TV and film production Chrysalis, Mr Chris Wright's music and entertainment group, is in the middle of a metamorphosis designed to turn it into a major producer of television programmes and films. Over the past 12 months, the group has quietly put together a raft of nine independent production companies, including two existing in-house divisions covering everything from drama and comedy to arts and sport. At the same time, Chrysalis, where Mr David Puttnam, the film producer, is now a non-executive director, has been making film development deals with a number of UK directors and producers, including Mr Gary Sinyor, director of Leon the Pig Farmer. Mr Michael Pilsworth, the former managing director of SelecTV who now heads the visual entertainment division, says the aim is to develop a range of production companies in the manner of record labels - usually by taking 50 per cent stakes. Chrysalis has bought into companies such as: Watchmaker Productions, a vehicle for Mr Clive James and members of his team at the BBC; Bentley Productions, which has made dramas such as Harnessing Peacocks; and Assembly, a company specialising in stand-up comedy. 'That is the end of the buying. We have spent a total, including provision of working capital, of Pounds 6m,' says Mr Pilsworth, who believes that access to scarce talent is the key to making money in the coming era of pay television. Chrysalis' new move into feature films involves a similar strategy of backing a roster of British independents, including Mr John Goldstone, the producer of comedy films such as the Monty Python movies. There have also been detailed discussions with Mr Richard Holmes and Mr Stefan Schwartz of Gruber Bros, the makers of Soft Top, Hard Shoulder, and Mr Jeremy Bolt and Mr Paul Anderson of Impact Pictures, who made the soon-to-be-released Shopping. Chrysalis has agreed to invest Pounds 4m over the next three years to fund the development of new British films, but is now looking for a 50-50 partner to help take the initiative forward. The rapid changes at Chrysalis have taken place against a background of financial difficulty. In the year to August 1993 the company reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 14.6m on turnover of Pounds 59m, largely because of problems at MAM, its amusement machine company which has now been disposed of. Interim results due todaywill give the first official clue on how well the restructuring is going. All the signs are that the losses have been greatly reduced and that the company is now heading towards break-even. Beside the small but profitable record import-export business, the plan is to have three main divisions. As well as visual entertainment, the company will concentrate on commercial radio and music publishing. The first wholly owned Chrysalis radio station, Heart FM, the new regional station for the West Midlands, goes on air in September. It will offer 'soft adult contemporary music' aimed at the 25 to 44-year-old market. Chrysalis hopes to take the format to London and is applying for one of two new FM frequencies - although the competition will be fierce. On top of its music publishing activities, Mr Wright, who sold Chrysalis Records to Thorn EMI for Dollars 150m (Pounds 100m) in two tranches, has launched the Echo label to try to build up his record business again. Last year Pony Canyon, part of Fujisankei of Japan paid Dollars 17.5m for a 25 per cent stake. 'It (Chrysalis Records) took 20 years to build last time. I think it could probably take 20 again,' says Mr Wright of Echo, which so far has released only 1,000 copies of work by a band called Zu. Although Mr Wright is as committed to Chrysalis as ever, he says he is not determined to hold on to his 51 per cent control. If the price was right, he says, he would be prepared to sell 15 to 16 per cent of the company.</p>

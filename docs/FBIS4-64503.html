			<p>BFN     [Text] Chancellor Helmut Kohl is visiting Italy. He was to  have been received in the Vatican by Pope John Paul II, but  because of the Pope's accident, he was received by the Vatican's  head of state, Cardinal Angelo Sodano. Kohl gave an interview  to Paolo Borrella.    [Begin recording] [Borrella] Is the destiny of Germany still  that of a united Europe, as you said at the time of  reunification?    [Kohl, in German with superimposed Italian translation]  Adenauer said in 1950 that the reunification of Germany and the  unification of Europe were two sides of the same coin. If the  German people who received this gift of reunification now  concentrate only on themselves, then they would not be worthy of  this historic duty. We need European unity just as much as the  air that we breathe. In the 21st century there will be neither  peace nor liberty for the European people unless we pursue and  realize this ideal. However, we are already on the right road.  We are not forgetting the others. There are millions of human  beings in the Balkans who are waiting for our help, and there  are billions of people in the third world who are also waiting  for our help. It is a duty that we must not shirk. [end  recording]</p>

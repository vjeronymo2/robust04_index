			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Technology: Face to face on the computer screen - Worth Watching Biometric security devices - retina scanning, for example - rely on complex machinery to recognise the would-be computer user. A computer security device developed by Visage, of Buckinghamshire, relies on one person recognising another, and could be sold for as little as Pounds 20. The Visage system flashes a matrix of several faces on to the screen. The users have previously scanned into the computer photos of people they know - partner or sibling, say - who resemble each other. They then pick the three pictures from a dozen on the screen. The user then taps in the numbers of the sequence in which the faces appeared. The faces cannot be forgotten. Nor can the user write down the 'answer' as the pictures are randomly organised on the screen. Visage: UK, 0494 481263.</p>

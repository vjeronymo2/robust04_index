			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Towers of strength turn to pillars of sand: The UK property market may have been through the worst of its decline, but the misery is not yet over The cracks in the UK's overborrowed and overbuilt commercial property market are widening. In the past two weeks, Olympia &amp; York, the world's largest property developer responsible for the ambitious Canary Wharf project in the London Docklands, has sought refinancing talks. So too has Heron International, the property and finance group. On Tuesday Speyhawk, a development company, revealed its liabilities exceeded its assets by Pounds 70m after losses of Pounds 217m. For a sector numbed by two years of disastrous news, these developments, serve as a forceful reminder of the severity of the slump. The decline is the worst for 50 years. Rental values are falling for the first time since the Second World War. Capital values have dropped by some 30 per cent since their peak in September 1989. By contrast, in the property crash of the the early 1970s, values fell by 15-20 per cent. The scale of the downturn has been masked by the drawn-out and relatively low-key nature of the crash. Property shares have slowly lost more than half their value since November 1988. Some observers find the measured nature of the adjustment reassuring. 'There is very little in the sector that remains to be hit,' says one. The banks may find the message from the stock market less reassuring, however. Property companies - and their banks - have not yet acknowledged the full depth of the fall in their portfolios, as is illustrated by the gap between property share prices and companies' net assets, which averages a hefty 35 per cent. When the banks come to terms with the true reduced value of the assets, they could find many of their loans may not be repaid in full. Estimates by surveyors suggest the problem loans could be as high as Pounds 8bn. The scale of the potential losses is a result of record increases in international bank lending to the sector at the end of the 1980s, which rose to more than Pounds 40bn last year. Assessing the scale of the damage to the banks is complicated by a lack of information. A City broker reckons that considerably more than half of the loans were made to private companies with the rest split between publicly quoted companies and housing trusts. Like an iceberg, the bulk of the problem is invisible. The banks are reasonably sanguine about the scale of the problem. Sir John Quinton, chairman of Barclays, recently said UK banks' exposure to property is not excessive, at 6.9 per cent of their total lending. At least half of the Pounds 40bn debt was loaned before 1988 when asset values were similar or lower than now. More than 60 per cent of loans were made to finance income-producing investment property, where interest payments are not in jeopardy. One risk for the market is that banks will curb new loans, making it tougher for some companies to refinance properties; another is that banks may be less supportive of companies that fall into difficulties. Companies can no longer take their banks' patience for granted. Speyhawk, with debts of just Pounds 303m, has 46 bankers and they have agreed to support it. But in any restructuring process, it takes just one unco-operative bank to scupper the talks. It is not clear yet whether a rash of large receiverships would tip the property market into another spiral of decline. On one hand, some observers argue that the overhang of property that is now or will eventually come on to the market - and the shortage of would-be buyers  - is already being taken account of in the low asking prices. The cheapness of property, by historical standards, is reflected in the convergence of rental yields and gilt yields. This has not been the case since the 1960s. On the other hand, high-profile receiverships and debt restructuring could have a depressing effect on investor confidence. 'The O&amp;Y saga will frighten off less well-informed overseas investors,' says one broker. However, experienced institutional investors have been attracted by the idea of bottom-fishing for the best part of a year. Indeed, there has been intense competition for a certain type of building, namely one that is high yielding and let on a long lease to a financially strong tenant. Few sales have resulted from such interest for two reasons: first, this type of building accounts for perhaps 15 per cent of the market and, second, its owners, typically, do not need to sell. The overriding problem in the market is that many buildings are simply unsellable because they cannot attract tenants. The combination of the recession and the oversupply of buildings have left a forest of To Let signs in British cities. Some buildings in the most overbuilt areas such as the City and Docklands will never let. With hindsight, the surge of speculative building at the end of the 1980s seems reckless. But at the time, developers thought their buildings were superior to the existing supply and would be easy to let and sell. O&amp;Y, for instance, described many London offices as 'slums', believing that companies wanted to regroup their head offices in state-of-the art buildings. Developers might have been proved right, had it not been for the rigidity of the UK lease structure. Tenants are locked into 25-year leases with upward-only rent reviews every five years. Although asking rents for new properties have tumbled, most tenants are still paying well above market rates. Although businesses want to move to better offices, they cannot get out of their existing leases. Even buildings that do let will not necessarily help the developers' cash flow. One of the industry's self-inflicted wounds is the custom of waiving a tenant's rent for several years, rather than dropping the asking rent. Although this may have artificially propped up values at the outset, it has cut severely into cash flow. The pain is not restricted to the new generation of developers that emerged in the 1980s. The stalwarts of the market such as MEPC, Hammerson and Slough Estates have all experienced problems. Some investors do not rule out a dividend cut for top companies. The worst prognosis is reserved for a UK election result that puts sterling under pressure. Any rise in interest rates could be critical for a heavily indebted company. Furthermore, a rise in gilt yields would depress property values. Kleinwort Benson Securities, the broker, estimates that in the event of a Labour-led hung parliament, the fall in net asset values could be 15 per cent. Whichever party wins power, the all-party commitment to the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System will perhaps have the greatest impact on the property industry in the long run. If the constraints of ERM membership continue to result in a relatively low rate of inflation, overborrowed property investors will not be bailed out. as they were in previous crashes. The prospect of low inflation and high real interest rates should dash hopes of a swift recovery. Rental growth will lag behind the recovery by as much as three years, says UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the broker. But the broker expects the values of offices in central London to fall by another 23 per cent by the end of next year. The property market may have been through the worst of its decline, but the misery is not yet over.</p>

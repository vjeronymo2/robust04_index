			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Carclo poised to swoop for Arthur Lee in agreed bid CARCLO Engineering Group is expected to announce the agreed takeover of Arthur Lee &amp; Sons, the Sheffield-based manufacturer of steel and plastic products in which it already has a 29.9 per cent stake. Shares in Arthur Lee were suspended yesterday lunchtime at 142p, valuing the group at Pounds 47.6m. A minute later, Carclo's shares were suspended at 223p, giving the Leeds-based company a market capitalisation of Pounds 93.4m. Neither company or any of their advisers would comment. However, a full bid had been expected since Carclo raised its Arthur Lee stake to the present level in October by paying GM Firth, the engineering group, 80p per share for a 22 per cent stake. Carclo, a card clothing, wire and engineering products group, has ridden out the worst of the recession, thanks partly to the timely disposal of its springs and forgings business for Pounds 21.6m to Hoesch, the German steel group, in 1991. Although Mr John Ewart, Carclo's chairman, described the Arthur Lee stake as a 'trade investment', he also said last year that he was always on the lookout for acquisitions at the right price. Carclo's pre-tax profits fell 30 per cent to Pounds 5.63m in the 12 months to March last year, but its interim pre-tax profits increased by 28 per cent in the six months to September and it was enjoying a stronger order book. Fierce price competition and a decline in demand decreased Arthur Lee's pre-tax profits from Pounds 5.12m to Pounds 861,000 in 1991, but they recovered to Pounds 2.98m in the year to September 30. The group repaid nearly all its borrowings last year after selling its loss-making bright bar division and related steel stock-holding company for Pounds 7.5m. Arthur Lee shares dipped to 65p in August last year, but were chased up to their present level by the bid speculation. Mr Peter Lee, chairman, said in January that Carclo's stake was 'a worry' and 'not of our choosing'.</p>

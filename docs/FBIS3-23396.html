There was a shooting attack near  the settlement of 'Ateret. According to initial reports, two  Egged bus passengers were seriously injured. Our correspondent  in the territories Golan Yokhpaz reports from the studio:    There was a shooting attack near the settlement of 'Ateret,  which is situated north of Jerusalem. Apparently two Israelis  were seriously injured and three others were also wounded,  although their condition remains unclear. The Israelis were hit  by gunfire directed at an Egged No. 468 bus which drove by the  settlement of 'Ateret in the Binyamin area on the Bi'r Zayt  bypass. The bus, was travelling from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv and  picking up passengers from settlements in the Binyamin area.  Seven Israeli ambulances are currently racing to the scene in  order to evacuate the wounded, apparently to Hadassah-'En Kerem  Hospital in Jerusalem. Large Army forces are also making their  way to the scene of the attack in order to treat the wounded and  close off the site.

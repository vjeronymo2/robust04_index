			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The FBI said it is joining the investigation of an attack in San Francisco on a  lesbian minister in apparent retaliation for her work with AIDS victims. Police  said a group of skinheads is believed to have abducted and beaten Lynn Griffis  after threatening to kill her. The FBI said it is entering the case because of  probable violations of federal civil rights statutes. Griffis, a minister in  the Metropolitan Community Church who has been active in the battle against  acquired immune deficiency syndrome, was also attacked June 12 by an intruder  who hit her in the face with a shovel.  </P></p>

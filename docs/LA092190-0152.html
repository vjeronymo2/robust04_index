			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CANCER-DRUG LAB ONCOTECH FILES FOR FIRST SALE OF STOCK  </P> <P> Oncotech Inc., a small, money-losing laboratory here that helps doctors select  the most effective chemotherapy for cancer patients, filed papers Thursday  seeking approval for its initial sale of stock to the public.  </P> <P> In a registration filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Oncotech  is seeking to raise about $10 million by selling 1.3 million shares of common  stock at a price of between $7 and $9 per share. The company said it plans to  use proceeds from the sale to expand its business.  </P> <P> After the offering, Oncotech would have just over 3.3 million common shares  outstanding with the remaining shares owned by venture capital companies and  Oncotech employees, said Paul G. Kanan, president and chief executive.  </P> <P> Oncotech was founded in 1985 by Dr. Larry Weisenthal, an oncologist and  pharmacologist, and Dr. Robert Nagourney, an oncologist and hematologist. In  1987, the company attracted a group of venture capital firms, led by Southern  California Ventures of Irvine, which provided about $6 million in start-up  funding.  </P> <P> Oncotech has lost $5.4 million since its founding, including a loss of $1  million on revenue of $700,000 in the first six months of 1990.  </P> <P> Kanan said the company expects the losses to continue at least through 1991 as  the firm continues to invest substantial sums in research and development and  establishment of a national sales network.  </P> <P> Oncotech is one of a handful of laboratories, Kanan said, capable of testing  the relative effectiveness of various drugs on cancerous tumors sent by  hospitals across the country. Drugs used to treat cancer should be carefully  selected, Kanan said, because their effectiveness differs from patient to  patient.  </P> <P> Another part of Oncotech's business, Kanan said, is working with pharmaceutical  companies to develop new cancer drugs.  </P> <P> The tumor specimens received by the laboratory are used to research the  effectiveness of new drugs.  </P></p>

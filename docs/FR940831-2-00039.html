			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> As outlined in an April 6, 1993, Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice (58 FR 17875), DOE is developing the Site Treatment Plans in three stages. The first stage, the Conceptual Site Treatment Plans, were released in October 1993 and described a wide range of possible treatment alternatives for each mixed waste stream. The Draft Site Treatment Plans were issued in August 1994, and include one or two options identified at the site, with input from the State, as the preferred treatment for each mixed waste stream. After further analysis of the preferred options for the DOE complex as a whole, discussions among the States, and consideration of public comments, DOE will submit Proposed Site Treatment Plans in February 1995 to the appropriate regulatory agency (i.e., the State or EPA). The regulatory agency will issue an Order requiring compliance with the approved Plan. Sites that are in compliance with approved Plans and Orders after October 1995 will be exempt from fines and penalties related to the storage prohibitions [section 3004(j)] under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Draft Site Treatment Plans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to early discussions with the States, DOE followed a ``bottom-up'' approach in which the DOE Operations Offices evaluated treatment options for the mixed waste at each site, in conjunction with the host State and others. The Draft Plans contain the results of this site-specific evaluation of the treatment options identified in the Conceptual Plans, and present the currently preferred option for treating the site's mixed waste. The Draft Plans have not yet been evaluated as a whole for impacts on other DOE sites and to the overall DOE program. Changes in the preferred option and associated schedules are possible as evaluation from the DOE-wide perspective progresses, as State-to-State discussions take place, and as other stakeholder input is received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOE defined a common framework to provide a consistent approach to Draft Plan development among all of the DOE sites. This framework, developed with input from State representatives, established common terminology, objectives, planning assumptions, and a recommended methodology for narrowing the alternatives presented in the Conceptual Plan to the preferred options in the Draft Plan. Evaluation criteria included sound technical judgment; regulatory compliance; environmental, health, and safety concerns; stakeholder involvement; implementability; and efficient use of limited resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Draft Plans also follow a common format, consisting of a Background Volume and a Compliance Plan Volume, supplemented by an Appendix(s). The Background Volume describes the site's treatment options, including the associated uncertainties, budget status, and regulator and stakeholder reactions, when known. The Compliance Plan Volume identifies the preferred treatment option(s) and associated schedules, and also broadly describes provisions to implement and update the Plan once approved. When finalized, the Compliance Plan Volume is intended to contain information that will ultimately be enforced through an Order. Each Draft Plan also includes an Appendix that explains how the options presented in the Conceptual Plan were narrowed to select the preferred option. Some site Draft Plans include additional appendices to present other related information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In conjunction with identifying treatment options, DOE is also evaluating options for disposal of mixed waste treatment residuals, at the request of the States. The Background Volume of each Draft Plan contains a description of the process for evaluating disposal options.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A Draft Site Treatment Plan Summary Report is being prepared to present a compilation of the information contained in the individual sites' Draft Plans. The Summary Report will also provide a preliminary indication of the configuration that may emerge for the DOE complex as a whole, and is intended to useful for discussions among the States, EPA and other interested parties. This Summary Report will include brief discussions of the Draft Plan development process, a DOE complex-wide look at treatment options for the different mixed waste streams, information on waste characterization, technology development and other related topics. The Summary Report will be released as soon as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III. Availability of Draft Site Treatment Plans and Opportunity for Comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The individual Draft Site Treatment Plan will be available at each site's public reading room or at nearby locations by mid-September, 1994. To review or request information on a specific Draft Plan, a DOE contact name and reading room address for each site can be obtained by calling the DOE Center for Environmental Management Information at 1&hyph;800&hyph;7EM&hyph;DATA. The full set of 48 individual Draft Plans can also be reviewed by mid-September 1994 at the U.S. Department of Energy Headquarters reading room, Room 1E&hyph;190, 1000 Independence Ave., Washington, DC 20585, and at the Center for Environmental Management Information, 470 East L'Enfant Plaza, Suite 7110, Washington, DC 20585.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments should be provided to the appropriate DOE site contact by October 31, 1994. Additional opportunities for public involvement in the Site Treatment Plan development process will be offered at many sites; information on these opportunities can be obtained from the DOE site contact. Comments from the public will be considered by DOE in preparing the Proposed Plans, to be submitted to regulators in February 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional information on the Site Treatment Plan process, related activities, and site-specific fact sheets describing the Draft Plans can be obtained from the DOE Center for Environmental Management Information at 1&hyph;800&hyph;7EM&hyph;DATA (1&hyph;800&hyph;736&hyph;3282). Persons interested in receiving the Summary Report when available, or other information on the development of the Site Treatment Plans and related activities, such as evaluation of options for disposal, should provide their name, address, and items of interest to the DOE Center for Environmental Management Information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jill E.

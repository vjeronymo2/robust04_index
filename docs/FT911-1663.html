			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Arts: From the Court of Ranjit Singh - A Sikh's taste in the exhibition 'Warm and Rich and Fearless' Traditionally the Sikhs have been regarded as a people of limited aesthetic sensibility. Rather in the way that the English perceived the Scots, they were deemed tough farmers and fighters of legendary bravery with no time at all for the liberal arts - at least until Ranjit Singh forged an autonomous Sikh kingdom in the first years of the 19th century. Warm and Rich and Fearless, which appears to be the first comprehensive exhibition in Britain or India devoted to Sikh painting and applied art, at Cartwright Hall in Bradford until June 2, should finally lay that myth to rest. BH Baden Powell described the Sikh artists' use of colour as 'Warm and Rich and Fearless', a description perhaps as appropriate to the Sikhs themselves. An introduction to Sikh history and culture is offered in the exhibition catalogue, beginning with Nanak (1469-1539), the founder of the faith and the first of its 10 gurus. The 100 or so exhibits - drawn from the V&amp;A, the India Office Library, the Royal Collection and private collections - take up the narrative some 300 years on. Despite limitations of size and cost, and the quite understandable absence of such evocative Sikh treasures as the Koh-i-noor diamond (then the largest in the world) and Ranjit Singh's golden throne (in the V&amp;A) it is a rewarding and enjoyable show. Ranjit Singh's court provided the stability and patronage for the flowering of Sikh art, its prosperity and lavish spectacle as much a magnet to the Pahari artists of the Punjab hills as to foreign visitors. The Maharaja had a taste for the grand gesture and a sensibility to the natural world - ordering a 21-gun salute in honour of the moon, say, or halting meetings of state to watch the formation of the monsoon clouds. Yet the splendour of his court life, and the extravagance of such peccadillos as drinking wine (forbidden by Sikh law) mixed with powdered pearls, are at striking variance with his own unprepossessing and relatively modest appearance. Contemporary accounts emphasise his small stature and badly scarred face, smallpox having blinded one eye and paralysed an arm and a foot. We find him astride a prancing milk-white horse with hennaed fetlocks, his head shrunk into his shoulders, his garb rich but simple. Prime minister Raja Dhian Singh out on a hawking expedition cuts far more dash. Such vibrant gouache miniatures of the mid-19th century are the glories of the show. Appropriately they have been selected to represent artefacts also on show or to reveal aspects of the Sikh character and way of life. A manifestation of the egalitarianism that underpins Sikh culture, for instance, is suggested by Raja Hira Singh's attendant who stands before his master without the cringing deference found in Mughal painting. Two cultivators - with water diviners? - allude to the Punjab as the granary of India. From the same set comes a painting of two Akalis - fiercely militant ascetic Sikhs - portrayed bare chested in their prescribed shorts, with weapons tucked into their conical turbans and brandishing clubs. Examples of the terrifying razor-sharp steel quoits or Chakras that, when not spinning through the air to fatal effect, were worn on their turbans, are here too. Horse necklaces - and human jewellery - chain-mail armour and the magnificent damascened shields of intricate koftgiri work are represented in pigment and reality, the latter a speciality of Sikh craftsmanship until the British banned the manufacture of weaponry in the Punjab. Gradually a Sikh idiom emerges out of the synthesis of Mughal and Jain painting. Curving lines and languor are abandoned in favour of sharper angles, often provided by oversize parasols, and a new tension more appropriate to Sikh manliness. That said, there is a vestigial delicacy and fastidiousness in some images, in the elegant poses, the bejewelled and spindly furniture based on English Regency models, and in the delicate, stylised blooms. Sikh painting shows a particular and sometimes penetrating portraiture. No attempt has been made, for instance, to hide the charmlessness of Kaharak Singh, Maharaja 1839-40. He resembles nothing so much as the frog-prince who has not yet been kissed. Sadly, we have only Hasan al-Din's uninspired portrait of the Maharaja Duleep Singh, painted a few years before the Punjab was annexed by the British in 1849 and the boy-king was forced to give up his throne, his kingdom, the Koh-i-noor and, temporarily at least, his religion. The watercolours and miniature portraits on ivory that follow, executed by Indian and European artists, are disappointing. The exceptions are the lithographs after drawings made by the Russian Prince Alexis Soltykoff in the 1840s. Far more rewarding than the later watercolours are the golden folk embroideries - the Phulkaris and Baghs - that continued to be made by the Sikh women of the Punjab until early this century. Their deliberate asymmetrical designs employ stylised motifs of everyday life - peacocks, ears of wheat, coins, chillies, even railway engines. Other textiles range from a Kashmir coat with lavish embroidery to Sikh silk battle standards said to have been used in the final Anglo-Sikh war, and to the contemporary shimmering, gauzy silk scarves confected by the British-born Sikh Sarbit Natt, their handpainted designs drawing from the geometries of traditional Phulkari. The modern white nylon lace and even nastier synthetic red and gold brocade used in the display of the manuscript of the Dasam Granth, the writings of the last Sikh guru, are lamentable even without the contrast. Modern Sikh art is also given a cursory nod, in the form of two paintings recently given to Bradford. Paris-trained Amrita Sher-Gil, part Hungarian, part Sikh, is represented by a haunting Portrait of a Woman of 1936, its earthy tones reminiscent of the Buddhist cave paintings at Ajanta, and Arpana Caur with his recent Time Image 2. The exhibition can be seen at Walsall Art Gallery February 7 - March 27, 1992.</p>

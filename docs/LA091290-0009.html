			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FGS DEFENDS ITSELF AS STATE SEEKS TO REVOKE ITS LICENSE  </P> <P> FGS Insurance Agency, which provides car insurance for nearly 200,000  Californians, labeled state Department of Insurance accusations that it engaged  in fraudulent sales practices as "absurd" Tuesday at the outset of a hearing on  revocation of the company's license.  </P> <P> The hearing in Los Angeles before Administrative Law Judge Robert A. Neher will  determine whether state Insurance Commissioner Roxani M. Gillespie can revoke  Irvine-based FGS's license.  </P> <P> The state alleges that FGS engaged in a series of fraudulent activities,  including misusing the beleaguered assigned risk plan, falsifying drivers'  records, hiding commissions and fees, and failing to disclose that it was being  paid $20 per applicant by finance companies.  </P> <P> "The commissioner's accusation is a tawdry grab-bag of allegations that invokes  repealed statutes, misstates crucial facts and misconstrues the public  interest," said FGS attorney Milford W. Dahl Jr. in his opening statement  Tuesday.  </P> <P> The company has denied the accusations and last week filed a lawsuit against  the state Department of Insurance, asking for a court order to stop what it  said was harassment. FGS said department investigators entered company offices  without permission and harassed customers there.  </P> <P> "In its zeal to nail FGS, the Department of Insurance has lied to the public,"  Dahl said as the department's hearings got under way. "The department has used  a sloppy, dishonest investigation to cover up its own inefficiencies."  </P> <P> The probe of FGS follows a larger state investigation into Coastal Insurance  Co., one of California's largest writers of high-risk auto liability insurance  policies before it filed for bankruptcy in February, 1989. Coastal once owned  FGS, whose officials claim that the action against the company is a vendetta  for the $66 million that Coastal's collapse will cost California consumers.  </P> <P> Department of Insurance spokeswoman Carey Fletcher denied the allegations.  </P> <P> "We did an excellent and thorough job, and the department is proceeding in a  timely manner because we have a good case," she said.  </P> <P> One of the state's biggest complaints against FGS is that it put almost all of  its automobile liability insurance through the California Automobile Assigned  Risk Plan, which was intended for drivers whose driving records are sp bad that  they cannot get insurance anywhere else.  </P> <P> Dahl said the department has focused on FGS to divert attention from widespread  criticism of its performance in regulating the state's auto insurance business,  including the deficit-ridden assigned risk plan, which has proposed a 160% rate  hike so it can break even.  </P> <P> Dahl argued that putting FGS out of business would only worsen California's  insurance situation. "Revoking FGS's license inevitably would lead some of  these drivers to drop their coverage, thereby exacerbating the uninsured driver  crisis," he said.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Farmers Insurance Group agent Dan Mills testified that he had at  least one client cancel insurance because the client said he could get a  cheaper policy with FGS through the assigned risk plan. Mills filed a complaint  against FGS with the Department of Insurance.  </P> <P> David E. Kuizenga, head of Western Assn. Automobile Insurance Plans, which  oversees the state's assigned risk plan, testified Tuesday that about 50% of  Californians enrolled in the assigned risk plan had perfect driving records. He  said FGS was not the only agency putting good drivers into the program.  </P> <P> But FGS did this more than any other company, the state said, accounting for  141,000 of the 1.2 million drivers enrolled in 1989. The company with the  next-highest number of clients enrolled had 29,000.  </P> <P> The state charges that FGS urged applicants to falsely claim that they had  tried unsuccessfully to get automobile insurance in California in the last 60  days, a requirement of the assigned risk plan.  </P> <P> Also, the state says FGS was engaging in a practice known as "sliming."  </P> <P> "Sliming was a practice whereby customer application records would be falsified  so that people would qualify for insurance," according to a report about FGS  that was recently released by the state Assembly. "Many extremely bad drivers  had their accident records and values of their cars misstated by the agents  into the computer system so as to permit the booking of many policies that  would otherwise be rejected."  </P> <P> For example, $40,000 cars were classified as $20,000 autos, a person with three  accidents and two moving violations was listed as having no accidents, and a  Corvette was listed as a Chevette.  </P> <P> Once an insurance sale was made, the agents were able to claim a commission on  12 months of payments, even though only one month was paid for, the state  contends.  </P> <P> Besides abusing the assigned risk plan, the state charges that FGS failed to  inform customers that they had to pay interest rates ranging from 21% to 40.75%  on premiums.  </P></p>

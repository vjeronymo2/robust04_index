			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Shephard sets her sights on farmworkers' wages board The National Farmers Union yesterday called on the government to keep the Agricultural Wages Board in its present form. The NFU's ruling body was responding to the government's consultation of the farming industry on the board's future. The NFU argued that the board was essential to maintain stability and harmony in the industry. It encouraged genuine career progression and training as well as guaranteeing basic working conditions. There was no evidence to suggest wage costs were unduly inflated by the board's existence, it said. Alison Maitland reports on the unlikely alliance of farming unions and employers seeking to retain the country's last statutory pay body MR NORMAN Davidson, a tractor driver, works 52 hours a week, starting at 5am or 6.30am and knocking off at around 5pm. He is on duty for 12 consecutive days before having two days off. Working with his boss and two colleagues at Yewtree dairy farm in the heart of Kent, he does everything from milking the 180-strong herd to clearing slurry, mending fences and ploughing. For this he takes home Pounds 190 a week. Yet Mr Davidson, who has worked on farms for 20 years, counts himself lucky. Thanks to the Agricultural Wages Board, whose future is in jeopardy because of a government review, he lives rent-free in his tied cottage. He earns a reasonable overtime rate, has at least three weeks' paid holiday a year and is entitled to buy farm produce for his family at wholesale prices. The board is the country's last remaining statutory body fixing minimum wages for low-paid workers. It is in the sights of Mrs Gillian Shephard, the agriculture minister, who steered legislation abolishing wages councils through parliament when she was employment secretary. This time she faces opposition from an unlikely alliance of employers and the Transport and General Workers Union, whose agricultural branch speaks for the country's 240,000 farmworkers. Tomorrow, the TGWU and the Labour party plan to take their campaign to Mrs Shephard's Norfolk constituency with a rally demanding that the board be retained. The board, whose powers stem from the 1948 Agricultural Wages Act, sets minimum pay for a 39-hour week for five grades of farmworker, starting at Pounds 138. It provides for sick pay, holidays, overtime rates and a ceiling of Pounds 1.50 a week rent for tied cottages. Mr Davidson fears the loss of these benefits. 'It would be every man for himself,' he said. 'It's not so much the money, it's the security. There would be a lot of disquiet because you would have no basis for knowing what you're entitled to.' The National Farmers Union said that 85 per cent to 90 per cent of its members support the board and yesterday its council called for it to be kept. Mr Davidson's boss, farmer Mr David Prentice, says abolition would lead to higher wages for some skilled workers, particularly on livestock farms where they are needed round the clock. But isolated farmworkers with little clout could well see cuts in real income, while farmers could face strife on their doorstep. 'I don't want the aggravation of negotiations,' he said. 'I don't want to see the safety net of the wages board going. If I had an argument with these three people now, I'd be well and truly up the creek.' Under pressure from both sides of the industry, the government has extended the period of consultation until November. It says it is open-minded on the issue. Moreover, time is of the essence. The government has to denounce two International Labour Organisation conventions on minimum wages and paid holidays in agriculture if it wants to abolish the board, and it can do this only once every 10 years. The year-long period for deratifying ILO Convention 99 began this August, while that applying to Convention 101 begins next summer. The minimum pay machinery has arguably helped to keep wages down because farmers have been able to say they are doing well by their workforce simply by paying slightly over the odds. Farmworkers acknowledge the board is not perfect but say that without it they would face falling wages and rising rents which could drive them off the land, hastening rural decay. Thirty people left the industry every day last year. The government may choose to avoid another high-profile battle, especially when it is trying to win back the rural vote from the Liberal Democrats. Mrs Shephard's preference could well be to keep the baord, given that she represents a farming constituency. The views of Conservative MPs in shire counties will be important but ultimately it may be the clout of farmers that settles the issue.</p>

			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET MAGAZINE CALLED 'KIND OF SCUM';  </P> <P> PRAVDA ARTICLE ATTACKS PRO-GORBACHEV EDITOR  </P> <P> A long-simmering controversy surrounding an editor at the forefront of  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's glasnost policy took an ominous turn Wednesday  when the Communist Party newspaper Pravda published a sharp attack on the  editor by an influential group of conservative writers.  </P> <P> Such cultural battles have extraordinary political significance in countries  like the Soviet Union, where rulers still rely more on ideology than on a  public mandate for their legitimacy. And while the top Soviet political leaders  have carefully steered clear of this fracas, publication of an open letter in  the country's most important newspaper appears to have increased the pressure  for them to weigh in on one side or the other.  </P> <P> While the letter did not name its target, it was clearly aimed at Vitaly A.  Korotich, a Ukrainian poet who nearly three years ago took over as editor of a  nondescript magazine called Ogonyok (Little Flame) and turned it into a leading  force for liberalization.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Distort History'  </P> <P> But to the six writers and a like-minded film director who wrote the letter to  Pravda, Ogonyok represents "a kind of scum . . . on the crest of the powerful  wave of rejuvenation." The group accused the weekly of printing unsubstantiated  articles that "distort history on an unprecedented scale . . . reassess  people's social achievements and vulgarize cultural values."  </P> <P> The letter writers, all of whom are considered key cultural conservatives,  complained that "the magazine has assumed the role of an ultimate authority in  all spheres of public life, politics, economics, culture and morals." And in  perhaps their most serious accusation, they added, "These activities have a  precisely formulated goal: to humiliate, to slander, to discredit."  </P> <P> Among the letter's signatories are the Siberian writer Valentin Rasputin and  Sergei Bondarchuk, a film director probably best known for his "War and Peace."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Others Opposed  </P> <P> While they were not signatories, other key cultural conservatives said to be  trying to force Korotich out of his post are Sergei Mikhailkov, head of the  Russian Writers Union; Yuri Bondarev, a politically powerful novelist and  Mikhailkov's deputy, and Anatoly Ivanov, editor of the rightist literary  magazine Molodaya Gvardia (Young Guard).  </P> <P> Earlier this month, members of the anti-Semitic, right-wing group called Pamyat  violently disrupted a meeting being held to nominate Korotich for a seat in the  next Soviet legislature.  </P> <P> "Korotich, you Jew, give back your silver coins," the Pamyat members shouted.  Korotich is not Jewish, but Russian anti-Semites frequently use the term  referring to anyone considered liberal or "cosmopolitan."  </P> <P> The Pravda attack was in direct response to an open letter published in  Ogonyok's first edition of 1989, in which the then-chief editor of  Literaturnaya Rossiya (Russian Literature), the official publication of the  Russian Writers Union, accused his superior, Bondarev, of working against  Gorbachev's policy of perestroika, or the "restructuring" of Soviet society.  "You need the paper as your own mouthpiece, promoting your -- let's put it  mildly -- not very progressive ideas, which would protect you and your group  from criticism and which would expose and soil your enemies," wrote journalist  Mikhail Kolosov.  </P> <P> By the next issue of Literaturnaya Rossiya, the 65-year-old Kolosov's name had  disappeared from the masthead. And in response to a query from The Times on  Wednesday, a spokesman for the publication said he "has been retired."  </P> <P> "Haven't we lost our dignity and public conscience if we can permit such  humiliation and dishonor of the famous artist without any cause?" the Pravda  letter asked rhetorically about the attack on Bondarev.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Critical of Perestroika  </P> <P> Bondarev has been publicly critical of Gorbachev's policies, most notably  during last summer's party conference here, when he compared perestroika to an  airplane that had taken off without any clear destination.  </P> <P> Korotich, who is said to be abroad and unavailable for comment Wednesday, is  considered one of Gorbachev's closest allies.  </P> <P> Still, the Soviet leader has apparently been trying to stay out of the cultural  fray while he deals with a potentially even more serious backlash among  ordinary Soviet citizens who have so far seen mostly empty store shelves in the  wake of his "restructuring."  </P> <P> When Korotich was attacked last week at a meeting attended by a group of  leading Soviet intellectuals, Gorbachev at one point reportedly said, "Why  don't our writers adopt the principle of unilateral disarmament?"  </P> <P> But the Pravda letter appears to represent instead a new phase of the cultural  arms race.  </P></p>

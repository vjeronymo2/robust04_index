			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister says any suggestion to restrict  the country's nuclear option is unacceptable in view of  Pakistan's acquisition of nuclear capabilities. Addressing the  Army Commanders Conference in New Delhi today, Mr. Narasimha Rao  said India is in favor of a time-bound universal and  nondiscriminatory nuclear disarmament. He said New Delhi has  always advocated peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Referring to  the allegations of human rights violations, he said that  anti-India forces are using these for political exploitation.  Mr. Rao called upon such forces to stop maligning India on this  score as New Delhi's concern for human rights is second to none.  The prime minister said that the low intensity conflict  sponsored by Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir is a major challenge.  Islamabad is sending terrorists, including foreign mercenaries,  to the state, he added.</p>

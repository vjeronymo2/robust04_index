			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / People: Turkey, Israel, Portugal. . . and Switzerland UBS, keen to build up its southern and eastern European emerging markets business, has reached into those markets it finds most promising to recruit a new team of analysts. Emre Yigit, formerly head of research at Turkish securities firm Global Securities, will cover that region at UBS. Gidon Yardeni, formerly a senior analyst at Tel Aviv-based Pacific Mediterranean Investment Company, will follow Israeli companies, while Pedro Fonseca, an analyst at Finantia, a leading Portuguese investment bank, will provide research on Portuguese companies. Gary Rigby, managing director of equity emerging markets at UBS, says that while Turkey, Israel and Portugal may not immediately spring to mind as the hottest emerging markets of 1994, there is considerable investor interest in all three. Turkey, he notes, was the top performing emerging market in the second quarter of 1994, although he concedes that in the first quarter it was about the worst. And despite the fact that a number of Israeli companies are listed on US-based Nasdaq, European investors have relatively little access to information about them, he says.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: FT-SE 100 spearheads friendly US invasion THE LAUNCH yesterday of the FT-SE 100 index on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and a corresponding option contract on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, is the first wave of a friendly invasion of the US by European-based index futures products. US investors are increasingly buying foreign equities, a trend that US futures exchanges have been quick to capitalise on in their scramble to diversify and maintain their share of global financial trade. The New York-based Comex will begin trading futures on the European Options Exchange's index of most actively-traded European stocks, the Eurotop 100, on October 26, with the American Stock Exchange offering options on the index. US exchanges are also eyeing Germany's DAX and France's CAC-40, waiting for trading and regulatory climates to ripen to a point where US-based contracts will be feasible. The success of US derivatives on foreign markets will depend on whether institutional investors find them more profitable to trade than home-based varieties. US futures exchanges are betting that fund managers will be attracted by their lower costs, familiar trading hours, dollar-denomination, plus familiar American regulations and settlement procedures. Los Angeles-based TSA Capital Management, a consulting firm which advises pension fund managers, says that less than 5 per cent of pension fund assets are currently invested in foreign equities. Like others, he expects that to rise to 15 to 20 per cent among more aggressive funds. The US-based FT-SE 100 contracts will begin on a strong footing. The product will be simultaneously available to the CME and CBOE. In earlier editions yesterday, the FT-SE 100 index was wrongly described as the FT-SE Eurotrack 100.</p>

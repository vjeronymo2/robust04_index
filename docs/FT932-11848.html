			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: Morgan Stanley plans issue of up to Dollars 10bn Opals MORGAN STANLEY has designed a new range of securities, offering investors exposure to country-specific equity indices through Opals - Optimised Portfolios As Listed Securities. Morgan Stanley plans to issue up to Dollars 10bn of Opals, structured as three-year bonds, but declined to reveal how much has been sold in two weeks of marketing so far. The securities are backed by a basket of shares, designed to replicate the index. Instead of a coupon, the bonds pay the share dividends semi-annually. Like index futures, Opals can be used for asset allocation. However, some institutions cannot use futures, for legal or tax reasons, or because they are not allowed under trust deeds. Thus, although it has some characteristics of a derivative instrument, Opals are actually bonds backed by shares, and can be exchanged for the underlying shares at any time, or at maturity. Unlike investments trusts, Opals will not trade at a discount, because the bonds can be traded in for shares. Further, it is designed as a passive investment tool, that is, it merely replicates an index, and does not involve stock-picking. 'The product is dependent on being able to package a lot of different services - such as equity analytics, international stock lending, and global custody,' said Mr Bob Tull, a director of Morgan Stanley. Many institutional investors will prefer to use the futures markets, which offer the best liquidity. However, index futures contracts are not available in all markets, and Opals may be a welcome alternative in some areas. There are plans to offer Opals in market such as Norway, Italy, and New Zealand, for example. Opals are likely to suit institutional investors wanting to make reasonably long-term investment decisions, rather than taking short-term positions. Futures are more suitable as a trading instrument, since they can be sold short. Earlier this year, the American Stock Exchange launched Standard &amp; Poor's Depositary Receipts (SPDRs), known as Spiders. The product is backed by a trust which holds the main S&amp;P shares, allowing investors to track the performance of the S&amp;P 500 stock index.</p>

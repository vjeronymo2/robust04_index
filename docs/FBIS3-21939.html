A street corner ambush    Noon. 8 September 1993.    In the busiest part of central Nanning, the capital of  Guangxi, Gonghe Road was as busy as usual, with people going to  or returning from work. The bustling about was never-ending.    In front of the Telecommunications Bureau, an ordinary  looking middle-aged man was squatting on his heels by a flight  of steps, reading a newspaper. At a small cigarette booth to the  left, a young man was haggling with the vendor over a slight  rise in the price. Over 40 meters away, another young man was  angry that his motorcycle was leaking oil. Two more young men  were wiping away their perspiration with napkins, while  complaining of the "too hot weather", and drinking from cans of  chilled honey peach juice....    At 1240, a man in a T-shirt driving a woman's red "Haomai"  brand motorcycle, with a fine black combination lock briefcase  on its back, sped out of a small lane into Gonghe road, and  rapidly proceeded north along Gonghe Road.    Just at that moment, the middle-aged man who had been  reading  his newspaper stood up, seemingly aimlessly. Rolling up the  newspaper, he slapped it twice against his palm. At once, the  people who had been buying cigarettes, repairing the motorcycle,  or having cold drinks all got on their motorcycles, and followed  the red "Haomai" motorcycle.    At that time, the man was radiant with happiness and  immensely proud. Less than 20 minutes before, he had reached  agreement with a big businessman from Guangzhou on a "deal"  which had earned him several hundred thousand yuan in less than  two days! With the money in his wallet, he was proud and happy,  feeling as if he were suddenly sitting on a gold mountain.    But it didn't last long. He saw that a car ahead of him was  disabled, and with a lot of police "checking" there, he said to  himself that it was "a collision--bad luck," and rapidly turned  towards the intersection of Gonghe Road and Beining Street,  trying to sneak away. But the five motorcyclists following him  just surrounded him in the center of the road. Two strong young  men jumped upon him from both sides, and handcuffed him tightly.    Another young man quickly seized the black briefcase, took a  fast look at the lock and with rapid and practiced movements  opened, and then immediately closed it, a scornful smile on his  face.    The man suddenly changed from looking immensely proud to  deathly pale, and began to sweat. He then was unable to stand,  and collapsed.    "Take him away!"    The entire arresting process had taken only three minutes.  It  was over so quickly that bystanders were still unaware of what  had happened.    As recently as just one month before, the Nanning Municipal  Public Security Bureau (PSB) received some intelligence: Someone  was selling large quantities of highly concentrated heroin in  the metropolitan area. With perfect arrangements and controls,  and after a 72 hour stakeout, the scene in the street occurred.    The man reading the newspaper was the head of the drug  enforcement squad of the Nanning PSB, Police Supervisor Second  Class Xie Yiqi [6220 0122 1142]. The young men who participated  in apprehending this drug dealer were the Assistant Head of the  Drug Enforcement Squad Nong Jingyao [6593 6855 1031] and 10  other excellent detectives from the Drug Enforcement Squad.    The street ambush in the end accomplished this: The  confiscation of 12 parcels of concentrated "Double Lion Global  Brand" heroin, 3,900 grams total.    Calculated on the retail price in the United States black  market at the beginning of this decade, 3,900 grams of heroin  could be sold for $8 million. Even if it were sold in Hong  Kong, it could still bring in tremendous profits of more than $3  million.    But the police did not seem particularly happy about getting  this large quantity of drugs. This was because the battle had  only started.    2. Victory is followed by hot pursuit    The drug dealer was taken into the interrogation room.    There were only chairs and a table in the room, and the  walls  were painted a snowy white. The only thing catching the eye were  eight words posted on a wall: "Leniency to those who confess  their crimes and severity to those who refuse".    The old, veteran detective Huang Feng [7806 2800], already  greying at the temples, has piercing eyes even when he isn't  mad. Now, he opened the black briefcase and lay the drugs on the  table, staring at the drug dealer's eyes without saying one word.    The young detective Li Kai [2621 0418] kept to the side,  awaiting his time to pressure the criminal.    The atmosphere in the room was very tense.    Minute by minute, the time passed by.    Gradually, the drug dealer's will fell apart, he could hold  out no longer, so he yelled, "I want to confess! I'm guilty! I  beg the government give me a break, give me a chance to do  something worthwhile to make up for my crimes..."    The drug dealer (called "A" from here on for  short) confessed that he was 32 years old this year, of the Han  nationality, with a junior middle school education. He was the  son of a worker in a suburban Nanning work unit. In 1983, he was  sentenced to three years for larceny, and was released in 1986  after serving his sentence. He then went to Ruili, Yunnan, where  he married a local woman, and lived with her in housing of a  work unit in a north Nanning suburb.    Huang Feng interrogated him directly, "How many drugs have  you sold in Nanning in all?"    A was flustered, but still wanted to cover up:  "Just the 12 parcels, no more than that, no more..."    Huang Feng snorted. "No more than that? Would you like me to  bring you a witness to confirm that? You had better be a little  more clear-minded. We caught you out of a city of a million  people; that's not something we did casually."    A knew quite well that the business he was  involved in was dangerous, so he was always very careful. He  couldn't understand why he still couldn't shake the drug  enforcement police off his trail, even though he had changed his  expression and movements several tens of times over the past  month. What had gone wrong? However, he did understand that  since the PSB already knew so much about his activities, if he  didn't tell the truth, he would suffer the consequences of  "severity to those who refuse."    In the end, A started to confess.    After A had been released when his sentence  expired, he moved to Ruili, Yunnan, and made his living by  cheating, defrauding, and swindling. He very soon met a drug  dealer named Yang Anquan [2799 1344 0356]. In July, 1993,  A and Yang Anquan shipped 8,500 g of heroin from  Ruili to Nanning and sold it there. In addition to the 12  parcels of 3,900 grams of heroin which had been seized, others  had been sold, and 270,000 yuan in illicit money had been  brought to Yunnan three days before. Before his departure, Yuan  told A that he had another 20 parcels of heroin which  he would market in Nanning later.    From many years experience in public security work, Huang  Feng was certain that A had not told him everything,  so he kept on pressing him. "Tell me, who bought drugs from you  in Nanning? Don't expect to sneak away!"    This made A collapse.    "Well, I...I thought of..." A had to confess more  about his crimes.    On the same night, five officers, including detectives Zeng  Xuyan [2582 2485 1750] and He Daguang [0149 1129 0342], drove  directly to the suburb of Yanzhiling, where they knocked at a  resident's house.    Just as they were going in, Zheng Xuyan shouted loudly:  "Brother He! Brother Yun! How about we do some business!"    The drug dealers Pan Hefei [3382 7729 7378] and his brother  Pan Yunfei [3382 0061 7378] were playing cards under the light.  Hearing the shout, they raised their heads. The men before them  now had never come there before, so they were puzzled: "We don't  know any of you brothers, and we don't know what kind of  business you want us do?"    Zheng Xuyan was still all smiles: "We're sure this business  will be done. But I know you'll definitely be the loser in it!"  He then yelled: "Go!" Acting in pairs, the four other policemen  grabbed each of the drug dealing Pan brothers. They were easily  handcuffed, then escorted to the police car.    After nabbing the Nanning drug dealers, the tracking squad  then began a long distance, direct trip to Yunnan. On 10  September at 1300, two police cars quietly left Nanning. Riding  in them were the Assistant Head Nong Jingyao, and the rest of  his outstanding detectives: Zhen Xuyan, Li Jiansheng [2621 1696  3932], Liao Bin [1675 2430], Tan Ping [6223 1627], He Daguang,  Li Kai, Tan Yiqing [6223 0110 0282], Gu Wenyong [7357 2429  0516], and Li Shihong [2621 0013 1347].    They arrived in Yunnan in the midst of the rainy season. The  road zigzagged through the tropical rainy forest, and for one 10  km stretch the roadbed had caved in, greatly delaying their  driving time. To catch all the criminals in the case, the  tracking squad continued their trip by day and night, despite  fatigue and bad weather. When they arrived in the city of Ruili  on 15 September, it was already dusk.    3. By intelligence and courage    On the morning of 16 September, Detectives Tan and Li, in  the  guise of big businessmen, and along with the drug dealer  A, checked into a very luxurious hotel in Ruili. The  next afternoon, according to plan, they went with A  to meet Yang Anquan at his home.    Although Yang Anquan was only 27 years old, his long time in  the underworld had made him very wary. He looked at the two  businessmen suspiciously, and immediately rejected them: "I  don't have any of that stuff, you'd better look somewhere else!"    Afraid of losing his chance to atone for his crimes through  performing meritorious services, A hurried to say,  "Didn't you say you have 20 more parcels of the stuff? How can  you deny it when I've brought these businessmen such a long way?  Do you want to make us go back empty-handed?"    Yang Anquan flatly denied it. "Did I say that? Maybe you  heard me wrong!"    Tan knew how to handle people like Yang Anquan: give them  more latitude at first, to keep a tighter rein on them  afterwards. Therefore, he said, "Since Mr. Yang doesn't want to  do any business, why should we bother him? Let's go!" The three  of them confidently started to leave.    But just as the three of them were getting into their car,  Yang called after them: "Wait a minute! Where do you live?"  Detective Li smiled to himself; the fish was taking the bait. He  pretended not to show interest: "In the xx Hotel, room xx. But  since you don't have the stuff, why bother!"    Yang Anquan tried to make up to them: "I'm sorry, I was  boasting last time. Actually, the goods are there, but somebody  else has them, and besides, the goods are in Myanmar. If you two  want to do some business, I can introduce you."    It was found out later that the reasons Yang Anquan refused  right at that moment were, one, he was being cautious, and two,  he wanted to get rid of A and keep all the profits  for himself. But then when he saw how close A was to  the "businessmen," he realized that was impossible, so he had to  change his mind, and decided to share the profits with  A.    On 18 September, Yang Anquan twice went to see the  detectives, negotiating with them as the representative of the  owner. Tan and Li used high performing skills in bargaining with  him.    Yang Anquan said, "The owner wants you to pay a 60,000 yuan  advance deposit."    Tan replied, "Nonsense!" We haven't seen the goods yet, or  him, so why should we give you 60,000 yuan up front? If you take  off with the money, where do we look for you?"    Li chimed in on Tan's side. "What? Are you dreaming, don't  you know the rules? The money is handed over while checking the  goods! It's always been done that way!"    A, who was ambitious to earn merit points, also  frequently interrupted to blame Yang Anquan.    Seeing that the other side was so sophisticated, Yang Anquan  believed they were real buyers. Expecting to make a great deal  of money soon, his enthusiasm for this deal grew. At last, they  reached an agreement to pay only a 30,000 yuan deposit, which  Yang would pay for them, expecting to be repaid later. He would  bring the owner of the drugs across the border the next day to  contact them.    B [the drug owner] was a large man, tough-looking  and menacing. Many years of rough experience in the underworld  had made him a typical desperado. But he was not suspicious this  time, since he had safely done business with Yang Anquan on  numerous prior occasions. So, as soon as he entered the room, he  asked: "Did you two businessmen bring enough money?"    "Name a price," said Tan.    B lifted his middle finger. "200,000 yuan!"    With a cold smile, Tan said, "We didn't bring that much. We  initially agreed in Nanning that we would get the goods, so why  should we have to bring so much money here?"    B insisted that the goods would not be shipped  from Myanmar unless he saw the money first. At the same time,  our side insisted on not paying before seeing the goods. The  "negotiations" broke up in discord.    Nong Jingguang immediately reported the situation to the  Nanning PSB, and his superiors there instructed him to accept  the conditions.    The following day, the detectives returned to the  "negotiations", and told B that they agreed to his  demand to "see the money before shipping the goods", but our  side still insisted on "paying for the goods on receipt."    Although the "negotiations" had succeeded, it was not easy  to  raise 200,000 yuan in cash in so little time. The drug  enforcement squads of the Yunnan Dehong Dai Nationality Jinpo  Autonomous Prefecture and the Ruili PSB gave them their full  support, and helped their police comrades from Guangxi raise the  200,000 yuan in a very short time.    On 24 September, a mysterious person unobtrusively entered a  hotel in Ruili, carrying two heavy suitcases.    On the afternoon of 25 September, when these two suitcases  filled with cash were opened in front of Yang Anquan and  B, these two money-loving people suddenly emitted  spittle three feet in length--drooling with envy, they agreed  with great pleasure to ship the goods as soon as they had  returned to Myanmar.    So, after 10 full days and 12 contacts, negotiations, and  repeated arguments, Yang Anquan and B would send the  real goods. At that time, it was only six days before the Moon  Festival and National Day, a time when every family gets  together to enjoy the moon and their affection for each other.  This meant that the tracking squad would be far from Nanning and  missing their families.    On the night of the Moon Festival, when the beautiful bright  moon had just risen, someone knocked at the rooms where the  detectives were staying. The visitor gave them a package of food  and said, significantly, "`Dad' let me bring you some moon  cakes. `Dad' says that everything is O.K. at home, and he just  wants you to concentrate on the `business' and come back home."    Every detective in the tracking group understood that this  was a gesture of caring on the part of their organization. It  gave them such a warm feeling, eating the authentic Lianrong  moon cakes from their hometown, and there was sweetness in their  hearts.    4. All-out attack    The days had passed, but B had still not returned  from his secret trip back to Myanmar. Waiting on the Chinese  border, Yang Anquan had grown anxious and worried.    Had something gone wrong?    Yang Anquan couldn't stand waiting any more, so he went to  Myanmar.    Nong Jingyao and his tracking squad held an emergency  discussion: We still have the money, the drug dealers won't  sneak away without getting the money. Because the money is their  only objective, they will definitely come back for it.    Finally, after another eight days had passed, Yang Anquan  and  B met again as arranged. They solemnly announced that  the goods were all set, and would be shipped. What had happened  was that during this time, Yang Anquan and B had been  looking for cotton and rattan in Myanmar; the plan was to hide  the goods inside cotton or rattan for shipment through China's  border customs.    On the morning of 18 October, B hid the drugs  inside the cotton, and drove to the customs on the China border.  When he learned that cotton was subject to a strict, 5-day  quarantine examination, he became frightened and quietly went  back.    It was really a problem. The tracking group reported it to  the Dehong Prefecture PSB and the Ruili PSB. In the meantime,  they kept on observing, waiting for their chance.    On 22 October at 0900, Yang Anquan and B suddenly  appeared and asked that Tan go with B to inspect the  goods. Yang Anquan stayed behind with Li and A.    Things had suddenly taken a very dangerous turn: Tan would  have to go to the drug dealing site; what would happen? Li would  stay behind, but what if A, the drug dealers'  one-time associate, was hot to deal with them, and pulled a  double-cross? Even more important, they hadn't received the  drugs yet, did not even know where they were. If the drug  dealers escaped, they would be far short of success for lack of  a final effort.    If we don't take action now, what are we waiting for? Nong  Jingyao made up his mind at once, and immediately divided the  tracking squad into two groups, one going by car and  motorcycles, following Tan's route and reacting as events  unfolded. The other group stayed behind, responsible for  arresting the remaining drug dealers.    Detective Zhen Xuyan burst into the hotel room, and gave an  eye signal to Li. Acting simultaneously, the two grabbed Yang  Anquan, who had no time to react, and wrestled him to the floor.  Detectives Li Jiansheng and Liao Bing rushed in, rapidly  handcuffed Yang Anquan and A, and escorted them to  another room for close surveillance.    Meanwhile, B had led Tan to a freight yard. There  was nothing in the yard, no trucks at all.    The goods had disappeared!    Leaving Tan there, B left hurriedly on a  motorcycle. Nong Jingyao, who had been following them, saw that  Tan was all right, and waved to indicate that he would continue  to observe the situation.    Certain that B would return to the hotel  regardless of whether he found the goods, Tan took a taxi back  to the hotel.    After searching everywhere for his missing rented truck,  B decided that our detectives were not underworld  figures, but outsiders who had stolen the drugs. Furious, he  returned to the hotel to find the "businessmen" and settle  accounts.    Entering the room, and finding both A and Yang  Anquan had disappeared, he realized something was wrong and  tried to escape. Tan and Li jumped into his way, and at first  tried to place him under arrest. But B resisted so  fiercely that they were unable to restrain him at once. The  sharp-witted Li Kai joined in the struggle, and taking out his  pistol beat B roughly about the head. The three  detectives used their fists, elbows, and feet, and finally  subdued the crazy B after more than 10 minutes' of  fierce fighting. B completely lost his ability to  resist, and collapsed to the floor.    Both Yang Anquan and B had been apprehended, but  where were the drugs?    "Search!"    The emergency order went out immediately on the radio waves.  Police from the Ruili PSB and other Yunnan police agencies, who  had been standing by for some time, were divided into more than  10 searching parties. Like lightning, they ran out to every  parking lot and freight yard.    Meanwhile, three other squads went separately to arrest  other  criminals--Yang Anquan's wife, Xiao Rong [2556 2837], was  arrested at her home while playing majhong with a neighbor. Li  and two other police officers broke down the door, brandishing  an arrest warrant.    The driver Zhang Xinping [1728 2450 1627], who had been  responsible for transporting the drugs, had just returned from a  truck parking lot. He hadn't even time to smoke a cigarette  before two police officers suddenly appeared, shouting, "Don't  move! Come with us." So he was caught.    The female drug dealer Meng Shuai [1322 1596] was drinking  with her husband in their family's restaurant, when Gu Wenyong  [7357 2429 0516] and three other police officers suddenly  appeared as if from the air, catching her as well.    After a complete and thorough search of each parking lot and  freight yard, they still had not found the car carrying the  drugs.    Nong Jingyao was deeply concerned about the situation.  Suddenly, he realized what the problem was, and asked Yang  Anquan, "You were there when the drugs were loaded. Tell me!  What kind of car was it? What was the number of the car?"    Yang Anquan answered, "It was an 8-ton truck, Yellow River  make, with the number..."    Nong Jingyao's thinking was that the hired driver was  unaware  of what had happened. The original agreement was to ship the  cotton to Nanning, where payment would be made; was it possible  that the driver had been too impatient to wait for B  to bring people to check the goods, and he left?" Inspired, he  at once gave the order: "Follow him to Kunming!"    The detectives jumped into the already moving police car and  sped off.    The road was full of zigzags and slopes, and cave-ins were  encountered frequently, but Tan Yiqing was a highly skilled  driver and continued to increase his speed, 60 km, 80 km....    More than an hour later, they finally caught up with the  Yellow River truck. Tan Yiqing made a beautiful sharp right  turn, then slammed on his brakes, bringing the Yellow River  truck to a halt.    When the car had come to a complete stop, the detectives  jumped out and took up positions which blocked the truck's  retreat.    They carefully searched through 120 individual parcels of  cotton. Not until they got to the bottom did they find it: 58  parcels of concentrated heroin, with a gross weight of 20,560 g.    So now, the number one drug enforcement case in Guangxi was  a  complete success, with a total of 24,460 g (24.26 kg) of heroin  confiscated, and with the apprehension of eight drug dealers  both from within China and from outside its borders.    At 1500 on 12 November, as the three police cars carrying  the  drug dealers drove into the Nanning PSB, several hundred family  members, coworkers, and ordinary people welcomed them with  applauuse and cheers.    Nong Jingyao ordered, "Line up! Salute!"    Ten detectives dressed in camouflage at once lined up, and  saluted their family members, the national flag, and the people.  That image of 10 muscular bodies shining in the afternoon  sunshine is deeply etched in people's minds.</p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / World Trade News: C&amp;W consortium wins Latvian telecom deal The Latvian government will today award a contract to modernise the country's telecommunications network to a consortium headed by Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecommunications group. The contract includes the privatisation of Lattelekom, the Latvian state operator. In return for a guaranteed Dollars 160m (Pounds 108.10m) of investment over the next three years, the consortium will take a 49 per cent stake in the company. The deal is the first internationally-tendered privatisation of a state telecommunications operator in the former Soviet Union. It follows the partial privatisation of Matav, the Hungarian state operator, last month, which was the first in the former eastern bloc. C&amp;W has a 70 per cent stake in the Latvian consortium; Telecom Finland, the Finnish state-owned operator, the other 30 per cent. The two defeated a bid by Deutsche Telekom, the German state operator, which won the Matav contract as head of consortium from which C&amp;W withdrew at a late stage. C&amp;W and Telecom Finland have agreed to carry through a 10-year modernisation plan to include the installation of at least 650,000 new digital phone lines, almost doubling Latvia's number of phone lines. Although Latvia has one of the former Soviet Union's more extensive phone networks, its number of lines per head is barely half that in the UK and the equipment is antiquated. A year ago there was a 170,000-long waiting list for new lines. C&amp;W's largest business is Hong Kong Telecom. The Latvian contract strengthens its north European base. It has an 80 per cent stake in the second national network in the UK (Mercury), and a 39.9 per cent stake in the second carrier in Sweden (Tele2). It also has mobile phone activities in Belarus, and a 40 per cent stake in a company providing international services in St Petersburg. Lord Young, C&amp;W chairman, said he expected the Latvian privatisation to set a precedent for the other Baltic states.</p>

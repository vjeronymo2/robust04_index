			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Arts: The killing fields brought home - Television In the wrong part of Sarajevo, the washing-up can cost you your life. Panorama's Forcing a Peace (BBC 1, Monday) began with reporter Martin Bell and his crew filming people who daily run the gauntlet to fetch water from a tap in a cellar, the only running water left in their neighbourhood. Each day, Serb snipers pick off their toll of victims. We saw a young man shot in the thigh, saw the fresh wound, and his puzzled expression suddenly wiped away by the white-faced immobility of shock. Bell's interpreter, a doctor, staunched the wound and the BBC jeep did duty as an ambulance. This was a notable feat of reporting and deeply harrowing. Bell's team filmed the fighting in the front-line of the battle, from trenches cut through Sarajevo's Olympic Village. Killing and the daily struggle to live are closely intertwined. As trees in the parks are hacked down for firewood, the snipers' aim gets ever more accurate. The parks, and now a football pitch, have been taken over for cemeteries. A bread-queue makes an easy target. Over the months, film-clips on the news broadcasts have tended to become cliches which actually make it harder to register what life can actually be like in Sarajevo. Time and again, we have seen puffs of white smoke drifting over what still seems like a picture-postcard prospect of tiled roofs, tawny-coloured churches and minarets. Film of UN military vehicles on the road to the airport can become an image of normality. Last night's images gave the lie to that when we saw UN vehicles speed past a young woman lying by the roadside in a pool of blood. It takes time to bring home the savagery of the war in Bosnia. Monday night's Panorama seemed like a very long 40 minutes. A Moslem woman spoke of months of captivity with 12 other women, and of being subjected to rape once, twice, or more at night. She spoke, too, of a six year-old girl held with them. A UN worker described in detail the manner in which amputations had been carried out in one hospital in a besieged Moslem town. Children endure that, too, and the wonder is that some of them even survive. Bell's point was a simple one; that the ordinary Bosnians' suffering has been so great that the outside world must now intervene to force a peace. Rightly, he did not get into discussion of precisely how that might happen, and what it might cost in non-Bosnian lives. His aim was an unsparing and, in the end, even-handed presentation of the ghastliness of this war. In a Bosnian Serb village, 23 were massacred, either shot or their throats cut in cold blood. Their corpses lay in a room awaiting burial, white and stiff as tailors' dummies. For some reason, in the UK the Bosnian tragedy has failed to trigger that mysterious thing, a public sense of pity and outrage. The trivialisation of TV news can hardly have helped. Last year's revamp of ITV's News at Ten has left it with a glib format which on some nights teeters on the edge of inanity. Serious current affairs documentaries of the calibre of Panorama are more to be prized than ever. Until this week, I had a false image of what going down the Nile on a pleasure-boat entails. My mental picture was of people on deck-chairs beneath an awning, looking with rapt interest at the immemorial landscape of palms, peasants, and water-buffalo. But apparently it is not like that at all, accord-ing to BBC2's Assignment report on Egypt, The Gun and the Veil (Tuesday). These days, people go down the Nile lying side by side, nearly naked and sweating oil rather in the manner of sardines on toast. It seems not so hard to sympathise with the views of Omar Abdul Rahman, leader of the Islamic League. The sheikh is a venerable, blind, holy man who lives in voluntary exile in New York after being tried, but acquitted, on the charge of ordering President Sadat's assassination. He inveighs against tourists as the work of the devil, polluting the land with gambling, adultery, prostitution, Aids, etc. Unfortunately, the sheikh's words did not make clear whether he will tolerate on Egyptian soil the kind of discreet, respectably dressed tourist who wears ankle-length skirts and a head-scarf. Since followers of the Islamic League have murdered a small number of tourists, one would have appreciated a directive from the sheikh. At any rate, substantial damage has been done to the tourist trade, allegedly down some 30 to 50 per cent this year, causing the Egyptian government to lose millions of dollars in revenue. And yet, there is far more to the rising tide of religious orthodoxy in Egypt than highly-publicised violence against westerners. In a poor (albeit by no means the poorest) district of Cairo, the kind of area where tourists never penetrate, the blocks of flats look onto lakes of sewage. In such districts, the Moslem Brotherhood runs cheap yet effective clinics where doctors and nurses show themselves to be kind, compassionate, honest - in a word, to be good Moslems. This sane and sympathetically made documentary showed that it is qualities like these which may be the keenest weapon in the armoury of so-called Islamic fundamentalism. Femme Fatale by Simon Gray, in the current season of Screen 2 (BBC2, Sunday), was a black comedy about how the random relations between good intentions and evil consequences. Not vintage Gray, perhaps, but an enjoyable play all the same. Its problem lay with a dangerously slow opening. Of course the ironic undertow was there, only it seemed to be flowing a mite too sluggishly to compensate for the setting, twee flummery in a Somerset village. For a while it seemed that this was merely an EC version of Cold Comfort Farm, with a diminutive, hot-blooded Italian virgin (Sophia Diaz) brought in as agent provocateuse. Things did pick up speed once the characters developed a bit and once the cloven hoof of Vicar Ronnie became clearer, played by Simon Callow. Garage-owner Algie (James Fleet), made a splendidly evil Scots seducer who never got his girl. Without being hilarious, there was plenty to smile at. It made a nice touch to have the corpulent shopkeeper (Colin Welland) almost as enamoured of his Italian daughter-in-law's pasta, pronounced as in meat pasty, as her voluptuous body. Last week's Essential History of Europe (BBC 2, 9.00), will surely have left Luxemburgers feeling put out, and with good reason. The opening proposition was that 'more Luxemburgers commit suicide each year than are killed on the road'. Which fact is, of course, wholly meaningless unless we are also told about the country's road safety record. Instead, we were left to deduce unfavourable conclusions about the lives of the poor rich folk of that tiny nation. Later, there was sinister mention of a bridge from which suicides throw themselves, an effective and time-honoured method of doing yourself in which is also popular in London, Bristol, and Paris. What really is the evidence that Luxemburgers are the lemmings of the EC? As far as I know, every country in the EC has a drugs problem so it seemed gratuitous to fasten on the drugs scene in Luxemburg. Furthermore, it is plain silly to claim anything paradoxical in a country where jobs are plentiful and living-standards are notably high, having the same proportion of drug addicts as in 'other major capitals'. From the stand-point of this oddly prejudiced, often self-contradictory analysis, Luxemburg was in a no-win position. The strangest things were marked to the debit side of the slate; that there is only one prison, and that one third of its inmates are there for drug-related crimes. Again, without statistics this is meaningless. Maybe there is a super-efficient gendarmerie, or maybe there are only thirty criminals in jug. The children of the country's large influx of Portuguese workers 'are becoming Luxemburgers' - the innuendo being this this is per se a bad thing. In the last war, the 'German occupation focused Luxemburg's frail sense of nationality'. Why should it be judged frail, given that previous speakers had stressed the cohesiveness of this fortress state, its inhabitants bound by their 'secret language' and their passion for clubs. It will be inter-esting to see what next's week's concluding film in this provocative series makes of Belgium's wartime experience.</p>

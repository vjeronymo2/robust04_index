			<p>BFN     [Text] While conducting investigations and research in  Shanghai recently, Wei Jianxing, member of the CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau, secretary of the CPC Central  Discipline Inspection Commission, and president of the All-China  Federation of Trade Unions, indicated: As the Shanghai  Municipal Party Committee and government have been upholding the  principle "that while enhancing economic construction, we should  also simultaneously and strictly crack down on crimes,"  Shanghai's anticorruption work has a relatively firm foundation.  He expressed his hope: Proceeding from Shanghai's current  actual conditions, the municipal party committee and government  will continually explore new experiences in improving the  party's workstyle and enhancing honest government under the new  circumstances, and will play greater roles in boosting  Shanghai's reform, development, and stability.    While conducting investigations and research in Shanghai  during 16-25 April, Comrade Wei Jianxing held conversations with  Wu Bangguo, secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee,  and Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju. He successively heard work reports  given by Zhang Huixin, secretary of the municipal discipline  inspection commission, and Bao Xinbao, chairman of the Shanghai  Municipal Trade Union Council. He also separately held  discussion meetings with leaders of some district and county  party committees and governments, secretaries of some discipline  inspection commissions, and cadres of enterprise trade unions.  Additionally, he personally visited the Pudong New District and  the Caohejing Development Zone.    Comrade Wei Jianxing pointed out: When carrying out  anticorruption drive, we should pay attention to handling it  from a macroeconomical viewpoint, stress education programs, aim  at prevention, be concerned to resolve deep-seated issues, and  properly conduct comprehensive rectification. The Shanghai  Municipal Party Committee and government have been resolutely  carrying out the anticorruption drive formulated by the party  Central Committee and the State Council, and have been improving  the party's workstyle and enhancing honest government by  upgrading relevant mechanisms and legal and organizational  systems. It is a good experience. He expressed his hope:  Persistently proceeding from its current actual conditions,  Shanghai will continually explore new ways and methods in  improving the party's workstyle and enhancing honest government  under the new circumstances, and will creatively carry out the  anticorruption drive.    Comrade Wei Jianxing pointed out: At present, trade unions  at various levels should correctly regard and properly handle  the relations among reform, development, and stability. They  should pay special attention to and be concerned for, reveal,  and help resolve the hardships of some staff members and  workers. Trade unions should adapt to new circumstances; should  widen their field of vision; should expand their tasks; and  should actively explore new methods and new experiences that  more effectively express and safeguard the specific interests of  staff members and workers, while safeguarding the overall  interests of all the Chinese people. They should support and  participate in various reforms; should respect actual practice;  should assess all tasks through experiments; should uphold and  promote the party's fine traditions and trade union work  experiences that have been accumulated in the past and that have  been effective; and should realistically implement the party's  policy of wholeheartedly relying on the working class.</p>

			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> ANTHRAX TURNS SHOW INTO SLAM DANCE PIT  </P> <P> Anthrax is the speed-metal band your parents might not mind your listening to,  a bunch of regular guys who wear jams, read Mad and watch "Yo! MTV Raps" just  like any other teen-age kids, guys who write songs about Indian rights and the  homeless instead of about Satan or sexist love. They're not half so into the  apocalypse as other headbangers -- and their audiences tend to slam-dance  instead of brood.  </P> <P> Anthrax, in town to record their fourth album, played a show at the Troubadour  Friday to test some new songs in front of a live audience. Anthrax usually  plays arenas; to speed-metal fans, scamming a ticket to the last-minute gig was  like their parents' getting in to see Springsteen at the Roxy.  </P> <P> It's less accurate to say that a slam pit formed than that the entire club  turned into a slam pit, bodies thrashing, one small fellow turning repeated  back-flips off the stage, a sump of sweat and beer. Half the audience hummed  the guitar leads, chanted along with the words, even on Anthrax's rap song, "I  Am the Man," which never made it onto an album. It was strictly unnecessary for  the rest of the band to join in on the choruses. The audience participation was  less on the new songs -- Joey Belladonna constantly apologized for them. "Yo. I  promise. When it's on the album, you'll like it," he said. JONATHAN GOLD  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 6 May (XINHUA) -- Opinions for the  implementation of the "five provisions" set out and reiterated  by the third plenary session of the Central Discipline  Inspection Commission on ensuring the integrity and  self-discipline of leading government and party cadres at or  above the county (department) level:    With the approval of the CPC Central Committee, the third  plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission  set out and reiterated that the "five provisions" on ensuring  the integrity and self-discipline of leading government and  party cadres at or above the county (department) level  (hereafter referred to as the "five new provisions") are norms  of conduct for leading government and party cadres at or above  the county (department) level. These opinions are formulated to  ensure the implementation of the "five new provisions" and to  correctly handle acts in violation of the "five new provisions."    1. The "five new provisions" are applicable to leading  government and party cadres at or above the county (department)  level, including leading cadres and their deputies at or above  the county (department) level in the party, the National  People's Congress, the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference, and in administrative, judicial, and procuratorial  organs. Leading party and government cadres as well as their  deputies who are continuing to perform official duties while at  retirement age are also included.    The "five new provisions" are applicable to leading cadres  and their deputies at or above the county (department) level in  enterprises (companies) and institutions (federations) of an  administrative nature, in trade unions, Communist Youth League  [CYL] organs, women's federations, the China Federation of  Literary and Art Circles, and the China Association for Science  and Technology; in party and government-owned newspaper offices,  magazine offices, publishing houses, radio stations, television  stations, party schools, administrative colleges (schools), and  institutions; and in schools under the All-China Federation of  Trade Unions, the CYL, and the All-China Women's Federation.    The "five new provisions" are also applicable to cadres and  deputies at or above the county (department) level in the  aforementioned organs who are not holding leading positions.    2. In accordance with the demands set out in the "Circular  Concerning Holding Special Seminars on Democratic Life and  Meeting the Requirements of the Provisions on Ensuring the  Integrity and Self-Discipline of Leading Cadres" (circular No. 3  issued by the Central Discipline Inspection Commission in 1994),  leading government and party cadres at or above the county  (department) level must conduct inspections in line with the  "five new provisions" at special seminars on democratic life.  The inspections must be focused on acts in violation of the  "five new provisions" after 1 July 1992. Leading cadres must  take the initiative in correcting these acts. Party organs and  governments at all levels must organize efforts to  conscientiously examine and check on the progress of  self-correction and self-investigations carried out by leading  cadres.    3. Imported luxury cars purchased for the use of leading  cadres at the county (department) level and above or obtained in  exchange in seeking ease and comfort after 1 July 1992 in  violation of the Central Committee's relevant stipulations must  be replaced by other vehicles which meet current stipulations.  As for those who fail to check and rectify this issue  voluntarily, or those who bought or exchanged cars in violation  of stipulations after the third plenary session of the Central  Discipline Inspection Commission, their cars in question will be  taken away, with party and government disciplinary actions being  taken against the leading cadres concerned.    Various categories of motor vehicles procured through an  exchange with or a loan from subordinate units, or purchased  with apportioned funds by taking advantage of one's authority of  office, must -- in the first two cases -- be returned to the  original owning units, and -- in the last case -- funds so  apportioned must be repaid to the relevant units. Those who  fail to check and rectify this issue voluntarily, or who  exchanged with or loaned motor vehicles from enterprises or  subordinate units, or who bought them with apportioned funds,  shall be ordered to have them rectified within a specific  period, with party and government disciplinary actions being  taken against the leading cadres concerned.    The practice of purchasing cars for the use of leading  cadres  with loaned or raised funds, or with special funds, should be  checked. Cars purchased by misappropriating funds designated  for disaster relief, relief, aiding the poor, or education, as  well as those bought against regulations after the third plenary  session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, should  be auctioned off or sold. The proceeds will be used to repay  the misappropriated funds in full while party and government  disciplinary actions will be taken against the leading cadres  concerned and those who are responsible.    Smuggled cars that have been purchased illegally should be  confiscated with party and government disciplinary actions being  taken against those who are responsible.    In counties (cities) where wages owed to their staff and  workers remained unpaid (the portion for which the financial  authorities are to be responsible), cars purchased by their  leading party and government organs and other wage-owing units  should be investigated. Cars so purchased should be auctioned  off or sold, and the proceeds from this are to be used to settle  pay owed to their staff and workers. Those who fail to check  and rectify this issue voluntarily or who have violated the  provisions after the third plenary session of the Central  Discipline Inspection Commission shall be ordered to have them  rectified within a specific period, with party and government  disciplinary actions being taken against the leading cadres  concerned.    4. Those who bought houses at a price lower than that set by  local housing price evaluation bodies in accordance with sale  prices of public-owned housing approved by provincial and  autonomous regional people's governments, as well as people's  governments of municipalities directly under the central  government, in violation of the State Council's regulations on  housing structural reform and taking advantage of the authority  of office, must pay the balance in full. Those who fail to  check and rectify this issue voluntarily or who take advantage  of the authority of office to purchase houses by decreasing  their sale prices after the publication of "The State Council  General Office's Circular on the Question of Preventing Low-  Price Sales of Public Housing" on 31 December 1993 shall be  ordered to pay the balance within a specific period and face  party and government disciplinary actions.    Those who buy houses in excess of state-stipulated criteria  with the excessive portions not being bought at the market price  must pay the difference. Those who fail to check and rectify  this issue voluntarily, or who did not buy the excessive  portions at the market price after the third plenary session of  the Central Discipline Inspection Commission shall be ordered to  have these rectified within a specific period and face party and  government disciplinary action.    Those who take advantage of the authority of office by  providing preferential conditions to their children, relatives,  and friends in terms of house-purchase eligibility, sources of  housing, and purchase prices must surrender their illegally  gained benefits. Those who fail to check and rectify this issue  voluntarily, or who have provided preferential conditions for  their children, relatives, and friends in buying houses after  the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection  Commission, shall be ordered to surrender their illegally gained  benefits and face party and government disciplinary action.    Those who use public funds for personal housing renovations  in excess of stipulated criteria must repay in full the excess.  Those who fail to check and rectify this issue voluntarily or  who have used public funds for excessive renovations after the  third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection  Commission shall be ordered to repay in full the excess and face  party and government disciplinary actions. Those who, prior to  the sale of public housing, used public funds to renovate  currently occupied houses should be dealt with seriously.    Using public funds to renovate houses in excess of the  criteria for subsequent personal occupation shall be handled  according to the preceding clause.    5. Checks should be carried out on leading party and  government cadres who, while carrying out their official duties  within the country, have indulged in excessive dining and  drinking by pursuing luxury and extravagance and in violation of  food and lodging regulations set by the central authorities, and  in excess of local reception criteria formulated or approved by  provincial and autonomous regional governments as well as by  governments of municipalities directly under the central  government. For serious cases which have caused bad influences,  the offenders should be ordered to carry out the appropriate  economic compensation and face party and government disciplinary  action. Those who fail to check and rectify voluntarily this  issue or who have violated the regulations after the third  plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission  shall be ordered to pay the appropriate economic compensation  and face party and government disciplinary action.    After the third plenary session of the Central Discipline  Inspection Commission, responsible persons of relevant  departments and units found to be pursuing luxury and  extravagance by receiving leading cadres in an extravagant and  wasteful manner and in excess of stipulated criteria shall face  party and government disciplinary action.    After the third plenary session of the Central Discipline  Inspection Commission, responsible persons found to be hosting  with public funds and equipment exclusive dance parties for  leading cadres in commercially run dance halls and other places  shall face party and government disciplinary action. Leading  cadres attending dance parties hosted exclusively in their honor  should bear a certain portion of the expenses and should face  party and government disciplinary action.    6. Checks should be carried out of those who indulge in huge  extravagance and waste by capitalizing on such occasions as  their own marriages and funerals, job transfers, birthdays, and  housewarmings, as well as those of their family members. Those  who make use of the perks of their job to indulge in huge  extravagance and waste should be checked on. Those who fail to  voluntarily carry out such checks, or who have made use of their  job perks to indulge in huge extravagance and waste after the  third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection  Commission, shall be ordered to do so and face party and  government disciplinary action.    Those who take advantage of their positions to use public  funds and properties or who accumulate wealth through unfair  means by capitalizing on occasions such as their own marriages  or marriages and the funerals of their family members; through  job transfers, birthdays, and housewarmings must return the  public funds and properties they have used and pay compensation  for using them; money and materials received by taking advantage  of the aforementioned occasions should be turned over to the  state's coffers. In more serious cases, party and  administrative disciplinary punishment should be meted out.  Those who do not actively carry out checks and make  corrections, or who violated the provisions after the third  plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission  shall be ordered to return and pay compensation for the public  funds and properties they used or turn over the money and  materials they had collected by taking the advantage of the  aforementioned occasions to the state and receive party and  administrative disciplinary punishment.    7. Those who borrow public funds for personal profit-seeking  or illegal activities must immediately return the public funds  borrowed and pay interest on them for the corresponding period  at the rate set by the bank. The profits and illegal income  earned should be confiscated and turned over to the state's  coffers; party and administrative disciplinary punishment should  be meted out. Those who do not actively carry out checks and  make corrections, or who borrowed public funds for  profit-seeking or illegal activities after the third plenary  session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, should  be dealt with harshly.    Those who borrow public funds to buy or build private houses  for themselves or their relatives should, by the end of  September 1994, return the public funds and pay interest on them  for the corresponding period at the rate set by the bank. Those  who fail to do so by this date, or who have borrowed public  funds to buy or build private houses after the third plenary  session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, should  be ordered to return the borrowed public funds and be given  party and administrative disciplinary punishment.    Those who borrow public funds for other reasons should repay  all the arrears in public funds by the end of September 1994.  Those who fail to do so by this date and those who have  borrowed public funds for other reasons after the third plenary  session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and who  have not returned them in six months should be ordered to repay  them. In serious cases, party and administrative disciplinary  punishment should be meted out. For those who really have  difficult lives and cannot return on time the borrowed public  funds, an installment repayment plan should be worked out and a  moratorium can be granted after approval.    8. In the course of self-checking, problems that constitute  graft, bribery, embezzlement, and other mistakes should be dealt  with according to relevant stipulations; any violations of  criminal law should be transferred to the judicial organs for  handling.    9. All provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, organs  directly under the CPC Central Committee, and ministries and  commissions under the central state organs may draw up specific  rules for implementation in light of actual conditions and these  opinions on implementation and should report these to the  Central Discipline Inspection Commission for the record.    Localities and units which have conducted checks in light of  the rules set by provincial-level party and government organs  and which have dealt with the problems before the release of  these opinions on implementation may choose not to repeat checks  and the handling of relevant problems mentioned in the "five new  provisions."    10. The CPC Central Committee Discipline Inspection  Commission is responsible for the interpretation of these  opinions on their implementation.

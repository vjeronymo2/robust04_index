			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Bank of Belarus is not in favor of  introducing Russia's customs duties in relation to third  countries on the territory of the republic, because Russian  export and import rates do not take into account the  specifications of the Belarus economy. A correspondent from a  financial information agency has learned this from a source at  the Belarus Parliament.    According to the available information, a few days ago a  parliamentary commission for the economic reform received an  official reply from the National Bank of Belarus on its queery  about the bank's stance with regard to the treaty on the  unification of the monetary systems of Belarus and the Russian  Federation, signed by the prime ministers of the two countries  on 12 April in Moscow. The official reply makes it clear that  the National Bank is critical of the treaty and believes that  the gain from lifting customs duties is minimal in comparison  with the burden of maintaining Russian strategic forces deployed  on the territory of Belarus, which will fall on the Belarus  state budget.</p>

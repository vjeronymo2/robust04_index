			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Talks prompted Swan Hunter to lift its offer THE NAO report seeks to explain one of the most puzzling episodes in modern defence procurement history - how two shipyards, both UK-based, could come up with bids for the same vessel which were Pounds 71m apart. The report discloses that the MoD 'reminded' Swan Hunter early this year that it would consider giving it the helicopter carrier order if it were taken over by a more financially secure company, able to provide the required guarantee of due performance. At that time Swans was negotiating a takeover by GEC. Ironically, it was advice from GEC-Marconi, which Swans concurred with and the MoD assessed as realistic, which added Pounds 12.2m for increased overheads to Swans final bid. While VSEL's bid dropped, from Pounds 165m to Pounds 139.5m, Swan's rose from Pounds 174.5m to Pounds 210.6m. The report says that the MoD's evaluation of the two initial bids, implied lower overhead rates for both than would have been expected. Nevertheless the department concluded that 'the tendered prices could be considered to be realistic'. Neither bid was fully technically compliant at that stage. No 'bottom-line' comparison of the merits of the two bids was made. The department's main financial analysis of the reasonableness of the best and final offer bids was limited to a subjective review. Because of the compressed timescale it relied on a 'senior management brainstorm' to identify key risks. It concluded the lower VSEL bid represented an acceptable price. Swan Hunter's bid, MoD technical experts concluded in a detailed review after the contract award, was 'realistic but unaffordable'.</p>

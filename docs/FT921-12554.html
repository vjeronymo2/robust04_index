			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Arts: Sanderling's Mahler AFTER KURT Sanderling's Philharmonia concert on Tuesday, Richard Fairman wrote: 'To my mind, now that a generation of venerable maestros has gone, he is one of the great conductors of the day.' To mine, too - assuming that the predecessors are the likes of Horenstein and Knappertsbusch, rather than, say, Herbert von Karajan. Still, when Sanderling returned to the Festival Hall on Friday to conduct Mahler's Ninth Symphony I wasn't expecting quite what we got. Since Mahler went international, a kind of cosmopolitan consensus about how to play him has grown up among thoughtful conductors, at some remove from Mahler's Austrian roots. It leaves room for many variations, but key points and passages are recognised as needing to make certain kinds of effect. As a result, what we most often hear from leading orchestras are variations on a certain 'basic' reading. The last really satisfying account I heard of the Ninth, by the Japanese-American Kent Nagano and the London Symphony a couple of years ago, was a distillation of just that accepted modern wisdom. Sanderling brought us up against something much less suave, seemingly plain and innocent of theatrics. The music seemed to play itself, without any forcing or clever underlining. Towards the recapitulation in the first movement, I found that there were tears pouring down my face, which hasn't happened during a concert since Lili Kraus and Colin Davis played K. 466 for Bertrand Russell's birthday, thirty-something years ago. Not because it was Terribly Sad; but because every element in that marvellous passage arrived so easily and inevitably, adding its exact sense without a trace of conscious manipulation. Throughout that movement, the 'Andante comodo', Sanderling secured an illusion of absolute steadiness (in fact, the music demands many swings in tempo), and thus of unblinking cogency. The three alternating dances in the Landler movement weren't guyed, grotesque, lumpen or hysterical; they simply recalled the Biergarten and the Tanzhaus through a fractured lens, with affection and a sense of homely things irretrievably lost. The Rondo-Burleske, which everybody now aims to make as angry and sulphurous as possible, managed to be sour and perverse whilst remaining at home in the Biergarten. In the final Adagio there was no withers-wringing, though the full-throated paragraphs were sonorous; only the close was immensely drawn out, as Mahler prescribed - but simply, without ethereal prettiness, and thus profoundly moving. Without doubt the Philharmonia players had given their most devoted attention to Sanderling in rehearsals, for the many levels of their music were lucidly shaped and balanced, pungently coloured in ways that owed nothing to glossy symphonic theatre. Afterwards, when the conductor took his second bow they refused to stand up with him, and instead joined in the audience's heartfelt applause. Quite right: there aren't many Sanderlings about.</p>

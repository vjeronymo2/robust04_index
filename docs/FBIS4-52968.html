			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Won't America Let It Be?"] </F>   [Text] One week after Michael Fay received his caning  punishment and despite the helpful words of US Vice-President  Albert Gore about moving on from there, there is still too much  rancour in the Americans' management of the fallout, thus causng  one to ponder two questions. Are relations between the two  countries, with strategic and economic interests that override  everything else, worth dicing with for the sake of emotional  bombast over a court judgment? If the answer is no, why does  the US persist with petty acts that would call into question its  commitment not only to diplomatic relations with friendly  countries, but also the primacy of the written law? If the US  is the only superpower left, it needs to behave like one. It  would not want to look silly over a matter as routine as Fay's  punishment. The Singapore Government had been proper, in the  face of abuse and rabid talk from both the US media and the Fay  family, in asking that both sides "focus on their larger mutual  interests and put this incident behind them." And this from the  party sinned against: Fay had been dealt with by the book.  Singapore had nothing to be sorry for what had happened. It was  a straightforward court matter. We ask if the US is serious  about wanting to move on from here when, in the space of two  days, a high official in the administration goes on what looks  like a personal vendetta against Singapore, and the State  Department continues to equivocate about the truth of Fay's  injuries from caning.    Mr Mickey Kantor, the Trade Representative, was guilty of  gross indecency when he said that Singapore should be denied the  privilege of hosting the World Trade Organisation's [WTO's]  inaugural conference next year. The Fay link was transparent.  Mr Kantor was hijacking the decision-making prerogative of the  WTO's global membership, an indiscretion that should be  condemned. Member states decide who shall be the host.  Singapore may not get the vote, but it should not be because of  the Fay case. If the WTO can be dragged into a bilateral  squabble, just as the Olympic movement was debased over the  argument about China's human rights record, a new and dangerous  distortion would become the norm in the conduct of international  relations. America would not want to claim the patent rights to  that, surely. Mr Kantor's remark was irresponsible, never mind  the crassness for which he is sometimes known. After the State  Department had said he was expressing a personal view as the  government had no opinion on who shall be host has America ever  cared about such things?, Mr Kantor was unrepentant. Singapore,  no -- he repeated. Question: If a loose cannon is allowed to  contradict policy, how much damage could be done? President  Bill Clinton, a personal friend of Mr Kantor's, needs to be  fastidious about cabinet house-keeping.    As for the dispute over how badly Fay had been hurt in the  caning, the pertinent issue is truthfulness as it affects  relations. The extent of Fay's injuries is irrelevant. Caning  will invariably leave marks and it would sometimes draw blood.  The Prisons Department should not have had to explain how mild  the injuries had been and how well Fay had taken the caning. To  the government's objections that the description of boy's  condition -- as given by his father and lawyer in America based  on an account given a US Embassy official here -- was  exaggerated, the State Department has been waffling. If it does  not believe the Prisons Department's account, it should say  outright that the Singapore Government is lying. The government  will no doubt respond appropriately. We have no cause to doubt  the accuracy of the official account. If the U.S. accepts it as  accurate, it owes Singapore an obligation to be forthright. In  the process, end the spectacle of the government of the world's  strongest nation being manipulated by an overwrought family. It  was amusing, now it gets tiresome.</p>

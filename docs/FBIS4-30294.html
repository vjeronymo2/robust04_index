			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 27 (KCNA) -- The joint measure  committee for the improvement of railway and subway working  conditions held a rally of workers and citizens for denouncing  the suppression of the National Council of Subway Workers Unions  (Chonjihyop) in Seoul on June 25 with the attendance of more  than 1,000 workers, dissident figures and students, according to  a radio report from Seoul.    The participants in a resolution held that the invocation of  "government" power by the authorities was a clear violation of  the "actual law" and demanded six points including the  resignation of the "home minister" who had illegally set police  in-motion, the release of the detained workers, scrapping of the  want list and the revision of the evil labour law.    A co-representative of the National Council of Trade Union  Representatives (Chonnodae), Kwon Yong-kil, declared at the  rally that in case the authorities failed to accept the demand  of the workers, they would answer with an allout struggle  including a solidarity strike on June 27.    After the rally, the participants took part in the function  of "June 25 grand torch procession for national reconciliation  and peace" sponsored by the preparatory committee for the  formation of the South side headquarters of the National  Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminnyon), and  marched to subway stations in the city and distributed copies of  a literature to citizens.    In a separate action, the National Locomotive Council  (Chongihyop) which entered the second day of a sit-in in Seoul  held a press conference on June 24 and declared that the engine  drivers affiliated with it would never go back to work, if their  demand for the release of the detainees, apology for the  invocation of "government" power and the withdrawal of police  force was not met.</p>

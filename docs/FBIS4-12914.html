			<p>BFN     [Text] Settlers in the Ma'ale Efrayim local council  decided, as of today, to begin conducting car patrols and  lookout posts on vehicles and people traveling on the road from  Ma'ale Efrayim to the Tapuah junction. Council head Hayim Aviv  informed the commander of the Central Command and the commander  of the Judaea and Samaria Division that the decision was made in  the wake of an increase in hostile activities against Israelis  on this road. According to Aviv, the settlers are not getting  appropriate protection from the Israeli Defense Forces. This is  reported by our settlement affairs correspondent Gil Litman.</p>

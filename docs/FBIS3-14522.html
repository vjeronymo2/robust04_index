Guards shot and wounded several protesters who smashed and  set fire to public buildings on March 17 in Bani Walid, about  150 kilometers (90 miles) southeast of Tripoli, Muhammad Fayiz  Jibril told AFP.    Protests erupted after Libyan television broadcast "false  confessions extracted under torture from army officers"  implicated in last October's rebellion in Bani Walid, said  Jibril, Cairo representative for the Libyan National Salvation  Front.    "Members of the Libyan regime called for the execution of  these officers, who admitted under torture to being agents of  the United States. Bani Walid residents were outraged over the  call for executions and the use of torture," he said.    "The residents then smashed and set fire to the offices of  the revolutionary and information committees" set up by  al-Qadhdhafi, he said.    "Agents of the revolutionary committees holed up in the  offices opened fire on the demonstrators, wounding several of  them," he added.    Jibril asked Arab League Secretary General 'Ismat  'Abd-al-Majid and Arab foreign ministers meeting in the Egyptian  capital to intervene to prevent al-Qadhdhafi from "executing the  55 officers."</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Igor Baranovsky: "A Russian Bath for Dirty </F> Rubles"; quotation marks as published]    [Text] Laundering dirty money has traditionally been one of  the most "intellectual" and highly paid trades in the West's  underworld. The masters of financial intrigues have to turn  themselves inside out, inventing intricate operations to pass  dirty dollars, lire or yen through innumerable banking filters  and get a 100-percent clean product. In our country, however,  there is no need to make any great effort to achieve this -- the  circulation of criminal money has been almost legalized and,  were it not for several nuances, it would be absolutely  pointless to discuss the techniques of laundering dirty capital  in Russia.  <H5>  Fearless billions </H5>   The sources from which dirty money originate are the same  throughout the world -- narcobusiness, illegal trade in arms and  antiques, and prostitution. In the opinion of experts, in  present-day Russia, in contrast to the West, there is no need to  clean the money gained from these operations -- without any  treatment it can be safely used in legal turnover. There are  hundreds of variants: transferring money from one bank account  to another, lending or loaning, purchasing realty, investing in  a business. In none of these cases is the mafia, as are  individual law-unabiding citizens, threatened with an unpleasant  question from a financial inspector -- "where's the money from?"    During the past year not a single person in Moscow has been  condemned for concealing incomes or for evading the submission  of a declaration on money receipts, although it is perfectly  well known to everyone that fantastic sums are not taxed in  Russia today. Last year Moscow's taxation police checked a mere  236 of the tens of thousands of commercial and state  organizations. It also checked 423 individuals. This kind of  "activity" means just one thing -- no serious control over the  movement of money has been established in Russia. This means, at  least, that no one is interested in the origin of capital in our  country. But does it also mean that there are no problems with  laundering money?    "Russian criminals still have to `rub' their money," says  Mikhail Zotov, section head at the Investigation Department of  Moscow's Main Directorate of Internal Affairs. "This is true  only in cases when money is earned through large-scale crimes  which, incidentally, seldom occur in the West. The real issue is  `air money' -- the billions and trillions that are removed from  bank accounts on forged documents."    Indeed, criminals have to invent new miraculous ways to  convert this money into cash and to cover their tracks.  <H5>  Playing hide-and-seek </H5>   Domestic mafiosi got their first serious experience in  laundering money when they used false letters of advice in  1992-1993. To this day this episode has remained the biggest  "emergency" in the entire history of the existence of Russia's  financial and credit system. Upwards of 1.5 trillion (!) rubles  were stolen from the state with forged documents. Public money  was involved and therefore definite efforts were required to  take the stolen money away from under the nose of  law-enforcement bodies and then to clean it. The criminals  succeeded with flying colors.    "The scheme of laundering stolen money is always typical,"  says Mikhail Zotov. "Some commercial structure sets up a  peculiar buffer zone for itself -- a group of fictitious firms  allegedly having no relation to it, although in fact they are  its subsidiaries. Moreover, they may be scattered all over the  country. Then, of course, the commercial structure opens  accounts for all of them at different banks. Now it is already  possible to manage serious illegal operations.    "For instance, the mother firm concludes a fake contract  with  its own dummy structure in a different city, say, for the  delivery of farm produce. Immediately it puts through the  banking network a false letter of advice -- the non-existent  payment for the specific commodity. By way of multistage  machinations the real money is entered on the head  organization's account. That is all -- dirty money has been  received. Now comes the laundering: the mother firm  instantaneously transfers the money stolen from the state to the  bank account of yet another one of its fictitious subsidiary  organizations, again with a fake contract -- allegedly for the  purchase of specific products. On the face of it everything is  in accordance with the law. Over there, the received rubles are  turned into cash and laundered, whereupon the false firm is  liquidated and the stolen money disappears without a trace. In  fact, now the fraudulently earned capital is fully controlled by  the organizers of the multistage swindle. This is all -- the  circle has been closed. Where the stolen billions will surface  is another matter. In any case, nobody will ask where the money  came from -- it is quite suitable for legal financial-economic  operations. "It is practically impossible for law-enforcement  bodies to find the culprits.    But though the financial and credit system is a common area  where criminals launder money, it is not the only way, of course.  <H5>  Medellin cartel respects Russia </H5>   The casino is perhaps one of the most traditional  "laundries"  for washing dirty capital in the West. Without any doubt,  domestic gambling institutions are also used for these purposes.  All the more so since according to the militia's summaries, more  than half of them (and there are about a hundred of them in  Moscow) are controlled by criminal structures. The system of  laundering is simple: dirty money is passed through the casino  as winnings. And since our New Russians are hot-tempered,  reckless and, moreover, rich people -- it is possible to declare  daily very large sums on financial reports. And there is one  more interesting peculiarity: gambling houses have a lot of  foreign capital. This makes it possible for criminals to clean  their pounds, dollars and marks, which then safely return home  as the large sum snatched in an "honest" game with the Russians.    In general, laundering money through transnational mafia  syndicates is prevalent on the Russian market. One need not have  a rich imagination to presume that not one billion of "narco  dollars" are hidden in Russia's troubled waters. But, strange as  it may be, neither the Federal Counterintelligence Service nor  the Interior Ministry has specific data on these operations.    The international mafia can launder money in different ways  in our country. For instance, through its Russian colleagues or  its own legalized structure it may invest its unclean money in  the purchase of timber, oil and metals. Then the commodity is  shipped to the West (generally through our near abroad) where it  is sold and clean dollars appear on someone's account in a Swiss  bank. It is very difficult to find faults with these savings --  the money seems to have been earned as a result of an honest  commercial deal.    One more variant of laundering is the investment of money  through dummy firms in Russia in lucrative financial and  industrial projects. And, of course, the acquisition of real  estate, land, enterprises and banks. The range of maneuver is  great and, moreover, I repeat, nobody in Russia takes any  interest in the origin of capital. So it will hardly be a  surprise when with time the shadows of Camorra, Yakuza or the  Medellin cartel become apparent behind many of our industrial  and financial giants.  <H5>  Offices for exchange of criminal experience </H5>   And lastly, active use is being made in today's Russia of  the  numerous currency exchange offices for laundering operations  with cash in rubles and foreign exchange. Already the fact that  not a single exchange office, not even the Central Bank, knows  even their approximate number makes one wonder. Although,  according to strict instructions, every authorized bank must  present exhaustive information on all its exchange offices to  the territorial departments of the Central Bank.    "Of course, almost nobody does that -- it is not profitable:  there will be check-ups, inspections and reports," says Alexei  Belov, deputy head of the 4th section of the Moscow Criminal  Investigation Department. "Therefore we decided to take a look  ourselves: how many exchange offices are there in Moscow? In the  course of our operation we checked about 1,000 such centers. In  fact, I believe, there are many more in the capital -- at least  2,000-2,500. The Social Development Bank alone had about 400  exchange offices until recently."    The results of our investigation were stunning. No more than  a dozen exchange offices in Moscow worked without violating  instructions and legislation. In 61 banks there were no orders  in opening exchange offices, practically none of the offices  filled out Form No. 377 which requires that they record all  exchange operations. A record number of violations was  registered at the centers of the All-Russia Exchange Bank,  Kristall Bank and First Investment Bank.    "It is evidently not worth explaining in detail why this  happens," Belov goes on. "Going around in those banks is a vast  quantity of uncounted cash, quite often of absolutely unknown  origin. Rarely is it possible to understand where the office got  the dollars which it sells for rubles or the rubles with which  it buys dollars -- there are no accounts whatsoever. That is,  any money you like -- whether stolen from the state, amassed  through rackets or received on a fictitious payment -- may be  and is put into circulation.  <H5>  Fifth column </H5>   Needless to say, it is not thanks to phenomenal intellect  that our local mafiosi and their foreign colleagues have scored  such impressive results in laundering money. At every stage of  implementing their criminal plants they have been actively  assisted by the multimillion army of Russian officials, perhaps  the most resourceful in the world.    Take the false letters of advice. According to most of the  Interior Ministry's experts, the banks through which fictitious  papers passed have, to one extent or another, taken part in this  swindle. Of course, this statement seems too categorical but, on  the other hand, it is not so groundless. For example, the  investigation has shown that the Soyuzprombank made its own  letters of advice. A criminal case has been brought up on this  fact. Or one more case: in 1992 four false letters of advice to  the sum of 2.2 billion rubles were received at the address of a  client of the Moscow subsidiary of the Severny Bank run by the  Zhilremontstroi firm from the small enterprise Svim in Grozny.  The bank did not demand a contract with Svim, but remitted this  money in small batches to the accounts of over 20 commercial  enterprises indicated by the client. Whereupon the director of  Zhilremontstroi vanished without a trace, whereas no Svim could  be found in Chechnya, of course. However, in the course of a  subsequent investigation eight million rubles of the stolen sum  were found on the account of the Sirius firm, on whose payroll  was Alan Gabisov, the chief accountant of the Moscow subsidiary  of the Severny Bank. Another 1.5 million was found on the  account of the Alan enterprise, one of whose founders was  Gabisov's father, and another 31 million -- in the firm of the  chief accountant's childhood friend.    There have been at least dozens of such scandals.    There is one more problem conducive to the success of  swindlers -- the absence of a normal data bank on likely  business partners: commercial banks, firms and natural persons.  Moreover, no track is kept in Russia of stolen and lost  passports, and registration chambers, even in Moscow, have not  yet been computerized. Hence the thousands of fictitious firms  which exist solely on paper and through which the underworld  launders its money. It is more than easy to start such a fake  enterprise. You find, steal or buy a passport from some hobo,  glue your photo on it and off you go to the registration  chamber. You get registered there and immediately go to the bank  to open an account. That's all: yet another fake office is born.    In short, conditions are very good for thieves in our  country, one might even say extremely favorable, to such an  extent that seditious thoughts occur form time to time -- for  example, legislators are preoccupied solely with checking their  projects with swindlers: so as not to harm them or not to cross  their path. And until journalists get rid of these strange  perceptions, they will for a long time continue lacking  materials on financial-economic swindles and on the mafia's  laundering operations.    MN [MOSCOW NEWS] file    Last year 110,000 economic crimes, 4,300 of them in the  financial and credit system, were committed in Russia. According  to the Central Bank's data, false payments are brought to light  every quarter to the tune of 120 billion rubles. Exposed during  this round were 429 criminal groups specializing in business and  banking operations. The law-enforcement bodies averted the theft  of sums which totalled two trillion rubles.    According to reports by French special services, in the  first seven months of 1993 alone the commercial structures of  the CIS countries and the Baltics earned 1,045 billion francs on  the re-export of Russian raw materials to France -- 96 percent  of these deliveries passed through Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania  and Georgia. Of course, some of the illegally exported raw  materials were intercepted -- 97.8 tons of oil products, 17.8  tons of different grades of metal -- but that is nothing in  comparison to the whole volume of materials.    According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, as many  as 1,500 officials violated the Russian president's decree on  the fight against corruption in 1993. Of this number, 25.8  percent were staff members of law-enforcement bodies, 42.7  percent -- of ministries, different committees and their  structures at grassroots level, 11.3 percent -- workers of the  financial and credit system, 2.5 percent -- employees of the  Customs Committee. Over the same period of time 4,500 persons  were found to be taking bribes.</p>

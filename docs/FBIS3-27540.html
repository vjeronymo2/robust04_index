			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Russian President  Boris Yeltsin expressed his determination on Thursday to  continue economic reforms and said backtracking would mean a  catastrophe.    In his first-ever state of the nation message addressed to  the parliament, Yeltsin urged Russian lawmakers to lay a "legal  foundation for Russian entrepreneurship."    Among most vital tasks for 1994, the president listed the  creation of a modern settlement system, a deep reform of the  central bank in order to create a federal reserve system.    Yeltsin said he will himself control the reform of the  central bank as it is of a key importance to economic reforms in  the country.    According to the president, 1994 should become a year of  creating financial and industrial groups. He said it is  necessary that they emerge on a voluntary basis and do not  reanimate the old government ministries.    The current year should also see major changes in state  support to agriculture, Yeltsin said, urging to carry out a real  reform in the agro-industrial complex rather than provide  unlimited subsidies to it.</p>

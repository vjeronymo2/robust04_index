			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Zurich buys much of Municipal Mutual MUNICIPAL Mutual Insurance, the local authority-owned insurer which withdrew from the market last year, yesterday concluded negotiations to sell substantial parts of its business to Zurich Insurance, one of Europe's largest insurance companies. The deal was predicted to go ahead after Zurich offered renewals to all existing local council policyholders under an interim agreement with MMI in October. As expected the Swiss group will not assume responsibility for liabilities arising on policies which were underwritten by MMI before September 30. Zurich said yesterday that it expected the EC competition authorities in Brussels to approve the deal. Zurich will employ 1,500 MMI staff and also provide claims servicing facilities to MMI. Zurich, which will call its new subsidiary Zurich Municipal, has purchased the Bournemouth office building of MMI and taken leases on remaining operational locations. Welcoming the deal Mr Brian Wright, MMI chief executive, said: 'The deal achieves a major part of our plans for the sale or solvent run-off of the business.' MMI withdrew from the market last May but management, lead by Mr Wright, were initially unsuccessful in finding a buyer. A number of UK companies examined the business. In October a deal involving the French group, Garantie des Foncionnaires Mutuelles, fell through.</p>

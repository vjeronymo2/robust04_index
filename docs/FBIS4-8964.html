			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Laszlo Urban, leader of the economic cabinet </F> of the Federation of Young Democrats, Fidesz, by Gabor Ferencz;  place and date not given: "The Fidesz Would Make a Wage  Agreement -- According to Urban, Consumption Could Grow From  1997"]    [Text] The Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] is  asking for three years before the improvement of the economic  situation also becomes apparent for the population after the  half-turn is made. Laszlo Urban also told our correspondent  that a general agreement between the employees, employers, and  the government which, above a 10 percent guaranteed level, would  link wage increases to improved productivity, would be a key  element of implementing their program. If it came to  government, the Fidesz would radically reorganize the economic  institutions, it would establish an economic top ministry and  budget ministry, and it would strengthen the economic diplomacy  activities of the Foreign Ministry.    [Ferencz] The Fidesz is the only party that can express its  economic program in a slogan: half-turn. However, this short  slogan can be interpreted many ways. What does it actually mean?    [Urban] It means a change of priorities in the budget  policy. Economic growth would be the goal, but this cannot be  reached through artificially suppressing the interest rates --  unsuccessful attempts at this have been made in recent years --  or through restriction, namely reducing the expenditure. In our  view, the budget policy has to be focused on investment  incentives. The deficit of the current budget cannot grow but,  when the budget is planned, funds have to be created for tax  allowances and measures taken to stimulate investments. This is  a half-turn compared to the current practice, because the  government's running expenses have increased in past years and,  due to the increased budget deficit, it is precisely the  investment expenditures that have been cut back.    [Ferencz] However, to make this policy successful,  insensitivity to social problems has to be accepted!    [Urban] No, it does not! Insensitivity to social problems  would arise if someone wanted to drastically reduce the budget  expenditure, including welfare spending. However, this is  suggested by parties other than the Fidesz -- at least, on the  level of campaign slogans. In our view, society would not  accept the reduction of welfare expenditure.    [Ferencz] On the other hand, the Fidesz's experts talk about  the need for voluntary wage limitation by the employees as a  necessary means to curbing inflation.    [Urban] The resources for the temporary overspending that is  to stimulate the investments has to be found in the budget. In  our view, this can be solved through reducing the interest on  the already accumulated debts. This is a huge burden because  interest payments are already now reaching 20 percent of the  total expenditure and this might increase to 25 percent next  year. This item can only be reduced if inflation is noticeably  reduced. A 5-percent reduction of inflation can decrease the  interest payments by 30 to 40 billion forints. This is more  than what a committed government, with a strong political  support -- I do not actually see any chance for this -- could  save through reducing the budget expenditure. However, to  reduce inflation, we will need a tripartite agreement (between  the state, the employees, and the employers) which will cool  down the inflation expectations. It has to be achieved that  wage increases should basically be linked to increased  productivity.    [Ferencz] Can this be regulated through a central pact in a  market economy?    [Urban] A central pact can provide a positive background for  the bargaining at company level although, naturally, cannot  replace it. As early as the end of 1993, some of the employers  attempted to set the automatic wage increases at the lowest  possible level, and to establish a connection between wage  increases and the increase of productivity. However, on a  national level, it was precisely the government's representative  who first called this untenable. A central agreement can force  the representatives of employers and employees at every company  to face the question: Do they consider it more important to  preserve the workplaces even at the cost of lower wages or will  they accept the dismissals and fight for a higher wage for the  people who stay? The government cannot decide this but it can  establish favorable conditions for the bargaining. The view of  the trade unions obviously is that more burdens cannot be placed  on the employees, therefore, wage increases at least have to  counterbalance inflation. However, in a stagnating economy,  this would actually contribute to maintaining inflation.    [Ferencz] Therefore, the Fidesz's experts attribute a  decisive importance to inflation expectations in the actual  increase of prices. However, the experience of the past few  years seems to contradict this: Between 1990 and 1993, the  inflation expectations -- and even the inflation forecasts -- at  the beginning of the year always exceeded the level measured at  the end of the year.    [Urban] The analyses prove that at least half of the  inflation is wage inflation. The speed of price increases  stopped receding in the past year, and I attribute the reduction  in the former years to the dampening effect of the recession and  to a consequence of the exchange policy that was revaluing in  real terms. However, the latter was double-edged because it  placed the costs of curbing inflation on the exporting companies  and this backfired in 1993. If we want to face the fact that  there is an over-distribution in the Hungarian economy compared  to the level that would be supported by our productivity then we  either cut the budget expenditure drastically -- but this does  not have the necessary political support -- or we have to make  self-restricting wage agreements. Private companies are inclined  to do this anyway, and the managers of state-owned enterprises  could be encouraged in contracts made with them to implement  this central agreement.    [Ferencz] How well developed is the Fidesz's program on  changing the economic policy institutional system?    [Urban] The economic policy mistakes of the past four years  can largely be attributed to the lack of a chief economic  strategist in the government, and the rivalries between the  various economic-type ministries. It is completely ridiculous  for a minister who is responsible for the economy to have the  same number of votes on economic policy issues in the government  as ministers who have nothing to do with the economy: This  makes it impossible to make strategic decisions. According to  our concept, an economic top ministry should be set up based on  the economic policy experts from the Finance Ministry, the  Industry and Trade Ministry, the Ministry of International  Economic Relations, and other ministries, while the economic  diplomacy activities of the Foreign Ministry should be  strengthened. At the same time, based on the Finance Ministry's  staff, a ministry dealing with budget issues could be  established, thus ending the situation where strategic decisions  are also determined by daily fiscal considerations.    [Ferencz] How long would it take for the results of the  Fidesz's economic policy to manifest themselves?    [Urban] The already mentioned tripartite agreement would  establish the opportunity for a breakthrough. If we managed to  complete this by the autumn of 1994, it would be possible to  anticipate lower inflation and increasing investment activity  when planning the 1995 budget. Economic growth could begin,  however, based on this, the reform of state administration would  first have to be implemented in 1996, it could be decided what  kind of expenditure can be removed from the state treasury. In  the following year, in 1997, the expansion of consumption would  also be noticeable to the people.</p>

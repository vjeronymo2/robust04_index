			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov by Stojan </F> Obradovic (Stina); place and date not given: "National  Exclusivity Leads to Ghettoization"]    [Text] Although Macedonia has not yet solved many problems  regarding its international status -- though it also has many  domestic tensions -- and the shadow of the possible war is still  hanging over this area, it seems that Macedonian President Kiro  Gligorov should not lose any sleep over whether he will win the  next elections. Public opinion polls show that he is supported  by approximately 90 percent of the electoral body. What is even  more interesting is that, regardless of the fact that the  Macedonian political scene is extremely turbulent and divided,  Gligorov not only gets support from "his own," but is also  strongly supported by the Albanian population and the voters of  the nationalist Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization  Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity [VMRO-DPMNE],  whose party is usually very critical of many of his moves and  even accuses him of "national treason" for allegedly flirting  with the idea of changing the name of the country, the flag, and  so forth. However, it seems that ordinary people appreciate  Gligorov's experienced -- perhaps even cunning or wise, if you  like -- but extremely efficient way of solving problem after  problem, many of which are labeled "to be or not to be," in the  stirred-up situation in Macedonia and its neighborhood. Many  say the fact that he built his authority on the other side of  the famous Balkan populist leadership, having imposed some other  qualities, did a world of good for Gligorov. One of those  qualities -- bearing those who criticize him no hard feelings,  as he probably considers it part of his job -- came to the  surface when we were setting up this interview. We met him at  the celebration of the most influential Macedonian weekly PULS,  also famous for its ruthless depiction of the dark side of the  Macedonian political scene, the weekly that often has no mercy  for Gligorov himself. Asked why he attended the celebration of a  newspaper that often criticizes and attacks him, he replied  that, as we all know, the authorities are not immaculate, and  the job of the media, among other things, is to remind the  authorities of that. At the beginning of the interview, we  "reminded" President Gligorov of the burning Macedonian problem  --relations with Greece.  <H5>  Talks, Not Skirmish, With Greece </H5>   [Obradovic] At the recently held session of the Greek  Parliament, Papandreu has again said they would not recognize  Macedonia under its name. Naturally and most importantly,  European powers recognized Macedonia, but solving the problem of  relations with Greece is important for stability of this region  and for Greek- Macedonian relations. What do you think will be  the final solution?    [Gligorov] I think the most natural way would be to continue  the talks we began under the auspices of the United Nations and  Mr. Vance. We managed to make a few steps forward in those  negotiations, but then they were interrupted by Greece for  understandable reasons -- they went to the elections, which are  now over. Now they have a new government and we must continue  to negotiate. That is the only possible way. Everything else  -- skirmishing, stipulating terms for the beginning of the  negotiations -- should not be happening between two members of  the United Nations, and would ultimately produce no results.  Things will get better eventually.  <H5>  Differentiation Among the Macedonian Albanians </H5>   [Obradovic] Albanian-Macedonian relations are evidently one  of the most important internal problems of Macedonia. Those  relations are burdened by many problems and things got worse  after it was discovered that the Albanians had weapons. Is it  possible control over those relations could be lost and that  this would escalate into a conflict?    [Gligorov] I do not expect that. What is happening in  Albanian parties is something normal in a law-ordered,  democratic country -- people are gradually being divided  according to their views on some problems.    The worst possible thing is when a nation, any nation, is  homogenized around certain demands, especially if they become  extremely nationalistic. That would lead to separation, not to  mention the ghettoization of certain parts of the population.  Some Albanians are undergoing a kind of political  differentiation. Basically, I appreciate that, for it is  actually a democratic process. It is another matter that third  parties are becoming involved in the internal discussions in  some Albanian parties. That is impermissible and bad, for that  means interfering in our domestic problems.    Otherwise, I view this process of differentiation as a will  of a huge majority of people who want their Macedonia to become  a state, i.e. of those people who consider it their homeland.  On the other side, there are extremists who still dream of  greater Albania.    [Obradovic] You mentioned interference of a third side. I  suppose you meant Albania. Do you intend to start negotiating  with them and ask them not to do that?    [Gligorov] We talk to them and I think it would be normal to  continue doing that, as well as to establish internationally  recognized norms of behavior that will strengthen and develop  our cooperation. We had a good cooperation for a while, and we  must overcome these events.  <H5>  Toward "Partnership for Peace" </H5>   [Obradovic] Macedonia has welcomed President Clinton's  initiative regarding the restructuring of NATO and the  "Partnership for Peace" project. Are there any chances for  Macedonia to become involved in that project?    [Gligorov] We have already applied to participate in  "Partnership for Peace" and, in my opinion, the only hindrance  is that we are still not a member of the CSCE [Conference for  Security and Cooperation in Europe] because Greece objects to  that. If we manage to overcome that, all members of the CSCE  have, in principle, the right and the possibility to participate  in that association. I think that Macedonia satisfies all  conditions for becoming a member of "Partnership for Peace"  association in every way.    [Obradovic] Do you think one will be able to break the  resistance of Greece soon? What condition have they set?    [Gligorov] I cannot predict when, but I think it cannot be  postponed simply because Greece is practically the only country  that opposes our becoming a member of the CSCE. Therefore, on  one hand, we will try to continue negotiating with Greece and,  on the other, we will try to realize that goal within the CSCE.  <H5>  Life Wants an Agreement </H5>   [Obradovic] Macedonia is, naturally, still not involved in  the war, but it cannot ignore the events on the territory of  former Yugoslavia. Can you comment on the latest agreement  between Tudjman and Milosevic?    [Gligorov] As a country that, first of all, strives toward  peace, negotiations, tolerance, solving the global situation in  the Balkans, and finding points of contact for future  cooperation, we welcome every step in realizing those goals. It  is difficult for me to comment on what lies behind this  agreement and what could be its consequences.    Some say it has something to do with the agreement made in  Karadjordjevo, others that it is an interim agreement made in  order to force the Muslims to sign the peace agreement under  conditions arranged between the two sides. However, one must  also consider huge interests in the normalization of relations  between the two countries; the main traffic route was  interrupted, and so were the oil pipeline and telephone  communications, but one must go on living, one must find some  points of contact to start taking practical steps in order to  overcome the atmosphere of war. I think the agreement is a wide  and complex matter and that it must be considered from different  aspects.    [Obradovic] Some say that Macedonia is yet to face certain  problems regarding the fact that it must start restructuring its  economy, and that social tensions will probably increase, and  that it must realize an economic program that requires some  sacrifice, etc. Can that further complicate the domestic  situation in Macedonia?    [Gligorov] In the present situation, when there are  sanctions imposed on Serbia and Montenegro, our road toward  Europe in the north is getting narrower and narrower.  Furthermore, considering the open problem with Greece,  introducing daring reforms, market institutions, and making an  agreement with the IMF and the World Bank for a stabilization  program is a very brave and a risky undertaking. But, on the  other hand, I think delaying it would complicate the situation.   <H5>    A Tough Nut To Crack </H5>   [Gligorov] As other examples show, delaying reforms, deeper  but inevitable changes, cannot buy time. There is just a  temporary illusion that the situation is under control, but the  right thing to do is to crack a tough nut, and it will be a very  tough one indeed. In my opinion, there is no other way. I hope  that the people of Macedonia -- considering what we went  through, that we managed to maintain peace and tranquillity --  will understand this is a step we must make so that, when the  war ends, in the process of normalization, we could use this  advantage, the fact that we were not involved in the war, to  develop and arrange relations with other Eastern-European  countries and with our neighbors. That must be an additional  stimulus for us to succeed in this undertaking.  <H5>  Favoring the Moderate Option </H5>   [Obradovic] New elections are supposed to be organized in  Macedonia this fall. Do you expect some extreme options,  whether Macedonian or Albanian, to get stronger at those  elections, which could lead to straining political relations and  the situation in Macedonia?    [Gligorov] This is a regular election year in Macedonia and  the elections may be a burden to some extent. Passions are  always intensified in the election year, demands are maximized,  people do things that trigger emotional reactions, conflicts.  We must count on all that. However, I think the experience we  gathered in the past two or three years, as well as global  events in these parts have taught us we should look for peaceful  solutions for our future. The people saw that the politics of  extreme options does not lead anywhere. And the fact that  extreme nationalism did not win here helped us to stay out of  the war; otherwise, we would also be in the maelstrom of war.  Naturally, I think it is not impossible that passion will be  stirred up again, but in view of what I have just said, I think  people are now aware of certain things and that they will favor  the moderate option.  <H5>  [Box, p 6] </H5> <H5>  U.S. "Blue Helmets" -- a Warning </H5>   [Obradovic] The forces of the United Nations are here in  Macedonia. Is that a certain guarantee that there will be peace  in Macedonia and what do you think about their role?    [Gligorov] That is a relatively small contingent. As a  military force, it does not bring any significant changes in  relations in these parts. However, their presence is of  enormous political and psychological significance. In the  political sense, it demonstrates the interest of the  international community in the situation in Macedonia. I think  the international community has, on time, realized the  geostrategic importance of Macedonia for the global stability of  this part of the Balkans in particular, as a pivotal area for  which, as you know, there have been many battles and wars in  history. Therefore, the mission of peace-keeping forces has a  dual role. One is to prevent -- therefore, those forces do not  act after a conflict happens, they do not separate warring  factions, but analyze the situation in order to predict possible  conflicts and thus prevent them. In that sense, Macedonia is a  very good example. The other role is that the presence of UN  forces, especially of the contingent of U.S. soldiers, presents  a kind of warning, a message to all who have a vested interest  in Macedonia that, in case of conflicts or some events that  would further complicate the situation with regard to the war  raging in the north, it will simply not be accepted.  <H5>  [Box, p 7] </H5> <H5>  Overcome Extreme Demands </H5>   [Obradovic] Do you think that the rights of the Albanian  minority in Macedonia have been protected in the right way or  should some significant changes occur with regard to that?    [Gligorov] Regarding the constitutional position of all  minorities in Macedonia, I think their rights were rightfully  established and protected. Many missions of the CSCE and other  institutions came here to assess constitutional solutions.  Among others, the well-known Badinter's Commission made up of  Europe's top lawyers and presidents of constitutional courts,  has also confirmed that those rights were protected. Much is  yet to be accomplished in practice on both sides -- on one side,  to transform that into everyday decisions that will in turn  enable us to reduce tensions and, on the other, to eliminate  some extreme demands that have not been fulfilled in any  European country and that could only lead to increasing  tensions. I think those demands are, first of all, a reflection  of what is going on in republics of former Yugoslavia, i.e. in  the Balkans, with regard to extremist nationalism and extreme  demands that go far beyond what we are supposed to grant --  first of all, to strive toward building a civic state, then  toward the European option, and then toward alleviating, opening  up borders and barriers and thus enable free passage of people,  creating new jobs, letting people decide where and how to live,  in contrast to present desires of each of those countries to  realize their own exclusively historic, national and some other  pretensions, which can lead to escalation of those conflicts.</p>

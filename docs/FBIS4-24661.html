			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Pei Jianfeng: "Steel Prices Decline Due to Oversupply"] </F>   [Text] Rolled steel prices have dropped on the Chinese  market due to overproduction and a tight bank credit policy.    Since April, prices of most steel products declined by 1.5  to  4.1 percentage points around the country. It was the first time  this year that steel prices fell.    The main reason for the price slide was that supply had  already surpassed demand, said officials from the Ministry of  Metallurgical Industry.    China's output of rolled steel reached 27 .6 million tons  during the first four months of this year. That was up 9.81 per  cent over the same period last year.    At the same time, imports of rolled steel amounted to 6.21  million tons, an increase of 5 per cent over last year.    As a result, stockpiles swelled around the country. By the  end of April, the stockpile of domestic steel had jumped 26.73  per cent from the beginning of the year.    Officials said that the shortage of money under the central  bank's tight credit policy to control investment and bring down  rising inflation also contributed to slack domestic demand for  steel products.    Many manufacturing and trading companies do not have enough  money to buy steel products and other raw materials.    The government's investment control in fixed assets has  curbed the demand for steel products, according to officials.    Steel prices rose sharply beginning early last year with the  country's investment and construction boom. Imports, mainly  from Japan, South Korea and Europe were large because Chinese  manufacturers could not meet demand. China produced 76 million  tons of rolled steel in 1993.    Prices started to drop after the central bank adopted a  tight  credit policy and limited real estate development last July.    Also, imports became more expensive with the devaluation of  renminbi from 5.8 yuan to one U.S. dollar to the current 8.7.  Despite that, imports are still large at the moment. Starting  from this year, the import licence for steel products was lifted.    In December last year Chinese companies imported 4 million  tons of rolled steel, which greatly expanded the country's  stockpile.    Since this year, the government cancelled the import  licenses  for steel products. Domestic companies can now import steel  through various channels.    However, due to lack of co-ordination and management, many  companies still import those steel products that are already  hard to sell on the domestic market, officials said.    To stem speculation on the domestic market, the government  decided to stop futures trading in steel products in early April.</p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHIEF DEFENDS CHICO OFFICERS IN QUELLING RIOT  </P> <P> Four people have filed complaints that police used excessive force to quell a  drunken rampage by 1,000 beer-swilling youths last weekend, Police Chief John  Bullerjahn said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Bullerjahn said police will investigate the complaints, but declined to discuss  details of the incidents.  </P> <P> He blamed the riot squarely on the 94 people arrested during the two-day clash  that marred the city's annual spring celebration, Rancho Chico Days.  </P> <P> "The only people to blame for this are those who were arrested," Bullerjahn  told reporters at a news conference. "I think the community ought to be proud  of the way the incident was handled.  </P> <P> There were 38 police officers injured in the melee, most by rocks and bottles  as they tried to disperse the crowd. One officer suffered a broken leg.  </P> <P> Butte County Dist. Atty. Mike Ramsey said he had seen no evidence of police  brutality, but would "certainly look at that issue, just like we would at any  other."  </P></p>

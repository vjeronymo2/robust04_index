Saro-Wiwa is president of the Movement for the Survival of  Ogoni People (MOSOP), a minority rights pressure group  representing about 500,000 people.    Soldiers arrived Sunday morning at his residence in the oil  city, surrounded the premises and prevented Saro-Wiwa from going  out and receiving visitors, the reports said. Also held in the  building with him were members of his family and some visitors  who were there the previous night.    The telephone lines of Saro-Wiwa, a former president of the  Association of Nigerian Authors, appeared to have been tampered  with and AFP was unable to contact him on Tuesday morning.    Saro-Wiwa was detained for some two months last year by the  previous military regime of General Ibrahim Babangida for  championing the cause of the Ogoni, who have in past years  complained about what they describe as the neglect, injustice  and degradation suffered by their community despite the fact  that large amounts of crude oil, the mainstay of the economy,  are produced in their area. The Ogonis are one of some 250  ethnic groups in Nigeria.    Ledum Mitee, MOSOP deputy president, and Monday Wiwa,  another  MOSOP official, were a week ago led away by soldiers to an  unknown destination, the reports said. Their arrests appeared  related to the authorities' decision to abort the celebration of  an "Ogoni week" scheduled to start on December 28 and to which  Saro-Wiwa was invited as a guest speaker.    The Campaign for Democracy (CD), an umbrella organisation  for  human rights groups, has condemned the arrests of these minority  rights activists in a statement and called for their immediate  release.</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Japanese economy slides as reform row grows Japan's politicians were confronted with official evidence yesterday that the country's economy continues to worsen as they engage in a protracted squabble over government proposals to reform the corruption-prone electoral system. Economic conditions are now 'sluggish overall', according to the latest report from the Economic Planning Agency, the government forecaster. That represents another downward revision since an optimistic claim last June that the downturn had bottomed out. The change, from the EPA's previous report that there were positive as well as negative signs, adds renewed urgency to the government's attempts to draw up economic stimulus measures, delayed by the crisis over political reform. It also increases pressure on the Bank of Japan to ease monetary conditions, as has been demanded by a worried Keidanren, the business federation. A parliamentary panel has little chance of agreeing on a new electoral system in time for the full Diet to vote on it before its session ends on Saturday. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, who heads a fragile seven-party coalition, has hinted at resignation if the measures fail. But the severity of the recession is prompting calls for him to minimise disruption by staying on whatever happens. Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, international trade and industry minister, said the government planned to decide on a rough outline of an economic stimulus by February 10, the day before Mr Hosokawa is to meet US president Bill Clinton in Washington. The EPA's leading business index, a measure of economic prospects over the months ahead, stood at 30 in November, its seventh month below 50, the dividing line between growth and decline. November's figure was up on October's 27.5. However, two important components of the November index showed declines. The outlook for money supply weakened, breaking a 12-month trend, while housing starts, formerly one of the few bright patches in the economy, ended a five-month rise. Two inconclusive signs of improvement came with an upturn in purchases of machinery by private sector companies and the first rise in job offers for three months. Separate evidence of the continued weakness in consumer demand was also announced, with a 6.6 per cent decline in department store sales for 1993.

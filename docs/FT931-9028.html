			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Italian group signs Russia ovens venture RUSSIA'S programme to convert state-owned industries and produce more consumer goods has moved forward with an agreement between De Longhi, the Italian white goods group, and SPA Impuls of St Petersburg to make microwave and electric ovens, Haig Simonian writes from Milan. The deal, worth Dollars 43m (Pounds 30m) a year for the next seven years, involves a licensing agreement to use the De Longhi name on 500,000 conventional electric and microwave ovens a year to be sold in Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The agreement follows a decision by the Russian authorities to diversify the activities of SPA Impuls, which makes computer hardware and software, into consumer goods. De Longhi is to provide know-how for designing, planning and building production lines. The latest deal marks the third co-operation contract in Russia by De Longhi, which had sales of L650bn (Pounds 295m) last year. Ansaldo, the Italian public-sector engineering company which is part of the IRI state holding group, has won a L193bn contract to supply equipment for a new hydro-electric power station in Ecuador. The group's Ansaldo-Gie subsidiary will supply turbines, generators and transformers for a generating plant at Daule Peripa.</p>

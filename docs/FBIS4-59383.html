			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 12 May (MENA) -- Dr. Nabil Sha'th,  Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser, has  announced that President 'Arafat today approved the nomination  of 15 members of the Palestinian Authority Council in Gaza and  Jericho. He said that he informed Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin of this today so that the authorities would  receive this information through official channels, and not to  ask Israel for approval of the Council members.    He added that the Council chairman will be Yasir 'Arafat. It  will include 14 members. These are: Zakariya al-Agha, Frayh  Abu-Midyan, Faysal al-Husayni, Sa'ib 'Urayqat, Dr. Riyad  al-Za'nun, Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Dr. 'Azmi al-Shu'aybi, Dr.  'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Haj Ahmad, Ilyas Furayj, Ahmad Quray' alias  Abu-'Ala', Samir Ghawshah, Yasir 'Amr, Mrs. Intisar al-Wazir  alias Umm Jihad, and Mrs. Hanan al-'Ashrawi.    Sha'th told his news conference at the Foreign  Correspondents  Association in Cairo today that all these members have agreed to  take part in the first Palestinian Authority Council, and their  nomination has been approved by the PLO Executive Committee.    He noted that in the next four days, nine other members will  be nominated, thus completing the formation of the Council,  which will consist of 24 members. He said that the Council will  start its duties immediately. He expected that this will take  place on Wednesday, 18 May, in Gaza-Jericho and will constitute  the first Palestinian National Authority on Palestinian  territory.    Dr. Nabil Sha'th said that among the members of the Council  are two former deportees, 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Haj Ahmad and 'Azmi  al-Shu'aybi. There are also two women: Dr. Hanan 'Ashrawi and  Intisar al-Wazir. Among them also is one of Jerusalem's  prominent sons, namely Faysal al-Husayni.    Dr. Sha'th added that the members of the Council have not  yet  been allocated their portfolios. He clarified that in  accordance with the protocol that was signed last week, the PLO  will continue to be the legitimate representative of the  Palestinian people until their Palestinian state is established.  He said that the Palestinian Authority in Gaza and Jericho is a  part of the PLO, which supervises the liberated territories.    He added that foreign relations and the Palestine Liberation  Army's affairs outside the Palestinian territories, as well as  the national and international relations will continue to be the  responsibilities of the PLO headquarters in Tunis. These  affairs will be administered by three prominent members from the  PLO Executive Committee--namely, Faruq Qaddumi for foreign  diplomatic relations, Mahmud 'Abbas for national relations with  Jewish organizations, and 'Abdallah Hurani for the Palestine  Liberation Army.    On the delay in the Palestinian Authority's assumption of  its  duties in Gaza and Jericho, Sha'th said that this is due to very  difficult circumstances because of the Palestinian diaspora.  Thankfully, Saudi planes have transported members of the police  from Yemen to Sinai. Saudi planes will also transport those  coming from Algeria. Those coming from Libya will travel by car  thousands of kilometers to cross through the al-Sallum border  post to Sinai.    Egyptian planes have transported those coming from Sudan.    In this regard, Sha'th thanked President Husni Mubarak; King  Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, the custodian of the Two Holy Mosques;  and the Arab countries who have provided and continue to provide  all the necessary facilities to transport these forces.    Sha'th expressed his belief that these forces will complete  their arrival in Gaza and Jericho within the next few days.    He said that the Palestinian Authority would like the  financial allocations from the donor countries to arrive quickly  so that it can be spent on this police force. He noted that  there is positive international action by the United States,  Japan, and the European countries to hasten this process. Also,  a batch of new cars for this police will arrive in Port Said  sometime next week.    He said that this positive attitude reflects the extent of  the world's interest in backing the implementation of the  Gaza-Jericho agreement.    On the relationships of the newborn Palestinian Authority  in Gaza and Jericho, Dr. Sha'th said that this authority is part  of the PLO, and although the latter is entrusted with  representing the Palestinian people and negotiating and signing  on its behalf, the Authority will be in charge of implementing  the agreement on the scene. He added: Both the Palestinian  people and Israel want to the retain the PLO at present. The  Palestinians believe that the PLO is their representative until  the state of Palestine is officially established. Israel would  like to continue to negotiate and cooperate with the PLO in  order to avoid the establishment of the Palestinian state. But,  he added, the establishment of this state has become inevitable,  no matter how long it takes.    In reply to a question about Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin's recent statement that Jerusalem is the capital of the  State of Israel, Dr. Sha'th said: Rabin has no right to say  this because, according to the Declaration of Principles,  Jerusalem is an issue in the bilateral negotiations. If Rabin  wishes it to be the capital of Israel, we in turn insist on  making Jerusalem the capital of Palestine. He added: Since  Israel has agreed to share the land of Palestine with us, why  does it not agree then to let us both share Jerusalem?    In reply to a question on why Israel has not released the  remaining Palestinian prisoners and detainees, Dr. Sha'th  emphasized that he is confident that they will all be released.  He explained that Israel would like to hand over many of them  to the Palestinian Authority when it takes over, especially  those convicted of ordinary crimes. Their cases will be left  for the Palestinian Authority to decide on. As for the members  of the Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and al-Jihad  movements, they have not been released so far because they have  not signed a declaration to the Israeli authorities accepting  the peace agreement. Maybe they do not want to sign such a  declaration for the Israeli authorities but might sign for the  Palestinian Authority so as to be released.    On 'Arafat's entry into Gaza and Jericho, Sha'th referred to  'Arafat's statements that this will take place in early June.  But, he added, 'Arafat has his own surprises. We don't know.  The date might be before then.    On the differences between the Palestinian organizations,  especially Hamas and al-Jihad, Dr. Sha'th said that there is an  agreement that these differences should be kept within the  democratic framework and not turned into acts of violence. He  stressed his conviction that all the Palestinian organizations  care about this democratic dialogue in order to establish the  Palestinian state and ensure the success of the agreement as the  first step toward the establishment of the state of Palestine.    Dr. Sha'th went on to say that the PLO, which is  headquartered in Tunis, will remain in charge of the affairs of  the refugees outside the liberated areas in the West Bank and  the Gaza Strip and that the Palestine National Council [PNC],  which includes members from inside and outside the territories,  will remain the highest legislative Palestinian authority.    Sha'th went on to say that the coming elections in the West  Bank and the Gaza Strip, which are scheduled to be held after  three months, will be for the election of the members of the PNC  from inside the territories, who were formerly appointed. He  said: These members comprise a third of the PNC members but at  the same time constitute the Palestinian Authority's parliament  inside the territories.    In response to a question about the Palestinian diplomatic  missions abroad, he said that they will remain the prerogative  of the PLO headquartered in Tunis, but all countries will have  the right to open representation offices in Gaza and Jericho  until the Palestinian state is established.    On the new Palestinian ambassador in Cairo, Sha'th said that  Acting Ambassador Zuhdi al-Qidrah will be appointed the  Palestinian state's ambassador in Cairo.</p>

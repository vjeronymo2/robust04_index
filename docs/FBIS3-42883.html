			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Todres, under the "Archives" rubric: </F> Zhirinovskiy's Falcons: The History and the People of the  `Victory Party'"]    [Text] In the popular perception, the party that so  amazingly won in the elections, consists of one person, and even  he came out of nowhere. Vladimir Zhirinovskiy himself told the  press on that triumphal Tuesday that they are the ones who "do  not know LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] politicians.  The Russian people, however, do know them, and that is why they  voted for them." Nevertheless, it seems that the people had  other reasons. As to the history of his party, it is still  shrouded in semi-mystery.  <H5>  The Beginning. From Novodvorskaya to Oleynik </H5>   It is unlikely that Mr. Zhirinovskiy would have made it to  the current pinnacle with the help of the LDPR had he not been  expelled from it at some point in the past.    He appeared on Russia's political arena in May 1989, on the  second day of the founding congress of the Democratic Union.  Only in those naive times could a person, having walked into  this sort of meeting for the first time, find himself elected on  the spot into the Democratic Union's coordinating council for  his eloquence--only to be expelled a couple of days later "for  communist leanings."    Having spent the summer and the fall at rallies, in the  winter of 1990 Zhirinovskiy received an invitation to join  forces with Vladimir Bogachev, who also had left the Democratic  Union and founded the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. At the  LDP's founding congress in March, Mr. Bogachev, impressed by the  legal, linguistic, and oratorical luggage of his partner,  promotes him to chairmanship, while settling for the job of the  party's coordinator himself. At the time the LDP consisted of  about 20 members, and anyone who wanted to could get a deputy  mandate and a membership card at the congress.    Mr. Zhirinovskiy concentrated his activities on the  so-called  Centrist Bloc, created in June 1990--an alliance of dwarf  parties that had the obvious sympathy of the CPSU's Central  Committee, whose member Boris Oleynik openly backed the bloc in  general and Zhirinovskiy in particular. Mr. Zhirinovskiy's  former confederates maintain that it was at this stage that his  rhetoric began to change significantly, acquiring populist and  imperial overtones.    In October 1990 the LDP chairman received an invitation to  attend the congress of the Liberal International [LI] in  Helsinki. (By the way, Mr. Zhirinovskiy still refers to his  "ties with the LI," although the leadership of this union said  right then that "any cooperation with Zhirinovskiy and his party  is out of question"). Having returned from the capital of Suomi  [Finland], the LDP chairman learned that he had been expelled  from the party.    Observers are inclined to believe that Mssrs. Bogachev and  Zhirinovskiy simply could not agree on how to apportion the  illusory power over the party. Bogachev's supporters insisted  that they expelled the competitor for ideological reasons--"for  pro-communist activities in a centrist bloc." Zhirinovskiy's  group maintains that Bogachev simply was covering up his  financial transgressions (Zhirinovskiy's attempt, however, to  prove it with the help of the OBKhSS [Department for Combating  the Embezzlement of Socialist Property and Speculation] and the  court failed).    It should be noted that, according to Bogachev, "At the time  Zhirinovskiy's name did not attract any sponsors or money to the  party. He definitely was alone--without any structures behind  him."    A hastily convened (with the help of the Centrist Bloc)  conference of Zhirinovskiy's group did the reverse--expelled  Bogachev and approved as "vice Zhirinovskiy" Akhmet Khalitov, an  elderly water-tower operator in a kolkhoz in the environs of  Moscow.    Since then the fortunes of the current victor began to rise  swiftly. The LDP leader began to appear on television. According  to Mr. Bogachev, "Zhirinovskiy's views after the split underwent  an incredibly rapid evolution." In January 1991 the proposal of  the "committee for national salvation of the USSR," drafted by  Zhirinovskiy and two other "Centrist Bloc leaders" Vladimir  Voronin and Valeriy Skurlatov, was made public; among other  things, the proposal advocated imposing a state of emergency and  disbanding all parties. (When, half a year later, Mr.  Zhirinovskiy was reminded of this at the election campaign press  conference of the presidential candidate, Zhirinovskiy demanded  that journalist Sergey Parkhomenko be removed from the studio  "for provocations.") The Ministry of Justice registered the  LDPSU [Liberal Democratic Party of the Soviet Union) in April  1991 (before the CPSU); it turned out later that the lion's  share of the required 5,000 signatures had been falsified, and  in August 1992 the Russian Ministry of Justice annulled the  registration (restoring it again, however, in November). On 12  June 1992 Vladimir Zhirinovskiy became a fact of public  conscience, having come in third in the race for the title of  the president of Russia.    To this day, only one sponsor of his campaign is known for  certain--the head of the Galant concern Andrey Zavidiya, who was  on the ballot as his vice president and who, after the putsch  and the dissolution of the CPSU, took upon himself the financing  of SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper.  <H3>  `The Inner Party.' Military-Industrial Complex Heroes From  the Shadow Cabinet </H3>   The LDP structure is designed to be strictly a pyramid: "the  party--the Central Committee--the Supreme Council, consisting of  five persons--Chairman Zhirinovskiy. In reality, however, the  "salt of the LDP" and its brain center is the "inner party"--the  LDP's shadow cabinet.    Interestingly, there are only a very few LDP veterans in its  current elite. As soon as the party got down to "serious  business," Mr. Khalitov, the water-tower operator, left the  party "for reasons of advanced age." Besides Zhirinovskiy  himself, only two "veteran swordsmen" may be counted among the  LDP's top echelon.    Stanislav Zhebrovskiy, the party's deputy chairman and "the  minister of the economy" in the shadow cabinet, a physicist, has  known Zhirinovskiy since 1983 from working together in the Mir  publishing house. In the party, his responsibilities include  organizational matters and the PRAVDA ZHIRINOVSKOGO newspaper.  Until then he worked as an editor in the Sovetskaya  Entsiklopedia publishing house, and before that, he worked for a  quite a while in Algeria. Viktor Bogatyy, 46, a year ago gave up  his Supreme Council membership and the post of "the minister of  foreign economic relations" in the shadow cabinet because of a  heart surgery. He now intends to return. He is the president of  the Eksodin company (insurance, real estate, commerce) and the  owner of seven similar companies; in the past, for many year a  staff member of the [Soviet] trade representation in Great  Britain, and then later a deputy editor in chief of the  VNESHNYAYA TORGOVLYA magazine.    It appears that the party owes its successful campaign to  the  "second draft": relatively young people who came to the LDP  after the 1991 presidential elections as a rather cohesive group  with its own hierarchy and remarkably similar biographies. The  current membership of the shadow cabinet is estimated by various  party functionaries to be between 20 and 40 people; its  structure is not rigid, moreover; it practically is not  subordinate to the party's Supreme Council, but is formed and  acts at its own discretion. It is believed that the party  maintains control over it, since the head of the cabinet, Mr.  Vengerovskiy, is a member of the Supreme Council.    Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, 40, is the "deputy prime minister"  and "the head of intelligence" in the shadow cabinet, No. 8 on  the party list, served for a long time as an officer in the  military space program; after that he worked on secret topics in  the same field in research centers; he maintains that he has  "conceptual experience in counterintelligence," and was the head  of a corresponding main administration in the State Committee  for Computing Technology.    Mikhail Musatov, the "deputy for defense affairs" in the  shadow cabinet, also was an officer in the military space  program. He joined the party in 1991.    Viktor Kobelev, 50, a member of the LDP Supreme Council, and  No. 2 on the party list. In the past a vice dean of the Ministry  of Heavy Machine Building's professional training institute.    Sergey Abeltsev, 32, member of the Supreme Council and "the  minister of security," is No. 9 on the party list. A former GRU  [Main Intelligence Directorate] officer (according to other  sources, he combined this service with assignments for the KGB).    Andrey Mitrofanov, 31, "the minister of foreign affairs," in  the past represented the USSR MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs]  at the Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna.    Sergey Barskiy, "the minister of internal affairs," a former  MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] officer, now works for a  private agency.    Viktor Lymar, "the minister of science and technology," is a  product of the Radio Industry Scientific Research Center.    As we can see, the "core" of the shadow cabinet noticeably  revolves around sectors of the military-industrial complex, in  particular, the space industry and nuclear power generation  (especially those under the control of special services).  Vladimir Gusev, the former deputy minister for chemistry and  timber in Ryzhkov's government (No. 11 on the list), and  Academician Aleksey Zvyagin, currently teaching at the Commerce  Academy, give the list and the cabinet respectability.    Mr. Vengerovskiy maintains that "the shadow cabinet, which  resembles the Rand Corporation, functions without remuneration."  Writer Eduard Limonov and well-known rock-nazis Andrey Arkhipov  and Sergey Zharikov did not fit with the cabinet (according to  Vengerovskiy--"because of their frivolous attitude and  zealotry").  <H5>  The New Generation Chooses </H5>   According to Mr. Zhebrovskiy, the flow of people who wanted  to join the LDPR especially swelled during the last week before  12 December. It still has not receded, which anyone walking into  the headquarters at Rybnykov Lane in Moscow will easily see for  himself. The party's average age (over 30) has been declining  lately. The procedure of joining the party is still simple: an  application, a photo, a 200-ruble membership fee, and the card  is issued on the spot. Or not issued, if one does not want it.  Of the 50,000 membership cards printed some time back, about  1,500 still have not been used.    There is no system of registration, so new members can  easily  escape paying membership dues (1 percent of the declared  earnings a month). As Mr. Zhebrovskiy says: "Who wants to go  looking for your money?!" Just recently he maintained that the  entire income of the indigent LDPR consists of membership dues.  <H6>  * * * * </H6>   How many of them were there four years ago--Voronins,  Skurlatovs, marginal chairmen of parties of peace, individual,  and other assorted centrism! For all 10 days after the  elections, I have had visions of them gnawing on their pillows  in impotent envy: "Had I been more careful in choosing friends,  I could have, too!"</p>

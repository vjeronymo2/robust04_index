			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FRESHMAN SWIMMER IS DENIED SCHOLARSHIP  </P> <P> Patrick Collins, a freshman swimmer at Tustin High School, has not been allowed  to accept a $4,000 scholarship because it would affect his eligibility to  compete in college.  </P> <P> Collins, 15, was named was one of 25 California athletes honored by the Amateur  Athletic Foundation and Glendale Federal Bank. As part of the award, athletes  would have received $4,000, paid over four years.  </P> <P> The money would be used to defray the cost of training for Olympic hopefuls,  according to Steve Rutledge, director of communications for the AAF.  </P> <P> However, the the cash award would violate National College Athletic Assn.  rules, according to Rick Evrard, an NCAA official. The AAF was informed of this  decision on June 1, the day before the award ceremonies.  </P> <P> Collins was one of 15 athletes who were not allowed to accept their cash  awards.  </P> <P> "The NCAA states that students may only accept actual and necessary expenses to  participate by the school he attends or the organization that is sponsoring the  competition," Evrard said. "Compensation, in any form, would violate (the  NCAA's) amateur regulations."  </P> <P> Collins has been swimming competitively for 10 years. He set three age-group  national records at the age of 10.  </P> <P> At the Southern Section 4-A meet in May, Collins finished 10th in the 100-yard  breaststroke and 11th in the 200 individual medley.  </P> <P> Rutledge said that members of the AAF as well as parents of award winners had  checked with the NCAA to make sure the cash awards were legal and understood  the awards did not violate NCAA rules.  </P></p>

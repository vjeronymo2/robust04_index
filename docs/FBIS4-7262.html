			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["DPRK Foreign Ministry Statement" issued during a news </F> conference for domestic and foreign reporters in Pyongyang on 28  April]    [Text] The illegal acts [pulpop haengwi] of the United  States to infringe upon the Korean Armistice Agreement and to  paralyze [mabi sikida] the supervisory organization of the  armistice have reached a peak.    By rupturing [kyolyol] the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks  that envisaged the prospect for a satisfactory solution to the  problem of DPRK-U.S. relations, the United States is now  deploying armed forces on a large scale on the Korean peninsula  and its surrounding areas.    The United States finally brought new-type Patriot missiles  into South Korea in defiance of the unanimous rejection of our  people and the public opinion of the world. It has been learned  that the United States will deploy Patriot missiles for an  actual war [silchon paebihada] by the end of April and will even  stage the Team Spirit 94 joint military exercise--a nuclear war  exercise--in November of this year.    The United States, which has already reinforced the Apache  helicopter battalion in South Korea, is going to bring various  one brigade-class combat equipment in the future.    The U.S. Marine forces, which have been concentrated on  areas  around our country, have not been removed. Thus, the United  States itself showed that it totally abrogated [pagi] the Korean  Armistice Agreement reached with us in the name of the United  Nations.    A basic condition for maintaining the armistice status on  the  Korean peninsula is to not bring operational materials from  outside and not reinforce armed forces.    Nevertheless, the United States has unilaterally abrogated  what was agreed upon in the agreement since it signed the Korean  Armistice Agreement in July 1953, and has brought modern  weapons, including 1,000-odd nuclear weapons, into South Korea.    In the past, the United States brought numerous armed  forces,  including nuclear weapons, into South Korea in a secret and  concealed manner in fear of the Korean Armistice Agreement.  Today, however, it openly brings in and deploys new-type of  missiles and combat technological equipment in broad daylight.  This illustrates that the United States does not recognize the  validity of the Korean Armistice Agreement and is ignoring its  existence.    Contrary to its duty as a real party to the Armistice  Agreement [chongjon hyopchongui silchejogin tangsajaroso chinin  uimue paechidoege], for over the past 40 years, the United  States has not only systematically violated and obliterated  [chegyejoguro yurin malsal] the provisions of the agreement but  it has even paralyzed the organization in charge of supervising  the implementation of the armistice [chongjon kamsi kigu majo  mabisikiotta].    When the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams disclosed the U.S.  violations of the Armistice Agreement after the agreement had  been signed, the United States unilaterally and forcibly had  removed [ilbangjoguro kangje cholsu sikyossumyo] the Neutral  Nations Inspection Teams, which were organized under Paragraph 3  of Clause 2 of the Armistice Agreement, from its area in June  1956. And, it appointed a general of the South Korean Armed  Forces, who is not legally suitable or qualified [amuron  bomnyulchok tadangsongdo chagyokto omnun] in view of the  Armistice Agreement, as senior member of its side in March 1991  and, thus, made the armistice organization incapable of  performing its function.    Because of these unreasonable acts [pudanghan chosa] of the  United States, the Korean Armistice Agreement has today turned  into an empty sheet of paper that cannot guarantee peace on the  Korean peninsula, and the Military Armistice Commission has  become an organization in which no one is in charge and turned  nominal [chuini omnun kigurodo yumyongmusirhage toeotta] as a  matter of fact.    The United States has so far systematically abrogated [pagi]  the Armistice Agreement and is now threatening us with the force  of arms [himuro], while building up massive forces on a large  scale on the Korean peninsula and its vicinity. In view of  this, we can more clearly see that its hidden intention [soksim]  is to crush [apsal] the socialist countries in Asia, including  our country.    The United States is bringing forces and armed equipment  into  South Korea as it pleases [maumdaero] and aggravating the  situation on the Korean peninsula as it pleases [chemaumdaero],  thus, bringing the situation to the brink of war. Nevertheless,  the Armistice Agreement cannot fulfill its role as a systematic  device [chedojok changchi] in preventing this. This is a  reality. Under these circumstances, the question of what in the  world [todaeche] the Armistice Agreement or the armistice  organization is necessary for arises.    Under the present circumstances in which the Korean  Armistice Agreement and the armistice organ [chongjon kigu] can  take no responsibility in bringing stability to the situation on  the Korean peninsula and stopping military buildup [muryok  chunggangul mangnundeso] but are used to shield the U.S. policy  of crushing our country [urinarae taehan migugui apsal  chongchaegul karinunde iyongdoegoinnun], it is natural that we  can no longer hold any expectations of such an agreement and  institution.    The state of armistice has been maintained and peace has  prevailed on the Korean peninsula up to the present because of  our Republic's patient peace-loving policy and volition.    A series of complicated and acute problems, including the  nuclear issue, are raised today on the Korean peninsula. This  is connected with the continuation of the armistice system which  defines us and the United States--the actual parties to the  Armistice Agreement--as the two warring opponents [choktae  ssangbang].    The state of armistice of the fifties remains intact today  after 40 years have elapsed. This is abnormal in every respect.  The developments [cheban sate] created on the Korean peninsula  demand that the Armistice Agreement be replaced by a peace  agreement without fail and that a peace-guaranteeing system that  substitutes the present armistice organ be established in order  to eliminate the hostile relations between the DPRK and the  United States, to achieve reconciliation, and to guarantee  genuine peace and security on the Korean peninsula.    In this connection, the DPRK Government proposes to the  United States that negotiations be held for the establishment of  a new peace guaranteeing system, which can prevent military  buildup and the recurrence of war on the Korean peninsula,  stabilize the situation, and practically and reliably guarantee  solid peace and security.    The United States should discard the concept of  confrontation  and the war mentality [taegyol kwannyomgwa chonjaeng simni] and  respond to this peace proposal we are making.    [Dated] 28 April 1994, Pyongyang</p>

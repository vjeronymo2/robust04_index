			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondent Dmitriy Gorokhov and </F> ITAR- TASS correspondent Georgiy Shelenkov]    [Text] Cairo, 5 May -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev, who is here on a visit, made the following press  statement to the ITAR-TASS correspondents:    "There has been an epoch-making event in the Republic of  South Africa that has put the country's development onto a  democratic footing -- namely, the country's first-ever universal  elections.    "The world community, which has for decades been  persistently  striving for a restoration of racial and social justice in the  RSA, today notes that this goal has been achieved. For its  part, Russia, which has invariably supported all the  constructive efforts of the South African Government, parties,  and public organizations along the path of democratic  transformations, shares with everyone a feeling of deep  satisfaction at the results of these efforts.    "We believe that favorable prospects are opening up for the  harmonious economic and social development of the peoples of  South Africa. Much will depend on the readiness of all the  country's political forces for constructive interaction similar  to what they have shown during the period of preparations for  the elections.    "Russia expresses its readiness to cooperate with the new  democratic South Africa and hopes that the good relations that  have been formed between our countries and peoples will in the  coming period be further developed in the interests of universal  peace and prosperity."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 22/4/1994 -- "There are no  opposing interests between the Russian Federation and Romania,  both states sharing the same European values and ideals," Yuriy  Fedorovich Yarov, deputy prime minister of the Government of the  Russian Federation, said during an interview held Thursday [21  April] evening in Bucharest with Romania's Prime Minister  Nicolae Vacaroiu.    Appreciating the conditions set forth by the new  Constitution  of the Russian Federation as favorable for expanding bilateral  ties, the guest said that they could and should be expanded not  only between Romania and the Russian Federation, but also  between Romania and the states in the federation that are  enjoying full freedom to build up their own international  economic ties.    In the opinion of Yuriy Fedorovich Yarov, the two  governments  are called to ensure as soon as possible the legal framework for  expanding cooperation in the economic, commercial, trade, and  scientific fields.    In his turn, Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu pointed out the  similarities of the stages crossed by the two countries on their  road towards market economy, saying that to get out of that  specific crisis implies strengthening of ties on multiple  planes. Nicolae Vacaroiu also considered that the Crans Montana  Forum was a good opportunity to foster new contacts that would  lead to an expansion of bilateral exchanges. Romania's premier  also expressed hopes in a rapid expansion of economic ties  between Romania and the Russian Federation.</p>

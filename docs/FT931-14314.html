			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / International Company News: Highlands Gold slides 18.6% HIGHLANDS Gold, the Papua New Guinea mining company, yesterday blamed falling gold prices and lower sales for an 18.6 per cent cut in net profits to K21.9m (Dollars 22.5m) for the six months to December 13. Highlands, 65 per cent owned by MIM Holdings, the Australian resources group, has a 30 per cent stake in the Porgera gold mine, which is the focus of a dispute with the PNG government. Net profits soared 78 per cent to K51.86m in the year to end-June, following Porgera's first full year of production, in which output was significantly higher than expected. However, confidence in the Porgera project was shaken in November when the PNG government said it wanted to increase its 10 per cent holding to 30 per cent. Highlands and its two joint-venture partners, Placer Pacific and Renison Goldfields Consolidated, have resisted the government, and are holding protracted talks on the issue in Port Moresby. Highlands also holds about 30 exploration licence areas in Papua New Guinea and it is negotiating with the Indonesian government to explore an area in northern Sumatra.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the Panamanian Banking Association outlining </F> its position on money laundering; place and date not given]    [Text]Why We Should Struggle Against Money Laundering    Money is of vital importance for all legitimate trade and  industrial activity, but it is even more important for criminal  activity. The constant flow of illegally obtained money through  the international banking and financial systems is fundamental  for criminal organizations as a means of obtaining funds  necessary for financing their operations and providing new  capital for their expansion. Therefore, the interruption of the  flow of money to criminal organizations is of utmost importance  in weakening and eventually eradicating them. The illegal and  criminal nature of money laundering is the main reason why the  Republic of Panama, its government, and its people should  decidedly combat money laundering. In addition, an analysis of  the methods through which criminal organizations gradually take  over a nation's economy shows that this struggle is an urgent  necessity in safeguarding the future of our nation.    This is the danger that looms over Panama and how it could  occur:    1. Infiltration in legitimate companies. Criminals  and drug traffickers, in particular, manage their businesses as  large corporations. The only difference between these illegal  operations and legitimate ones is that the illegal operations  have an enormous competitive advantage: They do not obey any  law. This advantage, in addition to their international contacts  and vast financial and coercive power, allows them to acquire  legitimate companies which are then used to conceal illegal  operations. In this way, they gradually infiltrate every sector  of the economy.    2. Concentration of economic power. The gradual  subjection of legitimate companies in key sectors of the  economy, along with the great amount of illegally earned capital  that can be used to expand illicit operations, creates a  concentration of economic power that subsequently can spill into  other investments and economic sectors. Eventually, these might  infiltrate political and government circles, and this would have  serious implications for the nation's future security and its  political and moral stability.    3. Money laundering as an ill-fated function in the  economy. The final stage of money laundering is reached  when illegally earned capital replaces domestic and foreign  investment in funding economic expansion. At the same time, this  surreptitiously harms the very foundations of the banking  sector, the stock exchange, and the financial system. The risk  of this happening is especially high in an economy such as  Panama's--one that lacks resources and, in turn, is eager for  investments.  <H5>  Corporations, Money, the Banking System, and the Free Zone: </H5>   Given its geographic location and the configuration and  extension of its territory, Panama has historically been a  center of trade and transit. Although growth can be obtained in  other areas, it is unlikely that Panama will turn into an  agricultural, mining, or manufacturing power. Our greatest  development potential in the immediate future seems to be in the  sustained growth of maritime and tourism services while  maintaining a healthy monetary infrastructure in banking and  international trade. As a result, services have been identified  as our best natural means of encouraging the nation's economic  growth.    Our service economy is based on our geographic location and  the Panama Canal. In addition to this, Panama features four  areas that are essential for today's service economy but, at the  same time, are also threatened in various ways:    -- the Law on Corporations, which was approved in 1927;    -- the monetary system, which dates back to 1904;    -- the banking system, which was created in 1970;    -- and the Colon Free Zone, which was organized in 1946.    The threats facing these four areas of our service economy  stem from two sources:    -- from some sectors of the international community aimed  at limiting their effectiveness and ending their existence;    -- attempts by criminal organizations to use these areas  to benefit their illegal activities.    It is obvious that Panama did not create these institutions  to have them used for criminal activities. This is why Panama  has the obligation to improve, control more efficiently, and  finally defend these institutions to enable them to continue  being useful for honest businessmen in an economy that is  fundamentally service-based and whose structure will not change  dramatically for a long time.  <H5>  Evaluation of Achievements </H5>   Drug traffickers and other criminal organizations use  incredibly advanced techniques and employ professionals with  broad knowledge of banking and financial affairs, with access to  the latest technologies of electronic banking and instant  communications to conduct operations beyond national borders.  Therefore, international cooperation is imperative to prepare  and coordinate measures that will make possible an effective  struggle against money laundering.    As part of these efforts, the 1989 Economic Summit created  the Financial Action Task Force, better known by its English  acronym FATF, formed originally by 26 countries that are sites  of financial centers. Panama subsequently joined it as a member  of the Caribbean subgroup. In May 1990, the FATF adopted 40  recommendations on measures to counter money laundering, based  on the 1988 Vienna Convention. Fulfillment or adoption of these  40 recommendations currently constitutes the best means to  evaluate progress in these struggles, and, in fact, in April  1991 the member countries agreed that their comparative progress  in this regard will be evaluated by experts from the group. In  Panama's case, an objective evaluation reviewing these  recommendations and other facts would reveal the following:    1. Panama ratified the Vienna Convention in December 1993  and  is in the process of implementing those articles that are not  included in Panamanian legislation. (Recommendation No. 1)..    2. Panama's banking confidentiality laws do not involve  absolute secrecy as it is made to appear to locals and  foreigners. Panamanian laws unquestionably permit authorities  access to confidential information through the proper judicial  institutions in the presence of suspicious criminal activity.  (Recommendation No. 2)    3. Panama accepts international assistance and coordination  against criminal activities, as can be confirmed by the recent  mutual legal assistance treaties negotiated with the United  Kingdom, Colombia, Canada, and Central America and the initial  negotiations with Mexico. In July 1991, Panama ratified a  similar treaty with the United States, which has yet to ratify  it. (Recommendation No. 3)    4. Through Law No. 23 of 1986, Panama defined as a crime the  improper use of banking transactions. In addition to the  criminal liability that this crime entails, Law No. 23 also  establishes the civil liability of the individual or his  employer. In addition to the transactions made in Panama, this  definition also includes those originating in Panama and  perfected abroad, with knowledge, through an individual or  intervening person. Finally, Law No. 23 and its reforms will  permit the seizure and confiscation of assets or instruments  related to the criminal action. (Recommendations Nos. 4 and 5)    5. There is no official agency with sufficient authority and  responsibility to define, coordinate, and implement actions  against money laundering. The vacuum caused by the absence of  such an agency cannot currently be filled by the National  Banking Commission because of legal, technical, and budgetary  limitations. This constitutes one of the most serious  limitations Panama has in the struggle against laundering.  (Recommendations Nos. 9-11)    6. Cabinet Decree No. 41 of February 1990 establishes as an  obligation the identification of the client and registration of  transactions in cash and negotiable instruments. This decree is  the source of authority that permitted the National Banking  Commission to issue Resolutions Nos. 5-90 and 1-91 regulating  the banks' obligation to know their clients and maintain a  registry of transactions in cash and negotiable payment  instruments. Unfortunately, the National Banking Commission does  not have the resources to create an automatized database to  adequately handle this information. (Recommendations Nos. 12-14)    7. Decree No. 41 and the relevant resolutions do not  explicitly address the problem of complex or uncommon  transactions or the topic of patterns or trends of infrequent or  unusual transactions. Decree No. 41 also does not address the  banks' responsibility to investigate these types of transactions  to establish their origin or purpose. (Recommendation No. 15)    8. Regarding dubious transactions, the Penal Code  stipulates that banks and their employees are required to tell  the relevant authorities about them under penalty of harboring  criminal activities. However, there is no legal precedent in  Panamanian courts that protects the institution or its employees  from civil or criminal responsibility for violating banking  secrecy laws in these cases. In addition, in terms of suspicious  activities, no law requires that banks terminate their relation  with the client. Finally, no legal precept requires banks to  implement procedures including controls, screening procedures,  policies, and training and internal audit programs against money  laundering. This lack of clear guidelines on the policies banks  should adopt to prevent domestic or international money  laundering curtails the confidence with which banks can act  regarding compliance with their legal obligations against money  laundering. (Recommendation Nos. 16-22)    9. Panama has implemented additional measures to avert money  laundering, including the cash transactions declaration and the  internal promotion of alternative forms of payment such as  checks, credit cards, direct deposits of salaries, and other  transactions that replace the use of cash. However, although  Decree 41 requires that transactions larger than $10,000 must be  registered, it does not include electronic international  transfers, nor does it require the creation of a national data  bank operating under a separate government agency that  guarantees its proper use. (Recommendation Nos. 23-25)    10. Panama has not sufficiently strengthened the role of the  National Banking Commission as a coordinating organization to  prevent and investigate money laundering since the National  Banking Commission does not extend its controls to other  institutions that manage considerable amounts of money such as  casinos, money-changing offices, and transfer agencies. The  National Banking Commission lacks the resources and the  authority to introduce, in all banks, adequate programs to  prevent money laundering or measures to detect any suspicious  behavior by clients. The National Banking Commission does have  and does exercise the authority to prevent criminal parties from  owning a majority of stocks in banking institutions.  (Recommendation Nos. 26-29)    11. As for the strengthening of international cooperation  efforts against money laundering, Panama has showed willingness  to participate at both the bilateral and multilateral levels  within its current legal parameters and financial limitations.  The exchange of general information by relevant authorities,  except areas related to dubious transactions, cooperation  between judicial and legal authorities, and mutual assistance in  investigations through the corresponding legal and diplomatic  means, should improve as bilateral agreements come into force.  (Recommendation Nos. 30-40)    As part of an objective evaluation, actions by the Panama  Banking Association that reinforce or complement achievements by  the national government should not be downplayed. A brief list  of these actions reveals that this Banking Association adopted  in 1984, through an interbanking agreement, the Code of Conduct  on Banking Operations, which was reformed in 1985 and 1986;  joined in 1989 the Declaration of Principles of the  International Bank for Clearing House Activities in Basel,  Switzerland; prepared in 1992 and updated in 1993 a guideline  for banks to prevent the improper use of their services;  conducted in 1992 and 1993 training and information seminars on  preventing money laundering jointly with authorities of the  Treasury Department, Justice Department, DEA [Drug Enforcement  Administraiton], Financial Crime Enforcement Network, and U.S.  Postal Service; conducted jointly with the National Banking  Commission in 1992 and 1993 a study to establish, as was done,  consistency between the information on cashflows and the  remittances of excess cash to the U.S. Federal Reserve; adopted  in March 1993 Interbanking Agreement No. 28, which determines  the order of endorsements on checks and facilitates audits  thereof; adopted in June 1993 Interbanking Agreement No. 29,  which regulates the acceptance of alternate documents for  negotiable payment and the criteria to send and receive  remittances of bank transfers.   <H5>    Recommendations </H5>   Additional measures that the Panamanian public sector as  well  as the private sector should take to combat money laundering  must result from Panamanian analysis--an analysis that must take  place within the domestic arena, while maintaining cooperation  with other nations. This analysis should focus on what is needed  to help us wage an efficient struggle against money laundering.  This analysis should also result from our philosophical  conviction that this struggle is ethical, moral, and  economically prudent for Panama.    In terms of its internal policies, the Panama Banking  Association proposes:    1. to bring up to date its Code of Conduct on Banking  Operations;    2. to improve, wherever possible, the "Guide for Banks To  Prevent the Misuse of Services" [Guia a los Bancos Para Prevenir  el Uso Indebido de Sus Servicios];    3. to defend our customers' rights to confidentiality in  legitimate business transactions, as provided for under our  legislation;    4. and to combat the abuse of confidentially by  organizations or individuals devoted to criminal activity.    The Panama Banking Association recommends to Panama's  executive, legislative, and judicial powers:    1. The creation of a working group with a mandate to  design a national policy against money laundering; this working  group should comprise representatives of the Attorney General's  Office, the National Banking Commission, and the Legislative  Assembly's Drug Commission.    2. The endowing of the National Banking Commission with  the technical, legal, and budgetary resources to carry out the  integration, execution, and coordination of a national policy to  prevent money laundering.    3. The prompt issuance of legal documents to implement the  guidelines of the Vienna Convention and the FATF with regard to  the banks' obligation to:    3.1. register all international and local transactions in  a logbook subject to revision by the Banking Commission;    3.2. rigorously investigate the origin and destination of  intricate and unusual transactions;    3.3. report to the authorities suspicious transactions,  safeguarding civil obligations concerning confidentiality;    3.4. implement in bank procedures and policies to prevent  money laundering, training programs that impart to employees a  thorough knowledge of internal auditing procedures, and programs  to guarantee the fulfillment of these procedures; this duty  would fall under the auspices of a high-ranking officer  specifically designated to carry out these tasks;    3.5. register stock market transactions or securities  deals that are unusual or suspicious in nature, subjecting them  to revision by the Banking Commission.    4. The inclusion within the authority of the Banking  Commission additional powers to prevent money laundering; the  power to review the flow of funds from casinos, exchange houses,  and money transfer agencies; and the power to enforce the  obligation of these institutions to report such cashflows to the  National Banking Commission.    5. The creation, as soon as possible, of an official data  bank under the Banking Commission's control and administration  to secure, compare, and analyze the information outlined in  Cabinet Decree 41 of 13 February 1990 and Cabinet Decree 10 of 9  March 1994. This includes any other information--to be furnished  upon request--regarding cash transactions, negotiable documents,  securities, or transfers made through electronic or magnetic  media.    6. An agreement on the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty  [MLAT] to strengthen and broaden Panama's participation in the  struggle against money laundering and the speedy ratification of  the MLAT by the relevant institutions.    7. The adoption of a doctrine or a group of principles  that oppose money laundering and emphasize systematic,  continuous, and dynamic preventative action instead of focusing  on how best to deal with crimes already committed. In addition,  such a doctrine should protect our irreplaceable service economy  and Panama's good name and image.  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   In conclusion, the Banking Association wants to acknowledge  that in Panama, as well as in many other friendly nations, the  problem of money laundering is a reality. In addition, it wants  to signal that the problem of money laundering is constantly  changing and remains extremely dynamic in terms of criminal  creativity and resources available to criminals who constantly  modify and invent new money laundering techniques, thereby  making current preventive actions ineffective. The struggle  against money laundering requires constant surveillance, quick  action, and close international coordination and cooperation to  remain in step with the criminals and to avoid losing the  battle. Above all else, the struggle requires knowledge,  commitment, and the willingness of the state and all national  sectors to achieve final victory.</p>

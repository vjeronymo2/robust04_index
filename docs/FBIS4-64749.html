			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["R. L."-initialed report: "The President -- One for All"] </F>   [Text] It was Herbert Wehner who once said mockingly  before a presidential election that the Germans would prefer to  have a Bishop Dr. von Hindenburg as president. These  expectations -- both comprehensive and contradictory -- have  obviously not changed, if one looks at our latest poll on the  elections.    According to this poll, the president should get involved  more in active policy (64 percent), should basically make the  interests of everyone a guideline of his actions (71 percent),  primarily try to come to an understanding on contentious issues  (68 percent), and, above all, tackle issues that affect the  future (69 percent). In eastern Germany the percentages are  generally higher than in the west: As many as 78 percent of the  eastern Germans hope for more involvement in active policy.    The idealized expectations placed on a head of state can be  interpreted as quite definite expectations on political  integration, which is carried out less and less by the  parliamentary mechanisms for quarrel and decisionmaking. In  addition, these high-flown claims are also a reflex reaction to  a certain "disenchantment with politics." And, of course, they  are a response to the extremely ambitious and extremely  satisfying way in which Richard von Weizsaecker has fulfilled  his office. No wonder that the majority of the voters advocate  a direct election of the president: A total of 80 percent of  all Germans want to elect the person on whom they place their  highest expectations, themselves.    The eastern Germans are once again more eager for  integration: 91 percent demand direct elections, compared with  77 percent in the west. The question in connection with  constitutional policy, namely whether such a mode of election  would conform with the architecture of the office as laid down  in the Basic Law, naturally does not appear in such polls.    Regarding the forthcoming election of Richard von  Weizsaecker's successor, all this results in tension between the  citizens' expectations and the parties' game for power.  Basically, the Germans want to vote themselves -- and if they  could do that, the majority would vote for Johannes Rau. If  four candidates are involved, Rau is ahead with 36 percent,  followed by Roman Herzog with 22 percent, Hildegard  Hamm-Bruecher with 14 percent, and Jens Reich with 5 percent.  If the election is narrowed down to two candidates -- Rau or  Herzog -- Rau gains an additional 18 percentage points and gets  54 percent; Herzog, on the other hand, only gets an additional 8  percent and manages to get 30 percent; in the east Rau would get  69 percent.    Certainly, the Basic Law deliberately did not make the  office  of president subject to popular vote. However, if Roman Herzog  were elected because of the all too obvious considerations of  party and coalition policy, this time clear tension would arise  between the mood in the population -- as regards the person and  the political process -- and the institutional mechanics.    However, some other observations are quite remarkable.  First: The voters are clearly turning away -- at least for the  presidential elections -- from the targets of the coalition and  party machinery; however, by doing that, the majority of them  come out in favor of a politician who has long worked in the  establishment; the offer of a candidate who is removed from the  parties did not catch on.    Second: The slogan that an eastern German must become  president did not catch on, either; even in the new laender only  12 percent are in favor of eastern German candidate Jens Reich  -- 3.5 times as many vote for Rau.    Third: Even though during the initial period of the election  campaign the Social Democrats -- and Rau in particular -- were  accused, also by Chancellor Kohl, of having betrayed Germany's  unity before 1989, in direct comparison 69 percent of the  eastern Germans vote for Social Democrat Rau -- more than 3.5  times as many as for Herzog (19 Percent).    All this refutation of myths also reflects a certain  "social-democratization" of eastern Germany -- or the  disappointment about the Christian Democratic Union/Christian  Social Union [CDU/CSU] and unification. When asked about the  parties' power of conviction, the Social Democratic Party of  Germany [SPD] gets 32 percent in the east, thus being ahead of  the CDU (19 percent) -- in the west the CDU/CSU is ahead of the  SPD for the first time: 26 to 25 percent.    A similar picture can be seen in connection with the  question  about the future chancellor: In the west, Scharping got 1  percentage point more than last time, thus reaching 38 percent;  Kohl is stagnating at 33 percent. The difference is not as  large as it used to be, but it is not becoming smaller, either.  In the east, Scharping is falling slightly behind, from 48 to  47 percent; Kohl is catching up, from 30 to 34 percent.    It may be that the elections will also be decided in the  east  in the very last instance, but the majority of the people live  in the west -- and in all new laender there are just as many  voters as in North Rhine-Westphalia, the land where Johannes Rau  comes from -- and where he will remain?    Infratest Burke polled 1,000 voters for DIE ZEIT. Those  polled were chosen through a representative sample (random  procedure). The poll took place from 18 to 25 April 1994.</p>

			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Mixed message for French right THE SWEEPING election victory of the French conservatives has delivered two contradictory messages, which could lead them to adopt two opposite strategies of government. The simple message is that the electorate has handed down a categoric rejection of the discredited Socialist party, and given the conservatives a licence to charge ahead with a populist right-wing programme, even if this involves getting into fights with the US over trade, with the Community over farm policy, and with President Mitterrand over his constitutional position. But there is a deeper message, less exhilarating for the right, which should prompt them to adopt a cautious and even a conciliatory posture. The case for caution is three-fold: the conservatives do not really have a popular mandate for a hard-line right-wing programme; they have not offered any rapid solutions for the country's economic problems, starting with the apparently inexorable rise in unemployment; and the electorate will not thank them if they gratuitously rush into a dead-end political crisis with France's trading partners, or an unnecessary constitutional crisis at home. The conservatives' popular base is more modest than their parliamentary majority would suggest. The collapse of the Socialist vote is almost wholly accounted for by the rise in the protest parties outside the governing mainstream, such as the extreme right-wing National Front and the ecologists. The conservatives' share of the ballot in the first round of this election - less than 40 per cent - was slightly smaller than in 1981, which must make it imprudent, therefore, for them to interpret a massive parliamentary majority as a massive popular mandate. Popular alienation This election thus confirms the existence of a strong under-current of popular alienation from the traditional parties of government, which first emerged in last year's regional elections. One factor is no doubt the Socialists' failure to stem the tide of unemployment; another is the tainting of the Socialist party by systematic involvement in corrupt financing practices. But the Socialists' fatal offence was to have succumbed to the arrogance of power. Like the Gaullists before them, the Socialists have systematically monopolised the patronage of the state, supping deep from the privilege of presidential power, and becoming increasingly remote from ordinary people. This is a direct consequence of a system where the authority of the president has progressively overshadowed that of government and parliament. There is a clear need for a rebalancing of the system in favour of parliament, and the modest constitutional reforms proposed by President Mitterrand could be a useful move in that direction. The conservatives' most acute dilemma is in economic policy. They subscribe to the same anti-inflationary objectives, and the same hard franc policy, as the Socialists. But there is an irreconcilable conflict in the short term between their need to bring down unemployment, and the deflationary effect of high German interest rates. They have promised a new initiative to accelerate Franco-German monetary co-operation. But if this fails to bring lower interest rates and the promise of faster growth, they will probably need to re-open the European debate on economic and monetary union. Guiding principles There is a danger that this dilemma will play into the hands of the populists and the anti-Europeans in the conservative coalition. In fact, the only sound general strategy for France is one centrally based on the European Community, on the liberal market economy, and on the key relationship with Germany. The best guarantee that these will continue to be the guiding principles of French policy will be the appointment of a prime minister who is prudent, pragmatic and reasonable. Speculation has suggested that Mr Mitterrand will choose Mr Edouard Balladur, the former finance minister, who said last week that the new government should be 'as open, as tolerant, and as respectful of others as possible'. Mr Balladur is not the only plausible candidate; but that is exactly the style of government which France needs at this delicate, and potentially unstable, point in its political history.</p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> NETS FINALLY REACH BEND IN THE ROAD, END SKID  </P> <P> Mookie Blaylock sank a baseline jumper with one second to play at Phoenix  Friday night and the New Jersey Nets' ordeal on the road was finally over.  </P> <P> The basket, which gave Blaylock 26 points, lifted the Nets to a 116-114  victory, ending a record 34-game road losing streak.  </P> <P> The Nets (3-9) didn't lack for persistence. They almost ended the streak, which  began Dec. 19, in the season opener at Philadelphia, losing when Derrick  Coleman was called for goaltending at the end of regulation play and the 76ers  won in overtime, 112-110.  </P> <P> The Nets ended their skid against a team that had lost only nine games at home  all last season.  </P> <P> Tom Chambers had a season high 39 points for Phoenix, but from the start the  Suns were in a battle. At one stage in the second quarter they trailed, 41-26.  </P> <P> Even when the Suns caught up early in the fourth quarter, the Nets didn't give  up.  </P> <P> Kevin Johnson sank two free throws with 10 seconds to play to make the score  114-114. Blaylock then dribbled the length of the court, turned on the right  baseline and swished the jumper. The Suns lost the ball on the inbounds pass in  their last possession.  </P> <P> Portland 143, Golden State 119 -- On the way to their 10th consecutive victory,  the unbeaten Trail Blazers ran into a problem at Portland. The speedy Warriors  led, 34-27, after 10 minutes.  </P> <P> Portland Coach Rick Adelman went with his small lineup, guards Danny Ainge,  Terry Porter and Clyde Drexler and forwards Buck Williams and Jerome Kersey.  </P> <P> With full-court pressure, this group turned the game around in a hurry. By  halftime, the Trail Blazers led, 76-52. The Warriors were never close in the  second half.  </P> <P> Detroit 97, Washington 88 -- On their way to two consecutive NBA championships,  the Pistons made defense their trademark.  </P> <P> In this game at Auburn Hills, Mich., the Pistons shut down the league's leading  scorer, Bernard King, who was averaging nearly 31 points. In 30 minutes he was  only five for 16 from the field and had only 11 points.  </P> <P> Indiana 112, Houston 111 -- The Pacers' Reggie Miller sank two free throws with  four seconds to play at Indianapolis.  </P> <P> Miller and Chuck Person gave the Pacers a one-two punch that overcame another  fine performance by Akeem Olajuwon. Miller had 35 points and Person had 33.  </P> <P> Olajuwon had 29 points and 16 rebounds and led the Rockets back from a 12-point  third-quarter deficit.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 111, Cleveland 105 -- There are times when no matter how well the  opposition plays, Charles Barkley won't let the 76ers lose.  </P> <P> It was one of those nights at Philadelphia. The Cavaliers played a strong game.  But Barkley was too much.  </P> <P> Barkley, 14 for 19 from the field, had 36 points, 12 rebounds, six assists and  four steals. In a 7-0 run after the Cavaliers took a 102-100 lead with two  minutes left, Barkley had four points, two rebounds and a steal.  </P> <P> Miami 116, Charlotte 100 -- The Hornets were beginning to believe they could  handle the other expansion teams. The Heat showed them it wasn't necessarily so  in this game at Charlotte.  </P> <P> With the score tied early in the fourth quarter, Kevin Edwards scored seven  consecutive points to trigger a 14-0 run.  </P> <P> San Antonio 107, Dallas 104 -- Paul Pressey's driving layup with 13 seconds  left at Dallas gave the Spurs the lead for the first time in the fourth quarter  and they held it.  </P> <P> David Robinson had 32 points and 13 rebounds for the Spurs.  </P> <P> Boston 115, Sacramento 105 -- While Larry Bird and Robert Parish spent most of  the game at Boston resting, rookie Dee Brown had 14 points in a reserve roll  for Boston.  </P> <P> Utah 97, Seattle 96 -- Karl Malone had 30 points and 12 rebounds at Salt Lake  City, but the Jazz almost blew a six-point lead in the last two minutes.  </P> <P> Utah led, 97-91, and didn't score again. The Sonics cut the lead to one and had  the ball, but Xavier McDaniel missed a 15-foot jumper at the finish. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

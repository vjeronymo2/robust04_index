			<p>BFN     [Text] RIGA, Apr 06, BNS - The Saimnieks (Master)  political association was created to participate in the coming  local governments elections, said Ziedonis Cevers, ex-interior  minister and president of the Drosiba (Security) foundation.    Saimnieks will nominate practical specialists who have  proved  their abilities in various spheres of life, Cevers told  reporters.    Cevers himself plans to run for Riga mayor.    BNS asked Cevers to name the priorities of Saimnieks'  economic program but he answered that the association was  established only recently and its programs are not ready yet.    Another leader of the new organization, President of the  Private Enterprise Association Valdis Krisbergs, told BNS that  the emphasis should be put on small and medium size business  development and welfare of people. Krisbergs characterized the  Latvian capital, Riga, as "the poorest and the most expensive  city in the world."    Other founders of Saimnieks are MPs Eriks Kaza, Ernests  Jurkans, actor Ivars Kalnins.</p>

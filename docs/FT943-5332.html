			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Bankers take a hard look at Ucatt account Among the concerns of trade union leaders this week will be Ucatt, the construction union which has been living beyond its means for years. Financial observers say that if it had been a private company it would have gone into liquidation long ago. The union has been struggling all year to sort out its finances amid persistent but erroneous rumours that it was bankrupt. In July the union reported it was spending Pounds 10,000 over its Pounds 1.4m overdraft facility with Unity Trust Bank, which is closely monitoring its cashflow on a monthly basis. The Pounds 48,000 of monthly union staff salaries were as much as the size of its bank charges. An internal report earlier this year by the union's accountants HW Fisher argued bluntly that Ucatt's structure was large enough to cover a membership of more than 250,000 while the total was down to 135,000 with only 74,000 paying full subscriptions. It suggested the union should consider whether it needed any regional offices at all, and be concerned at the 'low level of paying members' as well as their recruitment into membership. Ucatt forecast a 10 per cent drop in membership level this year. The original rescue plan for Ucatt proposed savings of Pounds 600,000 from staff redundancies, the sale of Pounds 650,000 of union properties and increasing membership subscriptions in 1995 generating an extra Pounds 240,000 inflow. The bank's own accountants, KPMG Peat Marwick, also carried out a study of Ucatt's finances that suggested the measures proposed in the original rescue plan would 'not lead to the union generating net positive cashflows until 1995'. The report warned that Ucatt's business plan would mean its borrowing would need to exceed its existing financial facilities with the bank by as much as Pounds 800,000. It said: 'During this period the security available to the bank diminishes. If the cash contingencies are included in the forecasts the deficit between borrowings, facility and available security are exacerbated.' KPMG concluded that: 'Unity Trust Bank is being asked to significantly increase its exposure to political loss. Viewed from a purely commercial perspective there is a very strong argument for the bank declining to provide any additional facility over and above that currently available. If such a decision were taken the ability of the union to continue in its current form is very doubtful.' The report recommended that a Pounds 200,000 cash contingency would have to be built into the union's assumptions both this year and next 'in view of the various uncertainties surrounding the achievement of the surplus'. A Ucatt spokesman said yesterday that the union was working effectively to repair its financial position. Yet the saving of Ucatt may well depend on a rapid takeover of its engagements by the TGWU, which itself has gone through a radical restructuring with the help of the bank.</p>

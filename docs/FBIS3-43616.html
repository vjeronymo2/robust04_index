			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Affairs Minister Venancio de Moura has said  that 1994 is a decisive year for this country's international  relations. To begin with, the Foreign Affairs Ministry will  seek to increase even further its diplomatic work in Africa and  other parts of the world and indications are that there are good  prospects for success.    [Begin Moura recording] Within that context, many meetings  are planned for Africa and other parts of the world. It is  worth noting that the OAU has some scheduled meetings, beginning  with one in February. There are also some planned visits by  foreign affairs ministers expected to visit us this year. We  have the summit of the heads of state of the Lusophone African,  PALOP, countries, preceded by a meeting of PALOP foreign  ministers. We have a meeting of our ambassadors, at which I am  sure we will be discussing issues pertaining to management,  competence, and the commitment of all to their diplomatic  duties, which they must discharge in an increasingly responsible  manner. The peace process must be defended, as must be the  interests and the property of the Angolan State. Abroad, we  must seek to project a dignified image of Angola. All those will  be issues to be discussed at that meeting, which is scheduled to  take place this year. We believe that this year is decisive for  us to show greater commitment on all fronts and a greater  dedication to the national cause so that peace can become our  principal objective as early as possible this year. [end  recording]    The People's Television of Angolan also asked Foreign  Minister Venancio de Moura to comment on a problem that has  prompted a protest by the Angolan Embassy in Lisbon. The  Angolan foreign minister noted that there is the need for great  understanding for the benefit of relations between the two  countries.    [Begin Moura recording] It is not the first time that this  happens. We have been receiving reports and we have been using  the most appropriate channels to urge the Portuguese authorities  to behave in a manner compatible with this kind of situation,  considering that we share historic and privileged relations and  that there are norms to be followed in relations between two  sovereign states, notably with regard to reciprocity and mutual  advantages.    We have tried to attend to Portuguese citizens whose  presence  in Angola is often irregular, so we would not like our  compatriots and, in particular, Angolan citizens who are senior  government officials and their families to be expelled or  humiliated because of the poor understanding -- I think it has  to do with poor understanding -- and sometimes even the  subjective approach of some functionaries in the Portuguese  Immigration and Border Services Department. Those people enjoy  immunities and privileges. Our consulate has also made some  contacts in a bid to request greater understanding on the part  of the Portuguese authorities and to ask for measures to be  taken to prevent similar situations arising again. Should our  requests not be heeded, obviously we shall have to start  considering the implementation of one of the principles listed  in the Geneva Convention and which have to do with reciprocity.

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / International Company News: Shake-up at O&amp;K after takeover of Hoesch THE FUTURE of Orenstein &amp; Koppel (O&amp;K), one of the most famous names in German engineering, has been resolved after months of uncertainty caused by the takeover of Hoesch, its parent company. Plans to reorganise O&amp;K will be unveiled tomorrow in Dortmund, a week after Hoesch shareholders gave the green light to the takeover by Krupp, its German steel rival. Fried Krupp Hoesch-Krupp is to retain the 75 per cent stake in O&amp;K previously held by Hoesch. The remaining shares are widely held and publicly quoted in Germany. O&amp;K will lose its heavy plant and systems division, which will be combined with its counterpart at Krupp. This could lead to rationalisation in the combined plant businesses, which overlap heavily. The deal unites the world's two dominant producers of equipment such as large bucket-wheel excavators used in open cast mining. O&amp;K will be left as a producer of excavators, loaders and other equipment used in construction and mining, and as a big producer of escalators. The resolution of O&amp;K's future comes after months of negotiations involving Krupp, Hoesch, Mannesmann - the German engineering and electronics group, its Mannesmann Demag heavy equipment business, and O&amp;K itself. Demag and O&amp;K came very close to a co-operation deal in construction equipment, but talks broke down about a month ago. Mr Brian Brock, managing director of O&amp;K Orenstein &amp; Koppel in the UK, said the end of the uncertainty was a great relief. O&amp;K's construction and mining equipment business has been under pressure for many years, due partly to the industry's overcapacity but also to losses in the mining division. Mr Brock said he was convinced O&amp;K had a future as an independent entity with its new, financially-strong parent.</p>

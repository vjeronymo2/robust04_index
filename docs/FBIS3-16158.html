			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Agita Berzina: "U.S. Policy Toward Latvia Has </F> Not Changed"]    [Text] Riga, 5 Mar -- Today, Minister of Foreign Affairs  Georgs Andrejevs met with Ints Silins, the Ambassador of the  United States to Latvia, to express his incomprehension  regarding U.S. State Secretary Christopher Warren's statement at  the session of the Senate's sub-committee on 2 March, the  Foreign Affairs Ministry press service announced. As DIENA  already reported, W. Christopher had pointed out in his  statement that, in his opinion, Russia can undertake activities  aimed "at stimulating Latvians" in the direction of broadening  the circle of citizens and granting voting rights to the  Russians residing in Latvia. During today's conversation, G.  Andrejevs expressed his incomprehension and anxiety over such  utterances from a high-level American official. In his reply,  I. Silins explained that they refer entirely to the inhabitants  of Latvia who are Russians by nationality. He also said that Mr.  Christopher meant for lawful and democratic methods to be used  by Latvia's Russians in persuading Latvians to take their  interests into account.    Summarizing, I. Silins emphasized that the principal policy  of the United States toward Latvia has not changed.</p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Gas in demand The see-saw performance by British Gas shares over recent sessions continued yesterday with further dividend upgrades by some of the market's leading broking houses driving the shares sharply better and recapturing most of the fall that followed Thursday's important strategy meeting. At the close Gas shares, again the heaviest individual traded stock in the market, were 8 1/2 higher at 298 1/2 p on turnover of 15m. Firmer oil prices, plus Talk of renewed US and domestic buying interest helped BP move up 6 1/2 to 399 1/2 p on 11m traded. Shell, still helped by the recent upgrade by Nomura, jumped 11 1/2 to 698 1/2 p.</p>

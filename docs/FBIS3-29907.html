Some 900 exhibitors from 35  countries are taking part in the week-long air show at the  Changi International Exhibition and Convention Center.    Opening the show, Deputy Prime Minister Brigadier General  Lee  Hsien Loong, urged the local aerospace industry to look beyond  the confines of its home industry. He noted that Singapore has  benefited from the rapid growth in aviation in the region.    Last year, investment commitments in the industry here grew  by over 40 percent to 163 million [Singapore] dollars. Gen. Lee  said Singapore will continue to service the region as one stop  center for aerospace services. It will also continue to play  its role in developing the regional aviation market and aviation  infrastructure.    Gen. Lee however, noted that one potential obstacle to the  growth of the industry would be infrastructure bottlenecks,  especially insufficient airport capacity. He said newly  developing economies like Vietnam and China will need to upgrade  airport management, air traffic capabilities, and to build new  airports as traffic volume expanded.    Gen. Lee said economic liberalization in the region would  create more growth and business opportunities for the aerospace  industry.</p>

			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Environmental Management (10): Debate rages on liability / Review of the problem of contaminated land Cleaning up contaminated land has emerged as one of the toughest problems in environmental management. Developed countries, particularly those such as Britain, with a long industrial history, have tens of thousands of sites which have been contaminated over the years with waste and hazardous materials. Even leaving aside the technical difficulties, the question of who should pay the enormous costs involved is an important issue for many countries. Although 'the polluter pays' is the widely adopted principle, it fails to provide a complete answer because the polluter may be long dead, or untraceable. And while public opinion may be clamouring for sites to be cleaned up and the polluter punished, the business community has begun to fight back because it fears the bill will land on its doorstep. Earlier this year, the UK government was forced to drop plans for a register of contaminated land because of opposition from business and property owners who feared it would have a devastating effect on land values. The US launched an assault on the problem with its 1980 Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (Cercla), or Superfund programme. This provides the government with money to clean up sites and pursue polluters. But although the programme was supposed to prevent disputes about responsibility from delaying clean-up work, the result has been rather the opposite. Fewer than 100 sites have been cleaned up - but a lot of money has been spent on legal argument. The Clinton Administration is now preparing to re-authorise the Superfund, so the debate about environmental liability is likely to be revived in the US. In Europe, the Council of Europe drew up a convention on environmental liability earlier this year, but several countries (including the UK) declined to sign it because they thought it too sweeping in scope. The focus has now switched to a green paper from the European Commission on civil liability for environmental damage, which has also caused widespread controversy. The paper proposes a strict liability regime which would be harmonised across the community. This would be linked to a compensation plan for cases where the polluter cannot be identified. The paper has upset a wide swathe of the business and financial community, which fears that owners of land could be held responsible for damage caused by previous owners. Opposition is particularly strong in the UK, which has a different legal tradition from continental countries. Mr Tim Yeo, the UK's environment minister, pledged in a recent speech to British bankers that the government would oppose the directive in its present form. 'No evidence has been provided to support claims that EU action in this area would deliver any additional environmental benefits at all in the UK.' Mr John Garbutt, head of the planning and environment unit at Nicholson Graham &amp; Jones, a City of London law firm, says: 'It would establish a level of liability which we don't accept in this country.' Banks are particularly worried that they could be sued for environmental damage caused by their borrowers. These fears date back to the late 1980s, when a US court ruled that a bank could be liable where there was evidence that it was in a position to influence the way a client disposed of hazardous waste. Although the Environment Protection Agency subsequently issued a regulation which annulled this ruling, that action is now being challenged in the US courts. 'The position is still unsettled,' said a spokesman for the American Bankers Association, which is urging Congress to pass fresh legislation to clarify the issue once and for all. In Brussels the Federation Bancaire, which represents the EU's banks, has warned the Commission against going down the Superfund route, and has asked for special exemptions for banks. Some of the insurance industry's anxiety about pollution claims in the UK was eased with an important House of Lords ruling earlier this month in the long running Eastern Counties Leather case. The tanning company had been found liable by a lower court for polluting the local water supply with a solvent and told to pay the water company's costs even though the spillages ceased in 1976 and the applicable EC directive did not require compliance until 1985. But the law lords said the tannery could not have 'reasonably foreseen' at the time that it used the solvent that the spillages would lead to any environmental hazards. The ruling was widely welcomed because it averted the danger that the concept of retrospective liability would be introduced into English law. Even if the issue of liability can be settled by redrafting appropriate laws, the question of who should pay, where the original polluter cannot be traced, remains a heated issue. Environmentalist organisations such as Greenpeace have put forward proposals for a special tax on 'dirty' industries which would be used to fund a clean-up campaign. The EU green paper proposes a compensation fund which would be financed by a levy on industry. But as Mr Tom Handler of the international law firm Baker &amp; McKenzie says: 'How do you define the industries?' In Germany, which has a special problem with its formerly communist eastern region, the early purchasers of property there were exempted from liability for any environmental damage caused by the property in the past. In the UK, several laws and agencies already address the issue of clean-ups. But the government is currently conducting a review after the failure of its contaminated land register plan. The CBI has been arguing that the cost of cleaning up past pollution should be borne by a partnership of private and public sector money, but with increased emphasis on state and EU regeneration grants. However, Mr Yeo was careful in his speech to bankers not to commit the government to footing the clean-up bill. 'Deciding what the liability should be and where it should fall - on the polluter, the owner or the state - is not easy. There is no simple solution and it may be that different provisions should apply in different situations. However, no one has the right to be regarded as a special case.'</p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Clinton to compromise over budget PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's deficit reduction package is now expected to pass the US Senate under a compromise plan involving a smaller tax rise and larger spending cuts. Passage of the budget bill will help Mr Clinton's efforts to put his presidency back on track after recent upheavals. In an effort to reassert himself politically, the president yesterday braved a hostile demonstration by war veterans when he spoke at a Memorial Day ceremony at the Vietnam war monument in Washington. With boos sounding all around him, Mr Clinton said America must 'regain control of its destiny' and of its economy. 'Let us keep the American dream alive,' he said. Earlier, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, chairman of the Senate finance committee, said the Clinton administration would agree to a deficit-reduction compromise that might mean cuts in Medicare, the government's healthcare programme for the elderly. Senator David Boren, an Oklahoma Democrat who had joined with Republicans to oppose a proposed energy tax, said the chances had improved 'by about 100 per cent that we're going to be able to work out an agreement'. The senator is another key member of the finance committee, through which the legislation will pass. Senator Robert Dole, the Republican leader, said if the president agreed to 'eliminate some of the spending, eliminate some of the taxes and find some new spending cuts, then it might attract some Republicans'. However, he predicted that the president would alter his proposals enough to get sufficient Democrat votes for passage without having to appeal to Republicans for support. Those in Washington public life welcomed the news that Mr Clinton was bringing on to his senior staff Mr David Gergen, a Republican, in order to stem a series of White House mishaps. In his Memorial Day address Mr Clinton called for a healing of the divisions in American society, obliquely referring to protesters' complaints that he did not 'belong' at the Vietnam memorial because he had avoided the draft. It was, he said, 'a day to put aside differences  - a day to reflect on what unites us'. Mr Clinton was the first president to speak at the memorial. Although one poll said 67 per cent of Americans approved of the gesture, protesters held up signs reading 'For Shame' and 'Hypocrite'. Mr Gergen, a columnist and television commentator appointed at the weekend as White House communications director, advised presidents Ford and Reagan, and served the latter when he had his greatest victories in Congress. Senator Sam Nunn, a Georgia Democrat who has frequently been at odds with the president, said the appointment was 'one of the best moves I've seen him make in a long time'.

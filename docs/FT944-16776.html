			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Pools win jackpot concessions The government yesterday spelled out concessions to football pools operators, including a partial right to rollover jackpots when there is no outright winner. The number of jackpots the football pools operators will be able to roll over will, however, be dictated by the number of rollovers in the National Lottery which will be launched next month. It is believed that the Department of National Heritage argued for such limits to protect the lottery from pools competition. When there is no overall winner in the National Lottery and the main prize, which could be about Pounds 2m, is rolled over to the following week, the pools companies get a 'rollover credit'. If there is no pools jackpot winner the pools companies can use the credit to roll over the weekly jackpot - up to Pounds 750,000 for Vernons and Pounds 2m for Littlewoods - within a six-month time limit. Mr Malcolm Hughes, managing director of Vernons, said last night: 'Obviously we are delighted at the movement in the direction of liberalising the rules. It is still not the complete deregulation we anticipated when rollovers were promised.' The order bringing the changes into effect also reduces the age limit for those able to play the football pools from 18 to 16. Newsagents, shops and betting offices will also be able to act as agents for the pools companies for the first time. Pools companies will be watching to see what effect the launch of the National Lottery has on their business and may yet return to the government to seek further concessions. Mr Michael Forsyth, Home Office minister, said yesterday that the right to hand football coupons in to local retail outlets 'will provide the small shop with the chance to benefit from an extra source of revenue'. National Lottery tickets will be available at about 10,000 outlets at its launch, a network that will grow to more than 35,000.</p>

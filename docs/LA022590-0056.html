			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHORTAGES HURT COASTAL PANEL, ANALYST SAYS;  </P> <P> BUDGET: THE LEGISLATURE IS TOLD THAT A LACK OF FUNDS AND PERSONNEL IS HAMPERING  THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION IN PROTECTING THE COASTLINE.  </P> <P> The mission of the California Coastal Commission to protect the state's  coastline is being hampered by a lack of money and manpower, said Elizabeth  Hill, state legislative analyst.  </P> <P> "Our analysis indicates that the commission has significantly fewer resources  to devote to regulatory activities today than it did eight years ago," Hill  told the Legislature last week.  </P> <P> Hill, the Legislature's nonpartisan budget adviser, made the comments as part  of her review of the $53.7-billion state budget proposed for the 1990-91 fiscal  year by Gov. George Deukmejian, who has held office for seven of those eight  years.  </P> <P> When adjusted for inflation, Hill said, the commission's proposed $6.2-million  budget is actually $2 million less than it was in 1982-83. And she noted that  the commission's work force has been cut from 170 to 110 in the last eight  years, a 35% reduction.  </P> <P> Hill painted a grim picture of commission operations, including delays in  certifying local coastal programs, a backlog of potential violations that need  to be investigated and a high volume of work per staff member.  </P> <P> But a spokesman for Deukmejian defended the governor's tight-fisted approach  toward the panel.  </P> <P> Tom Beermann, the governor's deputy press secretary, said Deukmejian, a  longtime critic of the commission, would still like to see the commission  abolished.  </P> <P> "He believes that decisions affecting land use along the coast should be  carried out by those individuals who are directly responsible to the electorate  in that area," Beermann said. "And the coastal commission is not responsible to  the electorate."  </P> <P> Planners have pointed to a noticeable strain on resources in the commission's  office in Long Beach, the governor's hometown. It is the busiest of the coastal  commission offices and oversees coastal development in Los Angeles and Orange  counties.  </P> <P> "Our (building) permit load has increased from about 800 five years ago to more  than 1,200 a year now, at the same time the number of staff planners has been  reduced from 13 to 9," said Gary Timm, a planner in the Long Beach office.  </P> <P> The Long Beach office has vacancies for two planners, but officials say the  jobs are difficult to fill because qualified candidates, mindful of the  commission's endangered status, are hesitant to apply for a job that may not  last.  </P> <P> Such staff shortages have left the commission vulnerable to criticism, both  from developers, who complain about delays in their projects being approved,  and environmentalists and slow-growth advocates, who say some projects drag so  long that it is difficult to sustain opposition.  </P> <P> In addition to personnel shortages, commission staffers complain of a lack of  modern office equipment. For example, at the panel's San Francisco  headquarters, workers still use a rotary phone system that frequently breaks  down.  </P> <P> "It got to the point where I finally just bought my own touch telephone at the  office," said Jack Liebster, the agency's public information officer.  </P> <P> Presumably, the telephone problem will be relieved because the commission is  expected to relocate its main office this spring. But the commission will have  to absorb at least $200,000 annually for increased rent, "effectively resulting  in another reduction in funds," Hill said.  </P> <P> Moreover, none of the commission's permit application files are accessible by  computer, meaning that staffers and the public must search through index cards  for information on any of the thousands of commission actions over the years.  </P> <P> Although a 1983 amendment to the state Coastal Act called for the creation of a  Coastal Resource Information Center, which would be a computerized system  tracking coastal development, staffers say the Legislature never allocated  funds for it. "Even if we could afford to develop the software, there's no  money to buy hardware," said Jim Burns, the agency's chief deputy director.  </P> <P> Hill's report on the conditions facing the commission met with a mixed reaction  from lawmakers.  </P> <P> Several Democrats welcomed her assessment but said that until a new governor is  elected in November there is not much that can be done to boost the  commission's budget.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles) predicted that whoever becomes  governor will do a better job than Deukmejian of protecting the coastline. "I  don't think anyone can do worse for the coast," Friedman said.  </P> <P> But Assemblyman Gerald N. Felando (R-San Pedro) maintained that the commission  has exceeded the scope of its original authority -- preserving access to the  coast. He said many of the commission's activities, such as monitoring oil  spills, were never envisioned for the panel.  </P> <P> "If they had stuck to what they were originally formed to do, their budget and  staff is adequate," Felando maintained.  </P> <P> Steve MacElvaine of Morro Bay, a Deukmejian appointee to the panel, said the  commission was set up to certify local coastal programs and then turn over  permitting of projects and enforcement to local authorities. MacElvaine, saying  he was speaking just for himself and not the commission, said the reason for  the work backlog is that local city coastal programs have not been completed.  </P> <P> MacElvaine contended that much of the staff's time is occupied with dealing  with permits for grading in the Santa Monica Mountains and the construction of  tennis courts or decks. But, he said, if local governments had completed their  own coastal plans, these decisions would usually be heard by local authorities  and not the commission.  </P> <P> Gladstone reported from Sacramento and Russell from Santa Monica.  </P></p>

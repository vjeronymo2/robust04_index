			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: NOTES ABOUT YOUR SURROUNDINGS.  </P> <P> MUSHROOMS: The Los Angeles Mycological Society has a couple of activities  planned for the county in the coming week. On Saturday, the group will hold a  "fungus foray" into the Rancho Mission Viejo area. The purpose of the trip,  which is open to the public, is to collect mushrooms for display at the wild  mushroom fair to be held the next day, Feb. 12, at the Museum of Natural  History and Science in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> The fair will run from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and will include displays,  demonstrations and lectures on common Southern California fungi. At 11 a.m.,  Mike Wells of the Oregon Mycological Society, co-editor of "Wild Mushroom  Cookery," will give a step-by-step demonstration on the cultivation of oyster  mushrooms. For $3, participants can take home a specially treated "log" that  will sprout the edible mushrooms.  </P> <P> At 2 p.m., Wells will give a cooking demonstration using wild mushrooms. A  50-cent ticket will allow participants to taste the samples. Admission to the  fair itself is $2, free for children under 12.  </P> <P> The public is invited to bring wild mushrooms to the fair for identification.  The museum is at 2627 Vista del Oro. For information on the fair, call (714)  640-7120; for information on the Saturday foray, call (213) 292-1900.  </P> <P> Locally, wild mushrooms can be found in the days following a rain. The best  places to look are in the county's hills and canyons, especially under tree  canopies and in meadows.  </P></p>

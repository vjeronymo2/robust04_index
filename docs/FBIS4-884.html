			<p>BFN     [Text] Representatives of the Malian Government and the  Azaouad united movements and fronts meeting in Tamanrasset  agreed yesterday evening to postpone discussion of the issue of  the enumeration of Azaouad combatants who are to be integrated  into the Malian security forces. It should be recalled that  this issue has remained a thorny point of disagreement between  the two sides.    In the opinion of observers in Tamanrasset, Algerian  diplomatic intervention has allowed the proceedings of the  committee to follow up implementation of the Bamako agreement,  which is currently taking place in Tamanrasset in the far south  of Algeria, to get under way.</p>

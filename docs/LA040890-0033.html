			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALL STREET  </P> <P> Q &amp; A  </P> <P> Q: My favorite stock is Galveston-Houston. It's a turnaround situation and has  made a big move percentage-wise this past year. I'm wondering what the pros  think of its prospects. -- Oceanport, N.J.  </P> <P> A: Galveston-Houston, a Houston-based manufacturer of actuators and replacement  parts for earth moving machinery, has to be one of the quietest success stories  of the past six months. The stock is trading at about $6 a share -- better than  twice its price level of last fall.  </P> <P> Why? Analysts -- only two follow the company -- say a recent North Sea oil  platform disaster prompted the British government to order the installation of  automatic safety valves on pipelines and platforms. That has greatly expanded  the demand for Galveston-Houston's actuators, which lie at the heart of  equipment-control systems.  </P> <P> Fred Mills of Lovett Underwood, Neuhaus &amp; Webb, a Houston-based brokerage  firm, believes that the stock could appreciate 20% a year over the near term.  He's predicting earnings growth to 46 cents a share in the current year, and at  least a dime better than that in 1991.  </P> <P> The company earned just 24 cents a share last year. And that 20% growth in the  stock's price, says Mills, presumes that nothing else happens to cause an  increased demand for the company's products. The large number of petrochemical  plants now being constructed could be the company's ace in the hole that'll  keep Galveston-Houston's stock humming.  </P> <P> Institutional Brokers Estimate System's computer over at Lynch, Jones &amp;  Ryan shows that the two analysts following Galveston-Houston have increased  their earnings estimate by nearly 19% in the past few months.  </P> <P> Q: I own 1,800 shares of Canadian Marconi Co., listed on the American Stock  Exchange. The stock has reached an all-time low. I have profits in this. What  should I do? -- Roseto, Pa.  </P> <P> A: Here's what one analyst, who for obvious reasons didn't want to be  identified, said about Canadian Marconi's stock: "It's not going anywhere. It's  dead money."  </P> <P> Because of Canadian Marconi's heavy reliance on government (especially U.S.  government) defense spending, the company's revenue and profit picture aren't  likely to improve much. That's the downside, so to speak, of reduced military  tensions around the world. Canadian Marconi's biggest problem is with a radio  that it has been selling to the U.S. Army. That radio -- the GRC 103 -- was hot  stuff at one time. But it has cooled off and so too have Canadian Marconi's  profits.  </P> <P> According to IBES, Canadian Marconi was forecast to have earned between 80  cents and $1.10 (Canadian) a share in the year that ended March 31. The average  estimate was 93 cents. That doesn't compare very favorably to the $1.02 a share  that the company earned in its previous fiscal year. Right now, analysts are  predicting that profits will be between 95 cents and $1.30 a share for the year  that ends in 1992.  </P> <P> Q: In 1987, my husband purchased an annuity through E. F. Hutton. The insurance  company issuing the annuity was First Capital Life Insurance Co. in La Jolla.  We called Weiss Research Inc., and it rated First Capital Life as very poor. We  were quite upset.  </P> <P> Our broker, however, says the company has a good rating. We can draw out the  money, minus a 3% penalty. Or we can draw up to 10% annually without a penalty.  We also have money in certificates of deposits and zero-coupon bonds. My  husband is 54 years old. Neither of us likes to gamble. What should we do? --  Rougon, La.  </P> <P> A: Michael Smith, a top New York financial planner, says it would be fine to  keep the annuity. While First Capital Life isn't a top-rated insurance company,  it looks safe. But Smith, who runs Michael F. Smith Associates, thinks that you  would do better by taking the 10% out of the annuity each year and diversifying  your portfolio into a "broad-based common stock mutual fund."  </P> <P> "I feel they have everything in fixed-income investments generating a return  that is currently OK but doesn't protect them against inflation," says Smith.  "And they are young at 54."  </P> <P> "You might even consider taking part of the CD money, once it matures, and also  putting it into a high-quality stock fund," says Smith. At this point in your  lives, Smith thinks that 30% to 40% of your assets should be in common stock.  JOHN CRUDELE  </P></p>

			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Leading Article: America's choice THE NEXT three weeks promise to be decisive for the future of global free trade. Will the world's trading powers be able to proceed down the home stretch towards an agreement in the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade? Or will they have to brace themselves for an escalation of bilateral trade conflicts that could poison international relations and impair world economic growth? An initial answer may come on November 17, when the US House of Representatives votes on whether to ratify the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) between the US, Canada and Mexico. Technically, the Nafta vote is quite separate from the wider Uruguay round negotiations; in practice, the two are intimately connected. If President Bill Clinton fails to prevail over Nafta's opponents - an alliance of trade unionists, environmentalists and protectionists - he will be so weakened that he will have little chance of gaining approval for the concessions needed to secure a Gatt agreement. If he wins, he can choose to press ahead with concluding the Uruguay round by the deadline of mid-December, when his 'fast-track' negotiating mandate expires. The good news is that after months of hesitation Mr Clinton has finally come out fighting for Nafta with a series of campaigning speeches for the agreement and an increasingly sophisticated lobbying effort aimed at congressional waverers. As a result it is beginning to look as if the balance is tipping in his favour. Although Nafta could still be derailed by the election of a new Canadian government, which claims to be committed to renegotiating it, the US appears confident that Ottawa's ire is directed more at its existing free-trade agreement with the US than at the new deal which will supersede it. Of course, Mr Clinton's efforts to secure Nafta come at a price. Sceptics in Europe and elsewhere note that the US has lately taken a harder line over the Gatt, withholding further tariff concessions, raising the stakes over financial services with east Asian countries and refusing to mollify the European Community over farm trade. They wonder whether Washington might, having secured Nafta, be tempted to spurn the multilateral negotiations in search of bilateral pacts with the Asian countries whose leaders Mr Clinton is to meet in Seattle on November 19. They should withhold judgment, at least for a time. Mr Clinton's current negotiating posture may be more form than substance. There is no reason why freer North American or Asian trade should do anything other than complement America's commitment to the Uruguay round, while serving the useful purpose of concentrating recalcitrant minds in the EC. It is in everyone's interest that he secure Nafta. Then, if he is wise, he will decide it is in America's interest to complete the new multilateral trading framework that the world so badly needs.</p>

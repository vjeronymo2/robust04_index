			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Scotland poised to win Dollars 1bn microchip factory Scotland is poised to win a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) Japanese investment which will make it the site for one of the world's most advanced semiconductor plants. NEC, the biggest chip maker after Intel of the US, is expected to build a factory next to its plant at Livingston near Edinburgh, creating 1,000 jobs on top of the 900 it already has there. Although the Tokyo company would not confirm the decision last night, NEC is understood to favour a European expansion rather than an addition to its operations in Roseville, California, the other front-runner. 'We have an enormous facility in the US and so are looking at ways of spreading production around,' an NEC official said. 'Livingston has a workforce skilled in high-density semiconductors and is strategically well-placed in Europe.' British and US authorities have both been keen to secure the investment. Although California has been hampered by its tougher regulations on air and water pollution, the decision also depended on the incentives on offer. California is likely to fight a rearguard action, with incentives to rival those offered by the Scottish Office. However, the availability of utilities as well as environmental permits are believed to be the most important issue for NEC in its decision on where to locate the new plant, with economic incentives playing very much a secondary role. The outlet will be modelled on NEC's latest plant in Kyushu, Japan, and will produce memory chips. Initial output will be 16-megabit and 64-megabit chips, honed from eight-inch silicon wafers, the largest the world electronics industry has been able to employ on a commercial basis. NEC expects world chip demand to grow by as much as 15 per cent this year. It is anxious to expand foreign production not only because of the high value of the yen but also to reduce exposure to Japanese suppliers of chip components.</p>

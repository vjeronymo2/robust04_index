An incredible bargain. Rooms for about $45 U.S. including breakfast.  Full pension available for slightly more (about $20). The hotel is family-run  and the staff is professional and wonderful! A huge swimming pool. The view is  spectacular as the hotel overlooks the sea. Other rooms nearby are three times  the price. Praiano is a great place to rest and relax. A small, quiet town. For  those who want more excitement, there are plenty of nearby places. I'm planning  a return trip."  </P> <P> Having been to Praiano, I agree with Kathleen Nizro. A real bargain hotel along  one of the world's romantic coastlines. Hotel Tramonto D'Oro: 40 rooms with  bath, telephone, private balcony. Open year-round. See your travel agent or  write to Hotel Tramonto D'Oro, via Gennaro Capriqline 119, 84010 Praiano,  Costiera Amalfiana, Italy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Skiers  </P> <P> For skiers on a budget, try Sunrise Resort Lodge in eastern Arizona.

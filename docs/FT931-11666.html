			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Russia aims to make free market 'irreversible' THE Russian government will this month try to make the free market system 'irreversible' by greatly extending the system of mass privatisation auctions throughout the country. Around 300 medium-sized or large enterprises in 41 regions of Russia are scheduled to be privatised through voucher auctions over the next six weeks. The sales include 10-15 very large companies with 10,000-plus workers each. If successful, these auctions will raise the tempo of sales considerably, from 11 in December and around 25 in January. The exercise, which should involve up to 5,000 large enterprises in the course of this year, is the largest sell-off of state assets ever attempted and is being seen as central to overall reform under way in Russia. Mr Anatoly Chubais, the Russian deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation, said at the World Economic Forum in Davos yesterday that he expected 'fierce political battles' with communists and their supporters in parliament over the reforms, but millions of people now supported the programme. 'I believe we won the privatisation process in 1992 and if we win only part of what we want to do in 1993, it will be enough to make the whole process irreversible for all time,' he said. Russian citizens have been sceptical about sales, reflected in low prices for the privatisation vouchers. Nearly all of Russia's 150m population have received one voucher, each of which has a nominal value of Rbs10,000 and can be exchanged for shares. However, in the secondary markets, where it is estimated that 20-30 per cent of voucher holders are selling their vouchers immediately, prices obtained are only Rbs4,000-Rbs5,000. Money raised from the sales is split between central and local government and the companies themselves. The Russian government more than doubled gas prices for industrial and household consumers yesterday in an effort to bring energy prices closer to world levels. Industrial users will pay Rbs3,600 per 1,000 cubic metres, up from a maximum of Rbs1,600. Household users will pay Rbs600 per 1,000 cu m, up from Rbs216. Gas industry officials said the price rise was to cover investment needs.</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Observer: Alms and the man Acts of God having played a fairly significant part in the dismal saga of Lloyd's, it is appropriate that a brush with the monastic life seems to be becoming an accepted form of management training for exposure to the insurance market. Lloyd's chief executive Peter Middleton came to the market with no knowledge of insurance, but was equipped no doubt with a certain discipline garnered from his oft-remarked four years with a French monastic order in Devon. Among the new vehicles revving on the starting pads after the membership of Lloyd's insurance market voted in their favour on Wednesday evening is Corporate Membership. Its managing director, Anthony Hamilton, spent a summer considering donning the habit at a Franciscan monastery at Cerne Abbas in Dorset. Middleton admits to not having been a very good monk; Hamilton says he was after 'broader horizons'. The latter went on to study comparative religion at Edinburgh University, somehow convincing the Ministry of Defence to sponsor the endeavour. 'If you want to understand military strategy, the Old Testament is as good a starting point as any,' says Hamilton, who spent 10 years in the Grenadier Guards before setting up in management consultancy. From there it was but a short step to Number One Lime Street. A Name for many years, but not one reduced to sack cloth, having cut back his exposure in the mid-1980s just when the allure of earthly riches seemed brightest, Hamilton is now taking his begging bowl around personal contacts in his endeavour to raise Pounds 20m in share capital for his latest venture.</p>

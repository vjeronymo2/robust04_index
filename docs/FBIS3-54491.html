			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The ECO session was concluded in Tehran this morning  after two days of dicussions. The session's final communique  shows that the member countries have reached comprehensive  agreements on various issues. Our correspondent, who attended  the very lengthy closing session, reports:    [Unidentified correspondent] According to the official  agenda, originally the session was to issue its final communique  at 1900 yesterday. However, due to existence of different  points of view expressed by the members, the communique was not  ratified until 0600 this morning, thus the session was in effect  extended by 12 hours.    We can explain this delay in the light of the speeches made  earlier by the participants. Later on, each of the speakers  were seeking to incorporate in the final communique their points  of view vis-a-vis the overriding national issues in their  respective countries. A great deal of the session's time was  thereby taken by this process. Nonetheless, the participants  seemed satisfied with the debates since they had been able to  put forward their problems and issues. [passage omitted]    In general, however, one's impression of the two-day session  was that the participants as a whole were satisfied with the  session's decisions. In my conversations with the participants,  including Shemshad Ahmad, the ECO secretary general, I learned  that they were happy with the session's outcome.    At the end of the session, I asked Mr. Velayati to remark on  the outcome of the session, even though he was very tired.    [Begin Velayati recording] One of the most important  decisions adopted in the session was to call the next 10 years  the decade of communication and transport. In view of the need  to carry out infrastructural works in order to facilitate  economic development and pave the way for all-embracing  cooperation, activities in the areas of communications and  transport are fundamentally important. The transport ministers  of ECO member countries recently met in Almaty, and as far as we  know, ECO members pay special attention to this sphere. It was,  nonetheless, decided that national projects should be formulated  and implemented in harmony with ECO's general communications  plans and projects. This is particularly significant in view of  the fact that the majority of ECO member countries do not have  any maritime borders, hence the importance of developing  communication and transport networks.

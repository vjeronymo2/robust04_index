Section 514(c)(9)(E) was added to the Code by section 10214 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, Pub. L. 100&hyph;203, and was amended by section 2004(h) of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100&hyph;647.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 25, 1990, Notice 90&hyph;41, 1990&hyph;1 C.B. 350, was published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin to provide interim guidance regarding the application of section 514(c)(9)(E) of the Code and to request comments. On December 30, 1992, the IRS published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (57 FR 62266) (the proposed regulations) regarding section 514(c)(9)(E). The preamble to that notice contains an explanation to the proposed rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The IRS received written comments on the proposed regulations, but cancelled a public hearing scheduled for March 31, 1993, because no one requested to testify. After consideration of all the public comments on the proposed regulations, the regulations are adopted as revised by this Treasury decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Explanation of Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Statutory Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 511 of the Code provides that tax-exempt organizations are generally taxable on their unrelated business taxable income. Section 514(a) provides that unrelated business taxable income includes a specified percentage of the gross income derived from debt-financed property described in section 514(b). Section 514(c)(9) provides an exception for income derived from certain debt-financed investments in real property by qualified organizations. Under section 514(c)(9)(C), qualified organizations include educational organizations described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii) and their affiliated support organizations, and qualified trusts described in section 401.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a qualified organization (QO) invests in debt-financed real property through a partnership in which one or more (but not all) of the partners are qualified organizations, the QO is eligible for the exception provided in section 514(c)(9) only if the partnership satisfies an additional requirement. Either each allocation to a partner that is a qualified organization must be a qualified allocation within the meaning of section 168(h)(6), or the partnership must satisfy the requirements of section 514(c)(9)(E). These regulations provide rules governing the application of section 514(c)(9)(E).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> II. Overview of the Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To satisfy the requirements of section 514(c)(9)(E), a partnership must establish that the allocation of items to any partner that is a QO cannot result in that partner having a percentage share of overall partnership income for any taxable year greater than that partner's percentage share of overall partnership loss for the taxable year for which that partner's percentage loss share will be the smallest (that partner's fractions rule percentage). This requirement, commonly referred to as the fractions rule, must be satisfied both on a prospective basis and on an actual basis for each taxable year of the partnership.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fractions rule is applied on an overall partnership basis. Therefore, if partnership allocations to one QO partner fail to satisfy the requirements of the fractions rule, that partner, and other QO partners in the partnership, are subject to the debt-financed property rules, even if the allocations to those other QO partners would otherwise have complied with the requirements of the fractions rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A second requirement under section 514(c)(9)(E) is that each partnership allocation must either have substantial economic effect or (in the case of certain allocations that cannot have economic effect) otherwise appropriately comply with the requirements of the regulations under section 704(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with PSOE Organization Secretary Cipria Ciscar by </F> Adolf Beltran in Valencia; date not given]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Beltran] Half of Spain is  wondering who this new PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party]  organization secretary is and how long he has been in political  life.    [Ciscar] I am in politics because of a commitment which  dates not from now but from when I was 18, at the time of the  struggle against the dictatorship. That original commitment,  which many of us young people had at that time, led me to  political commitment, also to the struggle against inequalities.  Later, in 1978, my link with the Socialist Party was  established.    [Beltran] Are you a Guerraist? A renewalist? With which  currents within the party have you identified?    [Ciscar] I committed myself from the outset to a blueprint,  which is the Socialist blueprint, without further labels. I  have always believed that that blueprint must be tackled on the  basis of renewal, and I have worked for reflection on ideas and  proposals which interest people not to be abandoned. In any  event, that attitude is already implicit in my commitment to  democracy and as a Socialist.    [Beltran] What circumstances made possible your becoming  organization secretary?    [Ciscar] Election as organization secretary or as the person  responsible for any other area of the Federal Executive  Committee occurs for two reasons. The first is that the  secretary general has decided to have you at his disposal. The  second is that the delegates have supported the proposal. It is  indisputable that the secretary general takes into account the  opinions which emerge in the party.    [Beltran] And did not the fact that you belong to a  federation -- the Valencian Federation -- which went to the  congress united under the flag of integration carry weight?    [Ciscar] There is no doubt that the Valencian delegation,  led by Joan Lerma, played a constructive role, both in  contributing ideas and in securing agreements for setting the  congress on the right course. Moreover, the fact that Lerma  chaired the congress made it necessary to play that role more  diligently.    [Beltran] What does integration mean in a party polarized  between Guerraists and renewalists?    [Ciscar] Felipe Gonzalez stated that the congress must be  one of renewal of ideas at the same time as one of integration  in order to ensure that the party does not lose its cohesion.  Thus there was an extensive renewal in the sphere of ideas,  thanks primarily to a fluid debate which made it possible from  the precongress stage to accept proposals by a very large  majority. As was natural, there were also changes in order to  form a team of people who can carry out those ideas. At the  same time, it was made very clear that society's concerns and  the party's run in the same direction.    [Beltran] What is your opinion of the work of Jose Maria  Benegas -- your predecessor in the post?    [Ciscar] He has worked very hard for several years, and now  he has accepted another post within the Executive Committee.    [Beltran] And how do you view his performance as  organization secretary?    [Ciscar] Work in the Federal Executive Committee is  teamwork; it must be performed jointly. It is true that each  area has some tasks, and also that everybody has his temperament  and way of doing things. I believe that the organization  secretary must encourage openness, tolerance, and dialogue  within the party and at all levels.    [Beltran] What is your opinion of the new Executive  Committee?    [Cscar] It has very considerable support. It is clearly led  by Felipe Gonzalez, and it contains a large contingent of people  with responsibilities in the government, autonomous community  premiers, and federation secretaries general. It is broadly  representative.    [Beltran] Must the door be opened up to society?    [Ciscar] The party must be consistent with the renewal of  ideas, and should avoid acting in a dogmatic and secretive way.  I will make an effort to ensure that the congress resolutions  are implemented, and although I have never before held directly  organizational responsibilities, but rather institutional and  parliamentary responsibilities, I will work to achieve this  hopefully on the basis of transparency, dialogue, and openness.    [Beltran] You are taking over the organization at a time of  poor election prospects.    [Ciscar] Over the past few years Spain has experienced very  considerable changes. Democracy has been consolidated, our  commitment to Europe has been reaffirmed, and the foundations of  the welfare state have been laid. Our aim must be to intensify  that work.    [Beltran] Corruption and the controversy over the parties'  funding have recently marked political life. How will you  approach this matter from your new post?    [Ciscar] The Socialist Party is the most closely watched of  all, and this is natural because it holds the greatest  responsibility. It is also the most open, but this is not  enough; it should be much more so. Felipe Gonzalez has spoken  of promoting the party's clear and transparent functioning, and  I have been called upon to work on the basis of that approach.</p>

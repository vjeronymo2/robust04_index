But it also betrays friction within the industry over plans to change the way units are priced. Coming after defections by the Prudential and others over robust UTA criticisms of insurance company commission structures, the latest departure further illustrates the gulf between different parts of the retail financial services sector. It would obviously be useful for the market if unit trusts, investment trusts and insurers were able to present a united front against the building societies. But that, it seems, is not the real world.</p>

This is a new form  of using direct foreign investment. Economic and trade  departments in various localities should properly handle  examination, approval, and management work.    Second, the establishment of corporations issuing special  renminbi shares or the issuance of special renminbi shares by  existing companies should be regarded as using foreign capital,  and economic and trade departments in all localities should  examine their contracts and rules according to the state's  relevant laws, regulations, and approval procedures for using  foreign capital. If any existing foreign-funded enterprises are  to be reorganized into corporations, their assets should be  reevaluated, and their revised contracts and rules should be  examined and approved by the authorities concerned.    Third, apart from Shanghai and Shenzhen, the establishment  of  Sino-foreign corporations should be reported to the Ministry of  Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation for examination so that  they can determine whether they are able to enjoy (or continue  to enjoy) the status of foreign-funded enterprises.  Certificates will be issued to them if such a status is  approved. The corporations should apply for the issuance of  special renminbi shares according to the relevant regulations of  the State Council and the management regulations of the Shanghai  and Shenzhen securities exchanges.    Fourth, the establishment of Sino-foreign corporations  should  be in keeping with China's industrial policy on using foreign  capital, and is now limited to industries in which the state  encourages and allows foreign investment. No Sino-foreign  corporations can be set up in industries in which they are not  allowed to do so or where the interim regulations on the  operational terms of Sino-foreign joint ventures do not allow  them to do so.</p>

			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Searching for the right recipe: Tomkins' options for reviving RHM By refusing last week to raise its offer for RHM, the baking and grocery group, Hanson has left Tomkins, its smaller rival bidder, free to show whether the formula it has applied to businesses such as bicycles, handguns and valves can also work in food. But in bidding Pounds 935m for RHM, is Tomkins biting off more than it can chew? Though the conglomerate has lined up the financing it needs, its reputation will ride on whether it can quickly extract from the deal the superior returns expected by its own shareholders. Mr Greg Hutchings, Tomkins' chairman, has ruled out selling RHM's businesses piecemeal. Everything will depend on finding ways to cut costs and build profitable business which have eluded RHM's own management. Critics argue that RHM's management has failed to exploit opportunities. The question is whether Tomkins, with no previous experience in the food industry, is better placed to do so. It could undoubtedly cut costs by closing RHM's head offices in Windsor and by rationalising production further. However, savings are likely to be small relative to Tomkins' planned investment. The labour content of RHM's manufacturing is already low and at least half its costs are in materials and packaging, which are not easily controllable. Hence, Tomkins' hopes for improving RHM's performance seem likely to depend heavily on enhancing the performance of its branded groceries, cakes and food services divisions and - above all - on stemming the steep profits decline in its flour-milling and bread-baking businesses. RHM is widely thought to have imposed unduly tight head office controls on the managers of its main divisions, none of whom sits on its main board. By introducing a more devolved management structure, Tomkins might perhaps unleash hitherto suppressed initiative. However, it will be difficult quickly to wring higher returns from its mixed bag of branded businesses. Of these, probably only the Sharwood's chutney and condiments range enjoys a really strong position in a fast-growing sector. But although highly profitable, Sharwood's had sales of only Pounds 32m last year. Others, such as Saxa salt, Atora suet, Paxo stuffing and McDougalls flour, are brand leaders, but in mature or declining sectors, while Bisto gravy and Mr Kipling cakes and pastries face increasingly powerful competition, both from branded manufacturers and supermarkets' own-label products. One dilemma about owning such a diverse stable of small niche brands is the wide spread of advertising and marketing support. Many other food manufacturers have found it more profitable to concentrate on selected areas of strength. Tomkins may decide to rationalise RHM's portfolio, possibly by trading some brands for those of other manufacturers. But it will need to maintain - if not increase - marketing expenditure if it is to hold its own. Most industry analysts think the chances of sharply increasing returns from these businesses are relatively modest. 'If Tomkins continue to develop the brands, they can expect growth - but it will not be dramatic,' says Mr David Lang of stockbrokers Henderson Crosthwaite. Nor does RHM's own-label production offer much prospect of increased rewards: supermarkets are careful to ensure operating margins on this business do not go much above 7 per cent. The key to RHM's fortunes may lie in the milling and baking side. As the greatest source of problems, these hold out the promise of greatest reward. But the problems run deep. As the chart shows, operating profits in the division have slumped. Analysts believe the year to Aug 1992 will show a fall to Pounds 19.4m and many think the division next year could show no operating profit. The industry believes there is between 10 per cent and 15 per cent too much baking capacity in the UK. Tomkins has hinted that taking capacity out may form part of the plan; business development director, Mr Geoffrey Eaton, said last week that Tomkins was driven by profits, not market share. Since the beginning of the 1980s, RHM has reduced its bakeries from about 60 to 18 - or 21 after the recent purchase of three from Dalgety. It has also spent Pounds 115m to increase efficiency in the past three years. With drastic further rationalisation it might be possible to service most of the market without losing too much revenue base. But that would require heavy capital expenditure on new plant. It is also uncertain whether the approach would work, given the special characteristics of the bread market. Associated British Foods, RHM's biggest competitor, is insulated by large family shareholdings from short-term market pressures. Tomkins insists the planned acquisition will not dilute its earnings - apparently on the assumption that milling and baking profits do not go into free fall. But there is a danger Tomkins will be saddled with a large slice of business that performs sluggishly for some time, even if it eventually turns round. If this were the case, the first casualty would be Tomkins' rating, which was a heady 17 times prospective earnings before the bid. As a company which depends heavily on bold acquisitions to sustain its growth, the capacity to raise large amounts of capital quickly is essential. To risk this carefully nurtured rating, Mr Hutchings must believe he has a rabbit to pull from his hat. The problem is that many City of London observers of the food sector cannot guess what sort of rabbit. What they all recognise, however, is that both Lord Hanson and Tomkins dreamed up the same idea at about the same time and had in mind a similar price. Someone has to have got it wrong.</p>

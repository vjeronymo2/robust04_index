The manufacturer has developed fuel inlet float valves of improved design, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has determined that the improved valves should be installed to reduce the number of repetitive tests currently required by AD 93&hyph;05&hyph;03. The proposed action would require installing these fuel inlet float valves of improved design. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent possible loss of engine power caused by failure of a fuel inlet float valve. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before November 28, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;06&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106.

An accident involving a Model 402C airplane where the fuel inlet valve failed in the open position prompted that action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since AD 93&hyph;05&hyph;03 became effective, Cessna has developed fuel inlet float valves of improved design, and the FAA has determined that installation of these improved valves serves as a basis for reducing the number of repetitive tests currently required by AD 93&hyph;05&hyph;03.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, Cessna has issued Service Bulletin (SB) MEB93&hyph;10, dated December 3, 1993, which specifies procedures for replacing fuel inlet float valves; and (2) accomplishing an installation test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After examining the circumstances and reviewing all available information related to the incidents described above including the referenced service information, the FAA has determined that the fuel inlet float valves of improved design should be incorporated on the referenced airplanes to prevent possible loss of engine power caused by failure of a fuel inlet float valve.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other Cessna Models T303, 402C, 404, 414A, and 421C airplanes of the same type design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 93&hyph;05&hyph;03 with a new AD that would require replacing the fuel inlet float valves with parts of improved design or modifying the existing part and periodically accomplishing functional tests to assure proper operation. The proposed actions would be accomplished in accordance with the ACCOMPLISHMENT INSTRUCTIONS supplement to Cessna SB MEB93&hyph;10, dated December 3, 1993.  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / International Company News: Creditanstalt down 24% pre-tax Creditanstalt-Bankverein, Austria's second largest bank, suffered a 24.5 per cent slide in pre-tax profits to Sch1.04bn (Dollars 96.3m) in the third quarter. It blamed the continuing slump in earnings from trading. The bank, which is awaiting Austrian government approval of a plan to complete its privatisation, reiterated that pre-tax profits in the full year would be lower than last year's record Sch5.4bn. Net income would be higher because of lower provisions for bad loans. Income from trading in the third quarter, at Sch400m, was 42 per cent down. The bank said income from money market operations and bond trading were below expectations. Net interest income, which was down 3.7 per cent in the first half, resumed a modest growth trend in the third quarter, up 2.9 per cent to Sch2.19bn. Fee income of Sch680m was 6.8 per cent ahead. For the nine months, pre-tax profits were down 19.8 per cent to Sch2.9bn. Consolidated pre-tax profits of the Creditanstalt-Bankverein group were down 20 per cent to Sch3.4bn.</p>

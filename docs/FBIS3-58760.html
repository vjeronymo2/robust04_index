			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Giovanni Valentini report: "Segni: These Are My Ideas To </F> Win"]    [Excerpts] Rome -- Heedful of the proverb "Short reckonings  make long friendships," [Pact for Italy leader] Mario Segni  presented his Pact for Italy platform in Rome yesterday, thus  virtually opening the electoral campaign and challenging the  progressive coalition. [passage omitted]    Let us look more closely, then, at the Pact's seven  proposals, as illustrated by Buttiglione and Baldassarri.    1. Italy's peace and security. National unity is a basic  principle that must be upheld against [League secretary] Bossi's  and [League ideologue] Miglio's separatism. This assertion must  have been welcomed also by Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta,  so much so that in his contribution he expressed appreciation  for this "wait-and-see position" in relation to the League,  urging the latter to "clarify the boundaries between federalism  and Italy's federal break-up."    2. Reform of the state and of local autonomous governments.  In order to combat centralism, Segni's movement is proposing to  strengthen the local autonomous governments. "Autonomy,"  Buttiglioni explained, " means transferring decisionmaking power  as close as possible to citizens, voters, and taxpayers."  However, this does not rule out "coordination instruments at  interregional level."    3. Law and order. This means protecting people and their  property. Apart from continuing to combat organized crime,  efforts must also be made to combat petty crime, which is  threatening urban life more directly.    4. Tax reform. According to Baldassarri's proposal, tax  rates should not exceed 40 percent. Sharing the tax burden more  equitably is one of the platform's objectives.    5. Solidarity policy. Until now, this policy has been "false  and mystifying." It must now strive for efficiency. As regards  running the services, budget limitations must be complied with,  and managerial criteria applied.    6. Job and employment development. Access to work must  become more flexible -- for example, by transforming  unemployment benefits into incentives to become employed. To  help young people, trainee contracts must be reintroduced, with  reduced social charges during the first few years.    7. Modernizing society. This involves, in the first place,  developing the south. For Baldassarri, however, the south's  development "must be understood in terms of the country's  overall development." For his part, ruling out massive  subsidies, Segni explained in his contribution that "this policy  must enable the south to become its own master, and provide for  itself."</p>

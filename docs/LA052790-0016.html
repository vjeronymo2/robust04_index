			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: *** 1/2 WORLD PARTY "GOODBYE JUMBO" ENSIGN/CHRYSALIS: ALBUMS ARE  RATED FROM ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> Karl Wallinger is no Lenny-come-lately, hippie wanna-be. Chairman of World  Party as well as its sole member, Wallinger has it all over the Kravitzes of  the world when it comes to being a flower child by nature.  </P> <P> If originality is not one of the pantheist protest singer's major virtues, his  Lennonisms sound somehow endemic, not affected. And if he blatantly posits  himself somewhere between the Age of Aquarius and the New Age, there's a  healthy cynicism to his naivete. Or is it vice versa?  </P> <P> It's not just the Beatles that inspire the beat here. The slide guitar of "When  the Rainbow Comes" suggests Derek &amp; the Dominoes; the ecumenical "God on My  Side" borrows its title from Dylan but its vocal style from Jeff Lynne.  Elsewhere it's Prince, slinky Memphis soul, echoes of Badfinger and Donovan.  </P> <P> It's no petty theft, either. "Jumbo" comes together marvelously. You might wish  Wallinger would let his guard down and admit you into his inner sanctum more  often. But his nature-loving, celebratory side -- in "Thank You World," the  grass is his blanket "and the sun is my alarm" -- is compelling enough to make  you want to organize a Post-Modern love-in.

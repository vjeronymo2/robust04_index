			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Gardening (A Taste of Chelsea): The otter surfaces - Country Note THE CHAIN fastened to the pub wall under a notice 'Water Otter' led into the murky depths of a tank enclosed and landscaped, after a fashion, to resemble a river bank. I bought my drink and waited expectantly but nothing appeared. Finally, seriously concerned for the animal's welfare, I hauled on the chain only to recover - a kettle] Sadly in England, kettles are far more numerous than otters, whose virtual disappearance in the 1960s and early 1970s largely as a result of poisoning from organochlorine pesticides and sheep dips, has been well documented. These chocolate brown members of the weasel family are almost as big as badgers but they are shy, secretive and difficult to find. This makes them a problem to count. It would be hard to discover if they were numerous or scarce were it not for their characteristic droppings, or spraints, which enable biologists to get some idea of the size of their population. These spraints are generally full of bones from fish and other prey which are glued together in a black and tarry mass. The most telling feature about them is their smell, a sweet musky odour which is both acceptable and unmistakeable, the staff of life to the otter surveyor. While mink droppings, or scats, look much the same, their smell is far from pleasant. Otters hold territories along rivers and streams as well as on the coast and leave their spraints at strategic points as signposts which will be readily found by other otters. Luckily for the surveyor, these are frequently on the ledges on either side of the water under bridges. Checking for them rarely means more than donning a pair of waders at the roadside and crawling under the bridge with a sharp eye and a keen nose. English Nature, then the Nature Conservancy Council, completed a first survey of otters in the late 1970s and has published the results of a repeat which was carried out ten years later. These indicate that, since the guilty pesticides have fallen from use and hunting has been stopped, otters are on the increase, but only in those areas where they were strong before, in the far west and the far north of England. Otters are spreading from these strongholds as their population grows to occupy new rivers. But where they have been severely reduced or are absent, things continue to look grim. At best they are doing no more than hold their own on the Somerset Levels and in East Anglia. There is a great swathe running through the whole of central England to the south coast from which otters are entirely absent. The problem is that, since they became scarce, habitat changes have taken place both in terms of 'improvements' to waterways and recreational pressures. Even if otters increased in numbers sufficiently to recolonise this chunk of England, many of the rivers where they once lived are now entirely unsuitable for them. Fortunately, in both Scotland and Wales, they are considerably more numerous and the islands and lochs on the west coast of Scotland are reputed to have signs of otters at every 100 metres on average. It is here, at Kylerhea on the Isle of Skye, that the Forestry Commission has established a centre and hide. For anyone prepared to spend an hour or so there, the chances of seeing an otter are high. In contrast you could keep a look out for a lifetime on an English river without seeing a single one.</p>

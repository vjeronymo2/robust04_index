			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / European shares rally as inflation rates decline: German and UK figures bolster confidence A BURST of confidence sent London and other European stock markets higher yesterday after encouraging figures on British and German inflation. News of a 1.3 per cent drop in west German wholesale prices and a sharp fall in June retail sales raised hopes throughout Europe that the upward pressure on German interest rates was easing. In the UK, the government moved closer to its goal of zero inflation as official figures showed that prices were rising at a much slower rate than expected. The annual rate of retail price inflation dropped to 3.7 per cent last month compared with 3.9 per cent in June after the biggest monthly fall in the retail prices index (RPI) for 25 years. The better-than-expected economic data from Germany boosted share prices in Frankfurt, Paris and London and also gave a fillip to bonds. Equities in London surged when the news on German retail sales coincided with the announcement of the drop in UK inflation. The FT-SE 100 index made its best daily gain for more than three weeks, closing 38.8 stronger at 2,356.8. UK government bonds gained more than a point. In Frankfurt, the west German wholesale prices data boosted the DAX-30 index of blue chip shares by 0.4 per cent. Paris equities shook off a bearish week to rebound by 1.8 per cent. The strong rise reflected bargain hunting in the hope that continental interest rates might begin to decline before the end of the year. Over the past week, the London market had been depressed by fears that sterling's weakness might force up domestic interest rates, deepening the recession. The 0.4 per cent fall in Britain's RPI between June and July added to evidence that inflation is being successfully squeezed from the economy. Earlier in the week, figures had shown that the prices of goods leaving factories - often used as a measure of core inflation - were at their lowest for 25 years last month. Labour market data on Thursday showed the rate of average earnings growth slowing sharply to 6 per cent in June. Yesterday's figures from the Central Statistical Office showed that July's headline inflation figure was the same as last October's - after which it jumped back to 4.3 per cent. This month it is expected to resume its downward path. Excluding mortgage interest payments, inflation fell to a four-year low of 4.4 per cent, from 4.8 per cent in June. The news on inflation may well encourage ministers back on to the offensive over government economic strategy. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has been under pressure from Tory backbenchers to boost the economy in the face of rising unemployment, which hit a five-year peak last month. Mr Tony Nelson, the economic secretary to the Treasury, said the latest inflation data, along with a modest rise in manufacturing output, were signs of 'better economic conditions that are to come'. Last month's fall in the RPI puts Britain's inflation rate below the EC average of 4.5 per cent but above the 3.3 per cent average of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries. The Confederation of British Industry described the inflation figures as 'extremely good' and said the UK was set to have one of the lowest inflation currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism. The Institute of Directors warned that wage inflation must be brought more in line with retail price trends to prevent job losses. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, pointed out that inflation was still higher in the UK than in Germany, Japan, France and the US. 'Britain has suffered the worst fall in investment, the worst rise in unemployment, record business failures and a worse economic growth performance than any of our major competitors,' he said.

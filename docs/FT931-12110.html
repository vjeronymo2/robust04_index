			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Cheap cover for classics in the garage  -A look at insurance for classic cars CLASSIC car enthusiasts are a special breed. That at least, is the conclusion of their insurers who offer a different type of policy for the proud owners of a much-loved Jensen or Alfa Romeo 'Spider.' The main attraction of this type of insurance, provided by brokers and many of the big insurance companies, is the much lower annual premiums. Martin Cooke of Bain Clarkson insurance brokers (0384- 455011), estimates that someone owning a Ferrari or Bentley, requiring annual insurance premiums of Pounds 3,000-Pounds 4,000 under a standard policy, would find them reduced to Pounds 800-Pounds 900 under classic car insurance. To enjoy the lower premiums, classic car owners are expected to cherish their car and not use it for mundane purposes, such as transport. 'The average owner of a collector's car will keep it in a garage, look after it carefully and will not use it for everyday driving,' said Mike Chamberlin of John Scott and partners (081-977-9121), one of the first brokers to specialise in classic and vintage cars. These conditions mean reduced risk, which is why the classic car insurance market can insure expensive cars relatively cheaply. Classic car insurance differs in two main ways from standard policies which use bandings for cars depending on model, engine size and the age of the driver. Instead, the agreed value of the car and the amount of driving the car is expected to do are the basis for theinsurance Norwich Union's Collectors Car policy (0603-622200), will cover the policyholder against accident, damage and total loss on an agreed value basis. 'Premiums are worked out on the value of the car rather than its group rating,' said James Duffell of Norwich Union. 'Since a classic 1950s car, saloon or sports car are all expected to be driven in much the same way, only the value of the car is relevant.' An Alvis, a Bristol or an Aston Martin would all fall into the same insurance bracket if it was agreed their value was the same. Settling on a value can be difficult in a market which has not found itself immune to the problems of recession. Those who bought at the top of the market in 1989, when prices for some classics had quadrupled in a few years, found that the value of their cars fell by as much as half. For this reason, the value of the car may need to be reassessed at intervals. Since the car is not expected to be used daily, premiums are based on maximum mileage - which is not usually a consideration under a standard policy. The most common mileage band is for a maximum of 3,000 miles a year, although some policies allow up to 4,500 miles or even 6,000 miles. Unlimited mileage policies may be available but the cost of premiums will be much higher. Bain Clarkson, for example, will offer standard rates but with the insurance being on an agreed value basis. The car does not have to be expensive to qualify for classic car insurance - Morris Minors and Sunbeam Alpines are common risks - but it must be old. 'The car must be at least 20 years old, though we do make exceptions, for example, for Morgans,' said Peter Fry of KGM Motor Policies (081-530- 7351), a Lloyds syndicate which is another veteran of the classic car market. Bain Clarkson will also insure younger cars but for higher premiums. The annual premiums for a 1980 Mercedes 450 SL, with an agreed value of Pounds 9,000 will, for example, be Pounds 300 for a 3,000 mile maximum and Pounds 460 for a maximum of 6,000 miles a year. Young drivers are not welcome. Most classic car insurers will base premiums on a minimum of 30 years for the driver. Cover may be available for those who are younger for higher premiums. Annual premiums for a classic car worth Pounds 5,000, such as a Morris 1000, insured for a maximum mileage of 3,000 are in the region of Pounds 110-Pounds 115 under classic car insurance. KGM estimates that for the same mileage, annual premiums for a fully comprehensive policy on a Pounds 10,000 car (such as a 1970 E-type Jaguar or a TR2) would be Pounds 170 and on a Pounds 20,000 car (a Mercedes 190 SL, for example), Pounds 253. The market has been affected by the rise in crime which has led to steeply increased premiums in the motor insurance industry as a whole. Bain Clarkson's Cooke says that for the first time in 20 years, classic car insurers have been obliged to raise premiums, by an average of 25 per cent this year because of increased theft. In addition, insurers are beginning to insist on lock-up garages for cars and are stipulating that the policyholder should have another car for normal daily driving, with the classic car reserved only for 'social, domestic and pleasure purposes.' Fry's KGM says that it tries to avoid 'off the road' cover, when cheaper insurance is provided for the car which is not being driven. Norwich Union will still provide off the road cover, which includes accidental damage, loss or damage by fire or theft, particularly for those who are doing restoration work to the car. What if the worst happens and your cherished Bugatti has a crash and is deemed a write-off? 'Sometimes a car has been passed on from father to son through generations and the owner will want to retain and restore the car whatever,' says Chamberlin. The best classic car insurance policies should have a salvage clause allowing the owner to retain the salvage after an accident. John Scott has arrangements with two insurers: under its Lloyd's scheme, the settlement would be limited to 80 per cent of the insured value while a scheme underwritten by General Accident will allow the owner to have the car repaired and reimbursed up to the insured value.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National" newscast] </F>   [Text] Rudolf Hommes, finance and credit minister, escaped  an attempt on his life unhurt, but one of his bodyguards was  injured. "National" newscast was the first to arrive at the  scene. Here is a report by J.J. Pinilla.    [Pinilla] The attack took place at 0805 [1305 GMT], when  Minister Rudolf Hommes was on his usual trip from his home to  his office in midtown Santa Fe de Bogota. One policeman was  wounded. The charge, consisting of over 10 kg of ammonal, was  placed at the base of a lamppost on 26th Street and 5th Avenue  and detonated by remote control. Following the explosion, the  minister's driver continued on for another block despite the  fact that one of the car's tires was flat. They stopped at the  Santa Monica Hotel, where Hommes Rodriguez left the vehicle and  was taken to his office in another vehicle.    [Begin recording] [Police Colonel Miguel Angel Meza] He was  taken directly to his office.    [Reporter] What happened to the policeman. [Meza not heard  to  answer]    [Reporter] What route were they taking? Where was the  minister going?    [Meza] He was going to his office. [end recording]    [Pinilla] A police bodyguard identified as Libardo Arias was  injured. A mass transit bus and a private vehicle that were  passing by were damaged.    [Begin recording] [Bus driver Enrique Molano] [Words  indistinct] just leave me alone.    [Reporter] How did you react when the bomb exploded?    [Molano] I put on the brakes because the lamppost fell on  top  of the bus. That is all I saw. Smoke filled the bus. [end  recording]    [Pinilla] The severity of the attack was lessened thanks to  the skill of the minister's driver, who never stopped the  vehicle despite the explosion.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yolanda Lopez Ordaz] </F>   [Text] Tapachula, Chiapas, 21 Jun -- In an open letter, the  Mexican Southeastern Revolutionary Peasants and Workers Front  (Frecoms), which is an armed group that allegedly operates in  the region and which has threatened to stage an uprising similar  to that of the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN],  requested a meeting with Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez Moreno  "to find peaceful solutions and to participate in the Chiapas  peace talks."    The Frecoms appeared for the first time on 31 March, as the  local EL ORBE newspaper published a report on a meeting between  the newspaper and Subcommander Pedro, a meeting during which he  announced the emergence of this armed group, which is willing to  take up arms, as the EZLN did, should the government "fail to  meet people's demands." During the meeting, Subcommander Pedro  pointed out his organization is not connected with the EZLN and  other groups that operate in the Central American isthmus.    According to the report published by EL ORBE, the Frecoms  has  active members in Chiapas, Tabasco, Campeche, and Oaxaca States.  Subcommander Pedro also said his organization wants a change  toward democracy.    Today in EL ORBE, this alleged armed group published an open  letter requesting a meeting with Governor Lopez to participate  in the peace negotiations. Archbishop Arizmendi Esquivel  reported that, according to information provided by the 42  priests who make up this dioceses and who visit the communities  of La Costa, Soconusco, Frontera, and Sierra, "this armed group  does not exist."    He added that the priests are in constant contact with the  residents of this region as well as with the catechists, and "no  movements by armed people or groups that are part of a front  similar to the EZLN have been detected, unless it is so secret,  no one knows about it so far."    The Tapachula bishop, however, did not rule out that some  people are trying to manipulate the population, trying to stage  an uprising to meet personal demands, or that someone simply  wants to make "more noise." This is why he urged the population  not to be concerned by broadcast information that goes beyond  what prudence dictates and why he asked the media to be careful  in the handling of this type of news, which could trigger  uncertainty among the population.    The priest underscored that fighting for the rights of  individuals and groups is beneficial, but he asked people not to  take up arms and make threats, which leads only to violence and  confrontation.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Supporting Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The petitioner states that the regulations that require licensees to implement safeguards contingency plans and security programs are essential to ensure operation of the facilities in an environment free from external threats. The petitioner notes that independent audits of these programs are required to overview their effectiveness. Furthermore, the petitioner believes that the frequency or extent of overview of these plans and programs by mandatory audits is not providing a commensurate performance in security programs. According to the petitioner, safeguards contingency plans and security programs have been in place in the industry for an extended period and that despite recent reconsideration of the design basis threat, nuclear security is otherwise being adequately addressed and implemented by the plans and programs as they are presently configured. The petitioner believes that a biennial audit frequency would more than adequately provide the requisite feedback and assurance regarding the effectiveness of each licensee's safeguards contingency plan and security program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petitioner further states that technological advancements and applications have resulted in and will continue to generate improvements to security equipment and facilities. The petitioner asserts that industry-wide programmatic enhancements continue to be made available to improve the effective utilization of security staff as well as equipment and that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results of the improvements to equipment and facilities and programmatic enhancements within nuclear safeguards and security programs over the past decade have elevated plan effectiveness throughout the industry. The petitioner notes that the improvement is evidenced, in part, through the SALP program which is used to assess security indicators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Amendments to 10 CFR Part 50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The petitioner proposed that in &sect;50.54, paragraph (p)(3) be revised to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;50.54  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Conditions of licenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (p) *&blank;*&blank;*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The licensee shall provide for the development, revision, implementation, and maintenance of its safeguards contingency plan. To this end, the licensee shall provide for a review nominally every 24 months of the safeguards contingency plan by individuals independent of both security program management and personnel who have direct responsibility for implementation of the security program. The review must include a review and audit of safeguards contingency procedures and practices, an audit of the security system testing and maintenance program, and a test of the safeguards systems, along with commitments established for response by local law enforcement authorities. The results of the review and audit, along with recommendations for improvements, must be documented, reported to the licensee's corporate and plant management, and kept available at the plant for inspection for a period of three years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Amendments to 10 CFR Part 73  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The petitioner proposes that in &sect;73.55, paragraph (g)(4) be revised to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;73.55  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Requirements for physical protection of licensed activities in nuclear power reactors against radiological sabotage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (g) * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The security program must be reviewed nominally every 24 months by individuals independent of both security program management and personnel who have direct responsibility for implementation of the security program. The security program review must include an audit of security procedures and practices, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the physical protection system, an audit of the physical protection system testing and maintenance program, and an audit of commitments established for response by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local law enforcement authorities. The results and recommendations of the security program review, management's findings on whether the security program is currently effective, and any actions taken as a result of recommendations from prior program reviews must be documented in a report to the licensee's plant manager and to corporate management at least one level higher than that having responsibility for the day-to-day plant operation.

The petitioner states that the annual audit frequency is not necessary to ensure an adequate safeguards contingency plan and security program, nor is it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commensurate with present industry performance in this area. Further, the petitioner states that it is not required to support NRC evaluation of program adequacy. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 2nd day of May 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> John C.

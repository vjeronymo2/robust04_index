			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Steep fall in size of wage deals likely to continue THE 'dramatic' fall in pay deals last year continued into the final quarter and looks likely to persist this year, possibly even breaching the 5 per cent 'pay floor', according to pay research body Industrial Relations Services. The latest figures from the IRS pay databank for the final quarter of last year, based on pay reviews for 630,000 employees, show that the median settlement has fallen to 5.1 per cent. The figure for December 1990 was 9.7 per cent. IRS says that nine out of 10 pay reviews in the final three months of last year were for smaller amounts than awarded in the same period the year before. December's lower quartile of settlements remains unchanged from November at 4.5 per cent, while the upper quartile has increased slightly to 6.7 per cent. IRS says that a striking feature of pay in the 1980s was the existence of a 'pay floor' of 5 per cent, in spite of persistently low inflation during 1986 and 1987. Public-sector pay in the financial year to March next year is expected to increase by 7 per cent, according to a separate analysis by the Public Finance Foundation. The PFF estimates that public-sector rises will be 1 percentage point higher than private-sector pay and 3.5 percentage points higher than inflation. The PFF expects that next week the pay review bodies will announce rises of about 6 per cent for the 1.5m teachers, doctors, nurses and members of the armed forces. It also predicts that local-government settlements in July and September will be 4.5 per cent and the Civil Service settlement will be 5 per cent.</p>

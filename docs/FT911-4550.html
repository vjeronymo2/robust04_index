			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / UK Company News: Eagle Trust disposes of plumbing equipment arm EAGLE TRUST, the mini-conglomerate that was delisted in September, has sold the businesses and assets of Pavis Group, its distributor and retailer of plumbing equipment, for Pounds 9m. The purchaser is the D Pavis Group, which has been set up by former Pavis Group managers and two new investors. The sale is the latest in a series of disposals by Eagle Trust in a reorganisation aimed at reducing its debt and trimming its operations. It will initially reduce borrowings, currently at about Pounds 8.3m, by a little less than the Pounds 5.9m cash it will receive in the first stage of the sale. The remaining Pounds 3.1m will come from a net surplus of debtors over creditors which Eagle Trust will retain. It has also subscribed for an initial 74 per cent of the ordinary shares of the new company. The remaining 26 per cent has been subscribed for by the new company's management team. Eagle Trust has also subscribed for Pounds 1.85m of Pounds 1 preference shares at par, Pounds 1.3m of 15 per cent secured loan stock and Pounds 1m of 15 per cent unsecured loan stock in the new company. The arrangement enables the management team to increase its shareholding from between 51 per cent and 75 per cent as the preference shares are redeemed and loan stock is repaid.</p>

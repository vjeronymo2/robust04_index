			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COOKING &amp; ENTERTAINING WITH STYLE;  </P> <P> GETTING TO KNOW YOU;  </P> <P> ENTERTAINING IN THE NEW L. A. / VISITING WITH JOEL AND MARGARET CHEN, YUKUO AND  AKIKO TAKENAKA, AGUSTIN AND MARIA GARZA AND JORGE SANTOS  </P> <P> Yukuo Takenaka's first brush with the differences between Japanese and American  social customs came in a physical-education class in Salt Lake City when he was  15 years old.  </P> <P> "We had a dancing class," he says, shaking his head. "That really shook me. You  have to remember, in Japan in those days, we didn't even talk to girls and we  certainly didn't hold hands. I had never danced in my life. In fact, I had  never touched a woman's hand before. And in the United States, girls grow up  very fast. It was a shocking experience to say the least."  </P> <P> Takenaka recovered enough to become the first Japanese accountant at the  prestigious accounting company of Peat-Marwick, where he worked for 22 years  before leaving this past March to found his own investment-banking firm,  Takenaka and Co. His new role often requires that he act as a Japanese firm's  man in America. He's not uneasy about dancing any more, but he remains acutely  aware of the differences between the way the two countries live and do  business.  </P> <P> "The difference between when Japanese entertain and when Americans entertain is  that when Japanese entertain for business, it is 100% business," he says. "In  American business entertaining, there is a lot of emphasis on family and  friends. Americans try to become your personal friend before they become your  business friend.  </P> <P> "In my home, I would only entertain relatives -- cousins and nephews -- or very  close friends I have known for a long time. For business, we usually take our  guests to restaurants or nightclubs, or sometimes to play golf."  </P> <P> For this, there is a price to pay. Takenaka says that at one time his wife  Akiko was typical of many Japanese in America in that she had a hard time  making friends: "She lived a very lonely life, initially. Then, when our kids  went to school, we moved to Palos Verdes. It was a very small school and they  needed the parents to help. My wife's language skills were not very good yet,  so she worked in the school garden every day and got to know people through  their children. But if we hadn't had kids, I would have had a very lonesome  wife."  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, he usually takes visitors to Nobu Matsuhisa's restaurant on La  Cienega ("I admire him very, very much"), the expensive Sushi-Ko or the private  zashiki rooms at Horikawa, good for business discussions.  </P> <P> "I usually prefer either sushi or what we call kappo ryori. In Japanese, that  means small dishes," says Takenaka. "It's like a series of appetizers that  usually feature the vegetables and fish of the season. Because I travel so  much, I need to balance my diet and with that kind of menu, it is much easier  to do."  </P> <P> If the visitors don't want Japanese food, Takenaka will probably take them to  Lawry's The Prime Rib: "There's something that Japanese love about a big piece  of meat."  </P> <P> Some of his favorite restaurants, Takenaka keeps secret. "One of the problems  with the Japanese is that they tend to do everything the same as everybody  else," he says. "If someone says this is good, everybody wants it. If I took  people to my favorite restaurants, I wouldn't be able to get in. I only take  Americans or people from Japan who aren't going to remain here."  </P></p>

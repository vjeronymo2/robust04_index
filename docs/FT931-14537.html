			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Arts: An American room in London - Architecture Welcome to London, Frank Lloyd Wright. You are one of the key architects of the 20th century and the arrival of one of your rooms in its entirety, with all its furniture and curious timber idiosyncrasies at our fabled and august Victoria and Albert Museum, is indeed a cause for celebration. It was way back in 1974 that Edgar Kaufmann Jnr of New York City gave to the V&amp;A a most generous gift: the office Frank Lloyd Wright had designed in the 1930s for his father at the family-owned business, the Kaufmann Department store in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. I remember Edgar Kaufmann Jnr well. I often met him in New York at his Park Avenue apartment where he sat in rather chill state beneath a great Rodin bronze contemplating one of the finest of Monet's 'Waterlilies'. He had been delighted to donate the Frank Lloyd Wright room to the V&amp;A because he wanted to see the architect represented in Europe, and he had a strong admiration of the V&amp;A and its then director Sir John Pope-Hennessy. Sir John, in his later years at the museum, was keen to acquire important things of quality from the 20th century. The subject of the gift was always a hard one to raise with Mr Kaufmann. He was very sore indeed about the whole subject of the V&amp;A and it is nothing less than a tragedy that he died in 1989, having waited 15 years for something to happen. If he had lived, I think he would have been pleased to see the installation and appreciate the trouble that the excellent curator, Christopher Wilk, has taken. Frank Lloyd Wright is not as well known here as might be expected. The new biography of him by Meryle Secrest (Chatto and Windus, Pounds 20.00) does little to further our knowledge of his architecture, and achieves the remarkable feat of making his fascinating, wild and contentious private life and his strange Welsh origins completely boring. So what is the average visitor to make of this fine room, and how does this American architect and designer fit into the museum's view of the 20th century? Wright was born in 1867 and lived until 1959 (almost an exact contemporary of Sir Edwin Lutyens) and, apart from being one of the most brilliant and prolific architect designers of the 20th century, he also devised theories of life and design that are appropriate to any architectural debate today. He invented what he called 'organic architecture', which was the basis of a unifying theory of architecture as a discipline that embraced structure, materials and ornament, and which included the design of the interior, the furniture, the textiles and everything to do with a building as part of one work of art. By the end of his life he had designed over 1,000 buildings and built more than 400. He reinvented the American house and created environments of simple elegance and repose that owed not a little to his interest in the orient. The Kaufmann room reflects the patron's interest in commissioning the finest of contemporary designs for his department stores - and for his own houses: Edgar Kaufmann commissioned one of Wright's most wonderful private homes, 'Falling Water', in the forests of Western Pennsylvania. Edgar Kaufmann, father and son, were important clients for Wright. They seem to have revived his career in the Depression years of the 1930s. At 'Falling Water' the Kaufmann family enabled Wright to crystallise his vision of man in union with nature. The house is open to the public and shows Wright at his best. The V&amp;A's room will act as a marker: that the 20th century is important, and that a key part of its architectural story is now international. The room has been accurately re-erected and is surrounded by impressive Wright artefacts which the V&amp;A has recently acquired. The accompanying book by Christopher Wilk is a model of scholarly research and an enjoyable read. The story of the room is a microcosm of the story of Wright's reputation and career. The most important element of the room is the cypress and plywood mural over the desk. It looks like a plan of one of Wright's horizontally planned buildings - beautiful, especially in the way it fades into the surrounding timber walls. The yellow pattern in the furniture and carpets has proved fugitive and the room lacks colour. But in every other respect it is perfect, and seems to justify the whole idea of the 'period room' as a didactic tool which is under threat at the V&amp;A. This installation is much to be welcomed. It is shaming that it had to wait so long and sad that so much of the funding had to come from America; but this in no way lessens the importance of the gifts. They are welcome and the exhibit is a brilliant example of international scholarship. May it not be the last.</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Government Bonds: Germany leads decline in European prices Haunted by continued fears of resurgent inflation, European government bonds took another dive yesterday. Germany again led the decline but outperformed the rest of Europe on the basis of its perceived 'safe-haven' status. Neighbouring markets' yield spreads over bunds widened further and several long-dated bond futures contracts hit new lows for the year. Although traders cited a number of reasons for the slide, 'what is behind the declines is that there are just no end-investors willing to buy here', said Mr Mike Gallagher, director of economic research at IDEA. Although bonds could stage brief corrections near-term, 'the market won't find a sustainable bottom until investors come in at bargain-basement levels,' he said. German bonds slumped early in the day when the June bund futures contract breached key technical support at 93.30. Shortly thereafter, the Bundesbank announced that a widely-expected issue of long-dated bunds would not take place because of the government's good cash position. This gave the bund future a brief fillip, but it soon resumed its slide, falling as low as 92.62. While the removal of fresh supply offered some relief, many dealers were disappointed by the cancellation of the bund. UK gilts were one of the day's worst casualties, sliding on data showing M0 money supply rising by a provisionally adjusted 7.1 per cent in the year to end-May. 'People fear the worst - they have no confidence inflation can stay low because this country has one of the worst track records,' said Mr Ifty Islam, international strategist at Merrill Lynch. 'It may take months of subdued RPI numbers to show that inflation is not going out of control.' Talk that today's UK purchasing managers' survey for May would show a rise in producer prices put further pressure on prices. The long gilt futures contract fell 1 to 100 23/32 . 'If it goes through 100, there's very little support until 98,' said Mr Mark Reckless, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities. The UK 10-year yield spread over Germany widened to 185 basis points, from 173 points on Friday. French bonds followed bunds lower, but were also weighed down by the prospect of some FFr20bn of new bonds on Thursday. 'There's no one around to absorb that supply,' said one dealer. The notional June future on Matif fell by 1.00 point to 117.72. The Italian market was also dogged by supply, having to absorb L3,500bn in new 10 and 30-year bonds, where the yield rose sharply from the previous auctions. The June BTP future ended around 108.17, down 1.25 points. Danish and Swedish bonds were hammered by heavy foreign selling, dealers said. Denmark is weighed down by inflation worries amid a strong economic recovery, and both are clouded by election fears. The Danish yield spread over Germany widened to 113 from 89 basis points last Friday; the Swedish yield gap widened to 243 from 208 basis points. US Treasury bonds retreated yesterday as a bearish tone set in ahead of this week's crucial economic data. Late in the session, the 30-year government bond was  11/32 lower at 86 1/32 , yielding 7.42 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  1/16 at 99 3/4 , to yield 5.993 per cent. The morning brought a barrage of economic news, most of which pointed to slower growth, a favourable development for inflation-sensitive bonds. However, Treasuries were moderately lower across the board in light activity, as commodity and gold prices showed fresh strength and declines in European bonds showed no signs of abating. Among the day's economic reports, the Conference Board, an industry trade group, said that consumer confidence had ebbed in May, after growing in the previous two months. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported personal income in April had risen 0.4 per cent, in line with expectations, while personal spending had dipped 0.1 per cent, against forecasts of no change. April new homes sales showed a 6.8 per cent decline from March. No single piece of data had much impact, although traders were surely unsettled by the monthly survey of Chicago's purchasing managers. This month, the regional index of business activity showed a slight drop from April but the index of prices paid by purchasing managers jumped from 59.8 to 63.6. The gain could presage higher inflation in coming months.</p>

Russian Side Prefers To Forget About It"]    [Text] The winding up of the 16th round of  Russian-Estonian talks coincided with another anniversary of the  1920 Tartu Peace Treaty. Ambassador Extraordinary and  Plenipotentiary Vasiliy Svirin, who leads the Russian delegation  to talks with Estonia, remarked that the sides completely forgot  the date in the course of the tense two-week work: "As far as  we are concerned, that treaty has died a natural death."    The Russian diplomat advised that the work on 1 and 2  February centered on the four [as published] main problems of  bilateral relations: the withdrawal of Russian troops from the  territory of Estonia, social protection for Russian military  pensioners who live in the Baltic republic, and border and  economic questions. The Russian side had planned to turn over  to its Estonian counterparts a complete schedule for the  withdrawal of troops until 31 August 1994, but seeing that the  Estonians had completely blocked the question of military  pensioners' rights, it did not find it possible to make such a  step. Mr. Svirin confirmed the statement by Deputy Foreign  Minister Vitaliy Churkin to the effect that Russia had never  linked the problem of its troop withdrawal from Baltic territory  with the position of the Russian-speaking civilian population.  He remarked, however, that the problems of upholding the rights  of servicemen and retired servicemen had always been regarded as  part of the troop withdrawal questions. "The conduct of the  Estonian Government may entail considerable repercussions  because it actually deals with the deportation of military  pensioners," he said. For example, leaders of this Baltic  country demand that all military men retired after 20 August  1991 should leave the republic's territory before 31 August  1994. The remaining 9,000 pensioners (35,000 together with  their families) are only granted the right to seek residence  permits while the Estonian side advanced such humiliating,  according to the Russian diplomat, requirements as  nonparticipation in armed formations and not having been  implicated in cooperation with foreign intelligence services.  The package of border questions, Vasiliy Svirin declared, had  been also blocked by the Estonian side.    The Russian delegation once again underlined, during the  latest round of talks, that Estonian claims to a number of  rayons in Pskov Oblast were hopeless. Vasiliy Svirin remarked  that Estonia is still refusing to demarcate the land borders:  "Russia will probably have to do this unilaterally," he warned.</p>

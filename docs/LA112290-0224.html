			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: RETAIL / TOURISM: THEME PARKS OFFER SANTA-SEASON DEALS FOR HOLIDAY  VISITORS  </P> <P> It should come as no surprise that Knott's Berry Farm and Disneyland are ready  for the holidays.  </P> <P> Knott's, for the fifth year, has converted its Ghost Town into an 1880s  Christmas village.  </P> <P> The program starts Saturday and runs through Christmas Eve. The display  features wandering carolers, 75 decorated Christmas trees, Santa's toy shop,  Mrs. Claus' kitchen and more than 200 costumed artisans plying their trades.  For visitors who don't want to pay for rides, the park charges a $2 admission  for Ghost Town only, with children under 12 free. The payoff for Knott's is all  the gifts and chicken dinners that are sold to eager Christmas shoppers.  </P> <P> Disneyland, for its part, is trying to boost holiday attendance with a special  Mickey's Holiday Workshop package at the Disneyland Hotel. The 1,132-room  resort is offering a $139 deal to families. It includes one night's  accommodations, two one-day passes to Disneyland, parking and a visit to  Mickey's Holiday Workshop, where children can get their picture taken with  Mickey Mouse. Because just two passes into the park are included, a family of  three or more must buy more Disneyland tickets to get everyone in.  </P> <P> Holiday Lights: Santa has already arrived at many major malls, but two of the  county's best-known shopping venues are yet to start their Christmas seasons.  </P> <P> Fashion Island in Newport Beach and South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa have their  decorations up, but they are planning elaborate tree-lighting ceremonies to  start the season formally.  </P> <P> Once again, Fashion Island boasts of having the largest Christmas tree in  Orange County -- possibly in Southern California -- with a 110-foot monster  anchored in concrete.  </P> <P> Entertainer Pat Boone will light the tree at 6:30 p.m. Friday while the crowd  is dusted with fake snow. Santa will make his entrance earlier in the day.  </P> <P> South Coast Plaza will wait until 6:30 p.m. Monday to light its tree and hail  the entrance of Santa, to the accompaniment of the All American Boys Chorus.  The tree will not be in the shopping center, however, but across Bristol Street  in the Town Center commercial area between Anton Boulevard and Town Center  Drive.  </P> <P> Themes at Malls: From supporting U.S. troops in the Saudi Arabian desert to  fighting illiteracy, malls are building themes into their holiday displays this  year.  </P> <P> Westminster Mall has undertaken a sweeping Greetings from Home program to let  GIs serving in the Persian Gulf area know that they are remembered.  </P> <P> The mall is providing a drop-off station for Mideast-bound packages for  soldiers and sailors. And through Dec. 2, mall strollers are being encouraged  to sign a giant greeting card that will be sent to the forces in the gulf.  </P> <P> Laguna Hills Mall has begun a campaign for literacy awareness. Shoppers and  store employees are being urged to donate books in good condition to stock the  library in the Human Options shelter for abused women and their children in  Laguna Beach. The books will be collected by volunteers near the Buffums store,  through Dec. 21.  </P> <P> MacMillan Publishing Co. has donated 2,500 children's books to distribute to  needy children through the mall's Angel Tree program. A book will be given to  every child, along with gifts donated by shoppers.  </P> <P> Orange County Public Library District librarians are volunteering to read  stories to children and their parents at the mall on Saturday mornings through  Dec. 22.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Jerry van Waterschoot commentary: "Fasten Your Seat Belts"] </F>   [Text] Will the political world in general, and the  Socialist Party (SP) in particular, have to go through yet  another wave of scandal, so soon after the Agusta case with the  reemergence of the Uniop case? The ball certainly is rolling  again. If it actually is established that fake studies were  ordered in order to illicitly channel public funds to political  parties, the political world is heading for a "fasten your seat  belt" operation.    The Agusta case led to the resignation of three ministers,  but that is not the end of the story. Not only is the  investigation still going on, the reputation of the political  establishment was also badly damaged. More than ever before,  transparency is needed in the financing of political parties and  in the unsavory affairs which keep cropping up. After the  Agusta case, in which the relevant ministers created the  impression they would rather cling to power than aim at full  openness, politicians can certainly no longer afford to cover up  their suspicious affairs.    An agitated SP Chairman Busquin denied all guilt yesterday,  and suggested that the time now has come to pry into other  parties' business. Busquin obviously is offended because, of  all parties, it was the SP which was attacked twice in a row.    Is it a coincidence or a maneuver by party-political  opponents? Other parties are not likely to be any more innocent  than the SP. There is certainly a good chance that other affairs  will crop up in other parties, or that slandering campaigns will  be fought.    Anyway, this is no reason not to unravel the Uniop case to  the bone, not even if consequences can be far-reaching. In the  case, the names of the few remaining SP leaders are mentioned:  Busquin himself, the man who kept the party in shaky balance  when the three Guys disappeared, and Moureaux, who stood up as  the party's moral conscience in the Agusta case.    If these two politicians also are discredited seriously, or  if the parties start to unveil each other's unsavory affairs,  things will be out of control. The politicians' credibility  already has reached an all-time low, and the citizen is not  eager to witness yet another wave of scandals. If governments  were to fall or if elections were fought over the issue, with  all resulting protest votes or political instability, chaos  would be complete.    However, if this is the inevitable consequence of the  uncovering of illicit practices, then so be it. If the search  for honest political ethics means, that the political  establishment must first be cleansed, then it must be done. The  politicians, the people's representatives, owe it to themselves.    Certainly now that, as a result of the previous affair,  there  is a growing awareness that something must change, as shown by  the new mentality with regard to the regulations on party  financing. In Italy, things also had to go very badly for the  political establishment, before the situation cleared up.</p>

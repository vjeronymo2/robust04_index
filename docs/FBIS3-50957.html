			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Eduardo Campos from Tapachula, Chiapas </F> State; from the "This Sunday" program--live]    [Text] We are in the city of Tapachulas, Chiapas State, to  where we have just returned following an extensive visit along  the border area with Guatemala, the border that divides these  two countries. We were in Ciudad de Hidalgo, the last town in  Chiapas, and crossed into Tecun Uman, the first town in  Guatemala. During our visit, the Televisa news team assigned to  this area was able to learn that people have no problem in  crossing illegally into Mexico from Guatemala. It is believed  that approximately 200 people can enter Mexico every day just  through Ciudad de Hidalgo en route to the center of the country  or the interior of Chiapas. Different immigration officials  have confirmed this information. They have said surveillance in  the area between Guatemala and Mexico is low, meaning that a  large number of people is easily entering Chiapas, coming from  Central America or even South America.    We also visited the highways around the border area, linking  Tapachulas. We were able to see that there is little  surveillance, but in the major areas of Tapachula--such as the  airport, a Mexican Petroleum station, and a large park or  zoo--the Mexican Army has strong security. Also participating  in that operation are members of the state and municipal police  and the Attorney General's Office. In addition to soldiers and  Federal Judicial Police, state, and municipal police agents,  Federal Highway Police agents are deployed at the airport; they  are not letting cars go near the airport's gate. One has to  walk 150 to 200 meters from where cars are parked to be able to  enter the airport.    [Unidentified anchorman] Going back to your visit along the  border, did you see Guatemalan soldiers on the Guatemalan side?    [Campos] The military presence on the Guatemala side is even  smaller than on the Mexican side. On the Mexican side, we saw  three immigration officials on the ground; two others are  conducting an inspection in a patrol car. On the Guatemalan  side, we only saw two people manning this border area.    We specifically asked Mr. Freddy Chicago, who is on the  Mexican side, if the flow of people entering Mexico or Chiapas,  more precisely, has gone up. He replied that it has risen  considerably. On the Suchiate River side, which is where people  cross illegally, the number has also risen considerably.  Crossing the Suchiate River right now.... [pauses] Because the  river between Ciudad de Hidalgo and Tecun Uman is merely 50  centimeters deep, many people walk across, and many others use  rafts consisting of boards tied to inner tubes. They make it  across the border without problems.</p>

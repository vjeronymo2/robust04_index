			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Books: Deadly stings in the tale - Fiction SCENES FROM A POISONERS'S LIFE by Nigel Williams Faber &amp; Faber Pounds 14.99, 217 pages SWEETS FROM STRANGERS by Simon Corrigan Andre Deutsch Pounds 13.99, 180 pages A killer cleaning lady from Guatemala, an arsonist electrician, serial murder, an onanist in a coffin, racism, teenage love, middle aged love, married lust, disillusionment and mail-order Satanism; all in the cycle of a Wimbledon year - if it is Nigel Williams's SWl9. Scenes from a Poisoner's Life, Williams's most recent fictional foray into this London suburb, is a sequence of 12 tales, each offering a sting in the tail. They provide an amusing way of getting to know the family Farr and its patriarch Henry, the fat middle-aged solicitor who tried to poison his wife in Williams's The Wimbledon Poisoner. The underlying humour of is pointed up by the jokes. Like champagne bubbles, the one-liners constantly force their way to the surface. Farr's marriage is described as having survived 'like Kurt Vonnegut in Dresden, by bizarre accident', while later his wife, contemplating adultery, thinks of her husband as a man who makes 'Monsieur Bovary look like Paul Newman . . ' William's Wimbledon is a unique, rich, multi-textured if on occasion somewhat bizarre society. Even peripheral characters are deftly painted in: there is Ella-I-was-at-RADA Makepiece, while another neighbour is characterised as 'Is the Mitsubishi Scratched Yet?'. In a few words Williams can summon up the preoccupations and pathos of a life sentence in the suburbs. He is hilarious when parodying the 'hey nonny no' pretensions of Doublet and Hose, the Wimbledon Early Music Group, and disturbing when tackling the racism of affluent Middle England. If at times things get a little uncomfortable, Williams does at least temper the grotesque with a tender appraisal of the misery of the human condition. For example, when Farr is faced with overwhelming platonic love for a girl in the newsagent, 'All love did for him was to remind him of the poverty of his vocabulary.' Home-as-castle feelings are poignantly expressed when Farr and his daughter return to 'the double fronted house where all their feelings and opinions could be comfortably hidden from the outside world.' Farr asserts his existence: 'I'm just an average guy, with slightly lower-than-average feelings. But I am here. And I won't go away.' The appeal of uncomplicated domesticity is not lost on Daniel, Cambridge dropout and protagonist of Simon Corrigan's Sweets from Strangers. He flees an unsavoury past in Paris to live quietly with his sister and her family in Oxfordshire, until his previous life catches up with him. It is perhaps unfair to compare two such different books, but while Scenes From a Poisoner's Life seems confident and assured, Sweets From Strangers appears disjointed and hesitant. The latter offers some clever psychological insights, but it is difficult to get a real feeling for the characters and their world. The balming effect of Daniel's flight into the cosy banality of his sister's household and a job washing up in a local hotel is neatly summed up 'as akin to the grateful compliance of a rehabilitating addict, relieved to swap one dependence for another, even if that second consists of no more than the tending of the hospital garden.' Corrigan's writing, however, livens up when it comes to describing Luc, the decadent, charismatic homosexual who reappears in Daniel's new life; and there is a sense of relief when the inevitable happens and Daniel returns to France and, by implication, a life of pampered depravity.</p>

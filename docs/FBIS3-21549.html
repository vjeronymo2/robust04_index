The Ambassadors of Denmark, Norway, the Federal Germany,  Finland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Britain, the  United States, Canada, Sweden and Japan handed over in Kiev  Monday a message to President Leonid Kravchuk.    The document says that Western governments welcome the  ratification by the Ukrainian parliament of the Moscow statement  made by presidents of Ukraine, Russia and the United States  about the elimination of Ukrainian nuclear weapons and the fact  that the Ukrainian parliament asked the government to exchange  instruments of ratification with signatories of the START I  Treaty.    At the news conference following the meeting with Ukrainian  President, the Ambassadors of the above countries said that the  NATO governments intend to cooperate on a bilateral basis not  only in dismantling nuclear weapons, but in restoring the  environment, conversion of the military production and  re-training of the military personnel.</p>

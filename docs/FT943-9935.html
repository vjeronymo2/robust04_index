			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets STOCKHOLM The market has been in upbeat mood in recent days in anticipation of the first-half reporting season which begins this week. Figures will come from Esab, the world's leading producer of welding equipment, and SKF, the roller bearings manufacturer, which in June sharply upgraded its 1994 profit forecast, citing stronger than expected growth in volumes in its main European markets. Many investors believe that the figures will beat analysts' forecasts. UBS says that the rule of thumb tends to be that profits will need to be 10 per cent above expectations to prevent profit-taking. It believes that the first-half figures will provide pleasant surprises, particularly in the forest sector and the motor stocks. On Wednesday, Volvo aims to improve the marketability of its shares with a five-for-one share split. In Denmark, Novo Nordisk, the health care and industrial enzymes group, presents six-month figures on Wednesday. Estimates for the half-year pre-tax profit range from DKr700m to DKr980m, with the outcome affected by a DKr80m provision taken against operating expenses to cover restructuring of US companies. FRANKFURT After the strong economic data released last week, the only significant news this week will be on retail sales, which demonstrated moderate growth in May  -a trend that is expected to have continued in June. Dresdner Bank will close the banks' reporting season on Wednesday. Analysts forecast a rise in interim operating profit to around DM1bn. On Thursday, Veba releases figures for the first six months. In the first quarter, the diversified energy and chemicals company's earnings rose 34.8 per cent. In 1993, net profit fell to DM1.01bn from DM1.04bn. AMSTERDAM A heavy week of corporate results is due, starting with Polygram tomorrow and ending with Fokker and Unilever on Friday, writes John Pitt. Brokers expect most of the results to confirm the picture of a general recovery in the European economy, illustrated by the results from chemical groups Akzo Nobel and DSM last week. Only Fokker, which came under the control of Daimler-Benz of Germany last year, is likely to disappoint, says James Capel, which rates the stock as a sell. The aircraft manufacturer's share price has fallen 25 per cent since January, with investors selling heavily in March after the group announced a net loss for 1993 of Fl 460m, more than three times analysts' expectations. By contrast, Philips' second-quarter results, due on Thursday, are widely expected to confirm the group's continuing turnround following an aggressive round of cost-cutting, lower interest rates and a general improvement in consumer spending. A similar story is expected from its Polygram subsidiary, which is due to publish its first-half figures tomorrow. Among other results, Unilever, due on Wednesday, will be watched closely to see if the recent 'detergent war' with Procter &amp; Gamble has had any effect on margins. Hoare Govett believes any effect will be insignificant, and is looking for a net profit of Fl 1,055m or Fl 3.75 a share, compared with Fl 3.81 a share in the same 1993 period - the reduction due mainly to the launch of the new detergent brand in Europe. HONG KONG The market has Friday's US employment statistics to digest today, while on the corporate side Cathay Pacific announces interim results on Wednesday, ahead of parent company Swire Pacific, writes Louise Lucas. Property sales will continue to be closely monitored. Sales of apartments were oversubscribed last week, but at far more modest levels than those attained earlier in the year. Brokers reckon that property prices are starting to bottom out and confidence is beginning to trickle back into the market. The H share index, designed to track China enterprises listed in Hong Kong, is due to be launched today. However, constituent stocks have already enjoyed a healthy rally in anticipation, and are not expected to make big gains this week. The market overall is in a state of consolidation. TOKYO Last week's announcement of Japan Telecom's listing next month may spur some activity in telecommunications-related shares, writes Emiko Terazono. However, overall trading is expected to be light ahead of the Obon holidays, and the Nikkei index is likely to fluctuate around the 20,500 level. Brokers also point out that the start of the annual high-school baseball tournament always signals a downturn in volumes. 'Investors will be glued to their television sets and will have little incentive to trade,' said a UK broker. Compiled by Michael Morgan</p>

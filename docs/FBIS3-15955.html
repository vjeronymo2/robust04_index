As many people know, such a decision was made in  retaliation for Mr. Nixon's contacts that had taken place with  prominent figures of the Russian opposition. [passage omitted]    In the meantime it is becoming clear that those close to the  Russian president have different assessments of the harshness  shown to the American visitor.    For example, Andranik Migranyan, member of the Russian  Federation Presidential Council, does not see anything  objectionable in the desire of an "aging" Nixon to get an  objective idea of the political processes in Russia with the  aid, among other things, of talking with representatives of the  radical opposition in Moscow.    In this connection, Mr. Migranyan told an INTERFAX  correspondent that "he is not quite clear" about the motives of  Boris Yeltsin's refusal to receive Richard Nixon. "This is even  less clear if there had been a previous agreement and promise  from our side of having a meeting," he added.    Yeltsin's adviser thinks the trips by USSR President Mikhail  Gorbachev to the United States, during which he freely  communicated with officials and political groupings hostile to  Bill Clinton, as an analogy are appropriate.</p>

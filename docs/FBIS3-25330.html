(Please give  as much detail as you can on provinces and districts, which  should be given greater attention). What is your party's land  policy? (Give details)" -- This is the second part of the list  of questions we sent to registered political parties, with the  exception of the ruling party, the Mozambique Liberation Front  [Frelimo]. These questions fell under social programs and were  aimed at obtaining the views of the different political parties  on their strategies for social development. This is also the  second part of a theme which we began to publish last week on  these same pages. We hope to publish the third and last part in  our next edition.    For the Mozambican Nationalist Movement [Monamo/PMSD], the  policy for social progress should be:    a) Health, the foundation for health lies in preventing  different kinds of diseases, physical education, sports, and  prevention through vaccination. [passage omitted]    b) The Land Policy favored by Monamo/PMSD is to guarantee  that each rural family has sufficient land for agricultural and  livestock activities.    The right to useful land should be realized through free and  protected settlement, with minimum infrastructures, like water,  health facilities, trade, schools, and recreational centers.    The right of inheritance is significant in order to value  and  make good use of the land.  <H5>  The Mozambican National Union [Unamo] </H5>   a) Health: reconstruction and extension of the health  network. The establishment of a system of incentives for medical  personnel, with a view to increasing the quality of public  medical service, particularly with admitted patients. [passage  omitted]    b) The land belongs to the state. The state identifies those  people who have the right to a piece of land, without harming  future generations.    The sale of land to foreigners should be prohibited. They  should only obtain it through temporary contracts, without  harming the Nation. [passage omitted]  <H5>  The Mozambique Democratic Party [Pademo] </H5>   Our country has many tribes and each tribe has its own  assessment of the meaning of land. Thus, as far as Pademo is  concerned, a land policy should be drawn up by the elected  assembly in conjunction with a traditional council. The view of  our party is that people should begin to have title deeds.  Regarding foreigners, we are of the view that there should be a  limit to the amount of land they can obtain, depending on their  objectives.    In all modern societies, the defense and promotion of health  constitute a determining factor in social welfare and increasing  the capacity to carry out all kinds of tasks. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, 5 Jun (TANJUG) -- The delegation of the  Srpska Republic left the Palais des Nations in Geneva after  several postponements of the talks on a cease-fire in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Srpska republic president Radovan Karadzic  refused to say whether the delegation would return.    Earlier at a press conference Karadzic accused the Muslims  of  continually sabotaging the conference. "This is a great  humiliation for the international community which bears the  responsibility for these actions. Before the negotiations we  were asked not to set any conditions, and we stuck to that. On  the other hand, we are witnessing constant blackmail by the  Muslims. There will be no peace without a cease-fire," Karadzic  said and left the Palais des Nations with his delegation.</p>

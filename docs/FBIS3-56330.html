However, he told a press conference on Thursday that this  would be a great intellectual and labour loss for Sakhalin and  Kuril Islands.    The Korean disapora on Sakhalin consists mostly of those who  were deported to the island by the Japanese before and during  World War Two, as well as from their ancestors.    The press conference was devoted to the work of a trilateral  Russian-Japanese-South Korean Commission which studied the  problems faced by Koreans in Sakhalin.    The Korean diaspora demands a compensation of 10 million yen  for each Korean, dual Russian-Korean citizenship and free  private housing in Korea.    However, foreign diplomats told reporters that the demands  would [word indistinct] hardly met.    10 million yen is too big a sum and dual citizenship is  problematic in South Korea, they said.</p>

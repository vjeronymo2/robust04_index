			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Skiing: Pure magic in Jackson Hole FOR SKIERS, there is nowhere quite like Jackson Hole, Wyoming. But the sporting appeal goes only part of the way to explaining Jackson's qualities. If you simply moved Jackson's Rendezvous and Apre Vous mountains to the French alps - where it sounds as if they belong; they were named by early French trappers - you would have a resort no better than Les Arcs or Courchevel and perhaps not even as good as Val d'Isere or Argentiere. So, the secret is not entirely in Jackson's skiing (although, with its chutes and gullies, bowls, and wide-open, fast cruising trails, it certainly is excellent). One of the other attractions is the vast, desolate and beautiful Teton mountains with their huge, lop-sided, jagged peaks that spring up from the flat valley floor like a pre-historic tidal wave of snow-drenched granite. They have a permanently startling quality, as if the Matterhorn had suddenly reared out of a Dutch plain. Jackson has the largest elk reserve in the world, which you can view from horse-drawn sleds. The town itself - with its wooden footpaths, shops selling cowboy clothes and Indian art, and pleasantly rowdy bars - just oozes visions of the old Wild West. Even executives from rival ski resorts drool over Jackson Hole. Take Al Roman, the village manager for 20 years at Copper Mountain, Colorado. 'I just adore Wyoming,' he said. 'Hell, do you realise that the entire population of the state is only just over a quarter of a million. There's hardly any crime - there aren't enough people to form a gang. As for Jackson - what a mountain. And such a quaint old town.' There are changes afoot, though. Paul McCollister, who discovered the mountain and built the resort in the 1960s, has retired after a lengthy legal dispute with a wealthy Dutch shareholder that, effectively, put Jackson's master plan in mothballs. Others are now in charge, and one of their projects is to build badly-needed new lifts. The irresistible force of progress has returned. There is an obvious danger, of course, that Jackson could be ruined by commercialisation, strangling the very qualities which make it so attractive. There is similar concern for Telluride, another unusually beautiful ski area which celebrities have patronised as the new Aspen - to the dismay of the locals. Jackson Hole's new chief executive John Resor, seems well aware of this. A local ranch owner, with a reputation for his environmental awareness, he is determined not to kill the goose that lays such golden eggs. Jackson Hole might not be the best ski resort in the world if you count the numbers of lifts, runs and snow cannon. But if you are looking for the whole cocktail of startling scenery, exhilarating skiing, western ambience, perhaps a moose or two foraging under the cable car, and a sense of beautiful if slightly disturbing desolation - then seek no further.

			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Observer: Go-go grocer shopped Why are business schools as well as US corporations studying the food emporium in Connecticut run by go-ahead grocer Stew Leonard?

Among the stacks of meat, vegetables and so on are model cows that moo and egg-laying chickens, while staff dressed as animals roam around. Even so, it is to be hoped business schools don't start endorsing another of 62-year-old Leonard's original approaches, this time to tax accounting, just revealed in a Connecticut court. He pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the Federal Government of taxes on more than Dollars 17m sales through a sophisticated scheme to conceal part of the store's turnover. The scam involved a computer program, hidden inside a hollowed out business directory, which altered records to hide discrepancies from the auditors.</p>

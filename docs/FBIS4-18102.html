			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Trevor Mason, PRESS ASSOCIATION parliamentary chief </F> reporter]    [Excerpt] Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd insisted again  today that Britain had won important concessions from the  European Commission before agreeing to endorse the so-called  Greek compromise on voting rights.    Despite denials in Brussels yesterday, Mr Hurd told the  Commons that the EC had confirmed undertakings in relation to  health and safety issues and social affairs. "These assurances  have been given by the Commission with the full authority of  Commission President Jacques Delors, and reconfirmed this  morning," he told sceptical Opposition MPs at question time.    His comments came as the Prime Minister was facing his  biggest test yet over what has been portrayed as a "humiliating  climbdown" in the row over EU [European Union] voting rights.    The "concessions" offered by the EC were pivotal to the  Cabinet's decision yesterday to accept the compromise proposal  -- a move which led one Tory backbencher, Tony Marlow  (Northampton N), publicly to call for Mr Major to quit.    In the Commons today, Nigel Spearing (Lab Newham S) said  that  when the Commission's undertakings were put to Mr Delors  yesterday, his response had been "no, no, no!". He demanded:  "How do you reconcile that statement with what we were told  yesterday?"    Mr Hurd said: "The Commission have confirmed that their  legislative programme does not envisage the use of the health  and safety articles of the treaty other than for measures  directly and demonstrably relevant to health and safety at work.  The Commission have also confirmed that proposals in the social  chapter will not apply to the UK. For the purposes of the  agreement, the UK should be considered as a third country."    Foreign Affairs Select Committee chairman David Howell (C  Guildford) said there had been "confused and mixed reports"  about what the Commission had agreed to.    He asked for confirmation that "undertakings have been given  to relinquish back to national level, where they are far better  handled, very important regulations and controls over important  health, safety and social affairs legislation."    Mr Hurd said: "The assurances given are the ones given by  the  Prime Minister yesterday, which I have detailed again today, and  were given by the Commission with the full authority of Mr  Delors and reconfirmed this morning."    Tory Winston Churchill (Davyhulme) said that while welcoming  enlargement of the EU, there was "an overwhelming majority of  people in the UK and a significant element among our EU partners  that does not wish to see us end up in a centralised federal  Europe."    He asked: "Will you undertake to fight all the way to ensure  that when this matter comes up to be decided again in 1996, we  have as many allies as possible to ensure that national rights  and sovereignty are not ridden over roughshod."    Mr Hurd said he was right and that there was a "growing  number of people right across Europe who reject the idea of a  centralised super state. There was a time when people felt that  in order to be a good European you had to believe that executive  power should be moved step by step to the centre. That is no  longer the belief of sensible people -- for example Chancellor  Kohl (of Germany)."    To Labour jeers, he said this would be a principal issue in  the forthcoming European elections, because it separated the  Tories from Labour.    Shadow foreign secretary Dr Jack Cunningham accused him of  misrepresentation. There was no question of his party  supporting a federal Europe, or abandoning the position of  requiring unanimity on economic, foreign and defence policy  issues, he said.    Mr Hurd said Labour leader John Smith had signed up to the  Euro Socialist manifesto and said that majority voting should be  the norm. "It is not the norm now," he said.    He told Tory James Paice (Cambridgeshire SE) that in 1996  "we  will be looking forward to a community not of 16, but  considerably larger and the kind of arguments which have been  tossed about in this House in recent months and years will be  well out of date by then. I cannot imagine that the EU will be  able to accommodate more members than 16 without a very radical  look at many aspects of its institutions and policies, such as  the common agricultural policy."

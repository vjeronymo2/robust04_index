			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Albania starts to lift barriers in investment drive ALBANIA will introduce foreign investment and joint-venture legislation, as well as measures to privatise sectors of the economy, as part of the government's plan to boost foreign trade and modernise the economy, Mr Ligor Dhamo, president of the Albanian Chamber of Commerce, said yesterday in London. Mr Dhamo, who with Mr Spartak Mersini, a senior official at the Albanian ministry of foreign trade, was on a three-day visit to the UK, said Albania was in desperate need of foreign investment to revamp food processing, light industry and other sectors of the economy. Last year, Albania had a trade deficit of Dollars 200m (Pounds 118m), a per capita annual income of Dollars 850, and over-employment of 30 per cent in the industrial sector, or about 93,000 people. Mr Dhamo said the prospect for a resumption of full diplomatic relations between Tirana and London 'in the near future', and Albania's determination to modernise its economy, would increase trade between both countries. Total trade turnover last year was less than Dollars 3m. Diplomatic relations were severed in 1939. Attempts to restore them failed in 1946 after the Corfu Channel incident in which two British destroyers were mined off the coast of Albania. Western investors had few incentives to trade with Albania because policies undertaken by Mr Enver Hoxha, the former communist president who died in 1985, banned foreign credits as part of his ideological policy of self-reliance and independ ence. But yesterday, Mr Dhamo said policies now pursued by the recently-elected parliament, which is dominated by the Albanian (communist) Party of Labour, would open up the country to foreign investment. In particular, he said new draft laws would: allow foreign enterprises, banks and foreign nationals to set up companies in Albania; safeguard those investments against expropriation or nationalisation; guarantee the right for full repatriation of profits - in hard currency. In a speech to British companies, however, Mr Dhamo said the authorities would establish a 'system of custom duties of a protectionist character for significant final products and sectors of the economy. 'Gradually, this system will be adjusted to the structures and levels of the tariff of international trade organisations of Gatt, the European Community, which we want to join.' The parliament were drafting a tax system which envisaged tax holidays of up to three years for foreign investors, and thereafter, rates of taxes of between 15 and 40 per cent. 'But I think the average tax will be around 20 per cent,' he said. Foreign companies, however, would not be allowed to own or buy property in Albania. 'They will be allowed to rent property,' he explained. A draft law on privatisation, expected to be unveiled later this year, will seek to clarify ownership and property rights. The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office yesterday extended the Know-How Fund to Romania in recognition of the country's committment to reform. The amount of financial assistance was not specified, however. The fund provides banking, accountancy and finance advice and expertise to help the countries of eastern Europe in their moves towards democracy and a free market.</p>

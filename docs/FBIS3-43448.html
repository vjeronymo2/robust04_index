At a news conference  on Friday, PAC Regional Executive Committee members said the  movement's lawyers would also assist relatives of Siphiwo Sam to  lay a murder charge against police following an autopsy on the  dead boy.    The organisation on Friday sought a meeting with Deputy  Regional Police Commissioner Maj-Gen Nick Snyman to discuss the  police raid.    Although it has not lodged a complaint with the Transitional  Executive Council, the PAC called on the Independent Electoral  Commission and other transitional structures to "prove that they  have teeth" and act firmly against the security forces.    Siphiwo, a standard six pupil at Langa comprehensive school,  was killed when violence erupted outside the Luyolo community  centre in Gugulethu after police raided a PAC meeting to arrest  suspects allegedly linked to last week's Heidelberg Tavern  attack. Police claim they fired rubber bullets and bird shot  after a crowd stoned them and tried to free nine young men from  a police vehicle.    However, PAC officials described the police version as "a  brutal lie" and said police had set dogs on PAC members and  opened fire without warning when angry supporters protested  against the arrests.    The police action was strongly condemned on Friday by  Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who said police appeared to  have exceeded the bounds of a normal criminal investigation in  order to harass the PAC.    PAC National Executive Committee member Patricia de Lille  told journalists on Friday PAC leaders had appealed to police to  postpone the arrests "until things calmed down".    However, a police team led by violent crime unit head Col  Leonard Knipe had insisted on identifying the alleged suspects  and removing them for questioning. "The meeting agreed that they  could look around. We allowed them to carry out their duty, but  we did not give them permission to remove anyone."    Mrs de Lille and other regional officials later accompanied  the police to Bellville, where murder and robbery squad  detectives released the men after questioning, fingerprinting  and photographing them. She said the fact that all nine were  subsequently released indicated that police had acted on false  information supplied by informers.    "The PAC has always said the police are racist and brutal  when dealing with black people. We wish they could show more  efficiency to find the killers of more than 10,000 (black)  african people who have died in South Africa in the past three  years."    PAC Regional Secretary Bathembu Lugulwana said three men and  a woman were still being treated for gunshot wounds in local  hospitals. He confirmed that a third member of the PAC in the  western Cape, Richard Dala, was detained by police on Thursday.  Two other regional officials, Theo Mabusela and Michael Siyolo,  are being held under Section 29 of the Internal Security Act.    Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel also announced on  Thursday that two "confirmed" members of the PAC's armed wing,  the Azanian Peoples Liberation Army [APLA], had been arrested  near Elliot in the north-eastern Cape.    Mr Lugulwana said police had refused to supply the names of  the two men detained in Elliot to the PAC. "They could have  picked up anyone and now they claim they are APLA," he said.</p>

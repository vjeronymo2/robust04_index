			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Management: Dragon boats in contract race - Taiwan's ancient sport has acquired a special dimension for civil engineering The sculpted ice model of a dragon-shaped boat dripped water from its nostrils under the heat of spotlights at the Taipei Bankers Club. The occasion was a reception held by Nuclear Electric, the UK's state-owned nuclear power company, which had gathered its team of local contractors for a progress report on what may be one of Britain's most lucrative civil engineering exports - the construction of a Pounds 1.4bn nuclear power station in Taiwan. The reception and the model had been arranged around the Nuclear Electric team's visit to compete in Taiwan's annual dragon boat races a few weeks ago. The roots of this sport, in which large canoe-like boats sprint frantically against each other over a few hundred metres, go back to ancient China. Today it is part of the sporting calendar in Taiwan, China and Hong Kong. In India and Bangladesh, the vessels are called peacock boats, in Japan perion boats. Since the annual Hong Kong dragon boat festival introduced international races in 1976, corporate teams and rowing clubs have developed the sport across the globe; it is proving increasingly popular because of its team-building qualities and the scope for sponsorship. Nuclear Electric has advanced the concept, using its dragon boat team as ambassadors for the company, both in the field of nuclear politics and in the more subtle art of securing business in East Asia. It was no coincidence that the dragon boat was in Taipei at the same time that Taipower, the potential customer, was considering sealed bids for the Lungmen Island nuclear power plant project at Yenliao, 40 miles north of Taipei. The British company crew could not directly influence the bid - one of three submitted by worldwide consortia - but the feeling was that by demonstrating its interest in Taiwanese sport, Nuclear Electric was helping to make its presence felt more acutely in a difficult market for British companies. The impact of dragon boat racing in East Asia should not be underestimated. According to figures supplied by the British Dragon Boat Racing Association, the sport has grown so large in China that 20m Chinese now compete. Grandstands and a four-star hotel are being constructed at Yueyang, in Hunan, the spiritual home of the sport and the site of its first official world championships in June next year. In the contract bidding, one of Nuclear Electric's problems has been that nominally it is merely the principal sub-contractor in a bid headed by Westinghouse, the US conglomerate. According to executives, Taipower was against the submission of joint bids. So the challenge has been to ensure that the Taiwanese are fully aware of its contribution to what it considers is as much a European as a US bid, while not disturbing its relationship with Westinghouse or its growing understanding with Taipower. Rival consortia are led by Combustion Engineering, a US subsidiary of ABB, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, and Framatome, of France. Guy Stanton, a commercial services executive and, until a few weeks ago, Nuclear Electric's only representative in Taiwan, is the man charged with leading the delicate negotiations. 'My role has been to raise the profile of Nuclear Electric in a country that had neither heard of the company nor of Sizewell B, the pressure water reactor that we designed (in the UK) and which forms the basis of this bid,' he explains. 'In Taiwanese eyes, we are a contractor, but it's critical that we have a presence since it's our design that we are selling, and we have as big an interest as Westinghouse in the project.' While local contractors would be involved in much of the construction, the deal, to build a power plant that, like Sizewell C, is double the capacity of Sizewell B, would be worth Pounds 700m and 5,000 jobs for UK exporters, almost equal to the whole of UK exports to the country in 1993. But the British company is up against a French design, older but almost certainly cheaper, and a US bid which is state of the art. In commercial terms, the biggest obstacle may prove to be price, even allowing for the series of industrial incentives for Taiwan built into the Westinghouse/Nuclear Electric proposal. Politics is also bound to play a part, however, since none of the nations bidding for contracts officially recognises Taiwan. Each treads a diplomatic tightrope. Philip Morrice, director of the British Trade and Cultural Office, which has a significant but discreet Foreign Office involvement, is the nearest the UK has to an ambassador in Taipei. He has only now succeeded in calming tensions caused by political reservations and adverse UK press reactions to the Pounds 157m Hualon textile group investment in Northern Ireland, supported by a Pounds 61m grant from the UK public purse. One of his chief roles is to promote the Westinghouse-Nuclear Electric power station bid. One way to do so is to highlight the difficulties that have emerged in Taiwan's biggest transport project, the French-built Mass Rapid Transit System, still unfinished after problems with an untried rail car. 'It's the most expensive transport system in the world, with no passengers as yet,' he says disparagingly. The hope of the US-British team is that this will work to Westinghouse-Nuclear Electric's advantage when the bidders stress the merits of what they claim is a 'proven' power station design. Perhaps the most complex area of all in a project of this size in Taiwan is assessing the importance of guanxi, roughly translated as 'connections'. 'You cannot overestimate the significance of the political massaging that goes on,' says one British businessman with years of experience in the island. In a country where the politics are anathema to the British way of business, that may prove too great an obstacle. 'They tend to want visits by royalty and recognition; the sort of things that, because of the political situation, we cannot provide,' says one observer. As one member of the Nuclear Electric party put it: 'If Britain was to recognise Taiwan tomorrow the contract would be ours, but that is not going to happen.' Europeans who work in Taipei consider the tight-knit local business community enormously difficult to penetrate. Politically, the country remains sensitive to western opinion but it is anxious to take advantage of the emerging economic strength of south Asia in forging new business deals with the west. In response to these challenges, Taiwan is working hard to shake off its reputation for turning out cheap down-market products and its government has been taking a tough line on counterfeiting. Nor can business visitors avoid the political inertia that has developed since the end of martial law in 1987. Getting things done is proving more difficult. In the midst of this political climate - the freer society has also led to western-style anti-nuclear protests - the public relations value to Nuclear Electric of spending Pounds 40,000 to send a 21-strong dragon boat team to Taiwan is hard to gauge. The event was certainly covered in newspapers and on television, which will have taken the company's name into Taiwanese homes - especially since the boat came fifth out of a field of more than 50. The crew is philosophical about its impact on the power station bidding. Most of its members would agree with the sentiments of Morrice, who said he could not put his hand on his heart and declare that the Hartlepool crew would win the contract for Nuclear Electric. But, as he said: 'It's a nice gesture and certainly does no harm.'</p>

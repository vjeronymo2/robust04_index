			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Currencies' wobbly week SHORTLY before the new year, foreign exchange dealers warned that the first week of 1993 would see intense volatility in the currency markets. The last five days have proved them true, writes James Blitz. The start of every year tends to be marked by heavy trading in currencies. Dealers in the main banks start off with new balance sheets: they have no profits to lose and are therefore less averse to taking risks when buying currencies. Many fund managers also make their portfolio allocations for the year at about this time, increasing financial flows around the world. This week, the trading has been more intense because of speculation that the French franc might need to be devalued inside the Exchange Rate Mechanism. At the start of the week, the Bundesbank showed no sign of reducing its short-term interest rates, a stance that led to heavy flows into the D-Mark. This put renewed pressure on the franc, raising suspicions that France would be unable to maintain the high interest rates needed to support the franc within the system. On Thursday, the Bundesbank made what may have been a significant move, cutting its money market dealing rate by 15 basis points to 8.60 per cent. The cut may have been small, but it was seen as an important signal that Germany will defend the franc at any cost. However, the Bundesbank may have to cut rates again, if it is to avoid renewed volatility. ***** The French franc came under strong selling pressure on Monday, bottoming out at FFr3.4190 to the D-Mark, just above its ERM floor of FFr3.4305. France raised rates on Tuesday to counter the moves. The franc rallied back above the FFr3.40 on Thursday night after the Bundesbank had cut money market rates earlier in the day. ***** The punt fell below its ERM floor of BFr54.025 against the Belgian franc on Wednesday, as devaluation fears grew. Ireland's central bank raised the overnight lending rate to 100 per cent on Thursday night, but the punt was still below its ERM floor yesterday. Dealers remained pessimistic about chances of avoiding a realignment. ***** The Danish krone came under renewed pressure on Monday falling to DKr3.8800 to the D-Mark, in relation to its ERM floor of DKr3.9016. The currency appreciated to around DKr3.862 to the D-Mark yesterday, following Germany's move on rates. Growing political problems in Denmark may affect the currency in the next few weeks. ***** The dollar broke through Dollars 1.64 to the D-Mark yesterday, following stronger-than-expected employment figures, but it later fell back to close at DM1.6375. There were rumours that the Bundesbank intervened on Thursday and Friday, selling the US currency, for fear that a strong dollar will add to imported inflation in Germany. ***** Sterling rallied 4 cents against the dollar in London on Wednesday, closing at Dollars 1.5455. However, it slipped back sharply against the US currency yesterday, as investors grew increasingly confident about the scale of the economic upturn in the US. Some investors believe the pound could slip as low as Dollars 1.40 later this year. ***** Sterling enjoyed a remarkable six-pfennig rally against the D-Mark on Wednesday and Thursday as ERM tensions encoyuraged investors to buy pounds as a temporary 'safe haven'. Sterling temporarily slipped at one stage yesterday, after Germany's rates cut eased pressures in the ERM. But the pound remains well underpinned. ***** The Italian lira slipped sharply against European currencies as dealers took a negative view of the Bank of Italy's easing of monetary policy late last year. After closing at L909.5 to the D-Mark in London last weekend, the Italian currency was as low as L940.00 to the D-Mark at Tuesday night's close but rose to L925.00 yesterday.</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Finance and Investment (5): Wall Street's knight to quit - Profile / Sir Dennis Weatherstone Back in 1988, an internal memorandum at J P Morgan outlined the ambition: within five years, the prestigious but somewhat staid US commercial bank would earn Dollars 200m-Dollars 300m a year before tax from the securities business. It proved a massive under-assessment. Due in large part to the most benign bond markets in memory, earnings in 1993 from the securities markets soared. Revenues from trading topped Dollars 2bn (more than twice the level of the year before.) It was a powerful endorsement for the strategy pursued by Sir Dennis Weatherstone, the bank's chairman and chief executive since the beginning of 1990. A Briton by birth, Sir Dennis (he was knighted in 1990) had risen through the ranks at J P Morgan over 47 years (48 by the time he retires at the end of this year.) Taking over from long-time chairman Lewis Preston, Sir Dennis inherited a plan first outlined at the bank in the late 1970s. A secular decline in the lending business and the growth of capital markets threatened Morgan's long-standing and influential relationships with some of the US's most powerful corporations. The answer, the bank decided, was to extend its reach into the underwriting and trading of securities, becoming a US version of the universal banks which bestride the commercial and investment banking businesses in continental Europe (though at the time, US regulation required a strict separation between the two.) Under Sir Dennis, Morgan has made greater headway in implementing that plan than anyone expected. Given powers to underwrite and trade corporate bonds in the US in 1989 and, a year later, to enter the equity market, Morgan has made rapid strides in the capital markets business - last year, it ranked seventh in the US league table of debt and equity underwriters. Also, aided by the triple-A credit rating that makes it an attractive counterparty in the swaps markets, the bank has become one of the big Wall Street trading houses. Earlier this month, Sir Dennis announced his intention to retire at the end of the year, shortly after reaching the age of 64. He collected Dollars 6.6m in compensation in 1993 for his efforts and the plaudits of US banking analysts. Yet for all that, the British-born chairman leaves the bank with nagging questions hanging over it. Wall Street remains sceptical about Morgan's earnings prospects: having reached a high of close to Dollars 80 a year ago, the bank's share price has slipped to a little over Dollars 60 now. At a multiple of around nine times estimated 1994 earnings, the market is indicating it has yet to be convinced of the consistency of the new Morgan's performance. It is the bank's greater involvement in the trading business, which fuelled 1993 earnings, that lies behind the concern. With the turn in US interest rates and the end of the bull market in bonds around the world early this year, Morgan's trading revenues have sagged. Compared with average quarterly earnings from trading of more than Dollars 500m in 1993, the first two quarters of this year produced an average of Dollars 292m. Are the new Morgan's earnings as volatile as any other investment bank, soaring and plunging with the markets? Sir Dennis has been close to the financial markets for much of his life. Starting out at the age of 16 as a clerk in the foreign exchange department of the London office of Guaranty Trust (which later merged with J P Morgan,) he rose to become head of foreign exchange. With his north London, working class background he was made an unlikely chairman of the US's most prestigious corporate bank. Sir Dennis refuses to be drawn into a discussion about how the stockmarket values Morgan. 'No chairman is ever happy with his share price,' he muses. However, he defends Morgan against charges that its profits are now prey to the vagaries of the financial markets. For a start, the bank's trading revenues suffered less than many of its investment banking rivals during the turbulent first half of the year. 'Trading in difficult markets, we've done very, very well,' he says. Also, he argues, Morgan has a strong core of earnings from trading with corporate and institutional customers, and does not rely on profits from dealing for its own account. It is a familiar argument, but one which the market continues to treat with some caution. While the volatility of earnings remains the biggest concern, there are two other big questions which Sir Dennis's successor, Douglas Warner, will have to face. First, for all its successes, Morgan has yet to break into the so-called 'Bulge Bracket' of banks which dominate the underwriting business in the US  -Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Salomon, Morgan Stanley and CS First Boston. Although the leading underwriter outside this pack, its market share last year was less than half that of its next biggest rival, CS First Boston. And while it made a quick mark in the bond business, climbing rapidly up the underwriting league tables, the equity market is proving more difficult. Sir Dennis cautions against paying too much attention to league tables. Morgan's plan has involved building on its existing corporate relationships, he says. The trick is to keep expanding the range of services it performs for those customers, rather than to rush out to buy market share. Second, Morgan will have to tread the fine line between exerting a more aggressive stance on behalf of its customers, while protecting its own high-quality reputation. It is a balance that the bank has struck well so far - though paradoxically, that very success throws into sharp relief any errors of judgment. That became clear earlier this year, with the upheaval at Banesto, a Spanish bank in which a Morgan-organised investment partnership had invested Dollars 160m. 'With the benefit of hindsight, it doesn't look too good,' says Sir Dennis. 'I don't think it was our glorious moment . . . But we're not going to go through our business and not make any mistakes, anywhere.'</p>

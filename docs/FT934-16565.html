			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Growth of Japan surplus slackens JAPAN'S current account surplus expanded to Dollars 7.23bn (Pounds 4.77bn) in August, slightly less than the market had expected. This represented a slower growth of the surplus. The August current account surplus is compared with Dollars 6.73bn in the equivalent month of 1992 and still puts Japan on track to exceed last year's surplus of Dollars 117.55bn, a big factor in strained trade relations with the US. Tokyo economists are expected to reduce their consensus forecast for a Dollars 144bn surplus this year, in the light of the new figures. 'Import volumes are down, but export volumes are down a little more,' said Mr James Vestal, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Japan. He forecasts a Dollars 133bn surplus for the year. In yen terms, imports fell by 10 per cent and exports by 13 per cent. The dollar trade surplus accordingly fell slightly, from Dollars 9.08bn in August 1992 to Dollars 8.97bn in August this year. Imports can be expected to go on falling, on the evidence of the weakness of domestic demand highlighted by the latest statistics. An Industrial Bank of Japan survey shows that companies plan to reduce investment on plant and equipment by 2.3 per cent this year, the second year of decline. Manufacturers, saddled with over-capacity built up during the buoyant growth of the end of the 1980s, will cut capital investment more heavily than service industries, said the bank's survey of 3,678 companies. Leasing contracts concluded in August fell by an annualised 13 per cent, the 17th month of decline, the Japan Leasing Association announced yesterday. Machine tool orders, another bellwether of the industrial economy, fell by 19.9 per cent to Y40.6bn (Pounds 253m), the lowest since this series of records began 10 years ago, the Japan machine tool builders' industry association said.</p>

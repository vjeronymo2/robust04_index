			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Doctor of Philosophical Sciences Valeriy </F> Khmelko, chief of the department of sociology at the Kiev-Mohyla  Academy University, under the rubric "Election 94, 27 March":  "Preelection Attitudes of the Urban Population of Ukraine: Who  Intends To Turn Out for the Elections, Who Does Not, and Who Is  Not Sure"]    [Text] The Kiev International Institute of Sociology  and the department of sociology of the Kiev-Mohyla Academy  University have taken a representative sample survey of the  adult urban population of Ukraine. Here are some data reflecting  the status of the corresponding public opinion as of the  beginning of 1994. Some 1,677 persons aged 18 or over were  polled by the interview method in Kiev and 102 other cities and  urban-type settlements of all 24 oblasts of Ukraine and Crimea.  These persons were selected by methods which ensure highly  representative levels of data--with a relative error at the  level of +/-3.2 percent.    One of the questions was as follows: "Had the election  campaign been already completed, and the elections held today,  would you take part?" Some 52 percent responded in the  affirmative, 33 percent in the negative, and 15 percent had not  made a determination. Therefore, for now almost one-half  of the voters in the cities of Ukraine have no firm intention of  turning out for the elections. Meanwhile, under the law  elections are considered valid only if no fewer than one-half of  the citizens who are entitled to vote take part in them. Thus,  the question "Will the elections be valid?" is not rhetorical at  present but rather genuinely problematical. For this reason, it  is worthwhile to analyze which social attributes and views on  contemporary problems distinguish those who intend to turn out  for the elections, those who do not, and those who are  hesitating.    The relevant analysis indicates that voters who intend to  vote in the elections are encountered with equal frequency among  men and women (52 percent). The proportion of such voters  increases with age: They account for only 43 percent of voters  aged under 30, 47 percent of voters aged between 31 and 45, as  many as 58 percent of voters aged 46 to 60, and 62 percent of  voters over 60. Therefore, there are almost 1.5 times fewer  young people than elderly who are disposed to take part in the  elections.    The proportion of such voters is appreciably greater among  people with a higher education (58 percent) than among those  with a secondary education (49 percent); it is also higher among  managers (62 percent) and specialists (55 percent) than among  clerical employees (48 percent) and workers (48 percent).  Besides this, voters who intend to vote are relatively more  numerous among believers (56 percent) than among nonbelievers  (49 percent), and among Ukrainians (54 percent) than among  Russians (48 percent). To be sure, there are considerably fewer  such voters among Russian-speaking Ukrainians (50 percent) than  among Ukrainian-speaking Ukrainians (60 percent).    Voters who make the position of abstention dominant (who  intend to refrain from participation in the elections) are more  frequently encountered among women (35 percent) than among men  (29), and among people under 35 (39 percent) than among the  people aged 36 to 55 (31 percent) and over 55 (27 percent).    The proportion of potentially abstaining voters is higher  among voters with a complete secondary education (35 percent)  than among voters with an education below secondary (32 percent)  or with a higher education (27 percent). It is also relatively  higher among clerical employees (36 percent) than among managers  (29 percent) and specialists (28 percent). Besides, such voters  are more numerous among nonbelievers (35 percent) than among  believers (31 percent), and among Russians (38 percent) and  other ethnic minorities (38 percent) than among Ukrainians (30  percent), including Russian-speaking Ukrainians (30 percent).    Voters who have not yet decided whether or not to turn out  for the elections are almost 1.5 times more numerous among men  (19 percent) than among women (13 percent); they are also more  numerous among young people under 30 (18 percent) than among the  elderly over 60 (12 percent). Other age brackets occupy an  intermediate position on this score: The proportion of voters  who are not sure comes to 16 percent among people in the 31-45  and 46-60 age groups.    The degree of readiness to participate in the elections is  also quite different among residents of various regions of  Ukraine. The results of an analysis of the heterogeneity of  political orientation of the electorate of Ukraine that were  obtained in our previous research indicate the feasibility of  characterizing the Western, Central, Southern and Eastern  Regions separately, if we place, respectively, Transcarpathian,  Ivano-Frankovsk, Chernovtsy, Khmelnitskiy, Ternopol, Lvov,  Volyn, and Rovno Oblasts in the Western Region (22 percent of  the voters of Ukraine); Zhytomir, Vinnitsa, Kirovograd,  Cherkassy, Kiev, Chernigov, Sumy, and Poltava Oblasts and the  city of Kiev in the Central Region (30 percent of voters);  Dnepropetrovsk, Zaporozhye, Kherson, Nikolayev, and Odessa  Oblasts and Crimea in the Southern Region (26 percent of  voters); and Kharkov, Donetsk, and Lugansk Oblasts in the  Eastern Region (22 percent of voters in Ukraine).    An analysis of the regional breakdown of answers by  respondents to questions concerning readiness to take part in  the elections indicated that potential abstainers are the most  numerous among the urban population of the Southern Region--37  percent. They account for 32 percent of the urban population of  the Eastern and Western Regions, and 30 percent in the Central  Region. The Eastern Region has the greatest reserve of electoral  activity: The proportion of voters who are not sure whether to  turn out for the elections comes to 21 percent there. This is  almost two times more than in the Western Region, where such  voters account for only 11 percent. The Central and Southern  Regions are in an intermediate position on this score: They  have, respectively, 14 and 16 percent of such voters.    Voters prepared to take part in the voting are the most  numerous among the urban population of the Western and Central  regions--they account for 57 percent in each. Such voters  account for less than one half of the urban population in the  Southern and Eastern Regions--47 and 48 percent, respectively.    During the last elections, the percentage of voters who  turned out to vote was not much greater (or not greater at all)  than the percentage of respondents who responded in the  affirmative to the question of their intentions concerning  participation in voting. For this reason, the percentage of such  responses registered in the Eastern and Southern Regions prompts  us to evaluate the likelihood of the failure of the elections in  a significant proportion of urban electoral districts in these  regions as quite high. This is particularly the case with the  section of the Southern Region including Kherson, Nikolayev, and  Odessa Oblasts and the Crimea. There, the proportion of urban  voters who intend to take part in the elections comes to only 36  percent +/-6 percent at present, with 0.95 probability.    If the propensity of voters to take part in voting grows as  the date of the elections to the Supreme Council draws nearer,  the projection for holding the elections will be favorable.  However, if the abstention sentiment mounts (as has been the  case over at least the last six to eight months), the projection  will naturally be unfavorable.    Which variant of the projection is probable?    This has to do with the fact that the propensity to take  part  in the elections (which depends on many factors) is also quite  closely associated with the assessment of the general state of  affairs in Ukraine. Among those who believe that things are  moving in the right direction on the whole, 73 percent of voters  intend to vote, whereas among those who believe that they are  moving in the wrong direction, only 50 percent intend to vote.  There are no optimistic expectations as of now. Thus, the  unfavorable projection concerning the completeness of the  holding of the parliamentary elections is more probable than the  favorable one.    Therefore, the question arises: If elections are not validly  held in many districts, what is the number of elected deputies  at which the elections will be considered to have been validly  held in Ukraine as a whole? That is to say, what is the number  of newly elected deputies at which it is possible to consider  that a new composition of the Supreme Council has emerged to  which the current Supreme Council should yield its powers?  Perhaps not at any number? For example, should it surrender its  powers if deputies are elected in less than 50 percent of the  districts?    The Law "On the Election of People's Deputies" does not  provide an answer to this question. It regulates establishing  the results of elections only in an individual electoral  district. For this reason, taking into account the unfavorable  projection with regard to holding valid elections in a  considerable number of electoral districts, would it not be  worthwhile for the Supreme Council to regulate the establishment  of election results in the entirety of electoral districts of  Ukraine as a whole ahead of time in order to prevent a situation  in which the legitimacy of both compositions of the Supreme  Council--the current and the newly elected--is called into doubt?</p>

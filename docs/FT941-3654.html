			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Costain Pounds 68.7m in the black - Balance sheet back in shape after Australian coal mining disposals Costain Group, the construction and mining group which was seriously threatened during the recession, bounced back into the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 68.7m for 1993. That compared with losses of Pounds 204.6m for the previous year. The directors said , however, that trading conditions remained difficult and that it was unlikely dividend payments would be resumed before 1995. All but Pounds 200,000 of last year's profits was raised from the sale of the group's Australian coal mining business to Peabody, part of Hanson, the industrial conglomerate. The sale, together with proceeds from last autumn's Pounds 83.9m rights issue, enabled Costain to reduce net debt from Pounds 331m to Pounds 83m taking gearing down to 37 per cent of increased shareholders fund of Pounds 228m. Interest costs, however, rose from Pounds 18.9m to Pounds 22.1m due mainly to the strengthening of the US dollar and bringing off-balance sheet loans on to the balance sheet. Mr Peter Costain, chief executive, said interest payments should fall sharply in the current year when the group would have the benefit of sale and rights issue proceeds for a full 12 months. Nonetheless, borrowings were likely to rise again this year due to the timing of capital investment in the US, payments to US sub-contractors and spending on the Spitalfields development in London. Borrowings were expected to fall sharply again in 1995. Turnover on continuing activities remained static at Pounds 1.1bn (1.17bn) while earnings per share recovered to 18.8p (losses 84.6p), including profit on disposals. In addition to its financial achievements, the group also increased operating profits. Engineering and construction made profits of Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 5.3m deficit) on a reduced turnover of Pounds 808m (Pounds 934m). Almost two-fifths of the group's construction order book is for higher margin overseas work, of which about half is in Hong Kong where the group is involved in the construction of the new airport and the Tsing Ma bridge. US coal mining also reported improved profits which rose from Pounds 6.1m to Pounds 8.3m. Severe winter weather, however, had meant that the business had got off to a poor start in the first few months of this year. COMMENT Costain, having got its balance sheet back in shape, has made no secret of the fact that it faces another tough trading year. Forecasts for 1994 profits will not have been improved by warnings of a poor start by US coal and a slowdown in the rate at which international construction orders are being won. Meanwhile, gearing could climb to more than 50 per cent this year before getting back to nearer 30 per cent in 1995. Group profits for 1994 may be no more than Pounds 6m-Pounds 8m. Analysts are looking for no more than Pounds 15m in 1995 but this could rise further if Costain's investment to improve coal mining productivity starts to pay off. The stock has been through too much to start recommending it now on the basis of jam tomorrow.</p>

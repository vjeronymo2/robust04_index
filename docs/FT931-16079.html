			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / International Company News: Eastern fledglings seek western partners - The former Communist-run airlines of eastern Europe need to modernise their ageing fleets fast, but most of them lack resources BALKAN, the Bulgarian airline, this week added its name to the growing list of eastern European carriers that are queueing to find western partners. The country's privatisation agency said that SG Warburg, the UK merchant bank, had been appointed to help find one or more 'strategic partners' as part of a privatisation plan. The Bulgarian move follows similar deals elsewhere in eastern Europe. Last month, Malev, the Hungarian flag carrier, made Dollars 77m by selling 35 per cent of its shares to Italian investors led by Alitalia, the state airline. Earlier in 1992, an Air France-led consortium paid Dollars 60m for 40 per cent of CSA, the airline of the Czech and Slovak republics. Airlines such as Malev, CSA and LOT of Poland need to modernise fast. Noise restrictions at many western airports are limiting opportunities for fleets still dominated by ageing Soviet-built jets. Compared with their latest-generation western rivals, the ageing aircraft also guzzle prodigious amounts of fuel. East European carriers lack the resources to replace their fleets overnight. Some have acquired, on lease, a handful of new aircraft for their most important European or intercontinental routes. But so far, such aircraft form only a fraction of their fleets. 'As far as western European traffic is concerned, we have to modernise and buy western aircraft,' says Mr Andras Pakay, Malev's chief executive. 'The market demands that.' Linking with a western partner provides not just cash for the airline - as in the Malev deal - or the government, but technical and commercial know-how too. A year after its deal with Air France, CSA's advertising has smartened up noticeably. The airline's commercial edge will be 'even sharper this year', says one banker closely involved in the deal. CSA's catering building has been upgraded, and the arrival of two French chefs 'didn't do any harm'. Above all, the company's commercial team gained 'a new lease of life' following the transaction, he believes. Most east European airlines fear their domestic markets are too small to support the kind of growth they envisage. And with the airline business gradually moving towards bigger, 'global' carriers, many east European executives fear their companies will be sidelined. Selling a stake to a western partner can provide cash and expertise without sacrificing independence, but so far, only Malev and CSA have succeeded. Balkan hopes to sell up to 49 per cent of its stock to foreigners, while letting employees take up to 20 per cent at discounted prices. The government would keep at least 40 per cent in order to guarantee the company's independence. 'A key element of our strategy is to enter a strategic alliance with an airline partner,' says Mr Kostadin Botev, Balkan's managing director. 'We believe potential partners will be attracted by our route network and low labour cost base.' But making a match is not easy, even for an airline like Malev with a relatively good reputation and consistent profits over the past four years. Malev's productivity, at Dollars 66,000 operating revenue per employee, is 50 per cent above the average for eastern Europe's five flag-carriers: net earnings last year amounted to Dollars 28m on sales of Dollars 315m. Credit Suisse First Boston, the adviser to the Hungarian government, had to tout Malev widely before securing a partner. Alitalia, Lufthansa of Germany, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and British Airways all showed interest, although BA and KLM quickly dropped out. That left Alitalia and Lufthansa. Although the latter seemed the obvious choice, given the strong commercial and cultural links between Bonn and Budapest, Alitalia's cash offer easily beat the Dollars 59m put forward by the Germans, of which just Dollars 10m was in cash and the remainder in know-how and equipment. The terms from Lufthansa, which faces an estimated DM600m (Dollars 377.3m) loss for 1992, and the other airlines' decisions to pull out shows how the recession has complicated matters for the east Europeans. Alitalia's managing director, Mr Giovanni Bisignani, says any airline carrying less than 25m passengers a year - what he calls the 'critical mass' - will have to look for allies. But with growing financial difficulties, even western Europe's smaller carriers are not rushing to buy market share in the east through alliances. In the circumstances, some east European companies may prefer to go it alone: hence the confusion over plans by LOT. Some bankers say LOT has already hired and fired at least one set of advisers. However, LOT executives claim it is in a relatively strong position, in spite of Poland's economic difficulties. Their confidence is based on its large home market: Poland's population is around 40m and it lies on the major east-west air corridor. 'We haven't received any special offers and we're not looking too hard at the moment,' says Mr Zbigniew Kiszczak, LOT's deputy chairman. LOT wants a 'strategic alliance' with a European or US airline, while retaining its independence. The Poles are seeking mutual access to booking systems and ticket sales, and an agreement on routes and servicing, but are not rushing to sell equity, in spite of the burden of 600bn zloty (Dollars 38.1m) in unpaid taxes and a 240bn zloty debt to Warsaw's Okecie airport. 'LOT is the most attractive of the remaining east European airlines without partners,' says one banker. With Lufthansa probably ruled out on political and historical grounds, and British Airways already commited to ventures in Moscow and Berlin, partnership with the Poles could appeal to a regional carrier such as Scandinavia's SAS, which has so far been disappointed in its plans to build alliances, he reckons. Confidence among some east European carriers has been boosted by the arrival of new western aircraft, which have helped to redress some of the competitive balance with west European rivals and let them into profitable expatriate markets. LOT, which has used its Boeing 767s to develop US and Canadian routes, would like to establish regular flights to Australia to tap the ethnic Polish market there. Malev has similar ambitions for its two new Boeing 767s. Balkan, which has substantial business taking tourists to Black Sea resorts, already operates some 737s, 767s and Airbus A320s. Both Malev and LOT - which moved into profit in July and is managing to cover its operating costs as well as interest charges on the Dollars 200m borrowed to acquire the 767s - have also been bolstered by more commercially-minded and realistic managements. Malev's Mr Pakay, for example, has dropped his predecessor's high ambitions to develop the company into the centrepiece of a three-way global alliance with big US and far eastern carriers. Likewise, LOT's improvement has been aided by more down-to-earth aims. Ambitions to create a wider international network have been scaled down in favour of closer regional links with former Soviet states such as Belarus or Ukraine.</p>

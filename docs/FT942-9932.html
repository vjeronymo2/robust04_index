			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / John Smith: a quiet climb to the top The fundamental questions about John Smith as Labour leader will never be answered. Would he have gone on in his quiet, patient way to become the first Labour prime minister since 1979? Would he have launched a more dramatic onslaught as the general election approached? And would he have won either way? His sudden death of a heart attack at the age of 55 yesterday immediately revived memories of Hugh Gaitskell who died, almost as unexpectedly, in 1963. Gaitskell, like Smith, seemed at the height of his powers. He had given the opposition a new standing in British politics. The Conservative government of the day was in disarray. Labour was consistently ahead in the opinion polls: Gaitskell's own ratings as a leader far outstripped those of Harold Macmillan, the prime minister, and it seemed only a matter of time before Labour returned to office after 13 years of Tory rule. The sense of shock at Smith's death is no less great than it was at the death of Gaitskell. There is, however, a considerable difference between the two leaders. Gaitskell tended to lead the Labour party by confrontation. He challenged it on some of its most deeply held beliefs: for example, public ownership and nuclear weapons. Smith rose to the top by a quieter, but no less brave a route. Plain John Smith was born on September 13 1938. Although his family lived on the island of Islay off the west coast of Scotland, his mother moved to the mainland for the birth. Two years later his father, Archibald, was made headmaster of Ardrishaig Primary School, which meant the mainland for good. But it was still a remote and conservative part of Scotland. The education authority was Argyll County Council. Argyll has never had a Labour MP. The young Smith moved on to Dunoon Grammar School and his father entered parliament as a Labour member. Impressions of the boy do not seem to have changed over the years. In the only biography of Smith, Playing the Long Game, published last year, Andy McSmith wrote that he was seen as 'bookish, but not a scholar'. The owl-like look that was to become familiar was there from the start; occasionally the words 'slightly sanctimonious' were attached, though in a fairly friendly fashion. After Dunoon it was Glasgow University where Smith arrived in 1956, taking an MA in history and an LLB in law. Here other budding politicians began to emerge. Among his contemporaries were the Tory Teddy (now Sir Edward) Taylor, Menzies Campbell, now the Liberal Democratic MP for Fife North East, and, later, Donald Dewar, now shadow social security secretary. During the Labour party splits of the late 1950s, Glasgow was a heavily Gaitskellite place. 'If there were any Bevanites in the University Labour Club,' Dewar recorded, 'I can't remember them.' Smith's reputation as a public speaker began to spread and political invitations came early. It was suggested that he stand for parliament in the 1959 general election, even before he had come of age. He stood in a by-election in East Fife two years later. The Tories won easily, but Smith came second, knocking the Liberals into third place. Smith tried the seat again in 1964 and still lost. It was by no means certain, however, that he was set on a political career. There was also the law and the need to make money, not least to marry Elizabeth Bennett, daughter of a Glasgow insurance manager. The couple met at a university dance in 1961 and married in 1967. For someone interested in politics it was unusual that he did not seek a constituency in the general election of 1966, which Labour won easily. Thereafter came a couple of strokes of luck. Smith was shortlisted for the Hamilton by-election in 1967, but not chosen, and the seat went to Scottish Nationalist Winnie Ewing. He then became friends with Peggy Herbison, the longstanding Labour MP for North Lanarkshire who was retiring in 1970. It was a safe seat and Smith won it. His political career never looked back. There was one action very early on which, though it may not have seemed so significant at the time, was to say a great deal about the future John Smith. In 1971 he voted with prime minister Edward Heath in favour of British membership of the European Community. True, there were other Labour rebels, though many of them subsequently left the party. Smith said: 'It was the biggest issue, I thought, that was likely to come up during the time I was in parliament, and I felt strongly about it and I really had to do it.' The commitment to Europe remained till the end. Smith's rise through the party was steady, but not spectacular. More attention might have been paid to it if the party had been in a better state. As trade secretary, he was the youngest member of the final cabinet of Mr James (now Lord) Callaghan and thus the only member of Labour's current frontbench team with cabinet experience. Yet such was the feeling that Labour was on its way out that he had little opportunity to develop. In opposition after 1979 he concentrated for several years on trade, industry and energy, all subjects of which he had previous experience in office. It was on the Westland affair in 1986, and the possible sale of Austin Rover to a foreign buyer, that he really made his mark as a debater. Being questioned by Smith in the Commons was something that even the most senior ministers wished to avoid. It was also probably then the idea began to emerge of Smith as a potential leader. He became chief spokesman on Treasury and economic affairs in 1987 and at Labour party conferences would simply introduce himself as 'John Smith, shadow chancellor'. In the last general election he was sometimes criticised within the Labour party for being too austere. David Hare's play The Absence of War has a thinly veiled hint that he did not stand too closely by the party leader, Neil Kinnock. Yet when the election was over and Labour had lost, there was never much doubt that Smith would be the successor. He was also able to claim that he was vindicated in saying that taxes would have to go up. On the more socialist side he stuck strongly to his belief in the need for a minimum wage. To the end the adjective most commonly applied to him was 'decent', though it was usually accompanied by 'clever'. He was also warm and convivial. The habit of staying up late and emerging shipshape in the morning had developed at Glasgow University. A heart attack in 1988 did not entirely calm him down. Yet the early, quiet Scottishness was still an essential part of him. Unlike some other Scots MPs he was never wild. He behaved as if he came from a classless society full of opportunities - which is what he did. He could be very kind: he seldom made personal attacks and was the first Labour MP to visit Norman Tebbit and his wife in hospital after the 1984 Brighton bomb. Smith leaves his wife, Elizabeth, and three daughters.</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS CONSIDER NEW TACTIC TO DELAY MALIBU INCORPORATION  </P> <P> Los Angeles County officials, forced by a judge's order to allow a Malibu  cityhood election to proceed in June, may try to delay the actual incorporation  for up to a year if residents of the seaside community vote to form a city.  </P> <P> A resolution prepared for supervisors to vote on today contains a condition  that would allow county officials to impose the delay. Ordinarily, once voters  approve, incorporation occurs on the date results are certified, usually four  to six weeks after an election.  </P> <P> The maneuver, spelled out in a copy of the resolution released this week, would  give the county time to go forward with a long-sought sewer system in Malibu  before a new local government has a chance to block it.  </P> <P> Slow-growth advocates, including many cityhood supporters, have opposed the  sewer system backed by supervisors as a prelude to widespread development.  </P> <P> Elwood Lui, a lawyer for the county, called the document "not unusual" and said  it was included "in anticipation of remarks that may be made for and against  cityhood" at today's hearing.  </P> <P> "We think state law clearly sets forth the supervisors' right to set an  effective date," Lui said, "but that's a decision that has to be made at the  board meeting."  </P> <P> Lawyers for cityhood backers, meanwhile, said that if the supervisors try to  use the tactic to delay incorporation, they will immediately ask a judge to  disallow it.  </P> <P> "I really wonder if they (county officials) can even sell three supervisors on  going along with such a thing, but if they do, we intend to be in court  immediately," said Graham Ritchie, an attorney for the Malibu Committee for  Incorporation.  </P> <P> A majority of supervisors have opposed Malibu's becoming a city for years,  saying that the sewer system the county wants to build there needs to be under  way before any city is formed.  </P> <P> Supervisors have said they want sewers installed in Malibu, where homeowners  now largely rely on septic tanks, because sewers are more sanitary and  environmentally safe.  </P> <P> Facing possible contempt citations from a judge who ordered the supervisors to  set a Malibu election date June 5, the supervisors two weeks ago sent word by  county lawyers that they would comply. Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs has  ordered that the issue be the first order of business during today's Board of  Supervisors meeting.  </P> <P> Cityhood backers insist that imposing a condition to delay the actual  incorporation date would make a mockery of the judge's order to stop stalling  the election itself.  </P> <P> State law makes it possible for incorporation to occur up to a year after the  certification of votes. Malibu voters will be asked to choose five city council  members on the cityhood ballot.  </P> <P> But there is disagreement over whether the supervisors have the authority to  impose a delay or whether that authority rests exclusively with the Local  Agency Formation Commission, which oversees the transformations of communities  to cities. County lawyers have expressed the view that supervisors do have such  authority; lawyers for cityhood supporters say they do not.  </P> <P> Lawyers for LAFCO have agreed with Malibu cityhood supporters. "Our preliminary  analysis is that only LAFCO can impose such a condition," said Meredith Jury,  independent counsel for the agency. "We do not believe that the county  supervisors have the right to do that."  </P></p>

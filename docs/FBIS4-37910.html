			<p>BFN     [Unattributed report: "A Correction and an Apology"]    [Text] AL-WAFD published the day before yesterday, Sunday  [19  June], a report on the arrests of the first secretary from the  Russian Embassy in Cairo, the director of the Russian Language  Institute, an Egyptian woman, and her son who were photographing  some bridges in Banha. It was confirmed that the report on the  arrest of the two Russian officials and their Egyptian  companions was not true.    What happened was that the two Russian officials were the  guests of the Egyptian family. The first secretary took some  photographs of nature scenes on the Nile River banks. A  citizen, who did not know their identity, remonstrated him and  took him to the security officer guarding the Banha Bridge  because he thought that the two Russians were violating the law.  When the officer ascertained their identity, he apologized  profusely for the error. The Russian diplomat gave the film to  the officer who promised to return it after checking that it did  not contain any photographs that violate security.    AL-WAFD apologizes to Yuriy Kuder Vicev, first secretary in  the Federal Russian embassy; Dr. Evgeny Zelenev, director of the  Russian Language Institute in the Russian Cultural Center; Mrs.  Widad Ahmad Wahdan; and her son Ayman. AL-WAFD stresses that  the publication of the report was not meant to be an affront to  the Russian diplomats or to bilateral relations.</p>

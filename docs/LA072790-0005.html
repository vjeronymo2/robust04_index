			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GIVE THIS IDEA A FREE RIDE;  </P> <P> RTD'S CURRENT INDUCEMENT MIGHT WOO BACK FORMER RIDERS  </P> <P> Fresh ideas in public transportation are about as common as seats on a  rush-hour bus. The only thing in shorter supply is a fresh idea that is also a  good idea. At first glance, the Southern California Rapid Transit District's  notion that passengers should ride free if their bus arrives more than 15  minutes behind schedule seems to meet both criteria. It certainly is worth the  test run RTD has in mind.  </P> <P> Of course, you have to ask why, if this is such a great idea, it hasn't been  going on for years? The RTD says that until recently its fleet was too small to  even think of free rides. With 2,000 buses, however, it has a fighting chance  to stay on schedule.  </P> <P> Chicago was appalled by the idea. A spokesman for the region's transit  authority rejected the idea out of hand as something they would never try. It  conjured up pictures of buses stalled by fires on their route, traffic jams and  other random ways of knocking buses off schedule.  </P> <P> But there is a big difference between the cities. Chicago doesn't need such a  plan. It has a long tradition of rail and bus transportation that works as well  as any city, and better than most. Los Angeles is still trying to create such a  history.  </P> <P> The idea could come unglued in several ways, but the RTD seems to have most of  them in hand. People with bus passes would get a chit they could use to reduce  the cost of the next month's pass. The agency is still pondering the rider who  pays his fare before the bus starts running late and then watches a parade of  people get on for free.  </P> <P> The most appealing thing about the idea is the most difficult to quantify. It  would demonstrate good faith and honest effort for riders who have stuck with  the system through some rude times in recent years.  </P> <P> To be both a fresh idea and a good one, the word on good faith would have to  get around to people who have abandoned the system. This is the only way  Southern California can create a transit tradition of its own. That makes this  worth trying.  </P></p>

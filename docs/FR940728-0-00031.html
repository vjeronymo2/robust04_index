This offset also is subject to any limitations imposed by other applicable law or regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;230.457  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Offsets among different persons who reported and paid royalties on a lease for the same prior sales month. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) This section applies to any reallocation of production for a prior sales month among different persons who reported and paid royalty for that month on a lease or unit, except for reallocations of production that result from the approval or amendment of a unit agreement subject to &sect;230.461(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) In the event of a reallocation of production as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the respective persons who reported and paid royalty may reconcile any resulting differences in royalty payment obligations between themselves without submitting revised royalty reports or requests for refund or credit to MMS under this subpart, except that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

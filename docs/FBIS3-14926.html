			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Justas Paleckis, Lithuania's ambassador </F> extraordinary and plenipotentiary for special missions, by  Zivile Kriauciuniene; place and date not given: "America Is  Sharing Its Experience"]    [Excerpts] [Kriauciuniene] The press and television  has briefly reported about your visit to the United States. It  would be interesting to learn about its goals and results in  detail.    [Paleckis] I went there at the invitation of the U.S.  Information Service. This service, in cooperation with the  State Department and other federal services, prepared a special  program: To demonstrate how decisions on foreign policy issues  are adopted in their country. [passage omitted]    The things that we saw could be summarized as follows:  There, as well as in our country, foreign policy decisions are  adopted by the president. Unlike us, however, no one imagines  that he or she knows more than the president or feels human  moods better. The American way of thinking is pragmatic and  democratic: He who has won the elections has the right to  decide.    It goes without saying that much attention was devoted to  President B. Clinton's policy. He came to power with promises  of focusing on domestic problems which, however, are not easy to  resolve. Therefore, B. Clinton, like other presidents,  immediately turned to foreign policy where effective results can  be achieved more readily. Many political scientists with whom I  met assess the president's foreign policy favorably, although he  has not had any experience in this sphere until now.    This does not mean, however, that the president does  whatever  he wants. The National Security Council set up in 1948  coordinates decisions adopted by government offices and consults  the president. I think that we also made a similar move when  establishing a Coordinating Foreign Policy Council late last  year.    [Kriauciuniene] Can the things that you saw be applied  in Lithuania?    [Paleckis] We could learn something: How to adopt decisions,  analyze different options, and predict the future considering  the interests of the state.    Moreover, the Americans wanted to show us the role of public  opinion in adopting foreign policy decisions. Public opinion is  expressed there not only through the press, television, or the  legislature (which is the case in our country) but also through  trade unions and lobbyism. [passage omitted]    U.S. ethnic minorities also express their interests in  foreign policy. We had several interesting conversations with  representatives of the black population. Currently, they are  being represented broadly in the Congress, the diplomatic corps,  and federal government institutions. Their number in the State  Department might be slightly smaller.    Observing this, one may think that the participation of our  Polish, Russian, and other minorities in adopting various  decisions, including foreign policy issues, is insufficient.    [Kriauciuniene]So, the trip was interesting.    [Paleckis] [passage omitted] One realizes particularly  clearly during such trips that the world is so big, while  Lithuania is so small. One understands that we often exaggerate  the influence of our country, the three Baltic states, or even  entire Central Europe on the world. In fact, this influence is  not so large.    In general, one could feel that America would become  slightly  less active in foreign policy after the cold war. Certainly, it  does not intend to return to isolation, as was the case between  the wars. Everyone remembers how many victims the failure to  prevent fascism required. However, the Americans do not want to  interfere in events that do not concern them.    One professor explained to me why NATO did not want to admit  Poland. In case of aggression, NATO would have to defend it and  send young U.S. soldiers to death away from home. Public  opinion, which is considered there so much, would not approve  this.    True, in the opinion of H. Kissinger, former national  security secretary and state adviser, it is now that Central  European states should be admitted to NATO. It is quite often  the case that an activist from the opposition tries to express a  different opinion from the official one because otherwise he  would not be interesting to anyone, the more so that not being  in power, he is not responsible for the effects.    Taking into account its economic interests, the United  States  is currently directing its glance toward the Pacific Ocean and  the Asian region, particularly southeastern Asia. The economy  decides politics.    [Kriauciuniene]Is the United States so little  interested in Europe?    [Paleckis] It is interested in Europe as well. The key issue  is Russia's problems. The rule of democracy and a free market  in that country would protect the United States against many  troubles, additional expenses, and the restoration of the cold  war. Therefore, the Americans are determined to help Russia. I  happened to hear the opinion that V. Zhirinovskiy is a  considerable gift to B. Yeltsin because the Russian president  can ask the West for more aid under V. Zhirinovskiy's threats.    While I was staying in the United States, B. Clinton  returned  from his trip to Europe. I was told at official federal offices  that one of the key topics of his talks with President B.  Yeltsin had been the issue of the Baltic states, particularly,  the Army withdrawal from Latvia and Estonia. At the same time  the United States wants the Baltic countries to apply  international standards to ethnic minorities.    The United States is very much interested in good and  constructive relations between Russia and the Baltic states. I  happened to be in the Congress at the time when S. Talbott,  assistant to the secretary of state, was making a report about  ties with Russia and other CIS countries. He stressed  repeatedly that assistance would be rendered to Russia only if  the latter adhered to the norms of international law in its  relations with other states -- former USSR republics and Central  European countries.    It would be an illusion to think that relations with Russia  will not be a U.S. priority. The very fact that the  uncontrolled and chaotic development of this big state would be  fatally dangerous to Russia's neighbors and even the  transatlantic superpower is responsible for such a U.S.  attitude. Thus, I categorically disagree with those who suppose  that instability in Russia is useful to us and enhances our  security. Undoubtedly, we would like that stability to be  democratic and in line with the norms of international law.    [Kriauciuniene]Did you meet with the  Lithuanian-American community?    [Paleckis] First of all, I would like to say that I had  useful and practical meetings with Alfonsas Eidintas, Lithuanian  ambassador to the United States, in Washington and Anicetas  Simutis, ambassador to the United Nations, in New York. I was  happy to hear that representatives of federal government  institutions in Washington were pleased with the work of our  embassy and its employees' competence. It is common knowledge  that the official Washington assessed former Ambassador Stays  Lozoraitis positively. It is pleasant, therefore, that  favorable words are also said about the new ambassador. A.  Eidintas has appeared as very flexible in maintaining ties with  our emigres and their organizations. He feels the Americans'  moods well. [passage omitted]    [Kriauciuniene]Is the emigres' attitude toward  Lithuania's current government changing?    [Paleckis] I could not draw any conclusions from these  several meetings. Recalling the president's trip to the United  States last fall, I can say, however, that very many emigres  wanted to see and hear him in New York and Los Angeles. Maybe,  A. Brazauskas was unacceptable to some of them as a personality.  but he was shown respect as Lithuania's president.    Incidentally, A. Brazauskas read an annual report in the  Seimas [parliament] last week, and some members of the  opposition did not stand up demonstratively or clap symbolically  on his entry. This shows the lack of our democratic culture  because disrespect for the president means disregard for the  state. [passage omitted]    [Kriauciuniene]Could you explain in conclusion what  your rank -- ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary --  means? Most people imagine that one may be ambassador only in  some other country.    [Paleckis] I go abroad quite often, and not only with the  president but also on special missions, as this one. Last fall,  I visited NATO headquarters in Brussels, as well as Oslo,  Moscow, Bonn, and other places. The title of ambassador  extraordinary and plenipotentiary gives more weight and helps  resolve certain problems.    [Kriauciuniene]Thank you for the interview.</p>

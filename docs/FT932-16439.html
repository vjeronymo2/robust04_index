			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / People: Brown treks back to United Inds Loss-making United Industries has hired Tom Brown, previously group managing director of the much larger, Hull-based, engineering group Fenner, who thinks he has spotted the ideal time in the economic cycle to 'be involved in something entrepreneurial'. Brown's predecessor at the company, which makes precision springs for aerospace, automotive, electrical and engineering applications, was 53-year-old David Simpkin, who has taken early retirement after a heart attack. A chartered accountant, he had been with parts of the group for 27 years and group managing director since 1989. 'In any case, we needed a different kind of manager to lead us out of the recession, one who was more product-oriented,' says chairman Ken Coates. 'Brown is a trained professional manager with an MBA (from IMEDE in Lausanne) and he is a qualified engineer.' Brown, who has been trekking in Morocco since resigning two months ago, likens Fenner to an oil tanker. 'I have been keen to be master of my destiny,' he says. Peter Barker, executive chairman, has been there 'approaching 40 years. It is very much his personal fiefdom'. At United by contrast he has a non-executive chairman who promises to 'offer guidance and counsel but not to get in the way', as Coates himself puts it. His last entrepreneurial sortie, Brown now thinks, was just at the wrong stage of the economic cycle. At the end of the 1980s his search, in association with Schroder Ventures, for a management buy-in opportunity which he would run and Schroders would finance, proved fruitless.</p>

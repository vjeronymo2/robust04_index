			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Portuguese trim their rates The Bank of Portugal yesterday cut its money market intervention rates by 0.25 of a point to 10.25 per cent for mopping up liquidity and 11.25 per cent for short-term lending, Reuter reports from Lisbon. Economists expect money rates to fall below 10 per cent by the end of the year providing the escudo remains stable and the government achieves its target of reducing the inflation rate to 5-7 per cent this year from 8.9 per cent in 1992.</p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Arts: Danish opera tunes up for the future - Richard Fairman reports from the the Kongelige Teater, Copenhagen If one crop fails, the enterprising farmer tries another. Faced with milk quota problems Danish farmer Vincens Steensen-Leth sold his cattle and applied for European Community funds to help him convert to a new growth product: he wants to plant a new opera company at his farm on the island of Langeland. If he is successful, Denmark could soon have its own Glyndebourne. This is just one example of a new international outlook to opera in the country. In Copenhagen the venerable Kongelige Teater (Royal Theatre; its archives go back as far as 1756) has given most of its operatic performances since the war in Danish, taking its casts from a resident ensemble. But since the arrival of a new chairman and his appointee as artistic director, Elaine Padmore from Wexford, that has started to change. The opera house had already undergone substantial modernisation in 1985 and Padmore's task is to effect a comparable re-building of the company  - even if that means a difficult wrench with the past. Some of what she intends to do is obvious. The standard repertory has been allowed to ossify and should be brought up-to-date, and the finance found to do so. At the moment the company receives most of its income from the state; if it is to move beyond the customary four new productions a year, sponsorship will have to rise. The repertoire must also be more varied. Formerly, if there was no soprano who could sing Donizetti's Lucia, the opera simply did not get done. Padmore wants to give her loyal audiences operas they have never seen and has scheduled the Kongelige Teater's first ever productions of Puccini's Turandot and Mozart's Idomeneo. These will be sung in the original languages, a policy that has slowly become standard over the last 15 years. That suits the increasing band of young Vikings, such as Randi Stene and Inger Dam-Jensen, who sing opera on the world's stages. Among the last of the Danish-language productions is the new Cos fan tutte, originally intended for Ib Hansen, a favourite Danish singer who sadly fell ill before he could appear in it. This has been produced and designed by Mikael Melbye, a company member from his days as a treble to his career as international baritone. As designer, he has given Cos a clean and stylish Scandinavian feel. As producer, he keeps strictly to the text, no updatings, no concepts. By mid-run the performances were being conducted by Andrew Greenwood in a swift and taut fashion (the company's orchestra is a good one and unusually prominent, as the pit extends right out into the auditorium). Among the singers, Randi Stene's Dorabella inevitably caught the interest, although all four of the lovers were decently taken. A good, ensemble performance without striking insights or personalities. A Fidelio in repertory at the same time showed the company's international links. Sung in German, the two lead roles featured Danish singers who have notable careers overseas: Tina Kiberg, a rather feminine Leonore; and Poul Elming, a Florestan strained by the higher parts of the role, though one looks forward to hearing him in the heroic Wagner roles he has conquered at Bayreuth. The secondary roles were strongly taken and the orchestra again played to a high standard under the baton of Paavo Berglund. Unfortunately, the production by Bruno Schwengl (producer) and Dieter Kaegi (designer) had self-consciously arty ideas. Fidelio is an opera that asks for eye-to-eye honesty and it does not help to have the prisoners forming a Last Supper scene, in which a chosen 12 gather at a long table so that Leonore can feed them bread and wine (why were the rest not invited?). But that is perhaps a risk worth taking, if the company is to open its doors to outside producers. For the future there are ambitious plans. The Kongelige Teater may well appear from time to time at the projected summer festival on Langeland. An endowment has been set up to cover the cost of the annual seasons there (Mark Wigglesworth and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra have been invited to be musicians-in-residence) and it looks possible that the European Union may find half the Pounds 14m cost of building works. If construction goes ahead, the first performances should be in 1997. As for the company's home plans, Padmore is working towards 1996, when Copenhagen will be Cultural Capital of Europe. The programme is expected to showcase Danish achievements on an international scale. Singers like Boje Skovhus and Lisbeth Balslev will return home. Both Nielsen's operas will be performed and Padmore is keen to put on what Danish singers do best, namely Wagner, so there will be a new production of Die Meistersinger. This is, after all, the land of Lauritz Melchior. Denmark seems to grow Wagnerians. It must be something in the soil.</p>

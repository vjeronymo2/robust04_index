			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government is determined to go ahead with its  announced housing project worth 90 billion rands despite the  ANC's [African National Congress] efforts to keep business from  getting involved in the project. The ANC has threatened that  the new government will probably not be able to honor the  contracts. This evening National Housing Minister Louis Shill  spoke to Ed Herbst about it:    [Shill, in English] I think that's a very intimidating  attitude. I cannot believe that any organization that believes  they have a part to play in the future South Africa -- and that  part is going to be played from May month onward -- would want  to prevent the building of houses. Many of the grounds which we  are doing under this present scheme -- and which was evolved  together with the forum in which the ANC plays a very major role  -- are only going to be developed into houses from May, June and  July month onward. They would be cutting off their noses to  spite their face. My appearing at the TEC [Transitional  Executive Committee] yesterday was meeting my responsibilities  as a minister in this government to provide information to the  organization like the TEC of my own volition. They have no  right to summons me, and they will have no right to summons me  for next Tuesday either. And the fact that I will be turning up  there is because I would like to have clarity on this matter and  I am sure the forum would like it as well. Maybe we can help  sort the matter out and get back to a normal keel and have the  politicians out of the business of housing.</p>

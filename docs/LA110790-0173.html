Final  </P> <P> EUROPEAN PANEL OKS ALLIANCE OF VOLVO, RENAULT  </P> <P> The European Commission said today that it has cleared the proposed alliance  between the automobile companies Volvo of Sweden and Renault of France.  </P> <P> The Renault-Volvo alliance was the first the commission has cleared under its  recently expanded powers to vet large mergers among European Community  companies.  </P> <P> The commission said the merger between Volvo and Renault in markets for cars,  trucks and buses will not create or strengthen a dominant position in any of  the markets.  </P> <P> It said that the linkup in trucks and buses will not impede competition in the  European Community or in any substantial part of it. In cars, the alliance did  not fall under the commission's merger powers, it said.  </P></p>

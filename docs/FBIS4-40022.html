			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Mikheyev report: "Vladimir Lukin Proposes His Own </F> `Sequence of Moves' in Approach to Pyongyang"]    [Text] The political crisis on the Korean Peninsula, which  could assume a military-strategic and even a nuclear dimension,  is capable of affecting Russia's national interests to a  considerably greater degree than the conflict in Yugoslavia.  This is the opinion of Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Duma  Committee on International Affairs, which he expounded at a  briefing for journalists.    It is not hard to predict that, in the event of the DPRK's  joining the nuclear club, South Korea will acquire its own  "deterrent force." The United States, which is interested in  preserving the military balance, may see to this. As a result,  there will be the increased likelihood of a nuclear altercation  in direct proximity to Russia's borders -- which would make the  Chernobyl tragedy pale in comparison.    One consequence could be the "nuclearization" of the whole  region, when even Japan, which experienced the horror of "a  blast brighter than 1,000 suns," will overcome its allergy to  the military atom.    Even if these apocalyptic forecasts do not materialize, the  standoff on the Korean Peninsula, wherein the Cold War is  threatening to escalate into a "hot" one, directly affects the  interests of Russia's national security, and so an "ideological  approach" to this developing crisis is totally unacceptable,  Vladimir Lukin declared. It is not a question of "whether or  not we like Kim Il-song."    In the opinion of the committee chairman, nobody can now  confidently state whether the DPRK leaders are really seeking to  get their hands on a tool of nuclear blackmail and deterrence or  whether this is a clever bluff on their part.    If we take the second option on trust, Pyongyang's motives  could boil down to securing international guarantees of  noninterference in its internal political affairs -- in exchange  for access to its nuclear installations. In this case we should  pick the "lesser evil," i.e. provide Russian guarantees and  persuade our partners to take an analogous step, Lukin believes.    "I criticize the U.S. policy only for the sequence of  moves,"  Lukin emphasized.    After pointing out that, in their approach to Pyongyang,  Russia, South Korea, Japan, and the United States are united in  maintaining and strengthening the nuclear nonproliferation  regime, the former Russian ambassador to Washington proposed  resorting to tough pressure methods only after the guarantees  offered to the DPRK have elucidated its true aspirations.    At the same time he described as a mistake Moscow's  statement  about a kind of "freezing" of the friendship treaty with North  Korea, which expires in two years' time. This deprives Russian  diplomacy of almost its last "lever of influence" over its very  close ally of yesterday.</p>

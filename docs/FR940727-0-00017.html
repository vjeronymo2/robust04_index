The interim final rule reapportioned the representation established for independent and small cooperative marketing association handlers on the Raisin Administrative Committee (Committee), to provide more equitable representation. This rule is based on a unanimous recommendation of the Committee, which is responsible for local administration of the order. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  August 26, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Richard P.

The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended, [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule has been reviewed under Executive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have any retroactive effect. This action will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of entry of the ruling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 20 handlers of California raisins who are subject to regulation under the raisin marketing order, and approximately 5,000 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. A majority of producers and a minority of handlers of California raisins may be classified as small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  This rule finalizes an interim final rule which revised Section 989.126 of Subpart_Administrative Rules and Regulations [7 CFR 989.102&hyph;989.176] and is based on a unanimous recommendation of the Committee and other available information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The interim final rule, published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on May 26, 1994, [59 FR 27225], reapportioned the Committee representation established for independent and small cooperative marketing association handlers on the Committee. The interim rule provided for broader independent handler/small cooperative handler representation on the Committee to reflect the different handler segments in the raisin industry. The change did not impose any additional regulatory, informational, or cost requirements on handlers or producers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 989.26 of the order provides that the Committee shall consist of 47 members, of whom 35 shall represent producers, 10 shall represent handlers, 1 shall represent the cooperative bargaining association, and 1 shall be a public member. The 10 handler positions are allocated between: (1) Cooperative marketing associations, each of which acquired not less than 10 percent of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year (referred to as major cooperative handlers); and (2) independent handlers and small cooperative marketing associations; i.e., those who acquired less than 10 percent of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year. Currently, there is one cooperative in group (1) engaged in handling raisins. That handler is allocated three positions on the Committee. Group (2) handlers are allocated seven positions. The allocation of members between the two handler groups is based on the provisions specified in paragraph (d) of &sect;989.26.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 989.126(b) of the Administrative Rules and Regulations had previously provided for independent and small cooperative handler representation on the Committee as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Two members selected from and representing the four handler(s) other than major cooperative handler(s) who acquired the largest percentage of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Two members selected from and representing the six handlers other than major cooperative marketing association handler(s) who acquired the next largest percentage of the total raisin acquisitions during the preceding crop year; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

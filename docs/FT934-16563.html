			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Bhutto and Sharif shown as neck and neck in polls PAKISTAN goes to the polls today with opinion surveys showing the two main contenders in the general election running almost neck and neck. Ms Benazir Bhutto, the former prime minister, was judged by many observers to be slightly ahead of Mr Mohammed Nawaz Sharif, a successor in office who resigned this summer after months of political turmoil. But, given the rudimentary state of opinion polling in Pakistan, few independent forecasters predicted the results with any certainty Mr Farhad Zaidi, editor of the Moslem daily newspaper, said yesterday that Ms Bhutto's Pakistan People's party (PPP) would 'probably' win Punjab province, the richest and most populous of Pakistan's four provinces and so would 'probably' win overall. The general election is being held after Mr Sharif was persuaded by army generals to resign in July after a power struggle with President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, who also quit. The main parties will have to contend with the Pakistan Islamic Front, an alliance of Islamic parties. Its performance will indicate the extent of support for fundamentalism. The speed with which the army and bureaucracy ended the last two governments  -Ms Bhutto's in 1990 and Mr Sharif's this year - has caused widespread disillusion with electoral politics. One opinion poll has shown that Mr Moeen Qureshi, the interim prime minister who has announced radical economic reforms, has an 85 per cent support rating - more than Ms Bhutto and Mr Nawaz Sharif combined. Pakistan's caretaker cabinet yesterday approved draft ordinances to stop MPs switching sides after being elected on the platform of a political party and to free state television from state control, Reuter adds from Islamabad. A flurry of floor-crossing had undermined Mr Sharif's government.</p>

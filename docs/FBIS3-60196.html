This amendment will allow the courts to  confiscate all land and property of drug smugglers who are  sentenced to more than two years in jail. The Pakistan People's  Party government has started to take action to rid the society  of the cures of narcotics, and has decided to amend the law in  order to confiscate property belonging to drug smugglers. This  is a very good step, however, the big fish manage to avoid being  caught in the present system. They free themselves with the help  of the police. The ordinary peddlers and the dealers are  arrested. The system should be overhauled so that the real  criminals are caught and given exemplary punishment.</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Costain seeks cash in Australia COSTAIN, the troubled British construction, mining and property group, is seeking to raise more cash by selling a stake in its profitable Australian coal mining subsidiary. The group failed to pay a final dividend after making a pre-tax loss last year of Pounds 69.2m. It sold its British investment property portfolio in December for Pounds 101.3m in a move to reduce its large borrowings. Mr Peter Costain, chief executive, yesterday confirmed that the group planned to seek a listing for its Australian coal mining business and sell part of its shareholding in it later this year. Bain Capital Markets, the Australian investment bank, has agreed to underwrite the issue on the Australian Stock Exchange. The group said yesterday that it was seeking to take advantage of the growth in the value of its Australian business and the current strength of local share prices. Last year Costain reduced its net debt by Pounds 143m to Pounds 168m cutting gearing from more than 100 per cent to 53 per cent. The figures, however, excluded Pounds 52m of off-balance sheet debt on the proposed Spitalfields office development in east London and Pounds 38m of convertible preference shares. Its Australian coal mining subsidiary has been estimated to be worth Pounds 130m based on current reserves and coal prices. Costain's US coal mining operations, where it is also thought to have considered selling a stake, are twice as large in terms of annual output but were less profitable than the Australian business last year. Lower profits in the US were due to a combination of recession, a mild winter and uncertainty over the US Clean Air Act. The Australian coal mining subsidiary has the contract to extract coal from Ravensworth open cast mine in the Hunter Valley in New South Wales and has a 28.4 per cent stake in a consortium which owns the nearby Warkworth mine. The two mines last year produced about 7m tonnes of coal, 9 per cent more than in 1990, generating an operating profit thought to be between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m. Overall, group coal mining profits - after taking into account the reductions in the US - declined by 24 per cent from Pounds 44.1m to Pounds 33.6m. Costain, in addition to its Ravensworth and Warkworth interests, has a 50 per cent stake in a joint venture which has won contracts at nearby Narama to extract coal and supply 2m tonnes a year for 20 years to the New South Wales Electricity Commission. Costain also owns a 25 per cent stake in a consortium prospect coal reserves at Bengalla, also in New South Wales, which the group estimates could produce 6m tonnes a year by the late 1990s.</p>

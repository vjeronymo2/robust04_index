			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA CLARITA CONCERNS  </P> <P> I enjoyed reading Sharon Rose's article on the Santa Clarita Valley (At Home,  July 1). I too chose this area a few years ago as a terrific place to put down  roots.  </P> <P> I would like to add a little to the picture Rose paints of this area, because  many of us believe that things aren't quite so rosy. The article correctly  notes the concern residents feel about the traffic congestion throughout the  SCV. However, as Jerry Reynolds and Ruth Newhall's comments point out, the real  villain is uncontrolled development.  </P> <P> This unplanned growth (which includes 28,000 county-approved, but as yet  unbuilt housing units) has also adversely affected the local school systems.  Besides overcrowding, this has caused the creation of "portable" schools using  the commercial equivalent of mobile homes as classrooms and offices.  </P> <P> Another situation that Rose does not touch upon is that the city of L.A.,  together with the county, plans to create a 190-million-ton dump in the  southeast corner of the valley. This canyon empties into the Santa Clara River  Wash, the source of 60% of the valley's drinking water.  </P> <P> There are already three "landfills" and the dump at the county prison at  Pitchess Honor Rancho.  </P> <P> Don't get me wrong. I like living in the Santa Clarita Valley. We have less  smog, quiet neighborhoods, high-quality education (so far!), and lower-priced  housing.  </P> <P> We also have a major traffic problem, crowded schools, few local jobs and a  threatened water supply. All of us who purchase houses to live in rather resell  soon learn that there's more to the neighborhood than the realtor's dog and  pony show lets on. Consider this letter a peek behind the curtain.  </P> <P> JIM VAN SICKLE  </P> <P> Canyon Country  </P></p>

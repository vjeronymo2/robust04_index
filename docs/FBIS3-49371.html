Pawlak added that talks with President Clinton's envoy  Madeleine Albright on Friday did not result in a declaration  that the "Partnership for Peace" program would lead to NATO  membership. According to the prime minister, these are only  mechanisms enabling Poland to maintain direct military contacts  for which this country will have to pay. These contacts will  not function in case of a threat.    Pawlak told journalists he had discussed the American  proposal with Russian Ambassador to Poland Yuriy Kashlev on  Friday. He said the cabinet would adopt an official stand of  the Polish Government on this question before the summit of the  Visegrad group in Prague and talks with President Clinton and  would do this at the nearest session of the council of ministers  with the participation of President Lech Walesa and chairmen of  the Sejm and senate foreign policy committees.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Siemens AG intends to invest more than 2 billion  German marks in the new Dresden semiconductor factory over the  next 10 years. COMPUTER ZEITUNG spoke to Heinrich von Pierer,  board chairman of Siemens AG, about the electronics giant's  project and the problems and prospects facing the chip industry.    [COMPUTER ZEITUNG] The head of the Munich-based Fraunhofer  Institute of Solid-State Technology, Ingolf Ruge, takes a  skeptical viewe regarding Siemens' plans to build a  semiconductor factory in Dresden, claiming that the project is  risky in that the infrastructure is better in Asia. So why has  Siemens decided in favor of Germany?    [von Pierer] Many aspects of Mr. Ruge's appraisal are  correct. Any major investment of this type is risky, but a  businessman has to live with risks. However, it must be  realized that Mr. Ruge is referring to the fact that the  machinery and chemicals have to be procured from abroad, but the  situation would have been no different had we invested in  Singapore, Malaysia, or Taiwan, as most of the equipment comes  from Japan. I believe that what we are now doing here will also  be a signal for the supply industry, and that it will give rise  to new developments in this area.    [COMPUTER ZEITUNG] Siemens used to complain that the  politicians were always calling for production to be kept in  Germany...    [von Pierer] Siemens did not complain. We have always  endeavored to stress the positive factors in the debate on  locational conditions. Germany must not be written off as a  manufacturing base. Of course, there are a number of worrying  factors, but we have a superb infrastructure and great political  stability in Germany, added to which good labor relations play a  major role. There are also highly qualified skilled workers and  engineers in Dresden. Germany will hold its own as a  manufacturing base in the future as well.    [COMPUTER ZEITUNG] So there was no arm-twisting behind the  decision?    [von Pierer] No, no one can force us into this. It was a  decision taken on mature reflection.    [COMPUTER ZEITUNG] You recently said in an interview that  Siemens intends to lay more staff off and relocate more of its  production abroad. How can this be reconciled with your  involvement in Dresden?    [von Pierer] I did not say that we would relocate production  abroad. What I said was that under current conditions we are  forced to create and expand production and engineering capacity  abroad and that there are two reasons for this: The first is to  take advantage of the lower costs that can be achieved abroad,  and the second is to open up markets. In many projects it is  extremely important to be able to do business locally as well.  This applies especially in Southeast Asia, where we have done a  lot of business. And we shall continue to do so in Siemens'  various sectors of operation.    [COMPUTER ZEITUNG] The semiconductor industry is booming at  the moment. What is your forecast for this sector over the next  few years?    [von Pierer] For memory chips there will be the usual cycles  that can break off at any time. However, I see quite clearly  that there will be a further growth in demand for logical units.  We have conducted surveys of our own that predict 10- to  13-percent annual growth in this market. Our system know-how  gives us the skills needed to secure an appropriate share of  this market.    [COMPUTER ZEITUNG] So you mainly expect growth in logical  units?    [von Pierer] I see it for memory chips as well. The only  thing is that our past experience with memory chips has taught  us that these cycles end. I cannot say when such a bullish  cycle of the type we are going through now will collapse. One  has to assume that it will happen some time. This will be less  the case in the logical field.    [COMPUTER ZEITUNG] Will Siemens subsidiary SNI [Siemens-  Nixdorf] be in the market for semiconductors from the new  factory?    [von Pierer] SNI will be a major customer, for instance for  personal computers, in which we have achieved over 100-percent  growth over the last two years. Our eco-PC's will also  constitute a user market for Dresden's chip output.</p>

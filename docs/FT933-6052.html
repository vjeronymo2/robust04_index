			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / EC to press Japan for further car export cuts: Brussels renews pressure as European sales fall EC trade negotiators will renew pressure on Japan this week to rein in car exports to the Community, in the light of worsening monthly figures for new car sales in Europe. European Commission officials fly to Tokyo today to persuade Japan to improve on the commitment made in April to cut exports by 9.4 per cent this year. The Japanese have hinted they are ready to agree a further reduction, so Thursday and Friday's discussions will focus on the scale of new cuts. EC officials have not revealed their new target, but after meeting the Japanese in Brussels last month, they indicated they were hoping for an 18 per cent reduction this year. The Commission says sales figures released or confirmed since the inconclusive Brussels meeting show the situation has worsened. According to one Commission official, there would now have to be 'an incredible boom in the second half of the year' to fulfil the Japanese forecast that 1993 sales will decline by 12 per cent. The same officials said even the Commission estimate of 16 per cent - in line with industry forecasts in July - was 'becoming an optimistic number'. Industry estimates published earlier this month suggested that new car sales in western Europe had dropped by an estimated 20.1 per cent in July, contributing to a fall of 17.7 per cent over the first seven months of the year, compared with the equivalent period. In the last week, DRI, the UK-based automotive analyst, has forecast a 16 per cent decline in west European sales of new cars this year; Volkswagen and Renault have announced poor financial results for the first half of the year; and Nissan, the Japanese carmaker, has said that its UK plant may not achieve the increase in output forecast for this year. The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association plans to release provisional figures for August sales shortly. 'A little upturn in the UK has certainly not been enough to offset the terrible picture everywhere else,' said a spokesman yesterday. Under the terms of a 1991 'understanding' between the EC and Japan, Tokyo and Brussels agree informal annual limits on the export of cars and light commercial vehicles to the EC, to allow the Community to gradually open its market to full competition. The 1991 deal does not directly cover Japanese vehicles manufactured in Europe.</p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: International Bonds Investors in international bond funds have enjoyed high returns, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. As the table shows, the average fund returned 57 per cent over the three years to January 1 (offer-to-bid with net income re-invested). This strong performance has resulted from a particularly favourable combination of factors. The devaluation of sterling after it left the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992 was the main cause but substantial falls in inflation and in short-term interest rates also have helped. Investors cannot necessarily expect the same degree of performance in the future, though, as the same combination of factors might not recur. But Jeremy Cunningham, manager of the Invesco International Bond fund, believes there is more growth to come because European interest rates will fall 'quite considerably' this year. Some 80 per cent of this fund is placed in European fixed-interest investments. At the top of the table, the Norwich International Bond trust returned 72.5 per cent over the period to its investors and has an above-average yield of 5.1 per cent. But performance has slipped in the year to January 1 with the fund's ranking falling to 20 of 27, according to Micropal. Brian Dowler, a fund manager at NU Investment Management, says 1991 was a very good year for the fund but believes it could have been underweight in Japanese bonds at certain periods last year, so missing out on the significant appreciation of the yen in 1993. Charges on the Norwich fund are 6 per cent initial and 1.25 per cent annual. The Invesco fund has an 1.05 per cent initial charge and an annual fee of 0.5 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE HIGHEST PERFORMING 10 INTERNATIONAL BOND FUNDS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fund                  Size (Pounds m)    Yield (%)     Perf*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Norwich Intl Bond       33.6               5.1        72.5 Invesco Intl Bond        3.9               5.2        68.8 CU PPT Global Bond       7.5               5.7        67.8 Britannia Life Gl Bnd    8.6               4.9        62.9 MGM Intl Bond            4.5               4.8        62.1 S&amp;P Intl Bond           32.1               5.0        61.8 Gartmore Global Bond    25.3               4.6        61.7 Sun Alliance Wrld Bd     8.6               5.1        61.1 Fidelity Intl Bond      34.8               4.8        60.8 James Capel Gl Bond      6.1               5.4        57.4 Sector average          17.2               4.9        57.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Micropal. *Offer-to-bid with net income reinvested over three years to January 1 1994.

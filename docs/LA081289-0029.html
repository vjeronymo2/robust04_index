			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SENIOR ROOKIE LEADS AT RANCHO MURIETA  </P> <P> John Paul Cain, a rookie on the Senior PGA Tour, shot a five-under-par 67  Friday to take a one-stroke lead in the opening round of the Rancho Murieta  Senior Gold Rush.  </P> <P> Ken Still was in second place at 68.  </P> <P> Ray Beallo, Bert Yancey, Phil Rodgers and Dave Hill shot 69s, and Al Geiberger,  Dan Morgan and Bob Erickson had 70s on the 6,674-yard Rancho Murieta Country  Club course.  </P> <P> Cain earned $45,000 when he won the Greater Grand Rapids Open last month.  Friday, the 53-year-old stockbroker from Houston made five birdies and said  that his victory, which earned him a one-year exemption, has allowed him to  relax and play his normal game.  </P> <P> "One of the hardest things about playing tournament golf is to be patient,"  Cain said. "The guys who have played out here for 30 years have learned that."  </P> <P> Still, who began his round on the 10th hole, was six under par after his first  eight holes. He was still six under par after a birdie on the sixth hole but  then bogeyed the next two holes to finish with a 68.  </P> <P> "I guess it's kind of like the fisherman who caught a 30-pounder and let it get  away," Still said, after playing his first nine holes in 31, only to shoot a 37  on the next nine.  </P> <P> Defending champion Bob Charles, the tour's second-leading money-winner so far  this year, shot a 73. Orville Moody, the leading money-winner with $382,768,  shot a 72. Moody won the Gold Rush in 1987.  </P></p>

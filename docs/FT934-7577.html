			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: Legislative timetable - Other measures The Sunday trading bill, which is expected to be tabled in the Commons today will be the first of the 13 bills to be debated. It will be followed shortly by the Scottish and Welsh local government, national insurance, education, trademarks and intelligence services bills. The coal privatisation bill is also expected to be introduced before Christmas, but the criminal justice and deregulation bills - the centrepiece of the programme - are still being worked on, and are unlikely to appear until next year. The other bills are the European Community amendment bill - which will increase Britain's contribution to the EC budget - the police and magistrates courts bill and the environment agencies paving bill.</p>

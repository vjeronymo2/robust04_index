			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg -- The Independent Electoral Commission  [IEC] and SA [South African] banks are finalising plans to  recruit bank tellers to count ballots. An IEC spokesman  confirmed that meetings between banks and the commission had  taken place with a view to hiring bank tellers because of their  counting skills.    The commission plans to recruit over 19,000 counters and  although bank tellers will not make up the total number, the  commission hopes they will comprise a significant portion. It  is understood that tellers have been offered R350 [rand] per day  of counting, plus travel expenses. Counting is expected to take  two days.    Meanwhile, the commission has estimated that 3.5 million  temporary voter cards have been printed by the Home Affairs  Department, one million of which have already been issued. The  commission has changed the registration process for the issuing  of the cards to avoid the long queues that have occurred due to  the complicated forms. The commission has pointed out that ID  documents, reference books and identity cards for temporary  identity certificates can be used and that people with these  documents need not apply for temporary voter cards.    The IEC has released the total number of eligible voters in  the different regions. The total number of voters will be  22,709,152. The approximate number in each of the regions are  Western Cape (2.4 million), Northern Cape (440,000), Eastern  Cape (3.2 million), [Orange] Free State (1.6 million), Natal  (4.6 million), the Northern West (1.7 million), the PWV  [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] (4.9 million), the  Eastern Transvaal (1.6 million) and the Northern Transvaal (2.3  million).</p>

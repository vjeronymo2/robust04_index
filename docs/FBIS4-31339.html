			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, June 3 (CTK) -- The Slovak parliament  today rejected the bill on place names which would enable the  use of bilingual (Slovak-Hungarian) names for towns and villages  in which the ethnic minority populations make up at least one  fifth of the population. One of Slovakia's commitments towards  the Council of Europe remains thus unfulfilled and the  government coalition suffered a serious break.    Although the coalition supported by the Hungarian minority  parties had a majority in parliament, only 67 deputies voted for  the law, 61 deputy voted against it and 6 deputies abstained  from voting. Only one vote more was required for the law to be  passed.    Two of the 14 Hungarian deputies present abstained from the  vote and one even voted against. These three deputies from the  Egyutteles movement were dissatisfied by the change in the  initial government bill banning the use of Hungarian names in  the case of villages named after Slovak historical figures, such  as for example Sladkovicovo and Hurbanovo.    The failure was also due to the absence of a part of  coalition deputies and the negative stand by former supporters  of the Slovak National Party (SNS) who have come over to the  government camp. The SNS was a coalition partner of Vladimir  Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, HZDS, until the  government was dismissed in mid-March.    The parliament rejected proposals for changes in the bill,  but approved a compromise proposal by Lubomir Forgas from the  government Democratic Left Party (SDL) to ban names from the  period of Magyarisation and Hortyite occupation of southern  Slovakia in World War Two. The proposal would also make it  possible to change the names stated in the minority's language  on the basis of local referendum.    This was a second attempt to comply with Slovakia's promise  to fulfill recommendations from the Council of Europe (CE) last  June when Slovakia was admitted as a CE member.    In January this year the parliament rejected a bill  submitted  by Meciar's government, also due to negative votes by Hungarian  deputies, because the bill would have allowed bilingual road  sign posts only in communities in which the minority constitutes  at least 30 per cent of the population.    The two-day heated debate has confirmed that the nationality  question has been a topic of political struggle before autumn  elections (September 30-October 1). The opposition did not  hesitate to argue with fears of Magyrisation, irredentism and  Hungarian territorial autonomy in the south inhabited by a  Hungarian minority of more than half a million.    Hungarian deputies did not conceal their disappointment at  the government's failure to fulfill its promise made to the  Hungarian coalition (Egyutteles and the Hungarian Christian  Democratic Movement, MKDH -- 14 out of a total of 150  parliamentary seats).    MKDH group's chairman Pal Csaky told CTK that "it would be  premature to speak about a coalition crisis, but it (the bill's  rejection) will have serious consequences. We will not go over  to the opposition in any case, this would be short-sighted."    Arpad Duka-Zolyomi from Egyutteles said that "the government  coalition has failed to keep its word... The situation can  assume the proportions of a crisis." But he added that "union  with the opposition is ruled out."    He said that the Hungarian groups had supported the bill  even  in the changed form because it would have allowed 480  communities to use Hungarian names. He added he did not think  that the different stands by three Egyutteles deputies could  affect the Hungarian coalition's unity.    Peter Weiss, chairman of the strongest coalition entity,  Democratic Left Party (SDL), said "the (failed) vote on one bill  cannot be considered an expression of difficulties in the  government coalition. I do not see the ensuing situation as  dramatic."    He said that HZDS and SNS deputies had not had the will to  agree to an acceptable compromise, but added he was convinced  that "any government will have to submit such a law sooner or  later" because of the commitment made to the CE.    "The Movement for a Democratic Slovakia and the Slovak  National Party do not have any other but the nationality card  for their voters and they want to base their campaign on  provoking the feeling of danger," Weiss said.    Tibor Cabaj, chairman of the HZDS group, said: "We could not  support the bill since our proposals improving it were not  accepted. The project solved only the demands of the Hungarian  minority and did not take into consideration the others.  Moreover, it directly forced (on communities) bilingualism  while our proposal left it up to the communities to decide."    "The law was not approved because of the absence of deputies  from the government coalition," chairman of the Democratic Union  (DEUS) group Vladimir Bajan admitted.    He added that the expected the negative stand by deputies  from the National Democratic Party-New Alternative (NDS-NA) of  Ludovit Cernak to have "repercussions" in the coalition.    "The compromise character of the law was so strong that it  was impossible not to approve it. The revivalists (Slovak  historical figures) have only caused problems. It will probably  be necessary to call an extraordinary coalition meeting," Bajan  said.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: European chemicals It will take more than marginal capacity cuts to transform the outlook for Europe's petrochemicals companies. If European producers can agree to close inefficient plant - they appeared close to a deal last week - capacity utilisation and profitability should improve. But with BASF's large Antwerp cracker due to start production, token closures will not suffice. Besides, the real pain in the current downturn has been caused by weak prices rather than low utilisation rates. There seems little hope of a substantial pricing recovery until capacity elsewhere in the world is brought into line with demand. Higher prices in Europe would suck in imports, notably from the US. Since US companies are generally low-cost producers, the flow of imports would be triggered at prices which would leave most European producers in the red. That cost disadvantage will not be easily solved. Small European plants using expensive feedstocks to make plastics in countries with high labour costs face a long uphill struggle. Even so, firmer plastics prices combined with higher utilisation rates would bring mild relief. The worry is that the prospect of subsidies for plant closures is delaying action that would otherwise be taken on economic grounds alone. If the talks are going to fail, it is better that they do so soon.</p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOSEPH N. BELL: SON'S DEDICATION TO LIFE SURVIVES HIS IRREPARABLE LOSS  </P> <P> Two very dear Corona del Mar friends lost a 24-year-old son in a tragic  accident last weekend. He was riding his bicycle near the UCLA campus, when he  was struck from behind and hurtled into an oncoming car.  </P> <P> His parents, our friends, were in Chicago on the second leg of a much-needed  vacation that had taken them first to see the fall colors of New England. They  received word of the accident in their hotel from the Chicago police in the  middle of the night and made "the longest flight we'll ever know" back on the  morning's first plane.  </P> <P> They were given hope at first, and moved into a motel near the UCLA hospital  where they were joined by their other two grown sons, one an Orange County  businessman, the other a student in San Diego.  </P> <P> The vigil was heartbreaking. For a few shining hours for this wonderfully close  family, there seemed a chance of improvement. Then the massive head injuries  required a second surgery from which the young man emerged with no hope of  recovery. Joshua Lapin died the next day, surrounded by his family.  </P> <P> His parents called us when they arrived from Chicago, reaching out as thank God  we are able to do at such times. But we weren't there. My wife and I were  attending a meeting in Palm Springs, and by the time we got the news, Joshua  was gone.  </P> <P> We rushed to the Lapin home and found the support system already in operation.  Their two surviving sons were stout pillars of strength. Fellow worshipers from  their temple were lining up at the back door with food and condolences. Their  rabbi had been to visit and would be coming again.  </P> <P> But even in the midst of such an outpouring of support, it was clear that dear  friends who come without any of the built-in closeness of extended family or  business or religious relationships fill a very special need, too. Friends come  purely out of love; they carry no other baggage.  </P> <P> But what can even close friends say at such a time? The loss is so profound,  the pain so deep. The one thing that none of us ever expect to do is bury our  own children. Nothing can prepare us for this, and the loss is inconsolable.  </P> <P> Every human life is special, but this young man was extra special. Joshua was  thoughtful and caring and sensitive and funny and smart and intense. Full of  curiosity and zest for life. As his younger brother said during a magnificently  affirmative funeral service, "He didn't just touch people; he grabbed them."  </P> <P> At his father's 50th birthday party last year, Joshua took over the proceedings  with a style so delightful and loving that none of us who were there will ever  forget it. His light shone. It will continue to shine, but in the immediate  shock of death, only the irreparable loss seems real.  </P> <P> I'm writing this a few hours after the funeral. The service by Rabbi Mark  Miller struck an exact -- and remarkably elusive -- chord that embraced  spiritual sustenance, human yearning and grief, warm recollection and  commitment to the continuum of life. Mourners gathered at the home afterward  for food and drink and talk -- and to put into place the first girder in the  bridge between the ceremonies of death and the rededication to life -- a  painful, difficult passage.  </P> <P> There will be quiet in their home soon -- as there is in mine now. The guests  will go home, the talk will fade and the emptiness of grief will be faced in  the first step of the healing process. I ache for my friends, and I know of no  means beyond those so beautifully demonstrated today to ease their pain. I once  thought I had such answers and offered them up glibly. I have no answers now.  Only love. Unconditional love -- and whatever healing and solace it can bring.  </P> <P> I'm pondering, too, what this week has said to me -- and what use I will make  of it. Over and over in the strength of these bereaved people, I saw  demonstrated the quite remarkable ability of the human psyche to draw on some  deep resource to carry us through such experiences as this. The example is  comforting. We will all be called on to tap it, although probably under less  shattering circumstances than these.  </P> <P> But the thought that kept recurring is the suddenness with which tragedy can  strike. I don't know that we are ever fully prepared for the death of a loved  one, even when age or illness conditions us. But there is no preparation for  the sudden death of a loved one with much of life left to experience. And so we  are plunged into an overpowering emptiness and a sense of the fragility of life  that can be snuffed out at the most unfair and mundane moment.  </P> <P> And also into this void comes the question: Why was this young life taken at  this time and in this way?  </P> <P> I had no trouble dealing with the "Why?" because it has become a meaningless  question to me. Since I don't believe that God decreed this boy's death, the  question is unanswerable -- and should therefore be dismissed. But the  fragility of life gave me pause until I began to realize how dangerous and  counterproductive a constant awareness of this can be.  </P> <P> There are two ways to deal with this sense of fragility: to become cautious and  careful in everything we do and refuse to go one-on-one with life; or to take  life at its fullest, to challenge it head-on, to explore its crevices and  recesses and -- most of all -- to enjoy the process without reservation.  </P> <P> This is the way Joshua Lapin lived; this is his legacy. As Rabbi Miller said  during the funeral service: "Joshua is probably debating with God right now --  and giving as good as he gets."  </P> <P> So my deepest thanks to you, Joshua, for teaching me -- and so many others --  this lesson. And to your family members for the example they have set of the  dignity and compassion and strength and love that is possible for humans to  achieve. All of us who shared this week with you and your family will live more  fully as a result. I think that will please you.  </P></p>

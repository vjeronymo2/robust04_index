			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / UK Company News: Growth at S&amp;U restricted to 5% S&amp;U, the consumer credit house and hosiery maker, lifted pre-tax profits by 5 per cent in the year to January 31, despite two adverse factors. One was an exceptional cost of Pounds 134,000 in objecting to the compulsory purchase order on the central Birmingham office, and the other was the fire at the hosiery company in Leicester - the insurance claim was in preparation. Turnover was little changed at Pounds 52.9m (Pounds 52.3m) and the profit came out at Pounds 4.52m (Pounds 4.31m). Earnings were 27.4p (25.35p) and the dividend is 10p, against 8.18p adjusting for a scrip issue; the final is 7.6p.</p>

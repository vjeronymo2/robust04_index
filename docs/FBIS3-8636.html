The Muslim leadership does not like the policy pursued by  the  leadership of the Tuzla municipality, since it affects also the  different trends and political divisions in the Muslim  leadership in Sarajevo, and blunts the fighting fervor against  Serbs.    In accordance with the radical policy of Muslim leader Alia  Izetbegovic, new orders for mobilization have been issued in the  Tuzla region in order to continue the offensive on Serbian  positions towards Brcko and east of Tuzla towards Doboj, Trebava  and Podrinja, a region under Serbian control in Bosnia.    Izetbegovic ordered last week his forces to capture Doboj  and  its surroundings, whatever the cost.    In the last few days, Muslim units have been reinforced to  launch an offensive on Serbian sttlements and positions on the  Mountain Majevica, east of Tuzla.    The brigade was reinforced by the so-called Sarajevo Muslim  Army Corps, whose forces have been transferred from central  Bosnia following the signing of the accord with Croats and the  placing of heavy weaponry around Sarajevo under U.N. control.</p>

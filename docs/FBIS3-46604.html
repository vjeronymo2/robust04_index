			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Anna Teo] </F>   [Text] Singapore -- Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong yesterday  delivered Singaporeans splendid news in his New Year message:  The economy did well in 1993, growing 9.8 percent and attracting  a record $3.9 billion [Singapore dollars] in manufacturing  investments. The 9.8 percent expansion, the strongest annual  growth since 1988, would mean an unexpectedly strong  fourth-quarter spurt of around 12 percent, going by the  preliminary estimate of about 9 percent for the first nine  months of last year.    The Ministry of Trade &amp; Industry in mid-November last  year  forecast 1993 growth of close to 9 percent, a figure which the  private sector has since set its sights on. Growth last year  was broad-based, and for the first time in five years,  productivity grew faster than real wages, said Mr Goh.    The strong flow of investment commitments last year,  surpassing the 1992 volume of $3.5 billion, confirms that  Singapore remained competitive despite a sluggish world economy  and China's strong pull, he said. But the overall average last  year was pushed up by the exceptional performance of the  financial and business services sector, especially the stock  market, Mr Goh noted.    Also, there are some signs that the manufacturing sector is  slowing down, which Singapore should watch carefully, he added.    Still, 1994 looks promising with the world economy  improving,  and Singaporeans can look forward to another good year, the PM  said. MTI is sticking to its earlier forecast of 1994 growth at  between 6 and 8 percent.    With the NAFTA Bill approved in Congress, and the Uruguay  Round of trade talks wrapped up, there is now a positive and  improving global trading environment, he said. Economic  recovery and steady growth in the U.S., Europe and Japan this  year will pull other countries along. Except for Japan, growth  in the Asia-Pacific will remain buoyant, and Singapore will  benefit from the regional boom. Singapore must seek and seize  the opportunities by participating in the region's growth, he  said.    Turning to the longer term, Mr Goh said one problem  Singapore  should pay more attention to is its rapid ageing population.    "This ageing population will have serious implications for  our economic vigour and competitiveness," he said. "We need to  make major adjustments to cope with this change."    Singapore has taken several steps -- raising the retirement  age to 60, getting Singaporeans to exercise and stay healthy,  getting them to save for old age -- but more still needs to be  done. The subject will be discussed in greater depth this year,  said Mr Goh.    While Singapore is not the only country with the problem,  its  population is ageing much faster than elsewhere because births  have declined sharply after the post-war baby boom, the Prime  Minister said. Typical Western countries take 50 years or more  for the proportion of elderly above 65 to double from 10 to 20  percent, but Singapore will take only about 20 years.  Furthermore, Singapore's edge of a substantially younger  population, compared with the developed countries, will narrow  and will eventually almost disappear in the next few decades.    Over the next 40 years, the Singapore population is  projected  to grow 30 percent from 2.7 million to 3.5 million, but the  number of people above 65 years will jump by three times from  164,000 to 662,000.    "Provided we prepare early for what lies ahead, we can  surmount this challenge, as we have many other challenges in the  past," said Mr Goh.</p>

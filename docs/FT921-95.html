			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Public-sector pay makes up ground THE PLEDGE by Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, that his government would not allow public-sector pay to fall further behind the private sector reflects a general assumption that public servants invariably fare less well. But in recent settlements they have done comparatively well. From tomorrow, 1.5m public-sector workers whose pay is determined by government-appointed review bodies will receive rises averaging 6.5 per cent. Private-sector settlements are running at between 4 per cent and 5 per cent. Average gross weekly earnings in the public sector this year are expected to overtake those in the private sector. An analysis by the Public Finance Foundation shows that the rise in public-sector pay was 2.5 percentage points above private-sector settlements in 1991-92. It predicts a 1 percentage point advantage in 1992-93. This will restore public-sector earnings to where they were relative to the private sector 20 year ago, according to the foundation. However there have been marked variations between public-sector groups in recent years. Since 1979, nurses and police officers have done comparatively well. Civil servants and BBC workers have been less fortunate. Annual public-sector pay rises tend to lag behind the private sector for some years and then catch up. As the last few years have generally seen a catch-up, government willingness to pay large rises is likely to be less marked than it would have been, say, three years ago, when the public/ private gap was growing.</p>

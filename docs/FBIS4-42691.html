			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with EC Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert </F> by Hugo Camps; place and date not given: "`Maastricht Was a  Failure"]    [Excerpt] According to Karel van Miert, as time goes by  Europe is behaving more and more like an out of control  projectile. The aimlessness of the European Union (EU) strikes  the citizen in the face like a tasteless striptease.    [Van Miert] Here are two examples. In Germany and elsewhere,  there are those who fervently advocate the rapid integration of  a number of central European countries, i.e., enlargement as the  certificate of good European behavior. Nobody is warning about  the dramatic consequences this will have for the countries  joining. We have obviously not learned from the unexpected  integration of East Germany. Enlargement means that the new  member states will be entitled to get money from the EU budgets.  The amount of the regional and structural funds must be  increased immediately. That presupposes doubling the European  budget. Germany set the ball rolling for a rapid accession of  the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Slovenia. Yet it is aiming  to slim down its own contribution. So we are faced with a  flagrant contradiction which creates a tremendous amount of  conflict.    [Camps] Europe is threatening to sink beneath its own  foundations.    [Van Miert] The EU institutional organization can clearly  digest the enlargement from 12 to 16 member states. With the  accession of a number of central European countries, however,  the administrative apparatus is backed into a tight corner. And  that is not all. The Greeks, British, and Spaniards are now  calling for Malta and Cyprus to join the EU. In short, a total  imbroglio is right outside our door with an escalation of the  conflicts between large and small states plus the prestige envy  between small countries and ministates. Will anyone ever agree  that Malta should speak for the entire EU as Luxembourg can  today? With this harebrained accession policy we are heading  straight for the abyss. Some people can see this, but hesitate  to warn others about it. Others secretly reckon that Europe will  go to its institutional chaos."    What most grieves the European commissioner is the fact that  the original motivation for European unification has been  abandoned. Somberly, he said: "A Community that goes further  than an interstate cooperation is needed now more than ever. We  once again find ourselves in a political context which at that  time was so crucial for the EU creation: Europe as an answer to  the spiral of border conflicts. Those who thought that the  passion for territory had subsided now have one less illusion  because of the tragedy in Yugoslavia. Within the Union too, the  yearning for border corrections is rife. The new majority in  Italy has already let it be known publicly that it wants to  review its border with Yugoslavia. Istria could be the  beginning of a nightmare. In Germany, too, the border issue is  a sensitive point. The EU is a child of the Cold War. Now that  the Cold War is over, some people have growing desire to modify  the former borders. It surprises me that a European offensive  has not yet gotten under way to counteract this perverse  mentality."    Karel Van Miert does not want to be called a prophet of  doom.  However: "For the first time in postwar history, there is the  danger that we will all wake up in the old Europe of the  1930's." The only antidote he sees to the irreversible process  of unravelling and dilution is the faster implementation of  political and monetary union, even in a Europe moving at  different speeds. "If monetary union is not implemented within  five years, then it could be too late. I am afraid that by then  we would have definitely missed our chance."    [Camps] So the Maastricht Treaty has been outstripped.    [Van Miert] Maastricht was a failure. We did not feel the  historical momentum of the time. Kohl himself said that Europe  had to be institutionally reinforced in view of German  unification. The signal was not picked up in Maastricht. For  me it has been an enormous disappointment. Instead of quickly  elaborating a monetary union and a defense community, Maastricht  awakened the illusion that a common foreign policy had been set  aside for Europe. That is like putting the cart before the  horse. Foreign policy must grow out of a common monetary and  defense policy. Not the other way around. [passage omitted]</p>

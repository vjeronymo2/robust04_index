			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Y.C. Tsai] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 23 (CNA) -- Taiwan and the Czech  Republic on Monday [23 May] entered into a business arbitration  agreement.    Wang Ling-lin, secretary-general of the Republic of China  [ROC] Business Arbitration Association, and Dr. Svetozar Hanak,  director of the Arbitration Court of the Czech Confederation of  Commerce and Industry, inked the pact at a ceremony at the Grand  Hyatt Taipei in the afternoon.    Dr. Hanak also delivered a keynote speech on the Czech  arbitration system and trade-related rules and regulations.    Speaking at the signing ceremony, Wang said the accord will  help settle the growing number of trade disputes between the two  countries arising from increased trade ties.    Trade ties between Taiwan and East Europe have been on the  rise. Statistics show that two-way trade totaled US$180 million  in the first quarter, up 23 percent from the year earlier.    This is the second business arbitration agreement Taiwan has  signed with an East European country, Wang noted.    The association, which has inked such agreements with 12  countries, including the United States, Japan, and Hungary,  wants to sign similar pacts with Britain, Austria, Singapore,  and Vietnam this year, he pointed out.</p>

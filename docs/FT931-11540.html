			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / International Company News: Blockbuster improves to Dollars 142m BLOCKBUSTER Entertainment, the US video rental chain which acquired the Cityvision group in the UK, yesterday reported after-tax profits of Dollars 45.1m in the final three months of 1992, taking the total for the year to Dollars 142m. In the fourth quarter of 1991, Blockbuster made an after-tax profit of Dollars 29m, and for all of 1991 Dollars 93.7m. At the earnings per share level, the Florida-based company - whose recent expansion moves have attempted to create a 'full-service' home entertainment group, rather than one narrowly focused on video rental - saw a figure of 77 cents in 1992, up from 56 cent in the previous 12 months. Blockbuster said revenues increased by 31 per cent to Dollars 1.98bn in 1992 overall, although this partly reflected the impact of acquisitions and expansion. In the fourth quarter, revenues for video stores which had been in operation for more than one year increased by 5.8 per cent. Yesterday, Blockbuster's finance director, Mr Gregory Fairbanks, was said to be comfortable with earnings estimates for the first quarter of 1993 that fall in the 18 to 20 cents a share range. He also estimated that Blockbuster commanded about 15 per cent of the US video rental market at end-1992, up from about 12 to 13 per cent in 1991. By the end of last year, the company had 3,127 video stores, of 2,002 were company-owned (including 775 stores in the UK, under the Ritz name). The remainder were franchised.</p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / UK Company News: Unipart climbs to record Pounds 24.9m Unipart, the motor components and accessories manufacturer and distributor, made record profits for the second successive year in 1993. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 24.9m for the year to December 31 were 26 per cent higher than the previous Pounds 19.8m, on turnover up 8 per cent at Pounds 714.1m (Pounds 661.4m). The increase was achieved against a background of slow recovery by the UK motor industry from its steepest recession on record and a 15 per cent slump in vehicle demand in continental Europe. The performance was claimed by Mr John Neill, chief executive, to vindicate 'the long-term view' which he insists managers have taken of the business since it was privatised from Rover via a management-led buy-out in 1987. The company is 42 per cent owned by management and employees, 38 per cent by institutional investors and 20 per cent by Rover. Mr Neill said he did not expect Unipart's own business to be affected in the short term by BMW's takeover of Rover and Honda's initially hostile reaction to it. Rover and Honda account for the main portion of Unipart's components manufacturing business, but Honda has indicated that existing contracts with Rover will be honoured and in the meantime, is continuing to expand its own carmaking operations at Swindon, Wiltshire. Mr Neill would not comment on longer-term implications of the takeover for Unipart. However, it is likely to be a net beneficiary of the expansion of production at Rover at which BMW has already hinted. At least one other leading German manufacturer is understood to have made approaches about possible component supplies. Mr Neill said he hoped for a further rise in profitability in 1994.</p>

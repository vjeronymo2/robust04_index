			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Multilateral phase of Middle East peace talks likely to be postponed A multilateral phase of Middle East peace talks due to convene in Moscow this month will probably be postponed until March, a senior Jordanian official said, Reuter reports from Amman. The official gave no reason for the delay but said Jordan welcomed the move, which would give more time for talks in Washington to make progress. The multilateral talks, the third phase of the Middle East peace process launched last year, had been due to start in Moscow on January 28.</p>

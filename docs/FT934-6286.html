			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gaza's farmers set for peace dividend - Israeli efforts to boost the region's agriculture Malachi Yosi is a worried man. Not far from his clean, modern nursery in the new Moshav settlement of Ein Habesor in the western Negev is the Gaza Strip  -full of fertile soil, citrus orchards, plastic covered greenhouses and competent farmers impatiently awaiting the dawn of unrestricted trade with all its neighbours. Until the intifada uprising in 1987 made it too hazardous to be dependent on the regular arrival of Palestinians from across the border, 90 per cent of the 60-odd workers in Mr Yosi's company were Palestinians. Now they comprise less than a third. With surplus labour from large families earning much lower wages, Gazan farmers can produce high quality fruit and vegetables at half the cost of their Israeli counterparts. While Israel controlled Gazan trade that did not much matter. But free trade is now an imminent prospect. Hence Mr Yosi's furrowed brow. International money is about to pour into the Gaza Strip, said to be the world's most densely populated region. And it will be liberally aided by its erstwhile conquerors. However worried Israel's farmers may be about competition, Israel's rulers are far more concerned to get the stricken Gazan economy on its feet and thriving as soon as possible. Not only is this seen as the soundest insurance against extremists: it is also in Israel's interests to channel Gaza's output of intensively-grown produce into export markets. This means not merely encouraging the most up-to-date production techniques in an industry already advanced well beyond its Arab neighbours, but creating a marketing apparatus and export facilities, which at present barely exist, save by courtesy of Israel's own sophisticated export-orientated system. Professor Avi Nachmias is the man nominated to head a group of Israeli and Palestinian experts to help expand and modernise Gaza's agricultural infrastructure, as part of a wider rehabilitation scheme. Head of one of the research stations run by Israel's Volcani Institute, the state's highly regarded agricultural research organisation, Prof Nachmias knows how interlocked Gaza's economy is with Israel's. 'We want them to export so that they don't undermine Israeli markets,' he says. 'We hope to get joint enterprises going, because Gaza is dependent on Israel for drinking water, electricity, transport to the West Bank, export facilities. . . Its agriculture is totally based on the Israeli economy - their seeds and irrigation systems, for example.' How close that connection already is can be seen from the fact that strawberries grown in Gaza account for over 60 per cent of those exported under the Israeli Carmel label. Here you have Palestinian production expertise, involving use of the most modern irrigation techniques, plant varieties and production methods, linked to an Israeli component comprising forwarding, air freight and established marketing services. Mr Ezra Sadan, one of Israel's most outspoken and influential economists, a former director-general of agriculture and now head of the Volcani, is scathing about the effect of the restrictive licensing system Israel has so far operated to limit competition from Gazan enterprises, notably in textiles, and is confident that free trade, by giving the Palestinians access to a a market 30 times its present size, will also generate more joint enterprises with Israel. Gaza's agriculture has been changing, largely because of growing salinity in the citrus groves (because of substantial over-pumping from the shallow coastal aquifer) and the fact that population growth has outstripped the rate of water replenishment. Together with the depressed prices for oranges in world markets, this has forced Gazan farmers into concentrating on high value, water-economical crops, creating what Mr Sadan recently described as 'an utterly modern horticultural industry'. In 1991 this comprised 400 hectares of greenhouses (Israel has 2,500 ha) and 700 ha of plastic tunnels. They represented an investment of between Dollars 30m and Dollars 40m divided among several hundred families. The horticultural industry is well poised to attack markets in northern Europe and throughout the Middle East. In mid- October the first (official) convoy of 17 produce-laden lorries crossed from Gaza through the West Bank en route to Dubai: a harbinger of a potentially booming trade. For Israel as a whole, with less than 3 per cent of its population now directly involved in farming or horticulture, the liberalisation of trade with Gaza is unlikely to have any serious economic impact. For people like Malachi Yosi, however, a frisson of apprehension is understandable. Nevertheless, the more speedily Israel and the West can help promote Gaza's ravaged economy and raise its living standards, and wages, the less painful will be this modest price for peace.</p>

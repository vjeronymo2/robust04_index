			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Kulik and Sergey Postanogov article: "'Arafat Is </F> Small But Smart"]    [Text] The visit to Moscow of Yasir 'Arafat, PLO Executive  Committee chairman and president of the state of Palestine, has  ended.    The main topic of the talks was, of course, the problem of  the settlement in the Near East. 'Arafat emphasized that in  spite of all the cosponsors' attempts to breath life into the  Near East process, the peace negotiations have failed. The  Israeli side is constantly maneuvering and trying to drag out  the period for withdrawing its troops from the occupied  territories, which, in his opinion, gives extremists from both  sides opportunities to undermine the peace process for once and  for all. If they succeed in doing this, the PLO leader stated,  then complete anarchy and the region's Balkanization are  inevitable.    On the subject of specific issues, it is necessary to point  out that during the talks Boris Yeltsin gave instructions to  prepare a Russian-Palestinian agreement on cultural cooperation.  It is also not ruled out that the Russian side will assist in  the formation and training of a police force in the future  autonomous entity.    But the problem is, as we know, not only relations between  the Palestinians and the Israelis but also the PLO's struggle  with such extremist organizations as Hamas. In reply to our  question about how 'Arafat intends to find a common language  with the radicals if they continue to ignore the peace  initiatives, he said that democracy presupposes the existence of  various points of view. The PLO leader added that points of  view differing from his own with regard to various problems were  "not a weakness but a strength."</p>

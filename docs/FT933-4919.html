			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / World air links 'could crumble' WORLD air networks could crumble if the industry's recession dragged on, Mr Pierre Jeanniot, director-general of the International Air Transport Association (Iata), said yesterday, Reuter reports from Cairo. Losses this year would reach 'several billion' dollars, he estimated. Mr Jeanniot told airline leaders and analysts that their troubles were far from over. 'What can happen over the next few years is the potential degeneration of international air networks.' If losses continued, more airlines would fold and the industry could implode. As the number of destinations served by airlines dropped, unit costs would rise, causing more bankruptcies. Mr Gerald Baliles, chairman of a US commission into the industry this year, said it was vital to scrap 'archaic' bilateral air traffic pacts and develop a multilateral system.</p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE / ANTHONY PERRY: THE WRITING'S ON THE WALL, BUT WHAT DOES IT  MEAN?  </P> <P> Right off, I'll tell you that I don't have the answer to this urban mystery.  </P> <P> All I know is that "Chanel, Dad Loves U" is being spray-painted across a wide  swath of San Diego.  </P> <P> The plaintive message has been spotted on the Adams Avenue bridge over  Interstate 15, on a freeway divider in Mission Bay Park and at a number of  construction sites in between, particularly downtown. "Loves" is sometimes done  with a heart.  </P> <P> For weeks I put off pursuing this. I suspected that media hoaxers might be  using a quirky name as a come-on.  </P> <P> Then I read a Valentine's Day story about a couple with a 3-year-old daughter  named Brandie. Chanel suddenly sounded more plausible.  </P> <P> My colleague, Nora Zamichow, saw a "Chanel" writer some weeks back around 9:30  p.m., putting his dark blue message on a construction fence around Symphony  Towers. He was tall and lean and maybe wearing a sweatshirt.  </P> <P> The fence has since been removed. "Chanel Dad U" then appeared on the 7th  Avenue pavement outside Symphony Hall, and on the newspaper boxes along B  Street.  </P> <P> I asked construction workers about "Chanel." Nothing. The same with the city's  anti-graffiti crews.  </P> <P> I called the Police Department. There are no missing persons named Chanel.  Also, no cases at the coroner's office.  </P> <P> I called agencies working with runaways and the parents who hunt for them.  Again, no Chanel.  </P> <P> I could find no musical group or performer named Chanel. Nor any racehorse  (Hey, wasn't Jimmy Durante's "Goodnight, Mrs. Calabash," said to be a winning  horse at 40 to 1?).  </P> <P> There are, of course, less checkable possibilities: A custody battle (one  "Chanel" is outside the Family Court building), a beloved pet, a perfume  aficionado, a love affair with role-playing, a contemporary "Kilroy Was Here,"  and more.  </P> <P> Maybe it's better that we not know.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Don't Drink the Water  </P> <P> Combatants in the court fight between the city of San Diego and the  Environmental Protection Agency will tour the city's sewage stations today.  </P> <P> A lunch break is included at the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant. Yummy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Club Comes to Arresting End  </P> <P> If this isn't true, may I be struck by lightning.  </P> <P> After Channel 10 did a story recently on a South Bay financial gambit called  the Chairman of the Board Club, the club operator began to feel the heat.  </P> <P> His pitch is that, for a mere $150, an investor can reap $27,000 as new  investors are found. State and federal laws often take a dim view of such  things, as the story pointed out.  </P> <P> So, at a recent gathering of would-be investors in Bonita, club operator Noble  Robinson tried to calm the waters.  </P> <P> "You may have heard on television that this is illegal," he said. "If it was  illegal, the cops would be in the audience tonight. They would arrest me, take  me to jail and close down the club."  </P> <P> You guessed the rest.  </P> <P> The words were barely out of Robinson's mouth when investigators from the  district attorney's office and an undercover cop from Chula Vista stood up in  the audience and identified themselves.  </P> <P> They arrested Robinson, took him to jail and closed down the club. He's charged  with running a pyramid scheme, kind of a low-rent J. David &amp; Co.  </P></p>

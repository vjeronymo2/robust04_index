			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Election '92 (Ballot Box): Stretching it Few political parties are daft enough to use fabricated statistics, but they can massage the truth, as yesterday's Tory education document shows. 'We are making a great deal of progress,' the policy document claims. 'In 1979 only 46 per cent of 16-year-olds stayed on in full-time education. The figure is now 75 per cent and rising.' A recent government publication, Education Statistics 1991, puts the total at just 50 per cent, but that statistic applied to 1989. In 1988 only a little over 30 per cent of 18-year-olds in England and Wales were still in full-time education - less than half the level in Japan, France and Germany. So why should there have been such a boom since? The reason is the recession. The unemployment rate for men aged between 18 and 19 rose from 13.8 per cent in October 1988 to 18.3 per cent last October. For those aged 16 to 17, who can no longer register as unemployed and claim benefit, the current lack of jobs makes staying on at school an obvious alternative. Even so, many will leave higher education with no qualifications. Only two thirds of 17-year-olds and 50 per cent of 18-year-olds who stay on are studying for courses leading to qualifications. Similarly, only 40 per cent of Youth Trainees gain any qualifications at all.</p>

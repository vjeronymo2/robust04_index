			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 16 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata emerged as the favorite Saturday night [16 April] to  succeed outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa as the ruling  coalition reached basic agreement on key policies, coalition  sources said. The sources said deputies of the ruling coalition  parties will resume talks on Monday to finalize the accord and  send it to the heads of the coalition parties, who will then  decide to choose Hata, 58, as their candidate for premiership.    Parliamentary balloting for the next prime minister is  likely  to take place either April 19 or 20 and Hata, who is also deputy  premier, will become the new Japanese leader.    Saturday's agreement was bad news for former Foreign  Minister  Michio Watanabe of the largest opposition Liberal Democratic  Party, who sources said may decide not to run for prime minister  because of a lack of support.    Hata left Marrakech, Morocco on Friday morning for Tokyo  after attending high-level talks and signing a new global trade  pact.    Watanabe will hold a second round of talks with LDP  President  Yohei Kono on Monday in which Kono will try to talk 70-year-old  Watanabe into abandoning his plans to succeed Hosokawa, 56, LDP  sources said.    Watanabe has toyed with an idea of quitting the LDP and  seeking an alliance with Shinseito [Japan renewal Party], of  which Hata is leader, and Komeito [Clean Government Party], in a  bid to become the next prime minister. But sources close to the  Watanabe faction inside the LDP predicted that Watanabe would  drop plans to run for premiership.    During the meeting of the deputies, the ruling parties  ironed  out their differences over such key issues as political reform,  Tokyo's policy toward North Korea's alleged nuclear arms  program, its international contributions and tax reform,  officials said.    New party Sakigake [Harbinger Party], one of the coalition  parties which declared Friday that it will not take a post in a  new cabinet, did not send its representative to the meeting.    The senior coalition officials confirmed the ruling parties  will stick with a policy accord reached before the startup of  the Hosokawa administration last August, Social Democratic Party  (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ] Secretary  General Wataru Kubo told a news conference.    Kubo also said the parties should reach an agreement calling  for early Diet approval of the already overdue fiscal 1994  budget as the next government's "urgent and most important task."    The policy discussions followed a week of political turmoil  triggered by Hosokawa's abrupt decision to call it quits on  April 8.    On the stance Japan will take toward North Korea's suspected  nuclear arms program, the SDP, which has traditionally  maintained close ties with the (North) Korean Workers' Party,  will not face difficulties in working out a common policy, Kubo  said. "We will honor a U.N. decision and strive to do all we  can within the bounds of the Constitution," he said, in a  reference to the SDP's readiness to respect the possibility of  U.N. sanctions against the communist country.    At Saturday's meeting, the ruling party representatives  concurred on the need to solve the question of how to define the  role of Japan-U.S. security arrangements, Kubo and other  coalition officials said.</p>

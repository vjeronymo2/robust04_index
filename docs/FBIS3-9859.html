			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Friedrich Koenig and Gunnar Jansson, rapporteurs of  the Council of Europe, met today with the representatives of the  Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR]. On this occasion  Florin Radulescu Botica, PDSR secretary and head of the Romanian  parliamentary delegation to the Council of Europe, reiterated  the political will and interest of both the PDSR and the  government in ensuring the fulfillment of the commitments  assumed by Romania upon admittance to the Council of Europe.  The main target is the ratification by Parliament of the  European Human Rights Convention, which will take place by 15  April at the latest. In his turn, Gunnar Jansson said this term  of six months is quite extraordinary, if Romania ratifies the  European Human Rights Convention by 15 April. Mr. Koenig left  the meeting for a few minutes to inform the German and Austrian  press -- as he later told us -- of President Ion Iliescu's act  of clemency in pardoning certain detainees, an act that,  according to Mr. Koenig, has been well received in Austria and  Germany as they celebrate the Holy Week, according to the  Catholic calendar.    The next meeting of the Council of Europe rapporteurs was  with the representatives of the Democratic Convention [CDR],  whose leader, Emil Constantinescu, reiterated the CDR's  contribution to Romania's admittance to the Council of Europe,  regarded as a goal in the national interest. Koenig said that  the CDR's position has played a decisive role in ensuring a  majority vote in favor of Romania's admittance. Emil  Constantinescu referred to several aspects that he considered to  be in dissonance with the commitments assumed. Among other  things, he mentioned the government's sabotaging of the local  administration, where the opposition holds an important stake;  the need to ensure the dependence of the justice branch; and  government corruption. The CDR leader said that the freedom of  the press is total and real, with the pressures applied being  generally of an economic nature. Emil Constantinescu emphasized  the objective stance of the national radio station and the  television's dependence on the power. At the end of the  meeting, Dinu Patriciu, president of Liberal Party-1993, handed  over to the two rapporteurs a memorandum from his political  grouping, whereby it considers itself deprived of a rightful  place in the parliamentary delegation to the Council of Europe.    The rapporteurs of the Council of Europe met with the  leaders  of the parliamentary groups from the Senate and the Chamber of  Deputies.</p>

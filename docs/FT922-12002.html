			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Arts: A Dead Secret There is nothing like death to revive a reputation. Rodney Ackland, one of the most subtly provocative playwrights of the century, was blasted into oblivion by Look Back in Anger and the obsession with 'realistic' drama in the 1950s. He died, virtually forgotten, last year. Now his plays are everywhere, especially if everywhere includes Richmond. Currently you can see his brooding 1943 masterpiece The Dark River at the new and enlarged Orange Tree, while around the corner at the refurbished Richmond Theatre is his earlier work, A Dead Secret. On the surface this was a play of its time (the early 1930s), a safe pot-boiler for weekly reps - a solid fictionalisation of the case of the arsenic poisoner Frederick Seddon. In his programme notes the director, Roger Redfarn, reminisces how he first appeared on the stage as the second, totally silent, totally unnecessary, constable, who in the final minute appears to arrest the Seddon character. Even today this touring production fills the stage with a solidly satisfying set, an Edwardian villa down to the aspidistra and stained glass, and stretching up two floors, plus a throng of actors. But while much is familiar and unexceptional, Ackland, always an outsider, unsettles the progression of a predictable plot with a brooding uncertainty. Did Seddon, here called Frederick Dyson and played by Edward Woodward, murder his rich lodger or was he the victim of his miserly, self-righteous, bigoted, character? While lesser playwrights would have forced up the temperature with an on-stage murder, or a combative court scene, Ackland concentrates on the character of Dyson. We only learn in an aside that Maria Lummus (Vivienne Martin) has died. This is the dissection of an ordinary man, with banal vices, caught in extraordinary circumstances. Everything revolves around Woodward - known to clerk and servant as 'The Great I Am'. Unfortunately he only takes full command of the role in the third act. Then the earlier longeurs are seen to be the fault of performances rather than of play. Woodward is considerably bolstered by Michele Dotrice, a decent woman still besotted with her warped husband, and by Auriol Smith as the batty maid. Even the children are credible in a play which works at one level as an exposure of pre-1914 lower middle class gentility and at another as a clue-ridden detective story. In the final moment you start to feel sorry for Dyson, concerned at his fate. And you realise how clever Ackland has been at balancing the need of an audience for a spine tingling melodrama and his own desire to create a character of classically tragic stature. Richmond Theatre until 18 April, then on tour.</p>

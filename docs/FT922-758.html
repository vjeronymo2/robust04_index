			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (30): A blue chip may emerge - Petrochemicals THE SECOND phase of privatising Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Ltd (IPCL), one of the state's few profit-making companies, is scheduled for later this year. In the first phase the government sold 20 per cent of its Rs1.86bn equity to mutual funds; now New Delhi will cut its stake to 51 per cent. IPCL, seen as an emerging blue chip with sales of nearly Rs20bn last year, operates a hydrocarbon cracker at Baroda, its headquarters in the western state of Gujarat. It has a second cracker and downstream petrochemical units located near Bombay. The company is now building the third cracker at Gandhar, also in Gujarat. A Rs48.75bn (Pounds 938m) investment is planned over the next five years on modernisation and expansion, with Rs34.75bn at Gandhar. The cash-strapped government has given notice that IPCL should raise all the money on its own. Mr Hashmukh Shah, chairman, says IPCL has not relied on budgetary support for years and does not wish to do so now. Last December, the government sold to mutual funds through bids 20 per cent of the equity at IPCL and several other state enterprises to mop up Rs30bn and narrow the budget deficit. The Narasimha Rao administration is under pressure from the IMF and World Bank to quicken the pace of economic reforms and cut the budget support to state enterprises. New Delhi is to bring the budget deficit down to 5 per cent of GDP this year from 6.5 per cent last year. The funds required for the new facilities that IPCL is to build are far greater than the company ever attempted to mobilise in the past. Innovative financing methods are needed. Mr Shah wants these plans to be in place before he retires at the end of the year. Nearly Rs20bn will come from internal resources and the remainder is to be raised through equity, supplier's credits and commercial loans overseas. But India's securities market scandal has soured immediate prospects for companies wanting to tap the overseas capital market. Mr Shitin Desai of DSP Financial Consultants says a local issue will have to precede the overseas flotation. The primary capital market is buoyant despite the securities scam. The convertible stock of Mangalore Refinery, a joint sector company, was oversubscribed nearly five times at the end of May. Petrochemical shares are fancied by local investors. The Rs10 shares of Nocil, a joint venture of Mafatlal Group and Shell, are quoted at Rs2,100 on Bombay Stock Exchange. Analysts attribute this high price to the track record of management, attractive earnings per share and expectations of future performance. Mr Shah says the market values the IPCL shares at 10-15 times their par value. The shares were traded unofficially at Rs700 in March at the height of the stock market boom. The government, which sold IPCL equity to mutual funds at the low price of Rs70 per share in the first phase of divestment, is determined to get a proper price in the second phase through a public offer. But the stumbling block is IPCL's poor performance last year. Earnings per share plunged to Rs1.45 from Rs4.81 three years ago. The Bombay petrochemical complex was shut for the best part of the year after an explosion in an ancillary plant. Mr Shah has to convince investors the future is rosy. He projects the earnings per share to jump to Rs8.9 this year but will level off later as the company intends to double its equity to Rs4bn in five years. Sales are to double to Rs43bn in five years from Rs20bn. He claims these are conservative projections, making allowance for a moderate rise in profits as the government reduces import tariffs by half to nearly 50 per cent over the next three years and exposes Indian petrochemical companies to overseas competition. Meanwhile, IPCL is exposing its staff to the international market by seeking to establish a joint venture in Saudi Arabia. It is to build a Rs8bn engineering plastics plant with General Electric of the US at Baroda and improve IPCL profitability.</p>

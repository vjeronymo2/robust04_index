			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Starikevich report: "Belorussian Authorities </F> Review Their Attitude to Press"]    [Text] Minsk -- The scenario of the presidential elections  scripted by the ideologues of the Belorussian [Belarusian]  "party in power" ["Partiya vlasti"] is now being played out.  The government has dealt the first blow against the mass media.    The latest statement by Vladimir Zametalin, the Belorussian  prime minster's press secretary, was wholly devoted to the  biggest circulation opposition newspaper SVABODA [Freedom].  IZVESTIYA has managed to secure a xerox of Zametalin's original  statement.    "Formally opposed to the development of democratic processes  in the republic, nationalistically minded political forces are  attempting to raise their public profile through the methods of  discrediting the policy of state organs, slandering state  leaders, and whipping up hysteria in the period of the campaign  to elect the first president of Belorussia [Belarus].... The  greatest activity in the creation of conditions of civil  confrontation is being displayed by a newspaper with a title  clearly at odds with its basic tendency -- SVABODA. The  newspaper...is continuing to act as the political cutting-edge  of national extremism in the republic.... The constant search  for unverified, so-called `compromising' materials against the  most constructive, influential, and prestigious people has  become the rule for the paper's creative conduct and thematic  direction.... Taking into account numerous requests from  citizens...the Government considers it its duty to revise  relations with this publication in the interests of  consolidating stability in the state...."    The press secretary's statement conveys the atmosphere being  created in the republic by the republic authorities on the eve  of the elections sufficiently clearly. The powers that be  [vlastnyye strktury] are seeking to neutralize anyone belonging  to the opposition to the "most constructive and prestigious  people" (read -- Prime Minsiter Vyacheslav Kebich) for the  period of the election campaign.    In the case of SVABODA, they have acted simply. The paper's  chief editor Igor Germenchuk told IZVESTIYA's correspondent that  the "Belorusskiy dom pechati" publishing house has refused to  print, and the Ministry of Communications to circulate, the  "awkward" newspaper. At the present time the editors are  exploring the possibility of publishing the newspaper outside  Belorusssia.    To this it should be added that in the state radio two radio  stations have been disbanded: "Belaruskaya maladzezhnaya"  ["Belarusian Youth"] and "Krynitsa" ["Source"]. The propaganda  apparatus set up by the Belorussian Government does not provide  for such "oases of democracy." Journalists have only to wait to  see who will be the next victim of the "revision of relations."</p>

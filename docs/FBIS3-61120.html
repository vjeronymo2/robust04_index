			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yanina Sokolovskaya: "The Hryvnya Will Kick In </F> on Thursday--When Pigs Fly?"]    [Text] As if a magician, the government has finally  produced from its sleeve a trump card which was secreted there  for a long time--the national currency, the HRYVNYA. Waving it  before the nose of the man in the street, the government uttered  a tirade about the prompt stabilization of the economic  situation in the country and the introduction of a new monetary  unit which would be capable of real conversion.    It remains a rhetorical question whether this is possible  given hyperinflation, a 13.3-percent drop in production, and  other economic "joys." As Minister of the Economy R. Shpek  hinted, at a minimum, equilibrium should be restored at the  macrolevel and a stabilization fund of the new monetary unit  should be established in order to introduce the hryvnya  properly. According to data from experts, $2-3 billion will be  needed to this end. Meanwhile, the National Bank of Ukraine does  not have such funds, as V. Yushchenko, its chairman of the  board, testifies. The 10 percent of foreign exchange sold to the  state on a compulsory basis which is called upon to generate  this fund will hardly be able to serve as even a feeble prop for  the hryvnya.    However, this does not at all mean that the public release  of  the Ukrainian currency is far away. According to a report from  Deputy Prime Minister V. Landyk, this will happen after New  Year's day. As V. Yushchenko specified, "on one of the  Thursdays." In all of this, as recently as a few weeks ago, it  was planned to count on the cost of one hryvnya coming to 1,000  karbovantsy. Now the hryvnya is valued at 10,000. This multiple  will change as time goes by, and it will hardly change downward.  For now, the economy of Ukraine continues to exist in the  environment of a dual-rate policy. One of the rates will be  established on the exchange where 4 to 7 percent of the  foreign-exchange proceeds of Ukraine will be sold. The second,  official exchange rate will be set a day later at a meeting of  the tender committee consisting of the representatives of  ministries and headed by V. Landyk. This committee will decide  who to give or not to give the foreign exchange to, having  compiled a list of enterprises and high-priority facilities that  need it. At present, according to the committee's calculations,  the exchange rate of the dollar comes to 12,600 karbovantsy  whereas by the end of the year it will not be higher than 25,000  karbovantsy. The chief of the committee observed: "Everything  will depend on our work and on the issuance of inflationary  karbovantsy; after all, our rate is no longer fixed but  floating."    However, despite more favorable currency regulation, many  enterprises are getting ready to go bankrupt before the  introduction of the hryvnya. Their number has already been  calculated by the Cabinet of Ministers. In the event of a sharp  increase in unemployment, which is called the "period of  plummeting," the Cabinet of Ministers confirmed a program of  public works which calls for the use of funds from the budget  (in order to have something with which to occupy the people who  have lost their jobs).    However, this is not a mandatory stage on the path toward  reforms. The streamlining of enterprises will be conducted  which, in the opinion of the government, may solve their  problems.    The rest of the salutary measures of the government fit  within a program for urgent measures to overcome hyperinflation  in Ukraine which has been adopted by the Cabinet of Ministers.  According to the program, in the future our reforms will balance  the full freedom of the market and administrative regulation,  advancing along the path of "strictly disciplined market  relations."    However, even if we succeed in avoiding a new cycle of  inflation owing to these measures, they are hardly adequate to  completely prepare the Ukrainian scene for the appearance of a  new national currency. At a minimum, a certain sustenance is  required to ensure the viability of this currency--a state loan  and liberalization of foreign economic relations. While the  National Bank of Ukraine, together with a group of specialists,  is preparing to issue bonds, the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations, in its turn, is trying to expand foreign trade,  although these measures could hardly be called complete  liberalization. While export duties are canceled, a system of  quotas remains. Import restrictions are introduced. The  "go-ahead" will mainly be given to raw materials imported to the  country.    Be that as it may, in the opinion of experts Ukraine so far  lacks appropriate funds for the introduction of the hryvnya. In  turn, the government does not venture to seek assistance from  international organizations--the International Monetary Fund and  the World Bank. In the words of government representatives, "as  a member of the fund, we may demand support from it. However, we  will not ask."    This is a rational thought: In the opinion of D. Kaufman,  the  representative of the World Bank in Ukraine, the introduction of  the hryvnya under current conditions makes no sense and is  capable of bringing about not only its depreciation but also the  complete economic collapse of Ukraine. Domestic experts foretell  the same fate of the hryvnya.    However, we should hardly expect the government to give up  its boldly planned hryvnya-step. As a deputy prime minister said  on one occasion, "We will proceed to take measures so as to work  in a market environment while simultaneously continuing our  policy." We are left hoping for a delay. Otherwise, the unviable  Ukrainian currency will be introduced with a move of the  imperious baton on a not-so-remote Thursday. It will kick in  then--when pigs fly.</p>

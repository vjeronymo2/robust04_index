			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / International Company News: Central bank quashes Unibank rumours DENMARK'S Nationalbank, the central bank, yesterday promised to provide cash support to Unibank, the country's second largest commercial bank, should support be necessary. The central bank said that rumours concerning Unibank were 'unfounded'. The action by Nationalbank follows a spate of rumours on Friday that Unibank was in serious difficulties, which caused an unknown number of depositors to withdraw their funds from the bank. The bank itself issued a statement to its staff on Friday afternoon denouncing the rumours as completely untrue. The Finance Supervisory Board, the bank sector's watchdog, also issued a statement late on Friday saying that 'the rumours which have come to our knowledge have absolutely no basis in reality.' Unibank made a DKr1.8bn (Pounds 160m) loss in 1991 and it is expected to report a substantial loss again in the first half of the current year, both because bad loss provisions will remain high and because falling bond and share prices since Denmark rejected the Maastricht Treaty in the June 2 referendum will cause substantial unrealised losses on bond and share portfolios. The bank's capital adequacy ratio at the end of 1991 was 10.7 per cent compared with the Danish minimum legal 10 per cent and Mr Steen Rasborg, chief executive, said that the ratio remains between 10 per cent and 11 per cent.</p>

			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Emerging Markets: Socialists' return greeted with equanimity  -The Emerging Investor Electoral victories by the left make markets and investors jittery all over the world. In eastern Europe, where this weekend Hungary's socialists look set to follow their Polish comrades back to power, the prospect is superficially even more alarming. For the region's socialists are the successors of the communist parties whose economic management, or rather mismanage-ment, condemned their countries to relative backwardness. However, foreign investors and their Hungarian advisers are reacting to the left's resurgence with remarkable equanimity. 'I don't think anyone outside the country is really concerned about the clock being turned back,' says Mr Janos Bartha, chief executive of CS First Boston Budapest, the Hungarian branch of the international investment bank. The Left Alliance, which came back to power in Poland last autumn, has won the confidence of western investors by continuing the orthodox economic policies of its non-communist predecessors. The Polish stock market's hectic rise continued after the left's triumph and ended 1993 with a 900 per cent year-on-year gain. The equally dramatic 50 per cent crash this spring had much more to do with inflated price/earnings ratios than politics. Likewise, Hungary's bourse, which rose sharply in January, fell back and is now moving sideways, is not expected to change course. On the last day of trading before yesterday's vote the market was flat. Volume touched a low for 1994 with only Ft13.1m (Dollars 130,000) worth of shares changing hands. The price of compensation coupons, the certificates for a politically driven privatisation programme of the governing conservatives opposed by the socialists, fell to a near historic low. Otherwise the Budapest Stock Exchange index hardly moved, ending 0.13 up on the day at 1620.78. Mr Zsigmond Jarai, head of the Budapest office of UK merchant bank Samuel Montagu, speaks for most analysts when he predicts: 'My expectation is that nothing will happen to the market.' Indeed, some analysts, including Mr Jarai, believe a socialist government could even be an improvement. One ex-communist who inspires their confidence is Mr Laszlo Bekesi, former and perhaps future finance minister in a socialist government. Mr Bekesi sees economic policy in starkly pragmatic terms: 'The options are not those of conservative, liberal or social democratic policies. There are only two alternatives: realistic and unrealistic.' In an interview with the FT he proclaimed his belief in floating the exchange rate and relying on private finance of infrastructure projects, and he favoured fire sales of unprofitable state companies. Even Mr Bekesi's pledge to stop Hungary's fledgling mass privatisation programme wins marks. Like the prodigal son, the socialists are prepared to bend over backwards to win the trust of western investors. Mr Bekesi and his fellow technocrats represent the reassuring face of the socialists. Less visible, but perhaps more powerful, are the trade unions which underpin the party organisation and put jobs and wages above the painful process of economic restructuring. And, however restrained the programme and public pronouncements of the socialists, many of their supporters are hoping for an immediate rise in their living standards. 'The socialists say they will build capitalism, but when they say capitalism the Hungarian people hear socialism,' says Mr Peter Tolgyessy, a leader of the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats, a potential coalition partner for the socialists. In Poland, the Left Alliance government's austerity has angered industrial workers who swung to the left in the belief that it would temper Poland's harsh new capitalism. This disillusionment helped inspire strikes which are jeopardising economic recovery, as well as the left's reputed ability to maintain social peace. An additional danger in Hungary is that the return of former communists to power will provoke the extreme nationalist right to resort to desperate action. Mr Ferenc Kulin, leader of the parliamentary group of the governing Hungarian Democratic Forum, warns: 'Western investors don't have any moral and political worries, because they have just one interest, an economic interest. But they don't realise that with a socialist victory, social stability will be in danger.' However, even alarmist statements like these do not ruffle the confidence of western investors. That is the true measure of the transformation in eastern Europe: western observers are convinced countries like Hungary have irreversibly opted for capitalism even if the leaders they choose call themselves, for old time's sake, socialists.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                          FRIDAY   WEEK ON WEEK CHANGE STOCK                           COUNTRY   CLOSE      DOLLARS      %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Aksa Akrilik Ve Kimya Sanayii   Turkey   1.1015      0.2910     35.91 Koc Yatrim                      Turkey   1.1304      0.2911     34.68 Guney Biracilik                 Turkey   0.8696      0.1894     27.85 Eregli Demir Ve Celik           Turkey   0.1406      0.0306     27.82 Turk Demir Dokum                Turkey   0.3841      0.0802     26.37 Doktas                          Turkey   0.2725      0.0554     25.52 Kordosa                         Turkey   0.1913      0.0379     24.71 Alarko Holding                  Turkey   0.4493      0.0875     24.18 Yapi Ve Kredi Bankasi           Turkey   0.0609      0.0109     21.92 Aygaz                           Turkey   0.2145      0.0379     21.49  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Tokai Bank cuts pre-tax profit forecast to Y12bn TOKAI Bank, the Japanese commercial bank, yesterday halved its pre-tax profit forecast to Y12bn (Dollars 113.2m) for the first half to the end of September, saying that an expected increase in banking profits would be undermined by write-offs of non-performing loans. Along with other Japanese banks, Tokai has been able to increase core earnings as falling interest rates have created a favourable spread. It is taking the opportunity to write off and make provision for losses arising from lending during the 'bubble era' of the late 1980s. Mr Shuichi Midorikawa, assistant general manager, said the bank had seen 'large profits' from arbitrage trading in London. However, he said that these would 'have little effect' on first-half results, which would be more determined by the 'profitability of our loan portfolio'. At the end of March, Nagoya-based Tokai reported that its non-performing loans were Y828bn, and that figure is expected to have increased over the first half. Mr Midorikawa said the write-off figure for the first half had not been finalised. 'We hope to do as much as possible,' he said. Regardless of the write-offs and provisions, the bank expects that net income will be 4.5 per cent above the previously forecast Y11bn. In the first half last year, Tokai reported a pre-tax profit of Y28.4bn, and a net profit of Y13.5bn on total income of Y972.9bn, which the bank expects will fall to Y902bn for the period just ended. Japanese banks are expected to face a difficult second half. They have already absorbed many of the benefits of falling interest rates, but are still confronted by an increase in problem loans and weak demand from corporate customers, who are lowering their capital spending targets.</p>

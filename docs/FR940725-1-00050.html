			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> After that meeting, technical representatives from each of the four organizations (GAMA, AECMA, FAA and JAA) met to resolve differences between the proposed JAR and part 23. This portion of the harmonization effort involved a number of separate meetings of specialists in the flight, airframe, powerplant, and systems disciplines. These meetings showed that harmonization would require revisions to both part 23 and the proposed JAR 23. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Near the end of the effort to harmonize the normal, utility, and acrobatic category airplane airworthiness standards, the JAA requested and received recommendations from its member countries on proposed airworthiness standards for commuter category airplanes. The JAA and the FAA held specialist and study group meetings to discuss these recommendations, which resulted in proposals to revise portions of the part 23 commuter category airworthiness standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Unlike the European rules, where commuter category airworthiness standards are separate, for U.S. rulemaking, it is advantageous to adopt normal, utility, acrobatic, and commuter category airworthiness standards simultaneously, since commuter category airworthiness standards are already contained in part 23. Accordingly, this NPRM proposes to revise the flight airworthiness standards for all part 23 airplanes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the part 23 harmonization effort, the FAA established an Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) (56 FR 2190, January 22, 1991), which held its first meeting on May 23, 1991. The ARAC on General Aviation and Business Airplane (GABA) Issues was established at that meeting to provide advice and recommendations to the Director, Aircraft Certification Service, FAA, regarding the airworthiness standards in part 23 as well as related provisions of parts 91 and 135 of the regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA announced, on June 2&hyph;5, 1992, at the JAA/FAA Harmonization Conference in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, that it would consolidate within the ARAC structure an ongoing objective to ``harmonize'' the JAR and the FAR. Coinciding with that announcement, the FAA assigned the ARAC on GABA Issues those rulemaking projects related to JAR 23/part 23 harmonization that were in final coordination between the JAA and the FAA. The harmonization process included the intention to present the results of JAA/FAA coordination to the public as NPRM's. Subsequently, the ARAC on GABA Issues established an ARAC&hyph;JAR 23 Study Group. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The JAR 23 Study Group made recommendations to the ARAC on GABA Issues concerning the FAA's disposition of the rulemaking issues coordinated between the JAA and the FAA. The draft NPRM's previously prepared by the FAA harmonization team were made available to the harmonization working group to assist them in their effort. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A notice of the formation of the JAR/FAR 23 Harmonization Working Group was published on November 30, 1992 (57 FR 56626). The group held its first meeting on February 2, 1993. These efforts resulted in the proposals for flight airworthiness standards contained in this notice. The ARAC on GABA Issues agreed with these proposals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA received unsolicited comments from the JAA dated January 20, 1994, concerning issues that were left unresolved with the JAR 23 Study Group. The JAR/FAR 23 Harmonization Working Group did not address some of the unresolved issues because the JAA had not yet reached positions on those issues. Unresolved issues will be dealt with at future FAR/JAR Harmonization meetings. With respect to other issues unresolved by the JAR 23 Study Group, the JAR/FAR 23 Harmonization Working Group recommendations did not reflect harmonization, but reflected the technical discussion of the merits of each issue that had been throroughly debated at the JAR/FAR 23 Harmonization meetings. (The Working Group Chairperson had been present at the Harmonization meetings.) The JAA comments have been placed in the docket for this proposal, and will be considered along with those received during the comment period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following completion of these harmonization efforts, the FAA determined that the proposed revisions to part 23 were too numerous for a single NPRM. The FAA decided to simplify the issues by issuing four NPRM's. These NPRM's address the airworthiness standards in the specific areas of systems and equipment, powerplant, flight, and airframe. These NPRM's propose changes in all seven subparts of part 23. Since there is some overlap, interested persons are advised to review all four NPRM's to identify all proposed changes to a particular section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

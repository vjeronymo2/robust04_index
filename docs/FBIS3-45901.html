			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] At the trade talks in Washington, officials from  Taipei, in explaining our government's stance to the U.S. side,  insisted that temporary tariff cuts can not be imposed on the  185 farm products of the 699 items proposed by the United  States. As for the 514 industrial products, tariff on about 70  items can be reduced under the relevant provisions of the  Customs Import Regulations.    Commenting on the (?light) products on which tariff  reductions have been agreed upon, Director Huang Yen-chao of the  Industrial Bureau said the bureau is mapping out plans to decide  on the items to be levied with reduced tariffs. According to  the explanation given by Industrial Bureau officials to the U.S.  side at the trade talks, preparations can be completed within  about two months. Hence, based on this estimation, Taipei is  expected to officially announce in March temporary tariff cuts  on industrial products, which Washington has demanded.    Moreover, Director Huang disclosed that the delegation from  Taipei already clearly explained the difficulty of temporary  tariff cuts on 185 farm products, and that import duties on 70  of the 514 industrial products can possibly be reduced under the  relevant provisions of the customs law. However, he said, the  reduction rates have not been decided yet.    Sources from the Executive Yuan's Agriculture Committee  disclosed that the U.S. response was not very favorable. The  delegation from Taipei proposed a remedial plan and pledged to  revise the administrative and legislative procedures for the  customs tax regulations to reduce customs tax for import items  whose tariff cannot be cut by half under the provisions of  Article 47 of the Customs Law. However, legislation for such  revision can be completed only after October of this year at the  earliest. As for whether or not Washington is willing to accept  the remedial plan, Director Huang Yen-chao did not further  elaborate.</p>

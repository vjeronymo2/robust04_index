The officials said the nation will donate blankets, sleeping  mats and portable kerosene stoves for victims of the disaster,  in which up to two dozen people died, many more went missing and  thousands were left homeless.    Three days of heavy rains in the country's central Andean  region caused the Fraile River to burst through its banks,  sending forth a giant wave of mud and rocks that swept away  hundreds of homes in such towns as Florida, Pradera and Tulua.</p>

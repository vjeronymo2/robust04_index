			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Chips down for PC partners: The computer industry's response to the Compaq-Intel spat is fascinated dread Intel, the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer, is spending Dollars 80m - the most it has committed to an advertising campaign - to persuade consumers and businesses to buy personal computers based on its latest microprocessor, the Pentium. The first newspaper, radio and TV advertisements are appearing in Europe and the US. But behind the message that 'It's amazing what you can do with a Pentium processor' looms a power struggle between Intel and Compaq Computer, its biggest customer. Intel and Compaq have for years collaborated in bringing to the market PCs based on Intel's microprocessor chips, which have helped Compaq become the world's leading manufacturer of powerful PCs. However, Intel's efforts to boost sales of all Pentium-based PCs could now harm Compaq's interests, and affect the rest of the industry, by shifting consumer preferences ahead of a Christmas boom in home computer sales. Signs of friction between Intel and Compaq emerged this month when the usually imperturbable Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq president and chief executive, lashed out at Intel at an industry forum in Barcelona. He accused Intel of undermining Compaq's marketing efforts and of not giving his company due consideration as the biggest seller of PCs in the US and Europe. The issues cited by Mr Pfeiffer - clashes over Intel's promotion of its own brand name, chip prices, and direct competition from Intel's growing PC and circuit board manufacturing operations - are the symptoms of a souring relationship, according to industry observers. 'In private, the executives have barely been able to contain their anger for months,' says Mr Michael Slater, an industry consultant and newsletter publisher. 'The only thing that is surprising is that this has come out in public.' Behind Mr Pfeiffer's outburst lies Compaq's growing frustration over Intel's efforts to orchestrate an acceleration in the pace at which technology advances in the PC industry. Intel appears to be treating the industry merely as its distribution arm, seeing the PC user as its ultimate customer. Hence the worldwide advertising campaign. Intel is pushing Pentium not only to maximise its already strong profit margins, but to outpace mounting competition threatening to eat into its roughly 90 per cent share of world microprocessor sales. Advanced Micro Devices, Intel's Silicon Valley neighbour and bitter rival after almost a decade of legal disputes, is biting at the market leader's heels with its versions of Intel's previous-generation 486 microprocessors. It will launch a Pentium look-alike, or clone, chip at the end of the year. Compaq's latest machines, for the consumer market, use AMD microprocessors. Last week, Nexgen, a privately held chip developer in which Compaq has a minority stake, launched a family of 'Pentium class' chips - microprocessors claimed to be as powerful and flexible as Intel's. Nexgen and Cyrix, another smaller chip company, have also contracted with International Business Machines to manufacture microprocessor clones, making them credible Intel challengers. Collectively, these companies could achieve a 20 per cent or higher share of the PC microprocessor market over time, Mr Slater predicts. 'In a worst case scenario, Intel faces a gradually declining market and possibly rapidly declining profit margins as competitors force down prices,' he says. Rather than give ground, Mr Andrew Grove, Intel's combative chief executive, has declared the chip maker will 'eat its own children' or deliberately cannibalise the market for its established products with new, more powerful chips. For Compaq, however, Intel's determination to maintain market leadership presents serious problems. In its own drive to increase market share, Compaq built up huge inventories of PCs, worth Dollars 2.2bn at the end of the second quarter, double that of a year earlier. The PC maker says the stocks will enable it to meet expanding demand and increase market share. But much of Compaq's inventory comprises lower performance PCs, rather than the Pentium models Intel is promoting. Last week, Compaq launched its own 'aggressive new worldwide consumer marketing blitz' for new consumer PC models based on older microprocessors. Compaq's new consumer models have multimedia capabilities and can double as a television set or telephone answering system. They will sell in the US for about Dollars 2,100 including a large colour monitor. For a similar price, a buyer could get a Pentium-based PC, with fewer bells and whistles, from a less well known manufacturer. Pentium multimedia PCs usually cost about Dollars 400-Dollars 500 more. Intel's efforts to point consumers towards more powerful Pentium machines include in-store demonstrations showing a Pentium PC racing through tasks while older 486SX-based machines lag behind. 'The 486-based PC is not the machine you should be buying,' says Hans Geyer, head of Intel's European operations. 'Any company that has a huge inventory of one kind of product when the market prefers another is in a dangerous position.' Compaq is not amused. From the company's perspective Intel seems to have forgotten the rule that the customer is always right. In fact, it seems, Intel is saying loud and clear that its biggest customer is wrong. 'What upsets us generally is that a component supplier should try to influence the end user. The end-user market is not their business. They are interfering,' says Andreas Barth, one of Mr Pfeiffer's closest colleagues and head of Compaq's European operations. Compaq must also be galled that Intel, along with Microsoft, the PC software leader, earns most of the profits made in the PC industry - its 1993 gross margins of 63 per cent were significantly ahead of Compaq, the most profitable PC manufacturer, which managed 23.6 per cent. It is an illusion, argues Mr Barth, to suggest the whole PC market is shifting to Pentium. Less than 12 per cent of PC sales in US consumer electronics stores are Pentium PCs, says market researcher Consumer Intelligence Infocorp. However, Intel's argument that a powerful Pentium processor is necessary to take full advantage of multimedia PC applications is increasingly credible. The latest PC games, incorporating sophisticated video and graphics, run at a snail's pace on older microprocessors. Moreover, what Compaq sees as interference, smaller PC makers regard as free advertising likely to boost demand for their products. Several plan to ride on the coattails of Intel's campaign with their own product campaigns. Yet Compaq is not alone in rueing Intel's power to shift the PC market rapidly from one generation of microprocessors to the next. The dizzying pace of change is also upsetting some buyers concerned about the rapid obsolescence of the products they purchase. 'Customers are telling us to slow down the pace of technology,' Lou Gerstner, IBM chairman, said earlier this year. 'How powerful a computer do you really need on your desk?' For now, however, Intel is in the driving seat. While it is promoting the Pentium chip for this Christmas, it plans to launch a yet more powerful microprocessor, codenamed P6, next year and is already working on later generations of chips. 'Intel has made a conscious decision that it is more important to try to make the overall PC market grow as quickly as possible than to protect the interests of its big customers,' says Mr Slater. The computer industry is following the dispute with fascinated dread. Alliances and co-operative ventures have become the order of the day as electronic technology becomes too complex for any one company. If giants like Intel and Compaq cannot co-ordinate strategies to their mutual advantage, can others do better?</p>

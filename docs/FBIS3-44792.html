In order to  implement the "Decision," the authorities called a series of  meetings on economic work in early November, which resulted in a  decision on introducing a number of plans in 1994 to reform the  banking, financial and taxation, investment, foreign trade, and  modern enterprise systems. Unexpectedly, however, the prices of  grain and edible oil have risen drastically by up to 20 or 30  percent in 35 large and medium cities throughout the country  since late November last year, causing panic among the public.  Eighteen provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have  experienced a tide of panic purchases of grain, edible oil, and  light industrial products. To deal with this, the authorities  immediately started a comprehensive operation, since  stabilization of the grain price and the control of inflation  are crucial to the smooth implementation of all the reform plans  this year. All the country, from the top leadership to the  grass- roots level, is called on to plunge into a concerted and  resolute effort to keep down the soaring prices of grain and  edible oil with a view to creating a favorable environment for  this year's comprehensive reform.  <H5>  Ideas for a Free Economy Are Becoming Popular Among Cadres </H5>   An informed source in Beijing quoted information released by  the Ministry of Agriculture as saying that 1993 was another year  of bumper harvest in China, the year's total grain output  hitting a record high by outdoing that in 1992 which also  enjoyed a good harvest. Information released by the Ministry of  Internal Trade also revealed a storage of newly harvested grain  kept by the state which roughly equaled that recorded in the  corresponding period last year. However, the prices in the  grain markets in coastal areas suddenly went up in late October.  By late November, the retail price of grain in Guangdong  Province increased by 10 percent over October while the rice  price was rising in such grain producing provinces as Hubei,  Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui. The increase in the rice price in  south China has affected the grain market in north China,  causing the wheat and corn prices to increase to a varying  extent. The grain price hikes have led to price increases for  other commodities, thus causing panic among the public and a  tide of panic purchasing of grain, edible oil, and even  household electrical appliances in many cities.    The grain price is soaring at the moment as the country  reaps  a bumper harvest. What is the reason for this abnormal price  fluctuation? Analysis shows that this is mainly because some  leading cadres who lack a correct understanding of the market  economy believe that the market economy means a completely free  economy, that the state may leave the grain price alone once the  restrictions on the grain price are lifted, and that any attempt  by the state to keep down the grain price is against the  principles governing the market economy and equates with  backtracking. Based on this logic, they have let commodity  prices increase without taking any anti-inflationary measures.  The chain effects of price raises would have been increasingly  aggravated if Zhu Rongji, vice premier of the State Council, had  not promptly called a national work meeting in Beijing on 25  December to discuss and adopt measures to keep down the prices  of grain and edible oil, after he found some problems during his  inspection tour in Anhui in late November last year.    The informed source said that the grain price hikes and the  panic purchasing tide had alerted Deng Xiaoping, who had urged  the authorities to seize the opportunity to speed up  development. Having read reports from some provinces,  municipalities, and autonomous regions in mid-December last  year, Deng made the following comments to Yang Dezhong, deputy  director of the CPC Central Committee General Office: 1)  the above-mentioned occurrences reflect the delicate mental  state of the public, of which party and government leaders at  all levels should be clearly aware; 2) as far as the people's  livelihood is concerned, party and government leaders at all  levels must keep abreast with market developments at all times  and do a good job in guiding and overseeing market operations;  3) common problems which may arise from the reform, especially  those related to the capacity to withstand the impact of reform  on the part of the public, must be promptly brought to the  attention of party and government leaders at all levels and put  on the order of the day; and 4) the central leadership has paid  close attention to the present case in a timely manner and  adopted resolute measures, indicating that the present  collective leadership is becoming mature.  <H3>  Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji Step Forward To Accept  Responsibility </H3>   The informed source noted that the CPC authorities agreed  among themselves, after Deng Xiaoping's retirement, that  whatever major issues arise thereafter concerning national  unification and economic construction will still have to be  referred to Deng Xiaoping for advice. Therefore, they have of  course paid great attention to the above comments by Deng  Xiaoping on the panic purchasing. The CPC General Secretary  Jiang Zemin personally called a meeting of the CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau on 24 December last year to discuss  how to carry out Deng Xiaoping's instruction.    Jiang Zemin made a self-criticism at the meeting. He said:  "Recently, many localities have experienced a tide of panic  purchasing of grain and edible oil. This indicates that we have  overlooked the public's reaction to price fluctuations while  concentrating on the party's central task. Comrade Xiaoping's  instruction is both a support for us and a criticism against us.  We must not treat this tide of panic purchasing triggered off  by widespread price raises as an individual event but view this  issue from the high plane of economic development. We must not  be ovedr confident about the public's capacity to withstand  inflation and thus treat the problem lightly. Changes in the  prices of grain and edible oil as basic commodities on the  market have a bearing not only on the immediate interests of  cadres and the public but also on the public's trust in the  party and the government. They will affect the extent to which  the public displays enthusiasm and initiative in reform and  determines whether or not we will be able to create a stable  social environment. Therefore, we must curb inflation  resolutely and without hesitation."    On the following day, that is 25 December, at a national  meeting on the operation to keep down the increasing prices of  grain and edible oil, Zhu Rongji, on behalf of the State  Council, accepted the responsibility for this occurence.  Meanwhile, he pointed out that the principal party and  government leaders in some localities were also responsible for  the fault. He said that they, as leaders, must not only take  the initiative in bearing responsibility but must also try to  find out the causes for the case and draw a lesson from it. Zhu  Rongji asserted: "Stabilizing the grain price and fighting  inflation will be a task of crucial importance to the smooth  progress of reform next year (that is, 1994). Our leading  people at all levels must resolutely adopt every economic means,  applying some auxiliary administrative means where necessary, to  rigidly regulate the intensity of the price reform and keep the  margin of price increases within a limit that is acceptable to  the public." Zhu also urged the judicial sector to penalize  according to the law those who corner the market, jack up the  grain price for staggering profits, and practice favoritism by  abuse of power.  <H5>  Inflation Is the Greatest Risk Factor </H5>   Thanks to the authorities' prompt reaction, the tide of  price  raises prevailing in certain parts of China in the fourth  quarter last year has now been checked. However, this year's  inflation situation still remains a question of common concern  among the public.    The China Price Information Center holds that, given the  intensity of regulation and control exercised by the state  through its economic and price policies, the general commodity  price level will be going up moderately and slowly this year.  Specifically, it may go up by 10 percent as compared with the  13 percent inflation rate last year. The center also pointed  out: "Ample supply of grain means stability" and, so long as  the prices of agricultural products remain stable, the market  price level on the whole will not experience great fluctuation.    However, some economic experts hold that the reform process  will involve more and more risk factors because China's economy  is entering a high-growth stage. Of such risk factors,  inflation must be the most crucial one. After all, China's  economy is still rather delicate, the public's mental  preparedness for economic impact is still rather insufficient,  the economic development standard varies considerably from  locality to locality, and the income gap between the rich and  the poor is very wide. The authorities must be well aware of  this situation and must not overestimate the community's  capacity to withstand inflation. Last year, the commodity  retail price level went up by 13 percent, the volume of living  expenses in 35 large and medium cities increased by 20 percent,  and the delayed effects of these developments will turn out to  be a very great pressure on the economy this year. Therefore,  the inflation rate may go up this year, given the expanded scale  of investment in fixed assets, the impact of the unification of  the foreign exchange rate system, and the increase in the prices  of fuel and farm products. In addition, the view that equates  the market economy to free economy is still rather popular among  cadres and the phenomenon of price raises as a consequence of  interference with the market by abuse of power will most likely  reoccur from time to time. All these factors discourage people  from being optimistic about China's success in the price reform  this year.</p>

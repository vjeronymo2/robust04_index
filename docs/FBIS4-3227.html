			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by station reporter (Xiao Yunhua); from the "News" </F> program]    [Text] On the afternoon of 16 April, autonomous regional  party and government leaders Gyaincain Norbu, Guo Jinlong, Yang  Chuantang, and Yang Song arrived at the Lhasa Air Force command  post. They called on Air Force officers and men in Tibet, and  were accorded a warm welcome by the latter.    In a conference room, (Zhang Guanying), political commissar  of the command post, briefed the autonomous regional leaders on  the development of Air Force units in Tibet, their relations  with local governments and the people, and their support for  local construction. (Zhang Guanying) said:    [Begin (Zhang) recording] Respected chairman Gyaincain,  respected secretary Guo, respected vice chairmen Yang, and  respected secretary general Li, leaders and comrades, on the eve  of the 1 May Labor Day, leading comrades of the autonomous  regional party committee and government have managed to find the  time to come and inspect the work of Air Force units in Tibet,  and to visit us. This fully shows the deep concern of the  autonomous regional party committee and government and the  people of all nationalities in Tibet for Air Force units. It  fully shows the close friendship between the armymen and people,  and between the Tibetan Nationality and the Han Nationality. It  also fully shows the two inseparable things pointed out by  General Secretary Jiang during his inspection tour of Tibet  [sentence as heard]. The leaders' visit here today is very  inspiring and enlightening for us; we are very pleased. On this  occasion, please allow me to speak on behalf of the party  committee, headquarters, and more than 3,000 officers and men of  the Air Force units in Tibet, to extend our warm welcome to the  autonomous regional party and government leaders and to express  our heartfelt thanks to them and the people of all nationalities  in Tibet for their profound concern. [end recording]    Gyaincain Norbu, deputy secretary of the autonomous regional  party committee and chairman of the autonomous region, said  after hearing political commissar (Zhang Guanying's) briefing:    [Begin Gyaincain recording] Political Commissar Zhang,  leaders of the Air Force command post, [word indistinct] and  comrades, on the eve of the 1 May International Labor Day,  deputy secretary Guo Jinlong of the autonomous regional party  committee; vice chairman Yang Chuantang; secretary-general of  the autonomous regional party committee (Li Liguo); vice  chairman Yang Song, and myself are making this special trip to  call on the officers and men of the air force command post. At  the same time, we are here to thank you on behalf of the  autonomous region's party committee, government, and more than 2  million people. As Political Commissar Zhang has just  mentioned, I think that in the three decades and more since the  establishment of the Lhasa air force command post, the officers  and men have indeed fully adhered to Comrade Xiaoping's thought  on army building in the new period, and to General Secretary  Jiang's 20-character instruction -- the PLA must be qualified  politically and competent militarily, and it must have a fine  workstyle, maintain strict discipline, and be assured of  adequate logistical support. During these three decades and  more, the air force command post has also been among the few top  PLA units here which have excelled in the joint army-people  campaign to build spiritual civilization, in army building, in  logistical self-sufficiency of non-staple food and [word  indistinct], and in implementation of the party's policies  concerning nationalities and religions. The party and  government are always (satisfied). [end recording]    Then, Chairman Gyaincain Norbu, accompanied by leaders of  the  Lhasa air force command post, visited the (Ganbala) radar  station, called on the officers and men there, and inquired  about their work, study, and everyday life.    Gyaincain zealously wrote an inscription for the radar  station: Work hard, make selfless dedication, and keep the  (Ganbala) spirit eternal.</p>

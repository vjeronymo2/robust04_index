			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Government bond markets suffer from Maastricht fallout DENMARK'S vote against the ratification of the Maastricht treaty sent a shockwave through the European government bond markets last month, resulting in a decline in total return for the higher-yielding markets, according to J. P. Morgan. Italy and Spain were the worst-performing government bond markets in June, registering falls of 1.26 per cent and 1.24 per cent respectively. Denmark, France, Sweden and the UK also suffered a fall in total returns as the Danish referendum result took its toll on those markets which investors had thought had the most to gain from the convergence of interest rates. In the wake of the Danish referendum on June 2, dealers reported a switching out of high-yielding European bonds into the relative safety of the D-Mark bloc. However, in local currency terms, the D-Mark markets (Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands) still showed a fall in capital return. 'No European market gave a positive capital return in June - only the inclusion of the month's accrual of coupon income lifted returns into positive territory,' according to Kemper Investment Management Company, which tracks 21 bond markets worldwide. The top performing markets in June were Canada (2.84 per cent), Australia (2.8 per cent), Japan (2.21 per cent), New Zealand (1.98 per cent) and the US (1.7 per cent) in local currency terms, according to Kemper. The dollar bloc benefited primarily from the uncertainty over the future of European economic and monetary union, and these five markets were the only ones to show positive capital returns. Australia and the UK were the top performing markets in the second quarter of 1992 in local currency terms, showing gains of 7.89 per cent and 6.34 per cent respectively. US dollar-based investors saw the best returns from the D-Mark bloc bond markets during June due to the dollar's decline of over 5 per cent against most European currencies.</p>

			<p><P> September 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISTRICT ELECTIONS  </P> <P> I was very disturbed in reading the arguments used by opponents of district  elections in Larry Gordon's piece on the Los Angeles Community College District  (Metro, Aug. 31) and legislation authored by Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los  Angeles).  </P> <P> Opponents stress that at-large elections have brought minorities to the Board  of Trustees. As a former trustee, I want to bring some historical perspective  to this assertion. Only one Latino served on the board before me and only one  has succeeded me to that office in its 20 years of existence.  </P> <P> I was fortunate to have been appointed to the board, rather than running in a  special election at-large to replace a trustee who left the board. But the cost  of campaigning district-wide would have made my election prohibitive and highly  unlikely.  </P> <P> Had the LACCD instituted district elections prior to that time, the cost to the  district for a special election would have been 1/7 of an estimated $1.8  million and the accessibility for myself and others to seek election would have  been enhanced.  </P> <P> While the concern about parochialism would be appropriate in other districts,  it is totally out of place in the LACCD. In fact, at-large elections lead us to  the opposite extreme, where constituents number 1.9 million. By a reasonable  person's judgment, 270,000 voters (1/7 of LACCD's voters) will ensure far  greater accountability without raising the question of parochialism.  </P> <P> Under district elections, the opportunity for greater representation of ethnic  minorities is increased. To paraphrase Althea Baker's words, we should not  limit ourselves by thinking of only "black" and "Latino" seats. Agreed. The  issue is not strictly to provide an opportunity for blacks and Latinos to be  elected, but more importantly, to provide and opportunity for blacks and  Latinos in South-Central and East Los Angeles to elect someone from their  community to represent them on the board. The choice will ultimately be theirs  under AB 364.  </P> <P> AB 364 is a good government bill. Not only will it ensure that every corner of  the district is represented and cost savings on operating elections are  achieved, it will guarantee access for candidates who might not otherwise be  able to mount a successful campaign over such a large and unwielding district.  </P> <P> LETICIA QUEZADA  </P> <P> Member, Board of Education  </P> <P> L.A.

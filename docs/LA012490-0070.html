			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMI'S NEW CHIEF WIELDS SCALPEL TO CUT HEAVY DEBT;  </P> <P> HEALTH CARE: HARRY J. GRAY BELIEVES THAT HIS EXPERIENCE AS THE FORMER HEAD OF  UNITED TECHNOLOGIES WILL HELP HIM IN HIS QUEST TO LIGHTEN THE DEBT BURDEN OF  THE RECENT BUYOUT.  </P> <P> In the 1970s as head of United Technologies, Harry J. Gray was one of the  master builders of the giant conglomerate. Today, as chairman of American  Medical International, Gray has traded his trowel for a scalpel as he tries to  whittle down the hospital company that he and a group of investors acquired  last October for $1.67 billion.  </P> <P> In a recent interview, the 70-year-old executive said he doesn't intend to  dismantle AMI, but he has moved aggressively on his predecessors' plans to sell  $1 billion in AMI assets and drastically reduce the corporate staff to cope  with the buyout debt. To date, Gray said AMI has sold two hospitals for about  $200 million.  </P> <P> AMI has stated a goal of reducing the corporate staff to about 400 people from  about 1,000 (down from about 1,500 last year) who work in Beverly Hills, Marina  del Rey, Costa Mesa and field offices outside California. Gray said he expects  that there will be about 100 people at the new corporate headquarters when the  company completes a planned move to Dallas from Beverly Hills. The company may  also make more cuts in its data processing operations in Marina del Rey and  Costa Mesa, he said. "We've had a lot of data processing that may not be  absolutely necessary," he said.  </P> <P> When AMI announced its move last month, the Beverly Hills headquarters had  about 200 people, and the Marina del Rey and Orange County sites combined had  about 200.  </P> <P> Before his involvement with AMI, Gray's closest look at the health-care  industry was from the perspective of a patient -- one lying flat on his back in  traction. More than two decades ago, he suffered a serious motorcycle accident  that shattered his thighs and put him on crutches for eight months. He sealed  his reputation for toughness and tenacity when he moved his office into the  hospital, missing only two days of work.  </P> <P> Analysts caution that hospitals present a unique set of management problems for  Gray. For one thing, demand for services is largely beyond the control of  managers, they said, and hospitals in particular are under pressure from  competitors to maintain costly equipment while government and private insurers  demand that they limit patient stays and justify their fees.  </P> <P> Although his management experience has been mostly in defense industries, Gray  said his experience with service companies owned by United Technologies will  apply to AMI. "I find it rather comfortable moving into AMI. There are quite a  few analogies I find helpful, especially in cost control," he said.  </P> <P> He said the health-care industry has not been sufficiently attentive to  controlling costs. "To survive, they must deliver quality on a cost-effective  basis," Gray said. AMI has already implemented an incentive program for  hospital executive directors. The managers win and lose points based on how  they manage their working capital, how discharged patients respond to an  independent survey on the quality of their treatment and an outside review of  the performance of the hospital's doctors, he said.  </P> <P> The program thus far has resulted in some "pleasant" surprises, Gray said. Some  of the hospitals targeted for sale because of lackluster performance are doing  better. That doesn't necessarily mean that they won't be sold, but it "does  make them more palatable" to potential buyers. Hospitals that were targeted for  sale, he said, were those that could not produce enough operating cash flow to  pay for capital improvements and to contribute their share of the total AMI  debt.  </P> <P> AMI intends to sell all 23 of its foreign hospitals and about seven of the  domestic hospitals, leaving the restructured AMI to operate about 40 hospitals.  Despite analysts' worries that AMI would not get the best prices for the  hospitals because the industry has far more hospitals for sale than buyers,  Gray said the two AMI hospitals sold so far attracted bids higher than  expected. The company sold its Singapore hospital and a facility in North Miami  Beach, Fla.  </P> <P> Gray said his goal is not only to pare costs at AMI, but to foster a new  "corporate culture." He explained: "Our purpose is to convince the people who  are not directly associated with a hospital that their function in life is to  serve the hospitals." To foster that, Gray said the new corporate headquarters  will be known as the "service center." Gray said the role of chief executive  was not one that he envisioned for himself when he decided last year that AMI  was a good investment. IMA Acquisition Corp., jointly owned by Gray's  investment firm and First Boston Corp., won a bidding contest for AMI triggered  last spring when a group led by M. Lee Pearce, an AMI director and major  shareholder, proposed to buy the company.  </P> <P> "There was no intent to go back into active management," Gray said, explaining  that he had little choice when AMI Chairman and Chief Executive Richard  Gilleland resigned suddenly after the buyout. Gilleland had been brought to AMI  less than a year earlier after successfully turning around a troubled Texas  health-care concern. Shareholders, dissatisfied with the pace of AMI's recovery  from a $97.3-million loss in 1986, had pressured Gilleland's predecessor,  Walter Weisman, to resign in 1988.  </P> <P> Gilleland said earlier that he didn't want to invest in an AMI buyout and  decided he didn't want to manage the company long term, Gray said. "I think he  did the best that he could for the shareholders. I think he was surprised that  others wanted to buy the company," he said. Gilleland couldn't be reached for  comment.  </P> <P> Some analysts speculated that Gilleland resigned because he feared that Gray  would demand too big of a decision-making role after he joined the board upon  completion of the buyout.  </P> <P> As head of United Technologies for 14 years, Gray was known for a reluctance to  share power and groom a successor. Four men who might have succeeded him as  chairman either quit or were forced to resign, associates said. Gray was  accused of ordering the bugging of the home and office of one of the company's  presidents before the man's resignation. But a committee of United Technologies  directors cleared him in an internal investigation conducted in 1984, and Gray  has always steadfastly denied the alleged bugging. That same year, as Gray  neared the mandatory retirement age of 65, directors forced him to choose a  successor. Gray retired at the end of 1986 and was succeeded by Robert F.  Daniell, who was earlier elected president and chief executive.  </P> <P> A Georgia native who started his career in sales, Gray held various posts at  Litton Industries in California in the 1950s and '60s. He became United  Technologies' president in 1971. By the time he left, he had built the  Hartford, Conn.-based company from a $2-billion aerospace company to a  $16.3-billion conglomerate and a leading defense contractor.  </P> <P> Some people called him "the shark" and "Jack the Ripper" for his record of  successful takeovers, such as that of Otis Elevator and Carrier Corp. If there  is a notable blemish on Gray's record as a shrewd manager, it was United  Technologies' 1982 involvement in the complicated takeover battle between  Bendix Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp. United Technologies baffled many  observers when it jumped into the fray as an ally of Martin Marietta, which had  responded to an unsolicited takeover bid from Bendix by attempting to swallow  Bendix instead. Of the companies involved in the so-called Pac Man war, United  Technologies emerged relatively unscathed as Allied Corp. leaped in and  swallowed Bendix, and Martin Marietta remained independent at a huge cost.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, March 30 (BTA) -- Again the leading national  dailies did not come out this morning in a continuing protest  against the 18 percent flat VAT [value-added tax] rate, due to  take effect on April 1 and from which the media are not exempt.  The six private radio stations in Sofia which suspended their  broadcasts for two days in protest against the tax are back on  the air today but every hour on the hour they will air protest  noise effects. The only paper to come out was BULGARSKA ARMIYA  the daily of the Defence Ministry. Today it carries an interview  with Deputy Defence Minister Boyko Noev about his visit to the  United States last week.    The CASH weekly which came out today has blank spaces  instead  of text and carries only advertisements. "This is what a  censored newspaper would look like," it is written on the front  page. Any attempt to levy VAT on the press, no matter what  motivates it, is pure censorship in the form of liquidation,  reads the commentary in this weekly.    A rally of intellectuals is scheduled to take place this  afternoon in support of the media protest. The editors-in-chief  of the leading national dailies will meet tonight to discuss the  forms in which to continue their protest.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] International and regional schemes aspiring to  divide Yemen and revive its pre-unity conditions are making  gradual headway. Tens of thousands have been killed, wounded,  or displaced in Yemen, north and south. U.S. political  pressure, aided and abetted by Arab regimes, is slowly but  surely wrecking Yemen's national sovereignty and wrenching its  land apart.    Keeping particular countries weak, in disgrace, and  dependent  upon foreign assistance is the hallmark of the policy the United  States has been vigorously pursuing in the region since the oil  [Gulf] war, a policy pursued even more adamantly in the southern  Gulf states.    The United States recently imposed humiliating terms on the  shaykhs of southern Gulf states, forcing their governments, not  particularly known for a firm political will, to end the  political and economic embargo of the Zionist,  Jerusalem-usurping entity.    Stripping Arab states in the southern Gulf region of  dignity,  integrity, and political will has become a trademark of U.S.  policy in that area. The corrupt regimes in Riyad and Cairo  support this policy, dragging along, willy nilly, Arab League  and Gulf Cooperation Council countries.    Seen from this angle, the U.S. position on the Yemeni crisis  is easily explained. The United States wants Yemen weak, poor,  divided, and, in both its parts, dependent upon foreign  assistance. This is the subservient state in which the United  States likes to keep most of the agent governments that do its  gambling in the Middle East.</p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> UNMANNED CRAFT BEARS FOOD, WATER TO 2 COSMONAUTS STRANDED IN SPACE  </P> <P> The Soviet Union said Thursday that it launched an unmanned spacecraft to ferry  equipment, food and drinking water to cosmonauts stranded since February in the  orbiting Mir space station.  </P> <P> A special Kristall module, aboard a Proton rocket launched from the Baikonur  cosmodrome, is scheduled to dock with Mir on June 6, the official Tass news  agency said.  </P> <P> Insulation on a Soyuz spacecraft carrying cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyov and  Alexander Balandin to Mir was damaged during its launch Feb. 11, raising fears  the two could be stranded without a reliable means of returning to earth.  </P> <P> The U.S. trade journal Aviation and Space Week, quoting a visiting Soviet  cosmonaut, reported two weeks ago that Solovyov and Balandin were left "without  a reliable vehicle in the event of an emergency."  </P> <P> Soviet space officials said there is no danger to the cosmonauts, adding that  the damage will not hinder a return flight. However, they said that a space  walk is planned to allow the cosmonauts to repair the damage.  </P> <P> The report did not say whether the cosmonauts' mission has been extended to  allow repair of their spacecraft.  </P></p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Schneider advances despite losses at Spie SCHNEIDER, the French electrical engineering and construction group, mustered a modest increase in net profits to FFr305m (Dollars 56.2m) in 1992 from FFr275m in 1991, in spite of continued losses at Spie-Batignolles, its construction subsidiary. The group, which was also affected by the cost of servicing the debt amassed in its acquisition of Square D, the US construction company, indicated that it anticipated another difficult year. It said that the past few months had 'definitely been more sluggish' than most of 1992. Schneider last year managed to counter the competitive economic climate by raising capital in asset sales and through improved performances from Square D and Merlin Gerin, its electrical distribution business. Although Spie remained in the red, it did succeed in reducing its net loss to FFr274.3m from FFr952.2m. Group sales rose to FFr61.4bn from FFr59bn. However, Schneider swung from an exceptional credit of FFr201m to an exceptional loss of FFr24m over the same period, due to FFr400m of new provisions and amortisation charges, most of which were at Spie. Schneider compensated by making FFr220m from asset sales and the settlement of doubtful foreign debts. The group is continuing with asset sales in an attempt to further reduce borrowings, following last year's 10 per cent decrease to FFr2.4bn. It recently agreed to sell Jeumont-Schneider, its electrical components subsidiary, to Framatome, the French nuclear reactor group. Schneider has also transfered part of its debt into convertable bonds. The company plans to alleviate the financial pressure on Spie-Batignolles by buying 50 per cent of the latter's Spie-Trindel electrical installation subsidiary. Terms of the deal have yet to be finalised.</p>

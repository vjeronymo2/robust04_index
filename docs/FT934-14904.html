			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Observer: Play it again, Ken Kenneth Baker may not have enjoyed glowing reviews of his memoirs, but at least his remarks about Sir George Jefferson are suitably diplomatic. As minister for information technology in the early 1980s, one of Baker's first tasks was to oversee the privatisation of British Tele-com. In the first appearance he makes in the memoirs, Kenneth Baker The Turbulent Years, My Life in Politics, Jefferson, then chairman of BT, is described as 'very co-operative', even if 'he was irked by having to come and see me about quite trivial matters'. Jefferson may remember the ultimately fairly successful battles over the shape of post-privatisation BT somewhat differently. Anyway, it will be Baker who is coming to see him, now that the former cabinet minister has joined the UK board of Videotron, the Canadian-controlled cable company, of which Jefferson is chairman. One of the largest operators in the UK, Videotron wants Baker aboard because he 'kicked off the whole cable business' - and forgives him entirely for the inaccuracy of his 1982 prediction that multi-channel cable TV would be in every British household before the end of the decade. At any rate, Baker is now in a position to roll up his sleeves and hasten the advent of the wired city.</p>

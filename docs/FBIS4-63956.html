			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy </F> by Anatoliy Smetanin: "The Army Will Defend the Homeland and  Its Sovereignty and Integrity"]    [Text] [Smetanin] What instructions have you received from  the supreme commander in chief regarding the Crimean crisis?  What are the Army's actions in this complex situation?    [Radetskyy] We have received clear and distinct  instructions: to keep to the Ukrainian law and Constitutions in  all our actions and perform our basic functions -- defend our  Homeland and its sovereignty and integrity.    In the Crimea, 32d Army Corps, Ukrainian Navy, air force and  anti-aircraft units are stationed... They operate in a regular  mode, except that their commanders were instructed to reinforce  protection of the command stations and depots with ammunition,  equipment, and arms. And I tell you, this measure was not  overreaction.    On 19 May, Lieutenant General Mikhail Lopatin, anti-aircraft  force commander, reported to me that in the vicinity of  Sevastopol, where the command station of one of the  anti-aircraft combined units is located, 18 camouflaged men,  driving a GAZ-66 truck, attempted to seize this station. They  were politely shown out.    The commander also reported his conversation with one of the  Crimean President Meshkov's aides who asked what would be the  reaction of the Ukrainian anti-aircraft force if certain  airplanes or helicopters attempted to land in the Crimea. There  could be only one answer: the most harshest measures would be  applied to them. In other words, they want to test the reaction  of our Armed Forces. We will do our best to make sure that our  skies are clear.    [Smetanin] Did you talk about the Crimean issue with your  Russian counterpart?    [Radetskyy] What does Pavel Grachev have to do with  developments in the Crimea? Nothing. It is as if I asked him:  how are things in, for example, in Kaliningrad or Ussuriysk?  The Crimea is in Ukrainian territory, so it is our business.    Another thing is how you cover the events. The Black Sea  Fleet press center, headed by Grachev's namesake who stirs up  emotions and provides false information, is by no means an  example to follow. No one else but the center sent a wire to  Ostankino (containing, however, the request not to make public  its contents) claiming that there are 1,000 Ukrainian special  troops allegedly stationed in Bilbek and that movement of tank  columns and armored personnel carriers can be observed...    We heard about this information, or more precisely,  disinformation. No tanks, planes, or APCs were used in  connection with the situation in the Crimea.    [Smetanin] The Crimean situation forced many parties and  movements to reveal their position on the issue and suggestions  how to resolve it. For example, Rukh considers it necessary to  suspend transportation of our nuclear weapons to Russia. What  is your opinion?    [Radetskyy] I am a military man. The transportation of those  weapons is carried out according to the trilateral agreement by  the presidents of Ukraine, Russia, and the United States. We  drafted the transportation schedule and strictly follow it.  Only the Supreme Council can change it or halt this process.  We will implement its decisions -- all to the last letter.  This is why I will not comment on that kind of statements.    In all my time as defense minister, I have never judged any  parties or movements, because I believe that the Army should  stay away from it. We are grateful to their leadership for  their understanding of our, let us say, neutrality.    [Smetanin] You said that tension in the Crimea is generated  by the presence of the Black Sea Fleet there. Will, and when,  the negotiations be continued on this issue?    [Radetskyy] The negotiations will certainly be continued. It  is in our interests that the Black Sea knot be untied. The most  important thing here is to determine the fleet's status. Now,  it is considered to be a kind of common fleet, subordinate to  the Ukrainian and Russian presidents. But as a matter of fact,  it is ruled by Russia. We should clearly divide it into the  Ukrainian and Russian fleets and deem the latter the fleet of a  foreign state with all consequences of this.    We will soon come up with our proposals to start  negotiations.    [Smetanin] Do you not think that those negotiations cannot  be  held in the Crimea?    [Radetskyy] I absolutely agree with you, because it would  bring nothing but political fights. The delegations should meet  in some neutral place.</p>

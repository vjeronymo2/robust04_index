			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Bad feeling about a good recovery: Tax hikes and job fears are clouding the full extent of the UK's economic upturn Rarely has the British economy performed so well. And rarely have so many people felt so bad about it. Almost without exception, the economic indicators over the past two months have confirmed that the UK is experiencing a textbook recovery from recession. The economy is growing at its fastest annual rate for six years, led by manufacturing and exports. Unemployment, having fallen in all but one month this year, is now below 2.5m and about 500,000 below its December 1992 peak. The current account balance of payments, so long the Achilles' heel of the British economy, has bounced back into surplus. The government's budget deficit is responding to treatment and on course to meet the Budget forecast of Pounds 34.4bn for 1994-95. Britain may be one of only three European Union countries to meet the budget deficit targets enshrined in the Maastricht treaty in 1996. True, inflation appears to have bottomed. But at 2.3 per cent in November, the underlying rate of retail price inflation was within the lower half of the government's 1-4 per cent target range and only just above the 27-year low of 2 per cent recorded in September and October. The UK's inflation performance over the past year has been the best for more than 30 years. Yet Britain is clearly not enjoying its economic recovery. Every indicator of opinion, from this month's Dudley West by-election, in which the swing from Tory to Labour was the biggest since 1935, to the latest consumer confidence polls, points to a deterioration in the public mood. This month's consumer confidence survey from Gallup registered a sharp jump in the percentage of people thinking their financial position would worsen in the year ahead as well as increased gloom about general economic developments, inflation, employment prospects and people's ability to save money. There are obvious policy reasons for the feel-bad factor. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Norman Lamont, his predecessor, raised taxes across a wide spectrum to plug the fiscal deficit. But the prevailing mood almost certainly reflects more far-reaching trends. Britain is undergoing painful adjustment on three fronts that is hitting the articulate and hitherto moderately pampered British middle class in particular: The UK is having to adapt to low inflation, which, if sustained, will bring benefits. But in the meantime it is dispelling the 'wealth illusion' generated by inflation-induced double-digit pay increases and rising house prices in the 1980s. Competitive pressures, the result of deregulation, globalisation and technological advance, have triggered 'down-sizing', job insecurity and redundancies in once secure industries. The changes are encompassing managers and professionals. There have been high-profile redundancies at the Treasury, at the former nationalised electricity companies and even within fast-growing sectors such as telecommunications; Mercury Communications, for example, announced this month that it would cut nearly a quarter of its 11,400 workforce. The state is scaling back its involvement in many areas of life for budgetary and ideological reasons. People are having to put aside more of current income to provide for education, healthcare and old age. This confluence of short-term pain and long-term change is not just a British phenomenon. It is contributing to the unpopularity of democratically elected governments in north America and continental Europe. In Britain's case, however, the increase in taxes and other burdens is considerable. The two Budgets of 1993 resulted in average losses of nearly Pounds 7 a week for British households. According to Sir George Young, the financial secretary, tax increases taking effect over the next year will cost all households an extra Pounds 2.30 a week on average. Research by the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies shows the tax increases will cost middle-income groups proportionately more than high earners or the poor. This will be especially true of married couples with a mortgage, hit by restrictions to the value of the married couples' allowance (MCA) and mortgage interest relief (Miras) both last April and at the start of the 1995-96 financial year. Next April's cut to 15 per cent from 20 per cent in the rates of relief of MCA and Miras will cost a working couple with a Pounds 30,000 mortgage more than Pounds 5 a week. According to government estimates, a working couple with children and a combined income of 150 per cent of average earnings will pay 3 percentage points more of their income in direct and indirect taxes in 1995-96 compared with 1993-94. In the meantime, the UK interest cycle has turned. Bank base rates are now 6.25 per cent against 5.25 per cent in early September. Most mortgage lenders have yet to respond fully to the monetary tightening, but further interest rate rises may come soon. The UK consumer and house-buyer has shrugged off rising interest rates in the past, most notably in the economically heady late 1980s. But house prices were rising sharply then. Hopes that 1994 would see a moderate rise in house prices after falls in recent years have been frustrated. The Nationwide and Halifax building societies' house price indices showed price falls of 0.6 per cent and 1 per cent respectively in the year to November. Falling house prices, high real interest rates and diminishing mortgage interest relief mean home ownership is no longer the sure investment that it was for most of the postwar period. People can no longer hope that their real debt burdens will be eroded by inflation. For many, especially in south-east England, home ownership now brings to mind tales of heavy losses or repossession during the recession. According to the Bank of England, there are still an estimated 1.1m households with negative equity in their property. The average sum is relatively small at about Pounds 5,500. But the phenomenon is concentrated in the south-east and greater London. It constitutes a burden for those directly involved, and, by restricting transactions, is probably contributing to the overall weakness of the housing market. The transformation of the housing market since the late 1980s, when prices rose by more than 20 per cent a year, is part of the bigger story of adjustment to low inflation. The government has managed to engineer an upswing that is foreign to Britain's postwar experience. The recovery, led as it is by manufacturing output and exports, holds out the promise of sustained growth and rising living standards. But it has none of the elan of the last period of strong growth in the 1980s when fast-growing pay brought shoppers out in force and money made from trading up in the housing market fuelled the purchase of consumer durables. In economics, it is usually darkest before the dawn. The Treasury's Red Book, published on Budget day, holds out the modest hope of some recovery in the nation's spirits next year. It forecasts that real personal disposable income will rise by 1 1/2 per cent in 1995 after stagnating this year. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development expects above-trend growth to continue for more than two years and further falls in unemployment. The hope is that these trends, supported by a modest run-down of savings, will support steady growth of consumer spending and restore the feel-good factor. But whether these broad economic developments offset the uncertainties generated by fast-moving, and possibly unprecedented, changes at the workplace is difficult to tell. Mr Clarke, who so far has been unexpectedly steadfast in clamping down on inflation, will be hoping that they will.</p>

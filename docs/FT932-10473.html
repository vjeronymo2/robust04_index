			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / UK Company News: SBC agrees BAT cash option THE LATE intervention in BAT Industries's enhanced scrip dividend scheme by Swiss Bank Corporation will now lead to all shareholders receiving a higher cash alternative than originally proposed by BZW, the company's brokers. BZW and SBC agreed last night that shareholders who elected for cash would receive 33.22p per scrip share, a discount of only 2 per cent to the full value of the scrip. BZW will 'pass through' those cash elections to SBC, which will pay the higher price of 33.22p. SBC only made its offer on Wednesday, and it has taken desperate efforts by lawyers to find a way of benefiting those shareholders who had already made supposedly 'irrevocable' elections for the BZW cash offer. BAT shareholders must communicate their decision on the scrip by Tuesday, and many of the 150,000 shareholders have already made elections. Under the original scheme, formulated by BZW, BAT shareholders were offered a scrip dividend of 33.9p, a 50 per cent premium to the cash dividend of 22.6p announced on March 10. At the time BZW said shareholders who wanted cash could take an alternative to the enhanced scrip of 32.2p, free of dealing costs - a 5 per cent discount to cover the joint broker's risk in underwriting the deal. BAT said it was delighted that a way had been found so as not to disadvantage any of its shareholders, which had been the group's main concern over SBC's late intervention. Initially BZW said SBC's timing suggested it was more interested in 'creaming off' institutional investors, rather than small shareholders. SBC denied that, and said it would consider making similar offers for the scrips of other companies which have followed BAT's example. All cheques to shareholders who elected for cash will be sent out by BZW. No fees or payments will be exchanged by the banks.</p>

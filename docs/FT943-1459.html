			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (3): Bush telegraph is busy - Personalities Many service companies claim they are only as good as their people. It is no different in the venture capital industry. The success of fund raising, in particular, but also of investing is often dependent on the personalities involved. The bush telegraph consequently hummed in February when Jon Moulton, founder and managing partner of Schroder Ventures, left the group after a row with parent Schroders over strategy. Moulton is one of the most respected deal-makers in UK venture capital, known for dominating boards and investing in large management buy-outs but also doing tricky deals requiring real industrial knowledge. His interpersonal skills are also legendary. Frequently described as aggressive and abrasive, he admits 'my vigour of action outweighs my subtlety of approach.' So there was general surprise when it was announced in April that Moulton would join Apax Partners. How would two large personalities like Moulton and Ronald Cohen, Apax chairman, co-exist in one organisation? 'The two personalities are thinking the same, too,' jokes Moulton from his private office where he was whiling away his 'gardening leave' with a bit of freelance corporate finance work. Cohen, who tried to hire Moulton in the early 1980s, knows exactly where his new partner fits - 'Jon has joined at the same level as my most senior partners to do the large leveraged buy-outs for which he is well known,' Cohen says. 'Prior to Jon's arrival I had headhunters out looking for someone in the buy-out area. It is good strategy to cover the whole spectrum of deals.' And does it mean, as rumours would have it, that Cohen means to step back to focus on his business interests in Israel? Cohen emphatically denies this. Apax is raising a Pounds 75m fund in a joint venture with Bank Leumi, to be in vested in the country's high-technology companies. 'It will be another Apax fund, I am certainly not pulling back,' Cohen says. Moulton's departure caused a hiccup in Schroder Venture's Pounds 140m fund-raising. Some investors pulled out on news of his departure but others took their place. For all Moulton's presence, Schroder Ventures is far from a one-man team. It has more ex-industrialists and former chief executives as partners than most other venture capital funds and a greater ability than many to consider investing in complicated situations like loss-making companies that need to be turned around. 'We put a third of our money into loss making businesses which is something you cannot do if you have not got the expertise in the industry,' says Carl Parker, principal at Schroder Ventures. Another big move of the year was Charles Gonszor, who helped build Phildrew Ventures into a powerful force but left after another bust up between partners. Neither side will talk about the underlying reasons but again there appear to have been differences in opinion about the types of investments Phildrew was making. Gonszor, whom Moulton hired at Citicorp Venture Capital in the early 1980s before he left for Phildrew, has been sharing an office with his former boss and is understood to be trying to raise a fund. Phildrew says Gonszor's departure will not affect the remaining parters' ability to do deals. Robert Drummond, former chairman of Grosvenor Venture Partners, an earlier departure as a result of a falling out, has yet to resurface. In February Grosvenor, where Drummond had a 49 per cent stake, was bought by Mercury Asset Management for Pounds 4.5m, after the company failed to raise a new fund. It was the first outright purchase of one venture capital fund manager by another, giving MAM an opening into smaller deals and greater deal flow out of London, MAM says. Earlier this month Trinity Capital, founded 10 years ago to focus on technology company investments, also lost its independence when it was taken over by Advent International. John Walker, the co-founder who becomes Advent's European managing director, had not tried to raise a new fund at Trinity. But he realised Trinity would not be able to raise the size of fund he would need to invest in later stage investments, the logical next move for the group. Linking with Advent, which has just raised Dollars 315m for European investment, brought together large fund muscle and specialist investing abilities. Walker also said that those smaller fund mangers that sorted their future out sooner rather than later would have better options as the industry consolidated. That consolidation among institution has been going on slowly all year and is likely to continue. First, Postel, the investment manager of the BT and Post Office pension schemes, formed a joint venture with Granville Private Equity, the private investment banking group in which it already had an 18 per cent stake. The new venture, Granville Private Equity Managers, will manage Postel's Pounds 195m private equity fund as well as Granville Development Capital's funds plus Pounds 50m of new money which Postel will invest over three years. 'An increasing number of institutional investors are recognising the benefits of specialist management of unquoted portfolios,' says Granville's chief executive, Michael Peacock. And then there is Cinven, the venture capital fund that focuses on larger buy-outs and has as investors the pension finds of British Coal, British Rail and Barclays Bank. In March, CINVen announced it is taking over the private equity portfolio of Royal Insurance Asset Management. But CINVen's future is uncertain because of the privatisation of British Coal. CIN Management, which owns CINVen, is one of British Coal's non-mining assets included in a programme of sales that will probably be concluded by next March. The company might be interesting for institutional investors but equally its own management might consider buying out the management company. All things are being considered including the possible management buy-out - 'it is up to British Coal and Samuel Montagu, (its advisers) to decide,' says Charles Nicholson, a CINVen director. If there were a management buy-out, venture capital companies would be queueing around the block - at least to look at CINVen's books.</p>

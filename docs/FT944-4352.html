			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Survey of Vietnam (5): Winners yet to appear - Foreign exploration indicates gas could have greater potential than oil A string of disappointing results from oil blocks in Vietnam's southern waters has punctured the optimism of the foreign energy companies which have been prospecting since 1992. Indications are that gas, not oil, could be the country's fuel of the future. None of the eight foreign operators that have drilled in the Nam Con Son basin (an area 350km south of the coastal town of Vung Tau) has struck commercially viable amounts of oil. Many, including big names such as Shell, Total and British Petroleum (BP), are still committed to drilling exploration wells as part of contractual arrangements with state oil agency PetroVietnam, but a major discovery of natural gas by BP in September has shown that the region is not as rich in oil as many firms expected. BP said when it announced the find that recoverable reserves could be about 2,000bn cubic feet, enough to generate electricity for the southern industrial centre of Ho Chi Minh City for 25 years at current levels of consumption. 'The fact that the Nam Con Son Basin is more gas prone than was first thought has become clearer and it could yield more gas discoveries,' said Michael Yeldham, BP chief executive in Vietnam. Vietnam plans to pump 7.1m tonnes of crude this year, up from 6.3m in 1993. Most of it comes from the Bach Ho (White Tiger) field, operated by the Russo-Vietnamese joint venture VietSovPetro and which was the country's only producing field until Australian operator BHP started producing small amounts at the Dai Hung (Big Bear) field in October. BHP hopes to have tapped 250,000 to 350,000 tonnes by year's end. Nearly all the crude is exported to Japan and is Vietnam's largest source of foreign currency revenue. However, these amounts are not enough to ensure Vietnam achieves targeted double digit economic growth by 2000. Hanoi is therefore keen to develop gas as fast as possible to increase foreign currency earnings and has charged the State Planning Committee with mapping out a master plan for the gas industry. Under a 'fast track' programme, priority is being given to building the infrastructure needed to bring commercially viable amounts of gas onshore. The first phase was the installation of Vietnam's first gas pipeline early this year by Korea's Hyundai Heavy Engineering. The 107km undersea pipeline runs from the Bach Ho oilfield and is designed to tap gas being flared off at a rate of 3m cubic feet a day. Test flows, due to start in November, were delayed because of an accident which damaged the pipe. The second phase involves the construction of an offshore compression platform and a liquefied petroleum gas plant on the coast near Vung Tau. British Gas and Mitsui last month finished work on a feasibility study for the Dollars 450m project. Industry sources say the speed at which Vietnam can develop its energy sector will depend on financing. Although the technical aspects of the British Gas study are clear, industry sources say there are doubts about how the second phase of the project, and any others, will attract project financing without government support. Vietnam's sovereign debt risk is still high and there is no precedent for large-scale financing. Projects would have to demonstrate sufficient foreign exchange revenues to justify any financing. 'The gas that comes ashore will be two and a half times as expensive as (that in) Indonesia or the Middle East because of the infrastructure needed to bring it ashore,' said Marie Belsey, British Gas Vietnam country manager. BP told the communist party daily Nhan Dan that it and its partners could spend as much as Dollars 1bn building production facilities offshore and an undersea pipeline to make use of the gas in Block Six, where it found gas. Up to a further Dollars 1bn could be needed to develop a market for the gas onshore, it said. Although Vietnam needs the gas domestically for power generation and fertiliser production, the government is also keen to export as much as possible, possibly to Thailand, which is known to be looking at further import sources. However, Hanoi will probably have to wait until next year to see how much gas is offshore. US firm Mobil, returning to Vietnam after a 19-year absence, is testing for gas at the Thanh Long (Blue Dragon) field but with no luck so far. Foreign firms say government planning will be crucial to successful exploitation of the country's gas. Late last month Vo Van Kiet, the prime minister, decided PetroVietnam should carry out a feasibility study looking into building Vietnam's first oil refinery in the poor province of Quang Ngai in the country's central region. The province, 525km north-east of Ho Chi Minh City, is hundreds of miles away from the offshore oilfields. Foreign oil firms were puzzled. A consortium of France's Total and Taiwanese partners had been working on a feasibility study, commissioned by state oil agency PetroVietnam, for a Dollars 1bn plant near Khanh Hoa, close to the oil industry hub of Vung Tau. The issue underlines the difficulty foreign firms prospecting for oil and gas sometimes have in gauging whether commercial priorities take precedence over political considerations as Hanoi decides how best to harness the country's energy resources. The country is also spending huge sums importing refined crude to fuel industrial growth and desperately needs its own refining capacity. PetroVietnam officials hope that as much as a third of the 6m tonnes of crude to be refined at the planned Quang Ngai plant will be shipped from Indonesia or the Middle East. But Danang, the nearest port, is too small to accommodate the kind of traffic anticipated and is not linked to major shipping lanes. Transporting the country's own crude northwards to the refinery from offshore fields off the southern coast of Vung Tau will add further costs. Meanwhile, bids have just closed on a promising oil block in the Mekong basin, closer to Vietnam's coast than the Nam Con Son basin and next to blocks with modestly encouraging finds by Japanese and Malaysian firms in June. 'The game's by no means over yet,' said BP's Mr Yeldham. 'There's still a lot of competition and the shakeout has yet to occur. 'We're not at the stage where you can say there are obvious winners and losers.'</p>

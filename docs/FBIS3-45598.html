According to the information released by Reporter (Shu  Shouchun) on the evening of 20 January, while staying at  Jingtang Harbor, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua inspected, along the  wide newly built road, the construction situation of the harbor  development area, listened to the report on planning and  development situation of the harbor, and inquired about the  detailed situation in building traffic, water supply, power  supply, and communications facilities of the harbor as well as  existing problems.    Vice Governor Chen Liyou introduced: Although Jingtang  Harbor and Tianjin's Qinhuangdao Harbor may complement each  other, while they cannot replace each other in functions.  Through various forms, including the transfer of property  right, Jingtang Harbor will cooperate with Beijing and Shanxi to  build itself to meet the demands of economic development and  opening up of the hinterland areas. At the same time, the  harbor will take advantage of its large expense of sea beaches  within the development area to absorb foreign investment and  develop the near-the-harbor industry in order to build itself  into a multi-functional harbor which combines industry with  foreign trade.    Vice Premier Zou Jiahua agreed to this idea on building the  harbor and exhorted the harbor to develop the near-the-harbor  industry within the development area in order to make full use  of the harbor.    During the inspection tour, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua also  listened to the report on economic development of Tangshan city  and construction of the harbor. He pointed out: Since the  restoration of construction after being hit by earthquakes,  Tangshan city has witnessed a very rapid progress in developing  the economy, and thus there will be bright prospects for the  development of the harbor. First, Tangshan city has such  hinterland areas as Hebei, Shanxi, and Inner Mongolia. Second,  the city has vast land resources which is exempt the city from  taking over land for construction and from relocating the  people. Third, combining the harbor with the development area  is conducive to developing the near-the-harbor industry. In  addition, the cooperation with Beijing is very important. Among  the several major cities around Bo Hai, only Beijing has no sea  outlet. Now, Beijing has chosen Tangshan Harbor is of great  significance to both Beijing and Tangshan. At present, the  harbor has already have the condition for attracting goods from  inland areas. We hope that Jingtang Harbor will successfully  radiate itself to inland areas, select its own points of  radiation, and strive to achieve success in building the  near-the-harbor industry.    Also accompanied Zou Jiahua on his inspection tour were  Zhang  Kezhi, deputy secretary general of the State Council; Ye Qing  and Chen Yaobang, vice ministers of the State Planning  Commission; Xu Penghang, vice minister of State Economic and  Trade Commission; Gu Xiulian, minister of chemical industry; Liu  Qi, minister of metallurgical industry; Liu E, vice minister of  communications; Sun Yongfu, vice minister of railways; and Zha  Keming, vice minister of power industry.</p>

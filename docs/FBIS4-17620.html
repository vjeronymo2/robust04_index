			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by KHOVAR correspondent for TASS] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe 26 April TASS -- According to forecasts  made by the military, in the near future the situation in the  Pamir area of the Tajik-Afghan border will be tense.    At present, the re-stationing of armed militants, belonging  to the movement of the Islamic Party of Tajikistan's Revival,  continues in northern provinces of Afghanistan, and in  particular, in the Badahshan Province where modernised military  formations are arriving.    Military sources say that a large group of militants has  concentrated in the Afghan settlement of Baharvk. The aim of  the group is to destabilise the situation in the Pamir border  area and cross into Tajikistan. Tajik anti-government militants  are being assisted by high-ranking Afghan military officials.    The command of Russian border guard troops in Tajikistan  jointly with Tajik government troops are taking additional  measures to prevent armed provocations in border areas  controlled by the Ishkashim and the Horog border guards units.  Border guard posts have been reinforced in the most vulnerable  border areas.</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Survey of Uganda (2): A long haul ahead - Uganda has achieved an economic turnaround Economic reforms, backed by donors and enthusiastically applied by the government, have brought dramatic results. Uganda's economic growth has averaged 5 per cent a year since 1988, inflation has fallen from 240 per cent in 1986 to single figures, and foreign exchange reserves cover more than three months of imports. Meanwhile, the budget deficit stays within limits agreed with the IMF and two critical areas of government spending are being tackled. The civil service will end up half its original 300,000 size, and the army will also be cut by half to 45,000 by the end of next year. In the process, life for the business community has been radically changed. Price controls have been lifted, foreign exchange controls abolished, and a privatisation programme begun in 1992-93 is under way. Meanwhile, foreign investors are returning, albeit cautiously, as are expelled Asians, encouraged by legislation that has allowed them to reclaim more than 3,000 properties expropriated by the Amin regime in the 1970s. For any government these measures would represent a remarkable achievement, let alone one with Uganda's history. But adding to the difficulties have been deteriorating terms of trade - 65 per cent over the past six years - as weakening coffee prices saw the crops' earnings drop from Dollars 384m in 1986 to Dollars 151m in 1992, recovering to Dollars 184m last year. The trauma has been eased, however, by donors, who have increased assistance from Dollars 230m in 1986 to more than Dollars 550m in 1993 with outright grants rising from under 10 per cent of government income in 1988 to 52 per cent last year. Although this has allowed growth to be maintained, it has left Uganda uncomfortably dependent on aid, and reaching levels of domestic and foreign investment sufficient to lead to self-sustaining growth, is now the single greatest challenge. The current rate of 6 per cent of GDP is 'still too low to provide the basis for rapid economic growth', warns a World Bank paper, and the impact on investment from the privatisation programme, managed by Public Enterprise Reform and Divestiture Secretariat, has proved disappointing. Parastatals have been classified into five categories. The government will retain full ownership of certain utilities, national parks and a development bank. It will partially divest from hotels, mines and telecommunications. Some 43 companies are slated for complete privatisation, while another 17 will be liquidated. However, few of the 100-odd companies in state hands have the potential to break even. The government has only privatised a handful of enterprises since the programme began in 1991. A bottling company, a distillery, Shell Uganda (which Shell bought back) and the tea estates of Agricultural Enterprises Ltd are the only notable sales to date. Several textile and spinning mills have been advertised, but the sector's plant is generally obsolete, overstaffed and carrying bad debts. Accompanying the privatisation programme has been the Uganda Investment Authority's attempt to attract foreign investment, offering a range of incentives first set out in 1991, designed to enhance the privatisation programme. It has managed to attract around Dollars 200m over two years, but it has not been an easy process. 'Uganda has been isolated from the real world of investment for so long, it doesn't know what the outside world wants or what price it is prepared to pay for it,' says a foreign consultant in Kampala. From one insider comes this blunt appraisal: 'Not one company has accounts up to date. Where accounts exist, they are often false or inaccurate.' Says another critic: 'The privatisation secretariat's recommendations to its political masters are often ignored, or overturned, often in pursuit of personal advantage for politicians and their associates.' There is criticism, too, of the amount of time spent outside the country promoting Uganda by senior government ministers and civil servants. The returns are far from clear, while work at home suffers. In 1985, over 50 per cent of government-collected revenue came from coffee exports, but during 1993 it was nil, for the tax had been abolished. Tax collection as a percentage of GDP remains low - about 7 per cent, around a third the average for sub-Saharan African countries, and is not expected to rise much above 10 per cent in the next two to three years. The Uganda Manufacturers' Association vigorously resists efforts to increase the burden on those already in the tax net. 'Uganda cannot afford to repulse capital by giving investors cause to relocate in neighbouring countries,' warned the association last year. The business community has a further concern - the appreciating shilling. High donor flows, improved coffee receipts and returning capital from Asian exiles have seen the currency strengthen from a high of 1,373 in January 1993 to a current level of around 960 to the dollar. This has resulted in artificially high import levels, which hurt the domestic producers and has hit exporters. Achievements notwithstanding, the task is a sobering one. If the economy maintains an annual average of 5 per cent growth and assuming population increase of between 2.5 and 3 per cent a year, it will take 30 years to double individuals' standards of living. At the same time, Uganda must reduce aid and reach self-sustaining growth - the biggest challenge of all.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Development projects  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Uganda's 1993-6 Rehabilitation and Development Plan includes several multimillion-dollar infrastructural projects of interest to international contractors.

			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses firm on hopes of lower rates CONTINENTAL bourses chose to focus on lower interest rates, following the US Federal Reserve's cut on Thursday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT rose in trading marked by wide swings in individual stocks. The day improved from a 0.82 decline to 698.92 in the FAZ index at midsession to a 8.37 rise to 1,776.98 in the DAX at the close, leaving gains on the week of 0.4 and 1.3 per cent respectively. Turnover jumped from DM6.5bn to DM8bn. Among blue chips, chemicals recovered from rumours of downgrades to close narrowly mixed, and carmakers climbed again with BMW DM7 higher at DM593, Daimler DM8 higher at DM770 and Volkswagen, which had gone ex-dividend, a net DM9.30 higher at 386.80. Banks extended their gains sedately after the US discount rate cut, reflected in a drop in the Bundesbank's average bond yield of 9 basis points to 8.25 per cent. Still among the DAX constituents, there were big moves in Lufthansa and Continental. The airline ended DM9.80 lower at DM114.70, after DM105 following its DM600m operating loss for the first five months of 1992. The tyremaker, however, rose DM9.50 to DM267 on speculation that Pirelli could overturn its voting rights limit and relaunch its failed takeover bid. Among second-liners, Asko resumed trading with a drop of DM109 to DM636, above a day's low of DM601, after a three-day suspension during which it announced a loss and passed the dividend. PARIS recouped Thursday's fall but trading was confined to a fairly narrow range. The CAC 40 index rose 10.12 to 1,883.64, down 1.6 per cent on the week, in thin turnover of FFr1.64bn. Suez was one of the most active shares, dropping to FFr3.80 to FFr270.20, on fears that it would have to increase its property provisions for 1992. The company has already warned shareholders that it will have to make provisions of FFr1.2bn. Euro Disney dropped FFr1.70 to FFr105.10 on fears that the French lorry drivers' blockades would harm the theme park's attendance figures. MILAN ended slightly higher after a nervous and volatile session. There was some professional buying at the start, in anticipation of a technical rebound next week, but the lack of follow-through buying by institutions prompted some dealers to square their positions ahead of the weekend. Dealers were also worried that opposition parties' calls for the resignation of the new finance minister, Mr Giovanni Goria, in connection with two scandals, could put the country's new government at risk. The Comit index fell 0.35 to 444.16, down 3.9 per cent on the week, in turnover estimated at L100bn after L103.8bn. Among issues which settled early, Fiat rose L22 to L5,112 but slipped to L5,090 later in the session. ZURICH closed an hour early as it moved to a new bourse building, and celebrated with the SMI index 15.9 higher at 1,870.5, 1.9 per cent higher on the week. Dealers liked lower interest rates at home and abroad. Trading was active, led by the obvious beneficiaries in banking and insurance, where SBC rose SFr10 to SFr262 and Winterthur by SFr60 to SFr3,150. MADRID produced a technical rebound which took the general index up by 3.39 to 239.44, still 1.6 per cent lower on the week. However, dealers said that domestic and international sentiment was still bad, that there had been no major news to encourage the turnround and that short-term speculators were behind it. AMSTERDAM closed broadly higher on the back of a firmer dollar but trading was thin. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.4 to 123.0, down 0.7 per cent on the week. The food producer Wessanen rose Fl 1.90 to Fl 89.50 on news that it had sold its milling, baking and starch operations to Goodman Fielder Wattie of Australia. BRUSSELS closed mixed in trading dominated by Petrofina. The Bel-20 index inched up 4.49 to 1,174.80 in turnover of BFr1.2bn. Petrofina climbed BFr100 to BFr11,150 and accounted for 60 per cent of the day's business. STOCKHOLM finished flat to lower in thin trade with the Affarsvarlden General index 2.8 down at 914.6, 0.7 per cent down on the week. Foreign interest helped three blue chips buck the trend, Asea B rising SKr2 to SKr392, Volvo by SKr3 to SKr385 and Astra B by SKr7 to SKr522, but volume slipped to a very thin SKr245m from SKr392m a day earlier. In COPENHAGEN, the all-share index fell 0.78 to 319.50, also in very thin trading, writes Hilary Barnes. Hafnia Holding was still suspended and a statement was awaited concerning its rights issue, subscriptions to which were postponed on Thursday. OSLO recovered earlier losses to close virtually unchanged in slow summer trade focused on the insurance company, Uni Storebrand. The all-share index ended 0.03 higher at 393.25, down 2.8 per cent on the week, as Uni Storebrand recovered NKr1 to NKr31in 315,000 shares after a mid-week fall on a report, since denied, that the company was close to technical bankruptcy. HELSINKI hit a new 1992 low in slow trade, the Hex index falling 3.3 to 750.7, 2.2 per cent down on the week. ISTANBUL fell on continued profit-taking as the 75-share index lost 68.7 to 4,175.96.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - Jul 3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10.30am  11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1135.61  1136.11  1137.16  1139.50  1140.90  1141.51  1140.52  1142.19  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           Day's High  1142.45    Day's Low  1134.87  -----------------------------------------------------------------------         Jul 2     Jul 1    Jun 30    Jun 29    Jun 26       1134.63   1132.36   1139.30   1141.48   1145.05  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Cs.I."-signed interview with Jozsef Torgyan, chairman of </F> the Independent Smallholders Party; place and date not given:  "The Victor Always Finds Friends"]    [Text] The renewal of the nation needs a leadership ready  for sacrifices, a leadership accepted by the population --  Jozsef Torgyan said in the series of interviews we are  publishing with the heads of political parties that presented an  election list. The chairman of the Independent Smallholders  Party [FKGP] is sure that his party will be one of the winners  in the elections.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Four years ago, the still united FKGP  received 11.7 percent of the votes. Listening to your speeches,  it seems that you are almost certain that the party will far  exceed this figure this time.    [Torgyan] You must know that you are talking to the possible  winner of the elections. Despite the situation of immense  discrimination against us and despite the fact that we are under  constant fire and that, near the pseudo-opposition that signed a  pact, we were the only real opposition party in Hungary, we not  only revived our party but also won over considerable masses of  people, and this clearly proves that the FKGP is one of the  potential winners of the elections. I think the Hungarian  people are sober and careful enough to be able to understand why  there is a deliberate silence about Jozsef Torgyan and the FKGP.  The government achieves exactly the opposite effect: It is  possible that, with this attitude, [Prime Minister] Peter Boross  helps us win a tremendous victory and, in case we win, I will  publicly thank him for this in a very polite manner.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Does your party's division hinder the  achievement of such results?    [Torgyan] Some 99.9 percent of our members support us. We  have never made it a secret that the gates are open and we  welcome any group of any name, no matter what they call  themselves: democratic smallholders, conservative smallholders,  national-oriented, or not national; we welcome the members, but  God save us from the betraying leaders! A party whose chairman  is only busy with cursing Jozsef Torgyan! I do not think that  this would be an adequate program in the elections. It is clear  that the current government created and maintains the United  Smallhodlers' Party, and it is no accident that, behind their  backs, people call them the party of ministerial armchairs.  This party will end up on history's garbage dump after 8 May,  and no one will have to deal with these issues ever again. We  have ceased to deal with these issues for quite a while.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Your personality will surely bring many  votes for the FGKP in a certain circle, but is there a real  program behind the declared promises, a program that can be  implemented?    [Torgyan] We are the only party that clearly stipulated in  its program that in case of an election victory, we will carry  out radical changes in all walks of life. It is worth pointing  out, and we do not keep it a secret either, that in case we  become part of the government, we will discard the  Budapest-centered political activity and will replace it with a  village-centered policy. We will create a top agricultural  ministry to revive the Hungarian agriculture, and we will  subordinate all the other sectors to this, including the foreign  affairs. Basically, it is possible to restore the agricultural  sector in two years. This is a full program that differs from  every other party's program. We would also apply totally  different solutions in legal matters, constitutional issues, the  state apparatus, privatization, unemployment, and the national  debt. National renewal requires a selfless leadership ready for  sacrifices, and one accepted by the population. We stress that  if someone gets a public function, he should not try to fill his  own pockets; instead, he should fill the pockets of the voters  he represents.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The FKGP has never named the desirable  coalition partners. It is also true that, with the exception of  the Hungarian Justice and Life Party and the Market Party, all  the parliamentary parties distance themselves from the FKGP led  by Jozsef Torgyan.    [Torgyan] I am not willing to cooperate with certain types  of leaders. People who have ignored and disregarded  constitutional methods so far, would be ready to do the same  anytime. Although people did not pay enough attention, I always  said that a party is one thing, and its leadership is another  thing. I am not sure that the parliamentary parties which you  are taking into account now will have the same leadership after  the elections. On the other hand, I start from the premise that  a victor always finds friends. The question is whether the  victor can calmly select. We want and will be able to select.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] If things turn out that way, under what  conditions would you accept the position of prime minister?    [Torgyan] I am a professional person who is absolutely aware  that it is impossible to keep waiting for new parliamentary  cycles to have a talented leader at long last. Nor can one wait  until an untalented leader becomes somebody. On the other hand,  one should examine the possibility of creating a social  cooperation in which the whole population supports the prime  minister, because it is impossible to get out of the current  catastrophic situation in any other way. If the conditions for  this cannot be created, one must not accept the position.</p>

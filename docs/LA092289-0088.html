			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESURRECTED;  </P> <P> ARLINGTON RACECOURSE, DESTROYED BY FIRE IN 1985, IS NOW BETTER THAN EVER  </P> <P> Any race track that has a Sunday Silence sundae on its dining-room menu can't  be all bad.  </P> <P> But that $2.95 concoction, named after the Kentucky Derby winner and a  combination of homemade ice cream smothered with a jillion calories, is only a  small reason for liking Arlington International Racecourse, the rebuilt grande  dame of Midwest racing in this northwest Chicago suburb.  </P> <P> There are bigger, and better, reasons for liking the new Arlington, which is  the result of 19 months of construction and an estimated $175 million of owner  Dick Duchossois' money. The track opened 2 1/2 months ago, about four years  after the original plant was destroyed by fire. The inaugural meeting will  continue through Oct. 15.  </P> <P> It is difficult to find a fan or a horseman who will knock the place. Charlie  Rose, an assistant to New York trainer John Veitch, has brought a couple of  horses here.  </P> <P> "I had heard so many raves about the place that when I came here in July, I  didn't expect it to live up to all those notices," Rose said. "But it did. It  is just as good as everybody says it is."  </P> <P> Jack Price, who owned and trained Carry Back when he won the Kentucky Derby in  1961, lives in Florida and is visiting a Chicago race track for the first time  in 25 years.  </P> <P> "This place is like the Louvre," Price said as he looked around. "Check that.  It's nicer than the Louvre."  </P> <P> Responsibility for the new Arlington lies solely with Duchossois (dush-a-SWAH),  a 68-year-old workaholic businessman whose company employs 8,500 people, makes  railroad cars and automatic garage-door openers and has seven radio stations  and a television station. Duchossois also owns Quad City Downs, a harness  track, and races horses and operates Hill 'n Dale Farm, a 400-acre estate where  he stands Zev, Illinois' most important stallion.  </P> <P> A newcomer to racing, Duchossois wasn't interested in horses until one of his  four children started riding saddlebreds in state competitions. In 1983,  Duchossois and three partners paid $19 million to buy a deteriorating Arlington  Park from Gulf &amp; Western. Although Duchossois put up most of the money, he  remained in the background while the others ran the track.  </P> <P> One of the partners, Joe Joyce, had worked for Gulf &amp; Western and was  largely responsible for starting the Arlington Million, thoroughbred racing's  first million-dollar race, in 1981. The Million was designed to give the ailing  track a transfusion by importing top grass runners around the world to Chicago  to run against America's turf stars.  </P> <P> The Million was a moderate success for four years, failing to attract Europe's  best horses but turning into a personal showcase for John Henry, the  charismatic gelding who won two of the races and finished second another time.  </P> <P> On July 30, 1985, 25 days before the fifth Million, Duchossois, a widower,  attended a birthday party with Phyllis Diller, his good friend. When Duchossois  returned home, he got a phone call from Joyce with news that there was a fire  at the track. The fire continued the next day, wiping out the grandstand and  most of the track offices.  </P> <P> Incredibly, Arlington was still able to run the Million, by removing the  grandstand rubble and replacing it with tents and portable bleachers that gave  the track a county fair atmosphere.  </P> <P> Insurance companies offered a settlement reported to be $60 million, and  Duchossois used some of the money to buy out Joyce and the other partners, who  say that financially they did better that way.  </P> <P> Duchossois went from a silent partner to a 100% owner who got involved in  everything. The track operated on the same makeshift basis for two years, then  closed last year while construction continued on the renamed Arlington  International.  </P> <P> "I've always felt that when something bad happens, something good can come of  it," Duchossois said. "The most fitting thing of all was that the year we ran  what we called the Miracle Million (1985), Teleprompter, an English horse owned  by Lord Derby himself, won the race. Because of that, the whole world knew what  Arlington accomplished on the heels of the fire. We took a tragedy and turned  it into an international display of good will."  </P> <P> Now, Duchossois has turned a setting out of Currier &amp; Ives into a sleek,  cosmopolitan racing facility that operators of Garden State Park and the  Birmingham Turf Club wished they had settled for when their tracks were built  in recent years. Both Garden State, near Philadelphia, and Birmingham, in  Alabama, were extravagant examples of construction overkill, facilities that  were too big, too opulent -- and too expensive -- for their market areas.  </P> <P> Arlington International may have cost a lot of money -- and only Duchossois  himself knows exactly what it cost -- but in the mind of its builder, it is a  realistically sized plant. When the Arlington Million was run for the ninth  time on the Sunday before Labor Day, management actually worked at keeping the  crowd down -- to around 30,000 -- so that everybody would be comfortable.  </P> <P> "This isn't California," says Duchossois, who races horses with trainer Charlie  Whittingham on the West Coast. "A big crowd for us on a Saturday is 20,000.  We've got room to expand, but we don't use our infield for spectators and what  we've tried to do is build a facility where everybody can enjoy a day at the  races."  </P> <P> Duchossois is also attempting to lure new, younger fans to Arlington, which is  the goal of tracks everywhere. There is a high-tech video area in the six-story  plant where fans can punch up interviews with racing personalities explaining  the intricacies of the sport. The same monitors also provide history lessons,  flashing highlights from the careers of some of racing's most famous horses.  There are several picnic areas and the yellow and white tents, familiar  holdovers from the post-fire years.  </P> <P> Despite the relative smallness of the plant, it is easy to see how the cost  escalated, because Duchossois spent lavishly in many areas. Just outside the  video center, one level down and overlooking the amphitheater paddock, is a  life-size bronze depicting the finish of the first Million, in which John Henry  and Bill Shoemaker nipped The Bart and Eddie Delahoussaye at the wire. The  statue is called "Against All Odds," which Duchossois says describes the  resurgence of Arlington as well as the fairy-tale career of John Henry, a  mean-spirited horse who passed from owner to owner before he started winning  major races.  </P> <P> Among the things that impress Whittingham about Arlington are the sight lines.  At many race tracks, one of the basics -- seeing the horses run -- can't be  taken for granted, but here there are 12,000 seats with unobstructed views. The  cantilevered roofs at both ends of the grandstand have no vertical structural  supports and actually resemble giant Concorde bookends.  </P> <P> Arlington may also lead the country's tracks in television monitors per square  foot. There are 800 monitors, with a TV set at most tables in the main dining  room, as well as at many of the box seats. The running of each race is also  accompanied by the best sound system in racing. A fan anywhere in the plant can  hear every word of ebullient Phil Georgeff's race call, and the volume is  intentionally turned up when the horses hit the top of the stretch.  </P> <P> Have there been any complants?  </P> <P> Well, yes. Someone said that the hamburgers at the concession stands are  overpriced. Still, they are less expensive than those sold at Saratoga. And  some of the old guard would feel more comfortable being able to flick their  cigar butts, but when the floors are marbled, carpeted or both, that's not  acceptable behavior.  </P> <P> "The place is so rich that I feel like taking my shoes off, so I won't leave  any footprints," one bettor said.  </P> <P> To accommodate the high rollers and corporate groups, Arlington has built 19  sky boxes, unfurnished suites that accommodate a minimum of 20 people and rent  for $60,000 a year with a three-year lease. One source said that the track has  not been overwhelmed with applicants, but Duchossois said that he got enough  response to almost rent each box twice.  </P> <P> "What we've decided to do is rent most of them on a daily basis, for parties,"  Duchossois said. "It costs $1,000 a day for a group to use them."  </P> <P> The early problems for Arlington International have been behind the scenes. The  track is suing a large Chicago architectural firm for $20 million, charging  that plans were submitted late, forcing the track to hire a general contractor  without competitive bidding and causing cost overruns. In response, the  architects say that Arlington is eight months late in paying the last $1  million of the $6.3-million fee.  </P> <P> The architects, who specialize in office buildings and museums, had no  experience designing a race track. They were specifically selected because they  would be open-minded with their ideas.  </P> <P> Duchossois, a decorated Army major during World War II, will not be an easy  opponent in this legal battle, giving ground no more readily than he has in  skirmishes with the racing commission, the state legislature and other Chicago  tracks over racing dates, off-track betting territories and other matters.  </P> <P> People who work for Duchossois are used to the same 14-hour days he subjects  himself to. Duchossois says he can't remember the last time he took a vacation.  </P> <P> Arlington's employees must follow rules that are highly unusual for race track  personnel. Betting during working hours is verboten, and mutuel clerks won't  punch out a ticket if they recognize a fellow employee across the counter.  </P> <P> "After this weekend, a lot of my people are going to get a week off,"  Duchossois said before the Million. "They've been working under a lot of  pressure, first in the rush to get ready for the opening, and then getting set  for the Million."  </P> <P> The owner of Arlington didn't mention a respite for himself. In fact, he  scheduled a vacation for November, then canceled it.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman issued in </F> Pyongyang on 4 April place and date not given -- read by  announcer]    [Text] A spokesman for the DPRK Ministry of Foreign Affairs  released the following statement regarding the UN Security  Council's [UNSC] announcement of the president's statement  making irrational demands [tangchi anun yogudul] on us:    On 31 March, the UNSC announced the president's statement  making irrational demands while urging us to allow additional  unjust [pudanghan] inspections by the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA].    The nature of our nuclear issue is not one to be referred to  the UNSC for discussions. We have already allowed enough  inspections of our nuclear facilities to guarantee the  continuity of safeguards, as we agreed with the United States  and the IAEA. There is no room for any doubt here.    Even if there had been some differences in opinion in the  course of the inspection, that should be settled between the  agency and the inspected country, the actual parties concerned  with the inspection.    Why on earth, despite these facts, did the UNSC finally  discuss the referred issue on inspections of us and adopt the  president's statement?    The intrinsic nature of the problem is clear. The United  States needed the UNSC, a stage for political discussions  [chongchijok toui madang], and had to make the president's  statement, a venue for pressure [amnyok konggan] to realize the  hostile policy to crush [apsal] the DPRK.    The UNSC, whose mission is to guarantee peace and security  of  the world, discussed our issue based the IAEA Board of  Governors' unjust and biased conclusion [pudanghago  pyonggyonjogin kyollon] noting that the scope of the  noncompliance with the safeguards accord has been broadened  [tambo hyopchong pulihaengui pomwiga hwaktae toeoddanun]. This  clearly contracts the purpose and principle of the UN Charter.    Today's reality is that the United States and some Western  forces [ilbu sobang seryoktul], who see our socialist system as  a thorn in their flesh, can have international organizations at  their beck and call [che maumdaero chwauji halsu innun], if  necessary, to plot to harm small countries, such as our country.  No one can deny this.    If the UNSC indeed wants to fulfill its mission, it should  raise an issue [munjesi] with the United States, which is posing  grave threats to peace and security on the Korean peninsula with  an immense number of nuclear weapons while creating obstacles to  the solution of the nuclear problem, and the South Korean  authorities, the perpetrator [hasuin] of the United States.    What cannot be overlooked, in addition, is that the UNSC has  unjustly raised an outcry over us, who are conducting peaceful  nuclear activities [pyonghwajok haek hwaltong], while ignoring  those countries that are playing the dangerous nuclear game  [wihoman haek changnanjil] under the U.S. protection. This  shows that, applying a double standard, the UNSC is being used  by the United States for realizing its hostile policy to crush  the DPRK.    The UNSC intentionally ignored the nature of our nuclear  issue and raised an issue regarding the implementation of the  safeguards accord in the president's statement encouraged by  [pyongsung] the U.S. hostile policy against the DPRK.    The validity of the safeguards accord has virtually been  suspended since we temporarily suspended the effectuation of the  withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] for  the DPRK-U.S. talks. Up to the present, we have allowed  inspections only to guarantee the continuity of safeguards as a  self-imposed and well-meant measure [chayulchogin sonuiui  chochiroso] with the desire to prove the transparency of our  nuclear activities. These inspections coincide with our special  position [uriga chohae innun tuksu chiwie puhaptoenun].    Since the United States and the IAEA could not deny this,  they agreed to conduct the restricted inspection only to  guarantee the continuity of safeguards, not regular or irregular  inspections [chonggi mit pijonggi]. Accordingly, raising an  issue on the implementation of the safeguards accord and  additional inspections is senseless to us since we are in an  authorized special position [kongindoen tuksu chiwi].    We do what we say we are going to do, and do not do what we  say we are not going to do. We are invariably adhering to a  firm independent policy and a correct line on external  relations. We have never changed a position that we once  declared.    The UNSC should first take steps to fix the unjust action by  the IAEA Secretariat, which has widened the area of unjust  treatment of us [urie taehan pulgongjongsongui pomwirul  hwaktaesikigo innun], currying favor with large countries,  before demanding our additional inspections.    The IAEA Secretariat ought to apologize for the fact that it  has widened the area of unjust treatment, openly joining the  U.S. anti- Republic maneuver. Far from apologizing, the IAEA  Secretariat has gradually expanded its unjust treatment of us.  We will repay [kyesan] this without fail.    The United States is more openly stirring up the maneuver of  international pressure against the Republic [kukchejogin  pangonghwaguk amnyok sodongul touk nogolhwa hago itta], using  the IAEA Board of Governors and the UNSC.    Furthermore, the United States is creating an extreme  military [word indistinct] situation, saying that it will resume  the Team Spirit joint military exercise and that it is ready to  trigger the second Korean war [cheiui choson chonjaengdo  pulsahagetta].    All facts clearly prove that the United States has no  intention to resolve the nuclear issue at all and that its main  aim is to realize its hostile policy of crushing Korea  [taechoson choktaesi apsal chongchaek] by deliberately  aggravating the situation of the Korean peninsula.    Complying with this as well, by continuing to introduce  nuclear weapons and stepping up their nuclear development, the  South Korean authorities are attempting to persistently stage a  nuclear war exercise against us in conspiracy with a nuclear  possession country. This shows that the South Korean authorities  are, in fact, not interested in the joint declaration of  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula but are rushing toward  the criminal road of nullifying it.    Under the present situation in which the United States is  clinging to pressure alone [migugi amyok ilbyondoro naonun hyon  sanghwangeso] after overturning all promises made to us we have  no choice but to conduct on a normal basis our peaceful nuclear  activities [chongsanghwa hajiannulsu opke toeyotta] which we had  unilaterally frozen for the DPRK-U.S. talks.    The United States and the South Korean authorities are  attempting to escalate their commotion of pressure on us with  the presidential statement of the UN Security Council as an  occasion. However, this cannot fool us.    The more the United States and its follower forces scheme to  crush the socialist system of our own style, the firmer the  singleheartedly united might of our party, the people, and the  People's Army will be.    Responding to force with force and to dialogue with dialogue  is our firm and invariable will and policy. The U.S. hostile  policy of crushing Korea will not escape ruin.    Our position to resolve the nuclear issue peacefully is  consistent [sijong ilgwan hada].    [Dated] 4 April 1994, Pyongyang.</p>

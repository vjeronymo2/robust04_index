			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [David Owen, Jimmy Burns, and David White report: "UK Arms </F> in Saudi Deal Exempt From Export Regulations"]    [Text] Saudi Arabia is under no obligation to give details  of the end users of defence equipment supplied by Britain under  the 20bn [billion] pounds Al-Yamamah defence deal, the  government said yesterday.    The potentially embarrassing disclosure, came in a  parliamentary written answer by Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence  procurement minister.    Mr Aitken said defence equipment exports under the  Al-Yamamah  deal had "Crown status", in common with all government defence  exports, and were "therefore not subject to export licensing  requirements."    It also emerged last night that the disclosure had earlier  been brought to the attention of Lord Justice Scott who is  conducting the arms-for-lraq inquiry.    Evidence before the inquiry shows that the government  pressed  ahead with defence deals with Saudi Arabia in spite of being  warned by intelligence and some officials that the country was  possibly being used to divert military equipment to Iraq.    Mr Paul Regan, a spokesman for the Scott inquiry, said the  judge was looking at the potential loopholes inherent in Crown  status arrangements, which are believed to cover a number of  other potentially sensitive defence deals, and the extent to  which the government had adhered to restrictions on exports to  Iraq directly or through a third country.    Al-Yamamah is a two-stage government-to-government deal  covering supplies of British arms, infrastructure, and defence  services worth more than 2bn pounds per year.    Mr Jim Cousins, the Labour MP who tabled the parliamentary  question, said yesterday that the government's answer was "of  very considerable significance" in the light of evidence given  to the Scott inquiry.    Mr Cousins said the answer showed there was "a great hole"  in  the export licence control system.    The Ministry of Defence said last night that there was no  requirement for transactions with Crown status either to have  export sales licences or for end-user details to be provided.    Mr Aitken said sales under Al Yamamah were subject to "the  normal foreign and defence policy considerations."    The Al-Yamamah deal dates from 1985 and was reinforced in  1988. Although signed by defence secretaries Mr Michael  Heseltine and his successor Mr George Younger, now Lord Younger  of Prestwick, it had from the outset the strong personal backing  of Lady Thatcher the then prime minister.    A year ago, Mr John Major, the prime minister, secured the  latest order for arms estimated to be worth 4bn-5bn pounds total.    Full details of the deal have never been disclosed. British  officials and industrialists have said this was at the  insistence of the Saudi authorities.</p>

			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OCEANSIDE CAN'T GET A GRIP, ENDS UP LOSING TO MADISON  </P> <P> Maybe if Oceanside High School hadn't treated the basketball as if it were a  wet bar of soap, things would have gone better for the Pirates Thursday night  at Madison.  </P> <P> Maybe if a couple of their 25 turnovers wouldn't have turned into  fourth-quarter slam dunks for Madison's Monte Bohannon and Brad Eaddy,  Oceanside would be preparing for Saturday's San Diego Section quarterfinals.  </P> <P> Instead, thanks to a few breaks and a lot of guts, Madison slid past Oceanside,  69-59, and will play host to San Pasqual Saturday evening.  </P> <P> The game wasn't 3 minutes old when Oceanside Coach Don Montamble pushed himself  off the bench to call timeout. Madison (15-12) had roared off to a 9-2 lead,  and Montamble was having nightmares of last season's playoffs, when his team  fell behind Kearny, 8-0, and never came back.  </P> <P> But that's not what happened. Oceanside (13-11) closed the gap to 17-14 and had  Madison running scared.  </P> <P> But then there were the Oceanside turnovers. Guards threw the ball away.  Forwards turned perfect passes into out-of-bounds deflections. Once, two  Oceanside players dove on a loose ball and were called for traveling. At least  the Pirates were consistent: They had 13 turnovers in the first half and 12 in  the second.  </P> <P> "It was a big game, and the kids were nervous and wide-eyed," Montamble said.  "We'd get a surge and make a run at Madison. . . . But then we'd turn the ball  over, and then someone would get lost on defense and give Madison an easy  layup."  </P> <P> Fred Dunn, who led Oceanside with 17 points, had a simpler explanation: "We  weren't using our heads tonight. We were throwing the ball around and stuff."  </P> <P> Oceanside was wounded once in each half by a Kirk Cumming three-point shot, and  the Pirates were hurt plenty by Madison's Robby Robinson, who reached his  average with 27 points. Monte Bohannon had 15 points and Cumming 14.  </P></p>

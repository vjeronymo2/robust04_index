			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian output cut fuels LME zinc price rally ZINC PRICES jumped to fresh eight-week peaks at the start of trading on the London Metal Exchange yesterday as the market absorbed news that Cominco, the Canadian group, is to cut its production of the metal by 50,000 tonnes this year. But profit-taking forced prices to retreat and analysts suggested further substantial cuts in the output of refined zinc were needed if prices were to move back up to the industry's break-even level of 54 US cents to 55 cents a lb (Dollars 1,190-Dollars 1,212 a tonne). 'We need two or three more cuts of the Cominco size if stocks are to come down and prices to rise,' suggested Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken, part of the Banque Indosuez Group. 'I don't expect any other producers to follow (Cominco) quickly but if the zinc price stays at the present level for another three months there will be more producer cuts.' Zinc for delivery in three months touched Dollars 1,140 a tonne on the LME in early trading yesterday before easing back to close at Dollars 1,129.75, still Dollars 11.75 up on Friday's close. Last week Pasminco of Australia announced a restructuring that would remove about 25,000 tonnes of zinc a year from the market but Mr Bielski said Cominco's cuts were more significant because they involved a reduction in refined metal production rather than mine output. He estimated that another 50,000 to 100,000 tonnes of refined metal production would have to be cut this year simply to bring the market back into balance. However, as world zinc stocks had risen to the equivalent of 9 weeks consumption, more cuts would be required to whittle them down. Stocks would have to be reduced to about five weeks consumption before zinc prices would show any substantial rise. Sumitomo Metal of Japan said depressed prices were forcing it to cut nickel production from April 1 to an annual rate of 15,900 tonnes for at least the first half of the 1993-94 financial year. Analysts estimated this might take 5,000 tonnes out of the market this year, 'not nearly enough to make an impact on prices,' said Ms Karen Norton at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group. Billiton in its latest Metals Report points out that most of the several nickel production cuts which have been announced are mainly reductions in planned 1993 output rather than genuine cuts. It still expects a nickel supply surplus this year and for the price to fall from an average of Dollars 3.18 a lb in 1992 to Dollars 2.75 this year.</p>

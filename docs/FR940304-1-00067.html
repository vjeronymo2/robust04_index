Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Part B of Title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, Public Law 94&hyph;163, as amended by the National Energy Conservation Policy Act, Public Law 95&hyph;619, by the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act, Public Law 100&hyph;12, by the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988, Public Law 100&hyph;357, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;486 <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  created the Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products other than Automobiles. The consumer products subject to this program (often referred to hereafter as ``covered products'') are: Refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers and freezers; dishwashers; clothes dryers; water heaters; central air conditioners and central air conditioning heat pumps; furnaces; direct heating equipment; television sets; kitchen ranges and ovens; clothes washers; room air conditioners; fluorescent lamp ballasts; and pool heaters; as well as any other consumer product classified by the Secretary of Energy. Section 322. To date, the Secretary has not so classified any additional products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=2 --> Part B of Title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended by the National Energy Conservation Policy Act, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988, and the Energy Policy Act of 1992, is referred to in this notice as the ``Act.'' Part B of Title III is codified at 42 U.S.C. 6291  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Part B of Title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended by the National Energy Conservation Policy Act only, is referred to in this notice as the National Energy Conservation Policy Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Act, the program consists essentially of three parts: testing, labeling, and Federal energy conservation standards. The Department, in consultation with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is required to amend or establish new test procedures as appropriate for each of the covered products. Section 323. The purpose of the test procedures is to produce test results that measure the energy efficiency, energy use, or estimated annual operating cost of a covered product during a representative average use cycle or period of use and shall not be unduly burdensome to conduct. Section 323 (b)(3). A test procedure is not required if DOE determines by rule that one cannot be developed. Section 323 (d)(1). Test procedures appear at 10 CFR part 430, subpart B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal Trade Commission is required by the Act to prescribe rules governing the labeling of covered products for which test procedures have been prescribed by DOE. Section 324(a). These rules are to require that each particular model of a covered product bears a label that indicates its annual operating cost and the range of estimated annual operating costs for other models of that product. Section 324(c)(1). Disclosure of estimated operating cost is not required under section 324 if the Federal Trade Commission determines that such disclosure is not likely to assist consumers in making purchasing decisions, or is not economically feasible. In such a case, the Federal Trade Commission must require a different useful measure of energy consumption. Section 324(c). At the present time there are Federal Trade Commission rules requiring labels for the following products: room air conditioners, furnaces, clothes washers, dishwashers, water heaters, refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers and freezers, central air conditioners and central air conditioning heat pumps, and fluorescent lamp ballasts. 44 FR 66475, November 19, 1979, 52 FR 46888, December 10, 1987, and 54 FR 28031, July 5, 1989.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For each of the 12 covered products, the Act prescribes an initial Federal energy conservation standard. Section 325(b)-(h). The Act establishes dates of applicability for the standards in 1988, 1990, 1992 or 1993, depending on the product, and specifies that the standards are to be reviewed by the Department within 3 to 10 years, also depending on the product. Section 325(b)-(h). After the specified period, DOE may promulgate new standards for each product; however, the Secretary may not prescribe any amended standard which increases the maximum allowable energy use, or decreases the minimum required energy efficiency of a covered product. Section 325(l)(1). The Department's current review of standards is for room air conditioners, water heaters, direct heating equipment, mobile home furnaces, kitchen ranges and ovens, pool heaters and fluorescent lamp ballasts and is considering establishing energy conservation standards for television sets. Section 325(g)(4)(A).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any new or amended standard is required to be designed so as to achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency that is technologically feasible and economically justified. Section 325(l)(2)(A).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 325(l)(2)(B)(i) provides that before DOE determines whether a standard is economically justified, it must first solicit comments on a proposed standard. After reviewing comments on the proposal, DOE must then determine that the benefits of the standard exceed its burdens, based, to the greatest extent practicable, on a weighing of the following seven factors:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The economic impact of the standard on the manufacturers and on the consumers of the products subject to such standard;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The savings in operating costs throughout the estimated average life of the covered product in the type (or class) compared to any increase in the price of, or in the initial charges for, or maintenance expenses of, the covered products which are likely to result from the imposition of the standard;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The total projected amount of energy savings likely to result directly from the imposition of the standard;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Any lessening of the utility or the performance of the covered products likely to result from the imposition of the standard;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The impact of any lessening of competition, as determined in writing by the Attorney General, that is likely to result from the imposition of the standard;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The need for national energy conservation; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Other factors the Secretary considers relevant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, section 325(l)(2)(B)(iii) establishes a rebuttable presumption of economic justification in instances where the Secretary determines that ``the additional cost to the consumer of purchasing a product complying with an energy conservation standard level will be less than three times the value of the energy savings during the first year that the consumer will receive as a result of the standard, as calculated under the applicable test procedure*&blank;*&blank;*.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 327 of the Act addresses the effect of Federal rules on State laws or regulations concerning testing, labeling, and standards. Generally, all such State laws or regulations are superseded by the Act. Section 327(a)-(c). Exemptions to this general rule include: (1) State standards prescribed or enacted before January 8, 1987, and applicable to appliances produced before January 3, 1988 (section 327(b)(1)); (2) State procurement standards which are more stringent than the applicable Federal standard (Section 327(b)(3) and (f)(1)-(4)); (3) State regulations banning constant burning pilot lights in pool heaters (Section 327(b)(4)); and (4) State standards for television sets effective on or after January 1, 1992, may remain in effect in the absence of a Federal standard for such product (Section 327(b)(6) and 327(c)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> b. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Energy Conservation Policy Act required DOE to establish mandatory energy efficiency standards for each of the 13 covered products. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  These standards were to be designed to achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency that was technologically feasible and economically justified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The consumer products covered by the National Energy Conservation Policy Act included: Refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers; freezers; dishwashers; clothes dryers; water heaters; room air conditioners; home heating equipment not including furnaces; television sets; kitchen ranges and ovens; clothes washers; humidifiers and dehumidifiers; central air conditioners; and furnaces. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Energy Conservation Policy Act provided, however, that no standard for a product be established if there were no test procedure for the product, or if DOE determined by rule either that a standard would not result in significant conservation of energy, or that a standard was not technologically feasible or economically justified. In determining whether a standard was economically justified, the Department was directed to determine whether the benefits of the standard exceeded its burdens by weighing the seven factors discussed above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The National Appliance Energy Conservation Act, which became law on March 17, 1987, amended the Energy Policy and Conservation Act in part by: redefining ``covered products'' (specifically, refrigerators, refrigerator- freezers, and freezers were combined into one product type from two; humidifiers and dehumidifiers were deleted; and pool heaters were added); establishing Federal energy conservation standards for 11 of the 12 covered products; and creating a schedule, according to which each standard is to be reviewed to determine if an amended standard is required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The National Appliance Energy Conservation Amendments of 1988, which became law on June 28, 1988, established Federal energy conservation standards for fluorescent lamp ballasts. These amendments also created a review schedule for DOE to determine if any amended standard for fluorescent lamp ballasts is required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Energy Policy Act of 1992, which became law on October 24, 1992, addressed various commercial appliances and equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As directed by the Act, DOE published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking with a 75-day comment period that ended December 12, 1990, for the eight products subject to today's rulemaking. 55 FR 39624, September 28, 1990. (Hereafter referred to as the September 1990 advance notice). The September 1990 advance notice presented the product classes that DOE planned to analyze, and provided a detailed discussion of the analytical methodology and analytical models that the Department expected to use in performing the analysis to support this rulemaking. The Department invited comments and data on the accuracy and feasibility of the planned methodology and encouraged interested persons to recommend improvements or alternatives to the Department's approach. The comments in response to the advance notice are addressed in Sections II and III of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II.

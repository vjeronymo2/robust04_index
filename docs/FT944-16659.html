			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Waterglade shares suspended Waterglade International, the lossmaking property group successfully besieged by rebel shareholders last September, had its shares suspended yesterday 'pending clarification of its financial position'. The new board, controlled by Singaporean Winston Ng, and brothers Anthony and Selwyn Midgen, were setting out to clarify the financial standing of the group before they announced a refinancing package, including a Pounds 6m rights issue. It is unclear as to whether they have discovered any impediments to such an issue. A further announcement will be made by noon on Friday.</p>

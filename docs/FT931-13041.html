			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: UK dividends The conventional view of the relationship between equities and gilt-edged stock suggests the former are currently cheap since they yield half as much as gilts. The yield ratio is at the bottom of a range that traditionally fluctuates between 2 and around 2.5. According to a paper written for the Institute of Actuaries by Mr Peter Jones of James Capel this view is flawed since it ignores changes in the rate of dividend growth. Equities strongly outperformed gilts during the 1980s because dividend growth constantly surprised even professional investors. Now there is a tendency to assume that high growth rates are normal. Yet if, despite the exit from the ERM, the UK is entering a period of low growth and inflation, dividend growth may start to disappoint. The yield ratio would then be sending a different message. The harder question is where the boundaries should be set. Mr Jones believes dividend growth would have to return to around 6 per cent by 1994 to justify present equity valuations. That looks plausible on the basis of a rebound of earnings after the recession, but touch-and-go when present levels of dividend cover and the likely trend of nominal GDP are taken into account. There may yet be grounds for switching into gilts, especially by pension funds that are heavily overweight in equities.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Service industry leaders endorse Nafta accord SERVICE industry leaders, appointed by the White House to make trade policy recommendations, have endorsed the new North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with its wide-ranging provisions opening the highly protected Mexican services market. This comes in a report by the Services Policy Advisory Committee (SPAC), to accompany President Bush's notification to Congress that a pact has been reached between the US, Mexico and Canada. Congress requires reports from private-sector advisory panels, to help members weigh trade pact benefits and drawbacks. The report contains important annexes by dissenting members. Mr John Adams, a Natural Resources Defence Council environmentalist, said the accord lacks 'sufficient environmental safeguards'. He urges Congress to 'condition final approval on strengthening measures that link environmental protection with North America's economic integration'. Congress members may block Nafta if environmental and labour provisions are not strengthened. Mr Jason Berman, Recording Industry Association president, said Canada's exemption for cultural industries should be matched by a warning that the US will respond to Canadian discrimination against US copyright interests. Mr John Sweeney, president of the Services Employees' International Union, said Nafta should be renegotiated, and pledges sought to improve environmental and labour standards and protect workers' rights to unionise. But sentiment among the committee's 37 members, headed by Mr John Reed, Citicorp chairman, is enthusiastic. Nafta's recognition of broad principles covering all services was an achievement hard to overstate, the report says. 'Services' were defined 'so that service businesses not now in existence will receive the benefits of the agreement'. Foreign service providers are at present restricted in Mexican operations. Under Nafta, US and Canadian service providers will be treated the same as Mexican companies, unless their services are specially exempted. Civil aviation, maritime and basic telecommunications services are not covered by the pact; banks, insurance and securities have limits to be gradually phased out. Services and investment liberalisation is so extensive that US business may have trouble accepting anything less restrictive under the Uruguay Round; for example, US and Canadian service-sector companies in Mexico will be exempt from export, import and domestic content rules.</p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Stand-off in Thai power struggle: The confrontation between the people and the military is far from over THAILAND'S political crisis is not yet over. After three days of violent confrontations between the government and pro-democracy demonstrators, Bangkok was returned to its normal state of noise and congestion yesterday by the timely intervention of King Bhumipol Adulyadej. The compromise brokered by the king late on Wednesday between Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon, the prime minister, and Mr Chamlong Srimuang, leader of the opposition campaign, has halted the violence and given businesses the chance to recover from the week's chaos. This forced reconciliation of enemies in the presence of the monarch, however, is only an interim solution. It is now up to the two sides to achieve the seemingly impossible task of satisfying both the political ambitions of the military establishment and the democratic aspirations of the Thai people. Yesterday neither side showed much willingness to yield. As 3,000 protesters emerged from jail yesterday under an amnesty announced by Gen Suchinda - some still wearing clothes stained with the blood of dead comrades - they insisted that the prime minister would have to resign and even go into exile. On his own admission, 40 people were killed in the disturbances, although unofficial tallies put the death toll higher. All over the capital, residents expressed relief that the violence had ended but said it would take a long time to heal the emotional scars left by the sight of Thai soldiers gunning down civilians in the city centre. 'Anger' was the word most commonly expressed, and opposition parties are demanding that Gen Suchinda and his government should be held accountable for the actions of the army. The sense of continuing conflict was underlined by a reference in one Bangkok newspaper to missing protestors as 'pro-democracy MIAs', an abbreviation usually reserved for soldiers missing in action. King Bhumipol's intervention has left the ball in the government's court. After meeting the king, Gen Suchinda promised to arrange for parliament to meet next week to rush through an amendment of the constitution, one of the opposition's main demands. They want the constitution changed to reduce the power of the military-appointed senate and reserve the premiership for an elected member of parliament, but it is unclear how far the pro-military coalition which appointed the unelected Gen Suchinda is prepared to go down the path of reform. Indeed, it was the coalition's hesitation on the constitutional issue which contributed to the violence in the first place. The five parties in the government, having conceded the need to change the constitution, appeared to be backtracking just before the disturbances erupted on Sunday night. King Bhumipol implicitly criticised Gen Suchinda on this point in his audience on Wednesday. Throughout this week the members of the coalition, having won the elections in March with the help of vote-buying in the provinces, have either remained silent or made undiplomatic statements which have grated on the ears of the more sophisticated population of Bangkok; the capital voted overwhelmingly for Mr Chamlong in the elections. Gen Suchinda dismissed his opponents as communists or Buddhist heretics. Mr Samak Sundaravej, deputy premier, responded to a question about the killing of anti-government protestors by saying: 'Let me ask you something. Why didn't anybody blame President George Bush when he sent troops to invade other countries?' And Mr Arthit Urairat, speaker of the lower house of parliament, drew an angry reaction from doctors and patients at a Bangkok hospital when he and other coalition MPs visited injured protesters and handed them tins of evaporated milk. Nor is it clear if Gen Suchinda is prepared to resign or if the coalition would then choose somebody acceptable to replace him. After the loss of so many lives, the demonstrators are determined to win at least a modest victory. They have warned that the protests will resume if their demands are not met by parliament, but government MPs apparently do not share the same sense of urgency. It was announced yesterday that although parliament would meet on Monday it would not consider constitutional amendments until Friday. 'I think it's going to be very jittery over the next few days,' said one western diplomat in Bangkok. Even if a compromise on the constitution can be reached, there is no sign of a solution to the much deeper problem of the military's long-standing involvement in politics and business. The generals have seen their freedom of action constrained in recent years by the growing confidence of civilian politicians. Thailand, however, did not resolve the issue of military interference when the king intervened to change the government after riots in 1973, and neither he nor anybody else is likely to do so now.</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Taylor Woodrow doubled to Pounds 22m Pre-tax profits of Taylor Woodrow more than doubled from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 22m during the first six months of this year, led by a sharp rise in house sales. Earnings per share increased from 1.3p to 3.5p, and the construction and property group is raising its interim dividend by 50 per cent from 0.5p to 0.75p. Its share price, however, fell 2p to 135p as construction and building material stocks continued to be depressed by Monday's UK interest rate rise. Mr Colin Parsons, chairman, said the increase would make it more difficult for housebuilders, but could help the economy as a whole if it encouraged low inflation. The rise in profits had been achieved in spite of a 17 per cent decline in turnover to Pounds 514m (Pounds 623m). The reduction reflected the group's refusal to take on construction contracts at unacceptable margins. Even so, UK contracting only just managed to break even in the first half, although construction world-wide moved from a Pounds 3.4m loss to a Pounds 1.8m profit, thanks to the Pounds 3.2m settlement of a claim for work on the Storebaelt link in Denmark. The profits improvement was led by housebuilding, which more than doubled from Pounds 3.9m to Pounds 9m, with Taywood Homes in the UK increasing its first half contribution by 50 per cent to Pounds 3m (Pounds 2m). UK housing profits overall remained unchanged at Pounds 3m because of the absence of apartment sales by the commercial property division, which contributed Pounds 1m in the first six months of 1993. Housing profits from the US, Canada and Australia also rose from Pounds 4m to Pounds 6m, after allowing for a Pounds 3.2m write-down last year in southern California. Property profits rose from Pounds 6.5m to Pounds 7.4m due to lower interest charges and in spite of a reduction in net rental resulting from previous disposals. Net borrowings fell by Pounds 25.3m to Pounds 90.8m reducing gearing to Pounds 16.9m. Interest payments as a result halved in the first half to Pounds 5.1m (Pounds 10.5). COMMENT Colin Parsons has done a good job in steadying the ship after Taylor Woodrow lost its way in the early 1990s. The balance sheet is in fine fettle while the group's conservative approach to contracting and housebuilding should stand it in good stead with interest rates starting climb again. Contracting, however, remains an unattractive business, particularly in the UK, where margins are likely to remain depressed in the short term. Housebuilding profits should recover further, but group profits of Pounds 48m this year and Pounds 60m next would put the shares on multiples of 18 and 14 respectively, which is dear enough given that the shares already have outperformed the market by about a 10th in the past 12 months.</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / International Company News: Ferfin opts for simplification - The Italian group still has many debts to clear What has been described as the largest out-of-court financial restructuring in corporate history is almost one year old. In October last year, Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the Italian financial holding company, and its industrial subsidiary Montedison proposed a radical programme of disposals, capital raising and debt-for-equity exchanges to sceptical bankers. The company had been brought close to collapse by alleged mismanagement, and was groaning under a burden of debt estimated at L30,000bn (Dollars 19.35bn). Although the threatened alternative was bankruptcy for Italy's second largest private industrial group, some foreign banks held out for better terms until the end of November, when the plan was finally agreed. Since then, Ferfin and Montedison, 30.5 per cent of which is owned by the financial holding company, have moved quickly to reduce debt and make the promised disposals. Yesterday, Mr Guido Rossi and Mr Enrico Bondi, who took over last year as, respectively, chairman and managing director of the two companies, expressed themselves satisfied with the progress of the plan at a shareholders' meeting called to simplify still further the sprawling structure of the group. But the Ferruzzi-Montedison group is still less than halfway towards the target of L7,000bn which it wants to raise from asset sales and debt transfers by the end of 1997. Although the group continues to work on restructuring all its subsidiaries, many of the most difficult disposals still have to be made. Asset sales have raised more than L2,300bn, in cash and debt transfers, with the disposal last week of Fermar, the group's shipbuilding subsidiary. In the first six months of this year, Ferfin cut its borrowings by nearly 30 per cent to L15,768bn. The sale of Fermar to fellow Italian shipbuilder Gruppo Coeclerici was the biggest disposal so far. Coeclerici is to buy Fermar for L225bn, of which L62.5bn plus interest will be paid in three years, and the disposal will reduce Ferfin's debt by a further L320bn. The group has disposed of its stakes in other quoted companies, including Gemina, the insurance company, Mediobanca, the merchant bank which masterminded the rescue plan, and Parmalat, the foods group. It has also sold or closed many small trading and agro-foods subsidiaries, disposed of substantial property interests, and even auctioned off paintings, furniture and ornaments bought by the previous management. Ferfin wants to slim until it controls only its 30 per cent stake in Montedison, which is active in the energy, chemicals and agro-industrial sectors, and its 34 per cent direct and indirect investment in Fondiaria, the insurance company. Mr Bondi said yesterday that the disposal programme was on schedule, and that prices were in line with internal forecasts 'down to the last lira'. This is heartening news for a company which last year - under previous management - had to admit that it had discovered a L435bn hole in its 1992 accounts, triggering a series of judicial and financial investigations which are continuing. The test will come with the larger disposals which lie ahead. For example, Ferfin still controls a majority stake in Calcestruzzi, the quoted concrete and building materials group, which has been hard hit by the downturn in the Italian construction and public works sector. Mr Giampiero Pesenti, who heads Italcementi, Italy's biggest cement group, may want to increase his own minority interest in Calcestruzzi, but such a move would raise anti-trust problems and risk prompting a full bid for the concrete group. Ferfin also controls holdings which reflect the interests of its discredited founder, Mr Raul Gardini, who killed himself last year, and Mr Carlo Sama, the former managing director. Ferfin and Montedison undoubtedly hope that creditors - now among their largest shareholders following the conversion of debt into equity last year  -will not put undue pressure on the group to accelerate the programme, a move which might sacrifice the benefits already achieved. At least the signs are encouraging. Yesterday, Montedison shareholders heard that the group had consolidated the last L345bn of its debt at favourable rates, which will save the company a further L18bn of financial charges every year, and voted in favour of absorbing Finanziaria Agroindustriale, the quoted vehicle for shares in Eridania Beghin-Say, Montedison's agroindustrial subsidiary.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                  FERRUZZI FINANZIARIA AND MONTEDISON                  PRINCIPAL ASSETS - SOLD OR FOR SALE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Alerion Bank (banking, US)            sold July 1993, Dollars 47m** Nikols (insurance broking)            sold June 1994, price unspecified Fermar (shipbuilding)                 sold October 1994, L225bn Calcestruzzi (concrete)* Trenno (property)* Il Messaggero (newspaper) Telemontecarlo (television) IMH (marine equipment) Intermarine (shipbuilding) Tencara (advanced materials)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *  Indicates quoted companies ** Alerion Bank was sold before the formal restructuring programme was    agreed in November 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

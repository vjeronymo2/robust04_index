			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> COUNTY LOSES WHEN MATCHING TRANSIT FUNDS ARE DOLED OUT  </P> <P> The voice on the telephone line from Sacramento sounded ominous.  </P> <P> "You Orange County guys are dead meat," he said. "Why should we help you if you  won't help yourself?"  </P> <P> I cranked up the charm. I talked about the great things going on in Orange  County transportation. Developer fees are building new corridors. Moves toward  unifying transportation agencies seem to be successful. We're creative. We're  innovative. At the Orange County Transportation Commission, we are helping the  state Department of Transportation by using private consultants to design and  environmentally clear freeway projects.  </P> <P> It sounded great, but it wasn't selling. Charm gets shopworn pretty fast when  other guys are putting money on the table.  </P> <P> And, in this case, the other guys are putting local transportation dollars on  the table and turning locally generated funds into transportation partnerships  with state and federal government.  </P> <P> In California and throughout the United States, the concept of partnerships  where the federal, state and local governments -- and sometimes the private  sector -- pool resources to build major infrastructure improvements, is gaining  momentum.  </P> <P> In some cases, the state government and the federal government require  dollar-for-dollar "matches," that is, for every local dollar raised, the state  and federal government will each add a dollar to this special partnership.  </P> <P> Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner is promoting these partnerships  in his National Transportation Policy. State propositions 108, 111 and 116, the  transportation measures approved Tuesday, are built on the concept of the feds,  the state and local government sharing responsibility to build roads, freeways,  and rail systems.  </P> <P> It's a concept built on solid logic. It requires government agencies to work  together harmoniously. It's widely accepted.  </P> <P> It's killing us.  </P> <P> It is killing us because we don't have the resources to pool with other levels  of government.  </P> <P> In every urban county in California, voters have approved a local option,  half-cent transportation sales tax. Of the 10 largest counties in California,  nine have adopted these locally approved sources of local transportation  revenue.  </P> <P> The lone holdout is Orange County.  </P> <P> Today, we're ringed by counties that have approved these transportation  measures. And that means we're surrounded by counties that have a competitive  advantage in the annual hunt for transportation dollars.  </P> <P> Orange County will continue to receive a return on the gas taxes approved on  Tuesday. We'll see that the state keeps its promises to improve the Santa Ana  Freeway through Santa Ana and Anaheim.  </P> <P> But we probably will leave rail money on the table because we won't be able to  match it. We may lose up to $75 million in the first three years, although  we'll be trying some fast footwork to try to bring as many of those dollars to  Orange County as possible.  </P> <P> But the haunting refrain of the voice on the telephone, "Why should we help you  if you won't help yourself?" will keep us on the edge of gridlock in this  county in the future.  </P> <P> There may be other ramifications. TRW Real Estate Information Services recently  reported the first drop in the price of Orange County homes in five years. For  the first time since 1985, the average home prices haven't been appreciating  here.  </P> <P> In neighboring counties, TRW tells us, the average cost of homes is increasing:  The average price is up more than 10% in Riverside, almost 10% in San Diego,  almost 6% in Los Angeles. Is there a correlation between investment in  transportation infrastructure and the quality of life? How about transportation  investment and the value of your home?  </P> <P> Tough questions.  </P> <P> Academic debates on cause and effect can rage for years without resolution.  Drawing a parallel between what happens with an individual homeowner's  investment and regional infrastructure is a dangerous comparison for anyone to  take.  </P> <P> But clearly, in the last year, property values have increased in neighboring  counties where people have invested in transportation and they've decreased in  the county where no investment has been made. There may be no connection in  these fact patterns. Then again, there may be.  </P> <P> The debate on the effect that infrastructure has on our quality of life -- and,  inevitably, on the investment we have in our homes -- is one which does not  have an easy answer.  </P> <P> Other issues are much clearer. We're confident that the Measure M package that  was defeated last November was a strong technical program. It balanced  freeways, highways, streets, roads and rail transit with a strong  growth-management program.  </P> <P> It called for safeguards to guarantee that any new transportation revenue goes  only for transportation purposes. It also included a special Citizens Oversight  Committee to act as a watchdog over public funds.  </P> <P> The measure was crafted over a two-year period and involved hundreds of people,  special task forces of city and county officials, an energetic Citizens  Committee, seven public workshops and countywide public-opinion polling.  </P> <P> The results of the technical work and the public outreach efforts were  striking: The professional engineers and the citizens of Orange County came up  with almost identical traffic solutions. They agreed on what should be done and  how to do it.  </P> <P> OK: If the plan was so good, why did voters reject it by a 53% to 47% margin?  </P> <P> Two reasons: first, low voter turnout. Only about 250,000 voters went to the  polls in November, 1989. That means 880,000 people who were eligible to vote  stayed home. According to the political pros, the people who did not turn out  were the ones who were most likely to agree to a transportation sales tax.  </P> <P> The second reason? No one wants to pay more taxes. Everyone hopes there is  another solution. They hope the developers will pay. Or the state government.  Or the federal government. Or someone else. Anyone else.  </P> <P> But the reality is that no one else will bail Orange County out. The other  counties have stepped up to the plate and agreed to tax themselves. Developer  fees in Orange County are among the highest in the nation.  </P> <P> And when we look to Sacramento or Washington, we're hearing that same old song:  "Why should we help you if you won't help yourself?"  </P> <P> Southern California Sales Tax Rates  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES COUNTY : 6 3/4%  </P> <P> SAN BERNARDIO COUNTY: 6 3/4%  </P> <P> RIVERSIDE COUNTY: 6 3/4%  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY: 6 3/4%  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY: 6 1/4%  </P> <P> Southern California Housing Prices  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES COUNTY : up 5.9%  </P> <P> SAN BERNARDIO COUNTY: up 8.1%  </P> <P> RIVERSIDE COUNTY: up 10.4%  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY: up 9.6%  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY: down 2%  </P></p>

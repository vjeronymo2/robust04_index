			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VISA TIGHTENS RULES ON CREDIT CARD ISSUANCE  </P> <P> Following the wild success of AT&amp;T's Universal credit card, Visa U.S.A.  said Tuesday that it changed regulations for non-bank members seeking access to  its profitable credit card system.  </P> <P> A Visa official denied that the changes, effective immediately and possibly  retroactive, were in response to the Universal card's popularity.  </P> <P> Bank members have objected strenuously to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph  Co.'s presence in the profitable Visa and Mastercard credit card systems,  charging that the powerful telephone giant was stealing business from bank  credit cards.  </P> <P> In the past, banks welcomed non-bank members to issue Visas and Mastercards,  believing that it put more of the credit cards into people's wallets and it  helped gain even more acceptance among merchants.  </P> <P> But banks have said AT&amp;T is not like the typical non-bank credit card  issuer, such as charitable and educational institutions, that issue "affinity"  cards. Affinity cards let non-member organizations partner with member banks  and participate in a credit-card program.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, Visa sought to restrict how non-banks can issue Visa cards.  </P> <P> Under the new rules, affinity cards cannot be used to access any account other  than one maintained by a Visa card-issuing financial institution; affinity  programs must honor all Visa cards, not just its own; and non-members are  prohibited from financing more than 25% of their receivables from the credit  card programs.  </P> <P> Officials at a local Mastercard office in Los Angeles could not be reached for  comment as to whether they would be making similar rule changes.  </P> <P> AT&amp;T said Visa's rule changes would not affect its Universal card  operations. "Our reaction is that the rule changes by Visa have absolutely no  impact on AT&amp;T's Universal card program," Bruce Reid, an AT&amp;T spokesman  said.  </P> <P> As of Sept. 30, AT&amp;T, which issues its Universal card through Universal  Bank of Columbus, Ga., said it had opened 3.1 million accounts.  </P></p>

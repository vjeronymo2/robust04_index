			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JAGUAR DISCUSSING PACT WITH GM, POSSIBLE SALE OF MINORITY STAKE  </P> <P> Jaguar PLC, British luxury auto maker, said today it is holding talks with  General Motors Corp. about a possible cooperative operating agreement.  </P> <P> Jaguar said that General Motors is considering buying a minority stake in  Jaguar as part of such an agreement.  </P> <P> The news confirmed the expected tug-of-war between GM and Ford Motor Co. over  Jaguar.  </P> <P> The announcement was made after London's Stock Exchange closed. Jaguar finished  at $10.82 a share, down 73 cents. Trading has been very heavy since Friday,  when Ford, which previously owned 1% of Jaguar, received U.S. regulatory  clearance to buy up to 15%.  </P> <P> Ford announced Sept. 19 that it wanted to buy up to 15% of Jaguar and left open  the option of making a full bid for the British company.  </P> <P> Jaguar characterized Ford's stake-buying as unwelcome and said it wants to  remain independent. However, money-losing Jaguar also has said it might be  interested in building ties with a major auto company.  </P> <P> Jaguar was widely believed to be holding talks with General Motors.  </P> <P> Jaguar's rules of association prohibit any shareholder from taking more than a  15% stake before the end of 1990 and give the British government a "golden"  share with which it may block any bid for the formerly state-owned company.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "Chinese Economic News" Column: "Trading in </F> State-Owned Enterprises' Property Rights Temporarily Suspended"]    [Text] The State Council General Office yesterday issued a  circular on strengthening control over transactions in state  enterprises' property rights.    As required by the circular, the market for these  enterprises' property rights must be closed, and the operation  of institutes engaged in this type of transactions must be  temporarily suspended. The department concerned under the State  Council will work out regulations on trading in state  enterprises' property rights as soon as possible in order to  standardize and legalize control over state enterprises'  property rights transactions and the proceeds derived therefrom.    The circular stressed that provincial, autonomous regional,  and municipal people's governments must apply to the State  Council for approval before they can engage in transactions in  state enterprises' property rights. The government, which has  not gone through the above procedure, must immediately suspend  existing transactions and apply for permission. The people's  government at the prefectural city level and below shall not  engage in transactions in state enterprises' property rights.    State enterprises are owned by the state. The transfer of  the property rights of state enterprises controlled by local  governments must be approved by the people's government at the  prefectural city level and above. The State Council department  concerned must apply to the State Council for approval before  the property rights of state enterprises controlled by the  central government can be transferred. The State Council's  approval must be obtained before the property rights of  exceptionally large or large state-owned enterprises (including  those controlled by local governments) can be transferred.    According to the circular, before the property rights of the  state-owned enterprise are transferred, the enterprise's assets,  including the relevant land-use rights, must be assessed in  accordance with the "Regulations on Assessing State-Owned  Assets." The property rights must be transferred in accordance  with the state's relevant regulations, and, after the transfer,  the parties concerned must register with the proper authorities.  The proceeds derived from transferring state enterprise  property rights must first be used to pay off bank loans and  make proper arrangements for the workers and must then be used  by the people's government at the same level to support  structural adjustment or to inject capital into the enterprise,  which needs to be supported, instead of using the funds to cover  running expenses or deficits, pay wages, or award prizes. The  department managing state-owned assets must strengthen the  supervision over the use of proceeds from transferring state-  owned enterprise property rights. It is strictly forbidden to  convert the property rights of state enterprises into shares, to  sell them at low prices, to give them away to individuals  without compensation, or to transfer the property rights and  interests of state-owned enterprises on credit. Such mistakes  must be corrected. Specific measures must be taken to properly  solve problems concerning the workers' employment and social  security in transferring the property rights of state  enterprises.</p>

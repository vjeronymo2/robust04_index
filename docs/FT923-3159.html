			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / MMC to hear of clustered private medical fees INFORMATION to be submitted to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry on private medical fees shows evidence that doctors' charges cluster very closely around the guideline rates published by the British Medical Association. An analysis conducted for the Financial Times by Private Patients Plan Group (PPP), the UK's second-largest private medical insurer, shows relatively little variation in bills submitted to the company for the same treatment from doctors around the country. Last Tuesday the MMC announced that it would investigate the process by which specialists calculated fees for private patients. It wants to determine whether there is - voluntarily or involuntarily - a monopoly being operated between doctors and the BMA. The BMA first issued a set of guidelines to its members in 1989, which showed the average rates charged for a series of medical procedures and anaesthetics. The latest version, published this month, lists rates for more than 1,500 treatments. It emphasises that the rates are not 'recommended' levels but simply advisory information that should help doctors determine their own rates in discussion with patients. The PPP analysis - using claims between April 1 and September 9 this year - shows a wide range between the highest and lowest charges for any type of treatment. However, the vast majority of bills are concentrated in a small central range around the levels in the BMA guidelines. Mr Roy Forman, PPP chief executive, has opposed the idea of a BMA schedule since it was originated in the 1980s. He welcomed the MMC inquiry, and argued that since 1989 doctors' fees had risen and increasingly clustered around the rates published by the BMA. A separate analysis by the company shows that the increase in claims among all private health insurers between 1990 and last year has been more than twice the rate of inflation. More than 84 per cent of the increase was due to a rise in the value of claims, with a small increase in the number of claims and a slight decline in the number of subscribers to private health care plans. PPP will be submitting further details of the medical bills it receives to the MMC.</p>

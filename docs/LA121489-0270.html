			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SPECTRUM BROADENS AMONG ELITE TEAM'S REPRESENTATIVES;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: PERENNIAL POWERS DOMINATE SELECTIONS, BUT, IN BIRMINGHAM, GRANT AND  VAN NUYS, THEY HAVE COMPANY FROM SCHOOLS IN UNFAMILIAR TERRITORY.  </P> <P> At first glance, The Times' 1989 All-Valley high school football team follows a  pattern. The area's traditionally strong teams again dominate the selections.  </P> <P> Granada Hills High, the only Valley school to win a City Section 4-A Division  championship since 1975, placed three players on the first team along with  Notre Dame, one of the area's oldest private schools. And Canyon and Hart,  perennial Southern Section powers, each placed two. In addition, Kennedy had  two selections on the 23-player first team.  </P> <P> But a closer look reveals a subtle shift in power to previously weaker  programs. For the first time in five years, City 3-A schools Birmingham, Grant  and Van Nuys are represented on the first team, a reflection of their  surprising success.  </P> <P> In addition, Montclair Prep, which plays in Division IX, the lowest level of  competition among Southern Section teams, was represented for the first time  since 1985 when Rich Swinton, who now plays at Washington State, was a  first-team selection.  </P> <P> Mountie running back Derek Sparks, the area's leading rusher with 1,944 yards,  is joined on the team by Birmingham quarterback-defensive back Danny Larson,  Grant quarterback-defensive back Marlowe Lewis and Van Nuys lineman Edvin  Babayova.  </P> <P> Babayova and Lewis led their teams to league titles; Babayova earned a share of  the Mid-Valley League MVP and Lewis claimed co-MVP honors in the East Valley.  Babayova, a dominant lineman on both sides of the ball, symbolized the Van Nuys  season, leading a team with no skill-position stars to a 5-2 league record (5-5  overall).  </P> <P> Grant was the surprise team of the area. The Lancers started the season with  seven consecutive wins, including a stunning 40-13 victory over traditional  power Reseda, and finished with a 9-2 mark.  </P> <P> Birmingham rekindled memories of its glory years in the 1970s with a  respectable 5-3-1 record, and Larson led Valley City passers with 1,445 yards.  </P> <P> The team comprises 16 seniors and seven juniors. Canyon tailback Chris Peery is  the only repeat selection, but he skipped a year.  </P> <P> Peery was an All-Valley selection two seasons ago when he also was named state  sophomore player of the year by Cal-Hi Sports.  </P> <P> First-team players and their coaches and parents are invited to The Times'  football awards brunch, scheduled for 9 a.m. Sunday at the Anaheim Hilton. The  winners of awards for coach of the year, back of the year and lineman of the  year will be announced.  </P> <P> * ALL-VALLEY CAPSULES: C18  </P> <P> * SECOND-TEAM CHART: C18  </P> <P> * GLENDALE, VENTURA TEAMS: Part J of regional editions  </P> <P> </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL ALL-STARS 1989  </P> <P> </P> <P> OFFENSE  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Clint Beauer  </P> <P> Position: Receiver  </P> <P> School: Canyon  </P> <P> Height: 6-3  </P> <P> Weight: 195  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Howard Blackwell  </P> <P> Position: Receiver  </P> <P> School: Hart  </P> <P> Height: 5-10  </P> <P> Weight: 170  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Christian Fauria  </P> <P> Position: Tight End  </P> <P> School: Crespi  </P> <P> Height: 6-4  </P> <P> Weight: 205  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Edvin Babayova  </P> <P> Position: Lineman  </P> <P> School: Van Nuys  </P> <P> Height: 6-3  </P> <P> Weight: 225  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Tim DeGroote  </P> <P> Position: Lineman  </P> <P> School: Hart  </P> <P> Height: 6-3  </P> <P> Weight: 245  </P> <P> Year: Junior  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: John DiSante  </P> <P> Position: Lineman  </P> <P> School: Notre Dame  </P> <P> Height: 6-4  </P> <P> Weight: 250  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: John Jones  </P> <P> Position: Lineman  </P> <P> School: Kennedy  </P> <P> Height: 6-2  </P> <P> Weight: 280  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Ontlwaun Carter  </P> <P> Position: Back  </P> <P> School: Kennedy  </P> <P> Height: 5-11  </P> <P> Weight: 174  </P> <P> Year: Junior  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Chris Peery  </P> <P> Position: Back  </P> <P> School: Canyon  </P> <P> Height: 6-1  </P> <P> Weight: 215  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Joey Rosselli  </P> <P> Position: Back  </P> <P> School: Alemany  </P> <P> Height: 6-1  </P> <P> Weight: 180  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Derek Sparks  </P> <P> Position: Back  </P> <P> School: Montclair Prep  </P> <P> Height: 6-0  </P> <P> Weight: 212  </P> <P> Year: Junior  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Frank Diana  </P> <P> Position: Kicker  </P> <P> School: Cleveland  </P> <P> Height: 5-11  </P> <P> Weight: 200  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> </P> <P> DEFENSE  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Gregory Bernard  </P> <P> Position: Lineman  </P> <P> School: Taft  </P> <P> Height: 5-11  </P> <P> Weight: 225  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Owen Taylor  </P> <P> Position: Lineman  </P> <P> School: Notre Dame  </P> <P> Height: 6-2  </P> <P> Weight: 255  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Jamal Anderson  </P> <P> Position: Linebacker  </P> <P> School: El Camino Real  </P> <P> Height: 5-11  </P> <P> Weight: 205  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Vincent Hall  </P> <P> Position: Linebacker  </P> <P> School: San Fernando  </P> <P> Height: 5-10  </P> <P> Weight: 192  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Brett Washington  </P> <P> Position: Linebacker  </P> <P> School: Granada Hills  </P> <P> Height: 6-0  </P> <P> Weight: 215  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Jerome Casey  </P> <P> Position: Back  </P> <P> School: Sylmar  </P> <P> Height: 5-10  </P> <P> Weight: 180  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Leon Glasgow  </P> <P> Position: Back  </P> <P> School: Granada Hills  </P> <P> Height: 5-9  </P> <P> Weight: 180  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Danny Larson  </P> <P> Position: Back  </P> <P> School: Birmingham  </P> <P> Height: 6-2  </P> <P> Weight: 185  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Marlowe Lewis  </P> <P> Position: Back  </P> <P> School: Grant  </P> <P> Height: 5-10  </P> <P> Weight: 165  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Errol Small  </P> <P> Position: Back  </P> <P> School: Notre Dame  </P> <P> Height: 6-2  </P> <P> Weight: 210  </P> <P> Year: Senior  </P> <P> </P> <P> Name: Derrick Stewart  </P> <P> Position: Back  </P> <P> School: Granada Hills  </P> <P> Height: 5-11  </P> <P> Weight: 185  </P> <P> Year: Junior  </P></p>

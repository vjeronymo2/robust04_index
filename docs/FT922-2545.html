			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Observer: Telling friends Offers are already landing on Slobodan Milosevic's desk just in case the Serbian president could be persuaded to step down. US congresswoman Helen Bentley saw the president in Belgrade recently and suggested he could become head of a US-Belgrade bank. He could perhaps even move to the US if he was getting a bit fed up with his policies which led to war in Croatia, and later in Bosnia. The president, we hear, has refused. But stranger things have happened. After all, back in the early 1980s, Milosevic ran Beobanka, the Belgrade bank, and had lots of friends in the US, including deputy secretary of state, Lawrence Eagleburger, and Brent Scowcroft. Both, incidentally, served time in the US embassy in Belgrade. Maybe that helps explain why the US was slow to come down hard on Milosevic.</p>

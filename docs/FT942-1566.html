			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Italy to import more Algerian gas Italy has signed a new gas deal with Algeria, committing Snam, the gas supply subsidiary of ENI, the Italian state oil concern, to buy 2bn cubic metres of liquefied natural gas a year from 1996 from Sonatrach, the Algerian state oil company. Algeria already accounts for about 40 per cent of Italy's gas supplies. The latest contract will bring to 26bn cu m the annual imports as of 1996, when the second leg of the Tunis-Sicily Trans-Mediterranean pipeline becomes operational. Coming at a time of increasing political uncertainty in Algeria, the contract is seen as evidence of Italy's strategic choice of this North African supplier. The LNGs will be transported from Skikda in Algeria to Panigaglia near La Spezia. By 1996 21.5bn cu m of gas a year will be contracted through Snam while an additional 4bn cu m is being bought directly by Enel, the Italian state electricity authority, but transported by Snam.</p>

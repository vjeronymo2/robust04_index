			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Saudi austerity hits arms deal Saudi Arabia has asked the US to reschedule Saudi payments on around Dollars 30bn of military equipment purchases because of the impact of declining oil revenues on its budget, US defence officials said yesterday. A Pentagon spokesman said Prince Bandar bin Sultan, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the US, had met US officials in charge of foreign military sales, as well as top executives from defence contractors, including General Dynamics, McDonnell Douglas and Hughes Aircraft, to discuss the kingdom's financial plight. 'We understand the financial issues facing Saudi Arabia. We believe they are manageable and will continue to work toward a resolution on the restructuring of the programme,' the Pentagon said. 'Programme adjustments will focus on the timing of production and deliveries of major programme items.' With government revenues under pressure from weaker crude oil prices, Saudi Arabia announced last weekend it would cut spending this year by 20 per cent in order to curb its persistent budget deficit. Saudi Arabia's military shopping list includes McDonnell's F-15 fighter, General Dynamics' Abrams tank and Raytheon's Patriot missile defence system.</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / The Queen's Speech: European bill to be given top priority - Parliamentary timetable The government plans to confront its critics - both internal and external - over the next few weeks by giving parliamentary priority to its European finance and Jobseeker's Allowance bills. Senior ministers said the two bills would be introduced quickly in the Commons, with a third controversial bill to remove a layer of administration from the National Health Service. The European bill, which will increase UK contributions to the European Union, will provide the main battleground between the parties, not least because of the government's threat to call a general election if it is amended or defeated. The bill on the Jobseeker's Allowance, which replaces unemployment benefit, will face tough opposition from the Labour party, which says that it will strip 90,000 people of benefits and force means testing on a further 150,000. The NHS proposals are also guaranteed a stormy passage through parliament because of strong Labour opposition to the prospect of substantial job losses and claims that the reforms will damage patient care. Much of the remainder of the government's programme will be given a fair wind by the opposition parties, including the bills to reform discipline in the medical profession and set up a review body to investigate miscarriages of justice. The parliamentary business managers have chosen to start two uncontroversial bills - reforming agricultural land tenure and the Scottish criminal justice system - in the Lords, where a series of important bills were mauled in the last session. The government has yet to work out a timetable for other bills which are likely to prompt criticism from MPs and peers of all parties. These include: A hybrid bill to authorise the construction of a high-speed rail link from London to the Channel tunnel, which will allow opponents of the scheme from Kent and east London to petition parliament. A bill to tackle discrimination against the disabled. The bill is unlikely to satisfy campaigners, who are still angry about the way that Conservative whips killed a more comprehensive private member's bill in the summer. Many Conservative MPs and peers were privately sympathetic to the earlier bill, and the opposition parties may attempt to embarrass the government by tabling a second private bill, possibly in the Lords.</p>

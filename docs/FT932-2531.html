			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Clarke stresses strategy to boost investment MEASURES to stimulate investment are likely to feature in the November Budget, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, indicated in the Commons as Tory MPs hailed the good set of economic figures announced yesterday. Tory backbenchers were heartened by a confident performance by the chancellor, who told Labour critics that they were facing a 'business-friendly' government which would take specific measures to sustain British industry and commerce. Mr John Major, the prime minister, provided another boost for Tory morale by highlighting the significance of the earlier announcement that the jobless total had fallen for the fourth successive month. To government cheers, he said it was 'good news for the unemployed, good news for the economy and good news for Britain'. Mr Major's robust performance heartened Conservative MPs after a traumatic few weeks for the government. But most recognised that difficult months lay ahead, particularly as ministers thrash out public spending decisions. Mr Clarke, in his first appearance dealing with Treasury questions, was taunted by Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, over his reliance on words rather than action since taking over from Mr Norman Lamont a fortnight ago. The chancellor said he was working closely with Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, and envisaged that his next 'major contribution' would be in the November Budget. In response to challenges from the Labour benches, Mr Clarke said business investment was low because the economy was just emerging from recession and in the early stages of recovery. But he recalled the success achieved in manufacturing and business investment in the three years to 1989 and stressed 'obviously I will be considering measures which will sustain that good record once recovery gets under way'. Acknowledging that there was also 'a balance of payments problem', Mr Clarke welcomed the improving export performance, particularly in non-European Community markets where demand had not been depressed to the same extent. The government, he said, would do everything possible, through the Treasury and the Department of Trade and Industry, to support manufacturers in their efforts to export. Mr Clarke hoped forecasters would take encouragement from the growth in gross domestic product, the growth in manufacturing output, and the announcement that unemployment figures had fallen for the fourth successive month. Mr David Willetts (C Havant) said it would be a remarkable achievement if Britain could secure an economic growth rate higher than the rate of inflation. Agreeing, Mr Clarke emphasised: 'It is important firstly to make sure that does happen in so far as it is within the government's power to do so, and to make sure that this time we sustain it'. Mr Alan Beith, Treasury spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, reminded the chancellor of Mr Lamont's condemnation of interest rate cuts made to offset some unfavourable political event. Mr Clarke said such decisions should be taken on the best objective advice and for good economic reasons, and he promised he would persevere with this approach.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Paisley flooding costs put at Pounds 50m The cost to insurers of floods in Paisley, near Glasgow, and surrounding areas may exceed Pounds 50m, according to estimates yesterday by Balcombe, the loss assessment group. Mr Nicholas Balcombe, chief executive, said it was too early to predict accurately the cost of claims but preliminary investigations by his company indicated substantial damage to commercial property in the region, as well as to housing. However, the Association of British Insurers said it was not yet possible even to guess the cost of claims.</p>

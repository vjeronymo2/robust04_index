			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SILENCE ON BIGOTRY  </P> <P> John Boudreau's Aug. 12 article on "God's Country," a play about neo-Nazism,  reflects the consequences of change in an America that has been too white, too  greedy and too blind to its own weaknesses -- one of which is the belief that  being white, and American, is somehow "special."  </P> <P> The play will make a difference for a good minute! Most of the audiences will  continue to be part of one of the country's biggest weaknesses -- that group  known as the Silent Majority.  </P> <P> ROSEMARY C. WATSON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

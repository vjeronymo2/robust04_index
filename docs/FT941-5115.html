			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Hartons losses reduced to Pounds 4.52m in depressed market conditions Hartons Group, the Sheffield-based distributor of semi-finished plastics, yesterday reported a Pounds 1.73m reduction in pre-tax losses to Pounds 4.52m for the year to December 31. Mr Charles Lenox-Conyngham, chairman, said 'considerable strides' had been made to resolve the main areas of concern at a time when markets remained depressed by the recession. He said the 1993 deficit was mainly because of poor performances in France and Spain where attributable losses amounted to Pounds 3.57m and Pounds 605,000 respectively. In the UK, trading activities produced higher profits. In the Benelux countries, a profit was achieved in the second half after a weak start to the year. Turnover of continuing operations totalled Pounds 47m (Pounds 51.3m), generating operating profits of Pounds 548,000 (Pounds 544,000). Losses per share were cut from 8.5p to 5.9p. The preference dividend has again been deferred. Hartons will concentrate all of its resources on the development of its distribution businesses in the UK and the Benelux countries following the sale of its French subsidiary. Completion is expected this month. The group continued to generate cash and reduce borrowings throughout 1993. The sale of the French offshoot will improve the position further, leaving bank borrowings at about Pounds 7.5m against Pounds 13.1m at the beginning of 1993. Noting a recent rise in the share price the directors said proposals were being considered which might or might not lead to a substantial acquisition.</p>

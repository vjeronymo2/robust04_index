			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Letter: Flexibility the key to pensions Sir, Mr Roger Lyons (Letters, April 22) is reading my predecessor's letter too narrowly. The National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF) is keen that equality in occupational pensions should be achieved as soon as possible, but it is the compulsory aspect, applied retrospectively, that is both impractical and expensive. Certainly some schemes have surpluses, but the majority do not. For many employers the cost would be prohibitive. The NAPF is not advocating any particular age for equal pensions. That must be for employers to decide in consultation with their employees. We do, however, call on the government to facilitate equality by providing some flexibility in state pension ages. Occupational pension schemes have a very good history of improving benefits to meet changing social needs. Given that it is accepted that equal benefits have to be provided for periods of service after May 17 1990, I have little doubt that improvements to past service entitlements will be made on a voluntary and planned basis within an acceptable timescale. Brian MacMahon, chairman, National Association of Pension Funds, 12-18 Grosvenor Gardens, SW1</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At a news conference today, Corneliu Coposu,  chairman of the National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party  [PNTCD], discussed the results of his recent tour through a  number of European countries. Coposu said that, generally  speaking, Romania enjoys the sympathy of the West, but there is  also some reticence, which Coposu termed as a tendency to set up  a left-wing government and reestablish communism in Romania. As  a consequence of this, Coposu stressed that the West might  reconsider its position regarding Romania's final acceptance as  a full member of the Council of Europe.    Coposu also said that during his tour, he paid a visit to  Versoix [Switzerland, residence of Romanian King], where he met  with the former sovereign of Romania, after which he emphasized  that the king does not intend to apply for an entry visa for  Easter or 10 May [Romania's national day during the monarchy],  although he did express his wish to visit Romania as soon as  possible, reports our correspondent Iulia Gherman.</p>

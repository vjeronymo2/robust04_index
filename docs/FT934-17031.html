			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Travel: Anguilla, where life's just a beach - James Henderson finds himself lost for words on a made-for-sybarites Caribbean island AFTER YEARS of looking at Caribbean beaches I have come to the conclusion that there are only a number of ways of describing them. Silken soft sand washed by gin-clear water. Lazy waves lapping on an idyllic half-moon curve. The sun-bleached sugar granules of a palm-backed strand. Etc. Etc. The Caribbean has suffered pretty badly from the attentions of over-zealous brochure writers anyway, but describing Caribbean beaches sends these poor people into overdrive. When faced with a blank, glossy page, they become linguistic thugs, wielding cliches like bludgeons and beating every word senseless. By this reasoning the island of Anguilla, which is not much more than beach, almost defies description, particularly if you are trying to avoid a brush with cliche. The island's 40-mile coastline has about 30 beaches. The sand is superb and the sea absurdly blue. And on most of them you can be alone. If beaches are your thing, Anguilla comes close to the proverbial paradise. I reached Anguilla late in the day, but with time enough to throw down my bags and skip out on to Mead's Bay, a mile-long curve of west-facing sand. Laid out beneath the Malliouhana Hotel, Mead's Bay seems an ideal Caribbean beach. It is so soft underfoot that your feet slip in up to your ankles and when the waves break they meander, fizzing with spume and carving huge scallop shapes on the sand. Digging my toes into the warm grains, I watched the setting sun play tricks on the huge clouds. People must have been staring at the sunset from here for centuries. Next morning I set out in search of Anguilla's finest beach. Shoal Bay, on the north coast, is probably the island's most popular - more than a mile of mounded crystalline sand with the quality of talcum powder. Hitching around the island presents no difficulty. Anguilla is the sort of place where the chief minister stops and picks you up. On this occasion, though, it was Vic, another island luminary, the proprietor of a beach bar (Trader Vic's) on Shoal Bay itself, so he took me there and handed me a beer. Shoal is an old word for a reef: the bay has a double reef system right offshore, which makes for superb snorkelling. As for snorkelling gear, Skyline Beach Rentals had it all: Shady Beach Umbrellas, Beautiful Lounge Chairs, Elegant Floating Rafts, Long Fluffy Towels and - just for me - Reliable Snorkelling Gear. I spent a happy half-hour chasing damsels and rock beauties in and out of the corals and stalking sergeant majors and grunts among the elkhorn. At times, Anguilla has something of a '30 square miles and a donkey' feel about it. If this patch of scrub happened to be in the Arizona desert - parts of it would not look too out of place - there would be a single donkey and no other discernible characteristics to differentiate it from the land around. Instead it is a nation, with its own distinctive identity. The island is more developed now than your average patch of Arizona scrub, but for all the steady building, the feel of Anguilla remains the same. And the strongest impression of island life comes from the Anguillians themselves, who are without doubt the coolest islanders in the whole Caribbean. There is an almost unnatural calm about the place. Here the statutory West Indian greeting (saying hello to everyone you pass) becomes a barely raised hand, a hint of a nod or a whispered 'yeah man'. I was trying to find Back Bay (any beach you have to abseil to must be worth a look), when I fell in with an Anguillian who took me half-a-mile out of his way and pointed me to the path through the scrub down to the beach. It was rather like a treasure hunt: through the bushes and over sunburnt rock you come to a point high above the sea. Three pelicans were riding the upward winds on the cliff-face, wheeling and folding their wings back arrow-like in a dive for lunch. Beneath them was Back Bay, a tiny sun-trap in a protected cove with blinding white sand and gentle waves. To get to the beach you clamber down the cliff with the aid of ropes fastened into the rockface. Faced with a cool island, the Foreign Office in London has been unwarrantably hip and has sent along a dead cool governor. He is a keen cyclist and rides around the island to shouted greetings of 'Hey, Government'. Somnolence is a word that fits Anguilla well, though it is difficult to gauge how fierce competition might be between two beach bars that face each other across the bay in the fishing village of Island Harbour. Gorgeous Scilly Cay is the offshore domain of Eudoxie Wallace, a former stateside tennis pro, who has decorated his sandbar with conch-shell walls and palm-thatch shelters. If you wave from the pier, they will come and pick you up and you can spend the afternoon eating barbecued lobster, drowning yourself in rum punch and soaking in the sea. On the beach opposite, Smitty's is a ramshackle island affair, a sandy, palm-thatch garden with discarded cable-barrels as tables and outsize pink buoys for decoration. I joined a small crowd of Anguillians watching MTV and mulling over island gossip. After a few beers I began to think I was hearing things. The normal noises of West Indian English had dissolved and the words were sounding curiously Irish. This happens in other places in the Caribbean: they seem to speak Welsh in parts of Trinidad, and if you close your eyes in Barbados you might almost be in the west of England. The Anguillians do have a lot of Irish blood in them. Looking around, it seems that there is not much that could ruffle an Anguillian's calm. But then it is worth remembering that in 1967 these people staged one of the world's least known (and coolest) revolutions. The Anguillians were threatened with independence from Britain as the poor relation of St Kitts and Nevis (nearby islands), and so they revolted - all 5,000 - arming themselves and taking to the scrub. Britain dispatched troops, who were bemused to find themselves greeted by islanders waving Union Jacks and singing God Save the Queen. Nobody could quite believe it, but eventually the Anguillians had their way, confounding colonial administrative convenience. They remain a British crown colony. On the south coast there is a cracking two-mile stretch of pristine sand, glaringly bright and offset by an electric blue sea, on Rendezvous Bay. It is a beautiful walk, through sand so thick that it makes you stumble, and it picks up some flotsam when the wind is right, so you can go beach-combing. In the dazzle looking south, there is a stunning view of St Martin, five miles away. It is one of the curious facts of the Caribbean that islands so close together can be so different. For all its beauty, St Martin is frenetic, crowded and horribly overdeveloped. The same sand as Anguilla and looser building laws have meant that over the last 20 years it has grown into a nightmare in concrete. Now there is a squeeze on and it has a problem filling hotel rooms that were quite smart 10 years ago. Anguilla is building, but only slowly, and it seems to be maintaining its reliably top-notch image. Strangely, you will see a surprising number of half-finished houses around the place. Like the fishing boats of decades past, which stood like skeletal hulks on the beach for seasons at a time, they are built by travelling Anguillians who come back and continue building when they can afford it. An unfinished house is a tax dodge; besides, it leaves room to add on for extra kids. Further east you might be forgiven for thinking that you were seeing a mirage when you come to the moorish domes of Cap Juluca Hotel on Maunday's Bay or the white, windswept facades of Cove Castles, which stands on Shoal Bay West. Strangely it has no reef, but it is a magnificent curl of steep-sloping sand where the waves clap and race and the swimming is impeccable. Yet to my mind the beach to beat them all in Anguilla is Captain's Bay in a secluded cove in the far north-east. It is simply . . . wait for it . . . a beach beyond description.

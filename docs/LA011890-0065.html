			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY OFFICIAL SEES DECREASE IN SERVICES  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian's proposed budget for the coming year will put Ventura  County in a difficult financial squeeze and could mean decreased services for  the poor, disabled and jobless, County Administrative Officer Richard  Wittenberg said this week.  </P> <P> Ventura County's programs, including those for the medically indigent, in-home  services for the disabled, Medi-Cal recipients and family planning clinics,  would suffer an estimated $5-million cut at a time when they need a 10%  increase, Wittenberg said.  </P> <P> "Counties cannot keep pace with growth of caseloads, and the state budgets  cannot continue to be balanced on the wholesale shifting of responsibility to  counties," Wittenberg said. "And that's what the governor has consistently  tried to do."  </P> <P> Wittenberg and other county officials hold out hope that the funds allocated to  counties will be significantly increased as the state Legislature reworks the  budget beginning with hearings late next month.  </P> <P> Sen. Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara), who represents the western county, sits on  the Budget and Fiscal Review Committee, which could allow Ventura County some  leverage. But Joseph Caves, Hart's legislative assistant, gave little  encouragement.  </P> <P> "We're under real constraints this year, so it's not clear how much flexibility  we'll have," Caves said.  </P> <P> Estimates show that caseloads, or the number of people needing services, such  as Medi-Cal and social services recipients, will total an 11% increase over  last year statewide, Wittenberg said. That compares to the 8% estimated  increase in revenues.  </P> <P> "The legislators will try to come back and provide greater assistance to the  counties, and decrease some of the health and social service cuts that the  governor has made," Caves said. "But to what extent it's possible, we can't say  yet."  </P> <P> Wittenberg, in a report to the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday, outlined the  good and bad news for the county. He could not estimate the amount of state  funds that would come into county accounts, but he counted among the good news  a $17.4-million increase statewide in funds for immunization to prevent the  spread of disease, a $25-million increase for mental health and a $4.6-million  increase for a substance abuse program for pregnant women.  </P> <P> The bad news, said Wittenberg, is more substantial. It included a statewide  $150-million decrease in general funding not allocated for specific programs.  </P> <P> Also disturbing, Wittenberg said, is a $74-million reduction in the funds  allocated to Medi-Cal for additional benefits that include transportation,  counseling and heroin detoxification.  </P> <P> The county executive also cited a $20-million reduction in funds available for  county reimbursement for expenses incurred by Medi-Cal patients and a  $24-million decrease in family planning services, which provide counseling, but  not abortions, for mostly young, unmarried and poor people.  </P> <P> Wittenberg said other cuts include a $91.6-million reduction in the GAIN  program, which provides vocational education to welfare recipients.  </P> <P> Wittenberg complained that the state does not pay for the programs that it  mandates.  </P> <P> "When we implemented the GAIN program, the state said it would fund it  completely," Wittenberg said.  </P></p>

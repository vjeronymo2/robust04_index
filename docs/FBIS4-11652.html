			<p>BFN     [Text] The G-15 countries have decided to adopt a united  stand at the Marrakech meeting in Morocco, which has been  convened to endorse the GATT accord. Addressing a joint press  conference in New Delhi today, the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha  Rao, said representatives of the leaders of the group will meet  to formulate their stand. Replying to a question on putting up  of new conditions on trade outside the framework of GATT, the  Malaysian prime minister, Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, said that the  developing countries have to adopt a common stand on such  extraneous issues. He deplored the tendency of the rich  countries to impose restrictive practices, including quota  system and Super 301.    Referring to the problem of quorum at G-15 summit, Mr.  Narasimha Rao said a proposal was discussed to make it more  flexible. Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said the absence of some leaders  of the summit should not be interpreted as loss of interest in  the forum. He said it is difficult to get all the heads of  state at one place at a particular time.    The Argentinian president, Dr. Carlos Menem, expressing  total  support for the meet, said commerce and trade should be made  much more transparent.    Mr. Rao described the three-day summit as successful.    The joint communique issued at the end of the summit has  called for setting up a monitoring mechanism to protect the  interest of the developing countries while carrying out the new  GATT accord. It also called for expansion of both the permanent  and nonpermanent membership of the UN Security Council on  democratic lines to give representation to the developing  countries. Describing terrorism as one of the most dangerous  threats to human rights, it urged the international community to  cooperate in effectively combating the menace.    The seven-page communique welcomed the conclusion of the  Uruguay Round and expressed the hope that it will lead to the  creation of a nondiscriminatory multilateral trading system and  expansion of trade, especially for the developing countries.  Expressing concern over moves to bring in new issues like label  standards and trade negotiations, the G-15 leaders urged the  developed countries to refrain from actions which will affect  the balance in the global trading system. On restructuring the  UN, the communique said a stable formula should be devised to  establish appropriate and dynamic interaction between the  Security Council and the General Assembly.    The summit called for revitalization of the dialogue with  the  G-7 advanced nations to find meaningful solutions to acute  problems like poverty, population growth, environment, and  development. Referring to South-South cooperation, the  communique said impressive progress made by some developing  countries reinforces its rationale. The summit called for a  comprehensive approach to solve the debt problem faced by some  developing countries.    Argentina will host the fifth summit next year, while  Zimbabwe will host the sixth.</p>

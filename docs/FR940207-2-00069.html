			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Western is working with the customers on a review of the Engineering Ten-Year Plan of capital additions and replacements and of the appropriateness of its incorporation into the PRS. Specifically, the customers and Western will examine the use in the PRS of projections of future replacements from the Engineering Ten-Year Plan versus projections of replacements from the Replacement Study portion of the PRS. Western and its customers will examine which future replacements projection and revenue requirements are most appropriate for reliable operation of the Federal system and setting rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Customer is concerned about the high concentration of replacement and addition costs in FY 1994 and FY 1995 within the rate period. History dictates that Western will, in fact, not be able to manage or execute those levels of expenditures in short periods of time. Please reexamine the expenditures schedule before the rate is finalized to avoid any unnecessary pinch-point resulting from unrealistic projections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Western has reexamined the replacement costs and believes the costs used in the PRS for replacements in FY 1994 and FY 1995 are appropriate and are the best estimates to date. Western hopes to work through the engineering 10-year planning process with the customers to reexamine the expenditures schedule. This will not be completed before the rate process is completed. However, Western has examined the pinch-point in the PRS. The step-one rate increase is being set to meet annual expenses and interest expense. The step-two rate increase is being set to meet required payments needed to fully repay investment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Purchased Power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Purchased power costs do not reflect planned flow releases from upstream reservoirs (i.e., $700,000 in purchased power costs should be eliminated after FY 1993). On April 8, 1992, Reclamation prepared a forecast of water releases through Hoover Dam. This forecast is based upon a consumptive water use downstream of Hoover Dam of 7.5 MAF and a delivery requirement of 1.5 MAF to Mexico. From 1993&hyph;97, these figures match the flows in 1987, and in 1987, P&hyph;DP did not purchase power. P&hyph;DP generated 482,875,918 kWh in excess of contract requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Western has certain contractual capacity and energy commitments to the P&hyph;DP contractors, regardless of the forecasted water releases from Hoover Dam, the upstream water supplier to Parker and Davis Dams. Western calculates the purchased power costs based upon a comparison of Reclamation's schedule of downstream water releases with the projected energy schedules of the P&hyph;DP contractors. While the total water releases, on an annual basis, may be sufficient to generate all of the energy requirements of the P&hyph;DP on an annual basis, the real-time water release may not match the real-time energy schedules and power purchases must be made. The FY 1993 budget reflects Western's projection that approximately $700,000 per year would need to be budgeted to assure power deliveries to the P&hyph;DP contractors. Since the derivation of the FY 1993 budget, Western has increased this projected expenditure to approximately $2.3 million.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

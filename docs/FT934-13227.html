			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / UK Company News: David Brown pays Pounds 11m for Powell arm DAVID BROWN Group, the West Yorkshire-based specialist engineering company, has agreed to buy the hydraulics and transmissions division of Hamworthy from Powell Duffryn for Pounds 11.1m. It is the first acquisition by David Brown since it was floated in April with a market value of Pounds 90m. The group's shares, which were launched at 170p, yesterday closed 22p higher at 223p. The Hamworthy businesses being sold make power and drive systems for off-highway vehicles, transmissions for light rail traction, and a variety of gears. They employ 630 people on two sites in Poole and Bath, and 90 sales and service staff overseas. The businesses are currently breaking even after three years of losses and are likely to be extensively restructured by their new owners. Mr Chris Cook and Mr Chris Brown, joint chief executives of David Brown, reduced their workforce by 400 to 1,400 in the three years before flotation, and said cuts of a similar magnitude would be required to get the acquisition to an acceptable level of profitability. The enlarged group will have five UK gears plants, including the existing David Brown plants at Huddersfield and Penistone, in Yorkshire, and Sunderland. A Pounds 6.2m provision for reorganisation covers the costs of closing one of the gear plants, although no decision will be made until the operations at Poole and Bath have been studied. The chief executives said that as well as the initial benefits from cost-saving and rationalisation, the enlarged group would benefit from complementary product lines and a strong international sales network, which David Brown currently lacks. Powell Duffryn, the distribution, storage and engineering group, said the disposal of this division would sharpen the focus of the remaining Hamworthy businesses  - marine equipment, combustion and compressor systems. Some Pounds 8.4m of the cash consideration will be raised by the placing of 4.4m new shares at 190p. The shares will be placed by BZW with institutional investors, but will be subject to clawback by existing shareholders on a 1-for-12 basis.</p>

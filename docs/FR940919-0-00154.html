			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The listing of these fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp will also bring section 5 and 6 of the Endangered Species Act into effect. Section 5 authorizes acquisition of lands for the purposes of conserving endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to section 6, the Service would be able to grant funds to affected States for management actions aiding in protection and recovery of these animals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Listing these fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp as endangered provides for the development of a recovery plan (or plans) for them. Such plan(s) will bring together State and Federal efforts for conservation of the animals. The plan(s) will establish a framework for agencies to coordinate activities and cooperate with each other in conservation efforts. The plan(s) will set recovery priorities and estimate costs of various tasks necessary to accomplish them. They also will describe site-specific management actions necessary to achieve conservation and survival of the fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 for endangered species and 17.31 for threatened species set forth a series of prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangered wildlife and to threatened wildlife not covered by a special rule. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to take, import or export, transport in interstate or foreign commerce in the course of commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any such species. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that was illegally taken. Certain exceptions can apply to agents of Service and State conservation agencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered and threatened animal species under certain circumstances. Regulations governing permits are at 50 CFR 17.22, 17.23, and 17.32. For endangered species, such permits are available for scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, to alleviate economic hardship in certain circumstances, and/or for incidental take in connection with otherwise lawful activities. For threatened species, there are also permits for zoological exhibition, educational purposes or other purposes consistent with the purposes of the Act. Further information regarding regulations and requirements for permits may be obtained from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services, Endangered Species Permits, 911 N.E. 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232&hyph;4181 (503/231&hyph;2063; FAX 503/231&hyph;6243). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> National Environmental Policy Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment, as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended.

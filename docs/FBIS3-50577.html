Do these two words have the same meaning  they had, in your opinion, when you started your odyssey 35  years ago?    [Castro] No, they cannot have the same meaning. For two  reasons: First, at that time we had an ambitious program that  has to a considerable extent been implemented; second, the  international situation has undergone decisive changes. We,  however, remain committed to our ideals and to our social and  political objectives.    [Gawronski] But hasn't the fact that communism fell to  pieces  in the countries in which it was in power made you conclude that  something should also change in Cuba?    [Castro] I might say that communism destroyed itself, that  it  committed suicide in the USSR, and that it had no reason for  committing suicide. It was a big surprise, both to us and to you  in the Western world. All the values that were the foundations  of that great country were destroyed. A country that rendered  great service to mankind, because I believe the commitments  Lenin and the October Revolution assumed are extraordinary deeds  in mankind's history.    The USSR's role in the fight against fascism was crucial,  and  so was its role in the process of liberating old colonies. What  I mean to say is that if the world has changed, it is because of  the USSR's decisive contribution. I maintain that the USSR  should not have been destroyed but improved, and that socialism  should not have been destroyed but improved. But what was the  result? The current unipolar world is under U.S. domination. A  large sector of the world is suffering the consequences of this.    [Gawronski] But how did that happen? Do you believe  Gorbachev  is to blame?    [Castro] No. Gorbachev spoke about socialism and about  making  socialism more socialist, about improving socialism, not about  destroying it. We should therefore wonder about the factors that  caused the destruction of socialism, and how is it that what  Hitler failed to achieve with hundreds of divisions and tens of  thousands of planes and tanks, happened without a war, without  armored divisions, planes, or tanks. Soviet leaders managed to  accomplish what Hitler could not do.    [Gawronski] What are the current consequences of all this  for  Cuba?    [Castro] The disappearance of the socialist bloc has been a  hard blow to us. Against the U.S. blockade we had been able to  benefit from trade with socialist countries, which served as the  basis for the development of our economy. The blockade is still  in effect today but the basis has vanished, and we are being put  to one of the toughest tests ever known in the modern era.    However, our decision to keep our ideals has not weakened.  Everything shows that it was an insult to Cuba to say that we  were a satellite of the Soviet Union. We have demonstrated that  we were not a satellite but a star shining in its own light.    Moreover, although it is true that the Soviet Union has  destroyed itself, that did not happen with China nor with  Vietnam. Much has been said on the disappearance of socialism in  the Soviet Union, but why does no one say anything about Chinese  socialism?    [Gawronski] Do you think China is an example that must be  followed?    [Castro] It is an experiment that must be studied. The  Chinese themselves say that no one should automatically imitate  what others are doing. They criticize themselves for  mechanically applying the Soviet experience during its first  years.    But if you want to talk about socialism, let us not forget  what socialism achieved in China. At one time it was the land of  hunger, poverty, disasters. Today there is none of that. Today  China can feed, dress, educate, and care for the health of 1.2  billion people.    [Gawronski] But although China has maintained a socialist  political system, it is trying to modify its economy. On the  other hand, Cuba seems to be still solidly socialist. Isn't it  difficult to keep being the only socialist nation when  everything else is changing?    [Castro] I think China is a socialist country, and Vietnam  is  a socialist nation as well. And they insist that they have  introduced all the necessary reforms in order to motivate  national development and to continue seeking the objectives of  socialism. There are no fully pure regimes or systems. In Cuba,  for instance, we have many forms of private property. We have  hundreds of thousands of farm owners. In some cases they own up  to 110 acres (some 150 hectares). In Europe they would be  considered large landholders. Practically all Cubans own their  own home and, what is more, we welcome foreign investment.    But that does not mean that Cuba has stopped being  socialist.  What is evident is that we will never fall into the error of  destroying the country in order to begin something new.    [Gawronski] It could be said that in Cuba socialism has  always been identified with you personally. Have you ever  thought what will happen to socialism when you are no longer in  power?    [Castro] I do not think socialism can be identified with me.  I did not make it up. Of course, individuals can have a decisive  role in a historical moment, but I have never thought socialism  could be identified with me. That would mean depriving those  theoreticians of socialism of such a great honor. An individual  by himself cannot achieve anything. Only a people can do it.    [Gawronski] Since you assumed power, you have had to deal  with eight U.S. presidents. Now there is Clinton, the first to  be younger than you. Things seem to be changing. Do you think  there will be a change in relations between the United States  and Cuba? Is there a possibility to improve current relations?    [Castro] Look, U.S. presidents are slaves to many things,  among them, electoral campaigns. During the course of their  campaigns they make statements and commitments, and Clinton,  unfortunately, had a hostile attitude toward Cuba. But they are  also totally different during the first term when they are very  careful about everything to be re-elected, and in the second  term they seem to have their hands less tied.    I am not going to defend Clinton. He is not my friend nor  foe. I am only trying to make an analysis that will allow me to  make an objective assessment of his personality. And I have  realized that he is very susceptible to pressures from the  right, the most conservative elements. In a given moment he  adopts a position and then changes as a result of pressure. What  is happening with him is the same that happened with Kennedy in  the beginning of his presidency. But I think he is still in the  process of acquiring experience.    Clinton is also conditioned to things he inherited from  Bush.  Somalia, for instance. But there too a starving and disorganized  people have been able to oppose an invasion, and I think Clinton  has learned a lesson from that experience. He did not react  arrogantly with new acts of aggression, with new attacks. He  reacted in a courageous manner and with a cool mind.    [Gawronski] Are you trying to say that to improve relations  with the United States it will be necessary to wait until  Clinton is re-elected so he will no longer be conditioned to  those forces?    [Castro] No one can say what will happen tomorrow. For the  time being Clinton seems to be focusing on his electoral  promises and on his country's internal problems. Moreover, let  us be honest: This is a little country. We are not China, and I  do not think the United States is particularly concerned about  Cuba. The government has other problems it considers more  important.    [Gawronski] Commander, to conclude, I would like to satisfy  a  personal curiosity. Why do you always wear your guerrilla  uniform? It has been a long time since the days of the Sierra  Maestra.    [Castro] These are my clothes. I have worn them throughout  my  life. They are comfortable and simple. They are cheap and they  are never out of fashion. I also have another suit, a more  formal one with a tie. But forgive me if I ask you a question:  When you interviewed the pope, did you ask him why he always  wears that white vestment?</p>

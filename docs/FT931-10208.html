			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Greek-Cypriots feel the effects of economic heat GREEK-CYPRIOT hoteliers are complaining that bookings have fallen sharply this year, but the island's economic planners admit a sense of relief. Last year's record tourist season, marked by a 43 per cent jump in arrivals to just under 2m, pushed up gross domestic product by between 7.5 and 9 per cent. With tourism contributing about 20 per cent of GDP, a leaner year should take some steam out of an overheated economy. 'We're already too dependent on tourism,' says one official. 'We reached a ceiling last year. We don't have the resources - workers, water, beaches - to cope with more people.' GDP growth this year should fall below 4 per cent, provided there is no last-minute flood of bookings. The travel industry claims the Cyprus pound, pegged to the Ecu since last summer, is too strong to be competitive in the British package holiday market, the main source of visitors to Cyprus. The clothing industry, the other main foreign exchange earner, is also in trouble because of the strong Cyprus pound. Orders from Britain, the largest customer, are shrinking. One big Greek-Cypriot manufacturer has moved to Jordan to take advantage of cheaper labour costs. The island's labour shortage has grown so acute that strict immigration rules have been relaxed. The workforce increased by about 5 per cent in the past year, with the arrival of more than 12,000 east European and Asian workers on short-term contracts at wages well below the Greek-Cypriot average. Nonetheless, labour costs have been rising more quickly than the European average, as Cyprus is still committed to index-linked wage rises. With the introduction of VAT last year, annual inflation rose to 6.5 per cent, the highest level for almost a decade. This year, inflation is projected to drop to 4.5 per cent as the central bank tightens a credit squeeze. The commercial banks have been threatened with severe penalties if the practice of letting liquidity drop below official limits is continued. But the central bank has comparatively little room for manoeuvre as the government is still unwilling to lift a 45-year-old law, a relic of British colonial days, that puts a 9 per cent ceiling on interest rates. Demand is forecast to shrink, after a desperate rush to acquire cars and household appliances before VAT was imposed. Imports rose by almost 20 per cent last year, with the current account deficit widening to CPounds 114m (Pounds 160m), equivalent to 3.5 per cent of GDP. This feverish prosperity is not matched in the north of the island, where the Turkish-Cypriots are heavily dependent on aid from Turkey, estimated to cover about 40 per cent of budget outlays. They have a per capita income less than a third of the Greek-Cypriot level of around Dollars 12,000. An independent economist points out that reuniting Cyprus in an arrangement that would promote economic co-operation with the north would make room for more tourists and allow Turkish-Cypriots to join the workforce. But, he adds, without a settlement, the prospects of attracting investment to help diversify the economy will remain limited.</p>

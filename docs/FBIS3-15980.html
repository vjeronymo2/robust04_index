			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Saeima today adopted a proposal by the Judicial  Commission that the regulations adopted under Paragraph 81 of  the Constitution by the Cabinet of Ministers, to the effect  that, additional powers for the state police and Home Guard lost  their force on the day after this resolution was announced.  Before that the Saeima voted against these conditions, as a  first reading of the bill, and also rejected the proposal from  the Commission on Defense and Internal Affairs, returning them  to the government for reworking. The regulations were adopted  by the Cabinet in the last days of 1993, and were intended for  police officers working together with the Home Guards, with the  right to search detained cars and their passengers.    In the debate prior to the vote, Deputy Aristids Lambergs of  the Latvian National Independence Movement stressed that the  regulations adopted openly violate the rights of citizens of the  Republic of Latvia and the principles of personal freedom. In  turn, at a news conference after the vote, Latvian Way faction  head Andrejs Pantelejevs welcomed all the racketeers and other  (?kinds of) bandits whom the police officers and Home Guard will  not be able to search when stopping their cars [sentence as  heard].    The Saeima also adopted on its first reading a bill prepared  by the Commission on Defense and Internal Affairs on the  National Security institution and the Bureau for the Protection  of the Constitution. The Saeima rejected an alternative  possibility, a bill prepared by the Cabinet on  counter-espionage.</p>

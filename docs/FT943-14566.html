			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Kim's challenge is to save his nation from collapse: Pyongyang's economy is caught in a seemingly endless downward spiral The principal challenge confronting Mr Kim Jong-il, the new leader of North Korea, is whether he can reverse the country's economic decline and save it from possible collapse. The North Korean economy is caught in a downward spiral, with gross national product having shrunk at an average annual rate of 5.2 per cent during the past four years. The immediate problems have been caused by the collapse of the Soviet bloc, which ended a barter-trade system that supplied Pyongyang with cheap and vital oil imports. The resulting energy shortage has caused factories to work at half their capacity or less. The problems have been compounded by food shortages caused by four years of poor harvests. Bad weather and the backward agricultural system in a mostly mountainous country have been blamed for an estimated 40 per cent shortfall in grain supplies needed to feed the 22m North Koreans. The economy has also been undermined by more fundamental flaws, including a highly centralised and inefficient planning system, a large heavy-industrial sector working with outdated equipment, and a huge diversion of resources to support one of the largest military forces in the world. The country's governing juche (self-reliance) ideology and its attempt to create a self-sufficient economy is another main cause of the decline. Trade accounts for 13 per cent of North Korea's GNP of Dollars 20.5bn (Pounds 13bn), an exceedingly low ratio by international standards. The adverse developments represent a potential political threat to the North Korean government, since the poor economic condition may eventually provoke a popular uprising. In an unprecedented admission last December, the government acknowledged the country's economic woes and signalled an important policy shift by downgrading the role of heavy industry. Instead, increased emphasis was placed on agriculture, the growth of light industry to supply more consumer goods, and the development of export industries that could provide North Korea with badly needed hard currency to buy oil and food supplies from abroad. Some analysts believe Mr Kim Jong-il was behind the changes. 'Although Kim Jong-il has not made any public pronouncements on economic reforms, the people who surround him are primarily technocrats who want a change in economic policy,' one western diplomat said. The key element in a future North Korean economic strategy is to attract foreign investment which would support new plant facilities that could produce goods for export. North Korea is already taking part in a project sponsored by the UN Development Program to develop a free-trade and investment zone around the cities of Rajin and Sonbong in north-eastern North Korea. Other free economic zones are being proposed for the port of Nampo near Pyongyang and Sinuiju on the border with China. The country over the past year has also revised its foreign investment laws, basing them on Chinese practices, to attract foreign capital and technology. But political considerations will probably limit the opening of North Korea to foreign investment, which raises doubts about the effectiveness of the proposed reforms in saving the economy. Officials in Pyongyang worry that an extensive opening of the country will undermine the government as the population becomes exposed to outside influences. Mr Kim Il-sung, the late president and father of Mr Kim Jong-il, summed up the dilemma that foreign investment poses for North Korea: 'We must open the window to let the wind in, but not the mosquitoes'. In an attempt to retain control, the proposed free economic zones are mainly located in sparsely populated regions. This may prove to be a disincentive to foreign investors. Samsung, the South Korean conglomerate, recently dropped plans to help finance a railway connecting the Rajin-Sonbong region with China because it regarded the area as being too isolated. Foreigners are also concerned about how well their investments will be protected; North Korea has shown little inclination to repay Dollars 1.6bn to foreign banks on loans it borrowed in the 1970s. But South Korea's main business groups at least are eager to set up factories in North Korea, to take advantage of a cheap, disciplined and Korean-speaking labour force. Initial investments would focus on production of textiles and electronic goods, but activity could eventually expand to the operation of heavy-industry plants such as steel, and the construction of ports and other infrastructure projects. Seoul has so far blocked business ties with the North because of the continuing dispute over Pyongyang's nuclear programme. But if the issue is resolved, South Korean investment is expected to receive the active backing of the government. Seoul wants to prevent a sudden economic collapse of the North, which could trigger a costly and rapid reunification of the two Koreas. Instead, it hopes to promote the gradual upgrading of the North's industrial structure, which would reduce reconstruction costs in the future once the countries are united.</p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'MOSCOW IS NO LONGER THE BOGYMAN';  </P> <P> S. AFRICA QUELLS ITS FEARS, WELCOMES SOVIET OFFICIALS  </P> <P> For years, South African leaders have justified their adventurism in black  Africa and repression at home with a single vision of the future: the day the  Soviets arrive in battle fatigues and on tanks to run up the red flag over  Pretoria.  </P> <P> But when the Soviets did arrive this week, in their first visit since Pretoria  broke diplomatic ties with Moscow more than three decades ago, they wore  pinstriped suits, carried briefcases and stepped down from a British Airways  747.  </P> <P> And the leader of this invasion, Vyacheslav Ustinov, a roving Soviet  ambassador, was squired around town by grinning government officials and fawned  over by local reporters like a Hollywood star.  </P> <P> Ustinov and his five-member delegation did not come to restore diplomatic  relations or even participate in formal talks with South Africa. They were  here, along with representatives of Cuba, Angola and the United States, for the  fifth meeting of a commission formed to help guide the Angolan peace accords.  </P> <P> But the Soviets' presence, and the way it has been heralded here, marks a swift  change in the South African government's public attitude toward the East Bloc.  And it has provided scenes, some on state-run television, that many white South  Africans never thought they'd live to see: a Soviet official making a courtesy  call on President Pieter W. Botha at the executive mansion, Soviet officials at  a South African wine estate, Soviet officials at a barbecue in the South  African foreign minister's back yard.  </P> <P> "The South African government's rhetoric has changed just in the last six  months. Moscow is no longer the bogyman," said Willie Esterhuyse, a professor  of political philosophy at Stellenbosch University.  </P> <P> No detail about the Soviet visitors was too small for the local newspapers. The  Argus reported that Ustinov was dressed "in shirt sleeves and slippers" during  an interview in his "five-star" hotel room. "He apologized for his casual  appearance," the paper added.  </P> <P> Ustinov's thoughts on Cape Town, the seaside home of South Africa's Parliament,  played well. "It looks like 'Frisco,' " he said, adding that "the streets are  clean and the beaches are beautiful."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Labeled 'Total Onslaught'  </P> <P> Since the late 1950s, South Africa has warned the white electorate that its way  of life was imperiled by a communist-inspired conspiracy to one day rule South  Africa, which Pretoria labeled the "total onslaught." The government over the  years has cited the "total onslaught" as justification for sending South  African soldiers to topple neighboring Marxist countries and to quell what it  believed were Soviet-backed black uprisings inside the country.  </P> <P> But today the old catch phrase is falling into disuse.  </P> <P> "If anything, the Americans -- and especially the Democrats in Congress who  support sanctions -- are being regarded as the main instigators of the 'total  onslaught' these days," Esterhuyse said.  </P> <P> The apparent thaw in Soviet-South African relations results primarily from  increasing informal contacts between the two countries arising from the  U.S.-brokered Angolan peace agreement. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's  search for political rather than military solutions to regional conflicts also  has made the South Africans less suspicious about ulterior Soviet motives.  </P> <P> But the budding relationship also indicates just how far South Africa will go  to break out of its international isolation, political analysts say.  </P> <P> "They're desperate for acceptance from any quarter," a Western diplomat here  says. "And they're showing America and the West that there's more than one big  power in the world."  </P> <P> Although the government risks some criticism from conservative whites for  talking openly with the Soviets, it will gain points among whites who are tired  of being, in the words of one analyst, "the polecat of the world."  </P> <P> "It shows that there are still some important people who recognize us as a  regional power," Esterhuyse said. "And all white South Africans, liberals as  well as conservatives, want to be recognized as a regional power."  </P> <P> South Africa closed the Soviet Embassy here in 1956, accusing the Soviet Union  of supporting the black liberation movement, particularly the African National  Congress (ANC). For more than 20 years after that, the government repeatedly  used the "total onslaught" image to mobilize support among the country's white  minority.  </P> <P> To counter the onslaught, it devised the "total strategy." It cracked down on  black opponents at home with ever more restrictive laws and, in the late 1970s,  funneled support to Rhodesia's white-minority government and the rebel  movements trying to overthrow the new, Soviet-backed governments in Angola and  Mozambique.  </P> <P> In the 1980s, as Pretoria's diplomatic isolation in the West grew, the first  signs of conciliation with the East appeared.  </P> <P> A little over a year ago, when Radio Moscow began broadcasting to South Africa  in Afrikaans, the language of the Dutch-descended Afrikaners, white South  Africans seemed more flattered than fearful.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gorbachev Book Sold Out  </P> <P> Gorbachev's book, "Perestroika," was an instant sellout in 1987. And, quietly,  the Foreign Affairs Ministry resurrected a desk designed to explore relations  with East Bloc countries.  </P> <P> In recent months, contacts between the Soviets and South Africans have  increased. Most of the meetings have been, like the one in Cape Town this week,  to discuss the progress of the Angolan peace accord and Namibia's steps toward  independence.  </P> <P> But Foreign Minister Roelof F. (Pik) Botha and Anatoly L. Adamishin, the Soviet  deputy foreign minister for African affairs, met in Mozambique earlier this  month. Then, a few days later, Adamishin was taken on a 90-minute helicopter  tour of the Johannesburg area. Western diplomats said it was the first time a  senior Soviet diplomat had laid eyes on the country in 33 years. He was said by  South African officials to have been surprised by the modern road network.  </P> <P> While neither side thinks diplomatic relations will be restored any time soon,  South African officials hope they can persuade the Soviet Union to put pressure  on its friend, the ANC, to end the guerrilla war against Pretoria.  </P> <P> Although the Soviets recently said they favor a political settlement in South  Africa, they have been reluctant to get too close to the South African  government for fear it would alienate the ANC and their other friends in  Africa.  </P> <P> Ustinov told reporters this week that the Soviet Union would not even consider  renewing formal ties with Pretoria until apartheid is dismantled. But, he  added, the Soviet Union would be happy to help South Africa end its system of  racial segregation "if you ask us to."  </P></p>

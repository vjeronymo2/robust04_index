			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAELI BANK PLACES $1-BILLION COST ON PALESTINIAN UPRISING  </P> <P> One of Israel's leading banks has estimated that coping with the two-year-old  Palestinian uprising has cost the country about $1 billion in expenses and lost  revenues, bank officials said this week.  </P> <P> In a survey published by Bank Hapoalim, economists said that boycotts against  Israeli products by Palestinians in the occupied territories together with a  slowdown in tourism and costs incurred by the army have cost the nation about  1% of its output of goods and services.  </P> <P> One bank official said the percentage of the gross national product given to  the uprising was significant, but "not a dramatic influence."  </P> <P> The figure for the second year of the uprising was slightly less than for the  first, which cost $600 million. The survey said the impact in the second year  was not as great because the economy has begun to adjust to the situation.  </P></p>

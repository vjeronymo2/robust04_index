			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / S Pacific airlines may be cut Leaders of South Pacific island nations, meeting in Brisbane for the annual forum, yesterday agreed to consider ways of rationalising the national airline services which pepper the region. In a formal statement, issued after the first day of discussions between the heads of 15 South Pacific countries, members acknowledged that there was a need to deal with airline losses. They pledged to set up a meeting between airline operators and aviation authorities, and to 'examine the options for a rationalisation of air services among Forum island countries, perhaps on a sub-regional basis'. The move will be welcomed by Australia, whose annual aid contribution to the area is about ADollars 500m (Pounds 238m). At the weekend, Mr Gordon Bilney, Australia's federal minister with responsibility for Pacific Island affairs, made clear his country was increasingly reluctant to see aid funds used to prop up the region's 11 national carriers. In a separate initiative, Mr Paul Keating, the Australia's prime minister, pledged additional financial assistance to the Solomon Islands, if it banned logging of tropical rainforests on all government land in the Marovo Lagoon area. Environmental damage from logging by foreign companies, notably Malaysian interests, has been of growing international concern.</p>

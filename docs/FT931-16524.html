			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Scud launcher in Budge assets A SCUD missile launcher, 50 racehorses, a gold mine in Arizona and a narrow-boat building yard are among the assets of AF Budge which the Leeds office of Coopers &amp; Lybrand is now trying to sell. The privately-owned East Midlands civil engineering group was forced into receivership by its bankers last month after running out of Pounds 20m of borrowing facilities. Budge's bankers are understood to have been unimpressed at the integration of private passion into corporate structure. The racehorses are still in training and being raced with the receivers' permission to enhance their value where possible. Coopers has brought in a bloodstock expert to value them for the January Doncaster sales. Budge had been due to sponsor a race at Cheltenham last month, but had to withdraw when the receivers were called in. The Scud missile launcher is part of one of the world's largest collections of military memorabilia, another Budge passion. An offshoot of this is a wholesale and retail small-arms trader. Other subsidiaries include a marquee business and an airport at Gamston, south of East Retford, Nottinghamshire, where Budge was based. There is also property in London's Docklands. The likeliest prospect for an early sale is Hytek Mouldings, an injection-moulding company with a projected turnover of Pounds 1.8m and 30 employees, which was advertised in yesterday's Financial Times. Try Construction, a once-small Uxbridge builder, yesterday emerged as the buyer of Budge's core building business, at Pounds 500,000 for Pounds 12m of ongoing contracts. Alfred McAlpine bought the other core business - road and bridge building - on Monday. Try has been going national throughout the recession by snapping up failed contractors in the south-east and the Midlands. Budge will give it a base in Leeds to expand into north-east England and should add Pounds 20m to Try's current Pounds 120m turnover. 'We have low gearing and have always kept ourselves healthy in cash terms, so when these opportunities arise we have been able to move in quickly for them,' Mr Peter Howell, Try's managing director, said.</p>

Ciller did not receive the enthusiastic welcome she had  expected from the crowd in her recent swing to Adana nor on her  campaign stop in Malatya last weekend. Following the rally in  Malatya, eggs and tangerines were thrown at her. Due to the  tension within her party, she could not even announce the DYP's  mayoral candidate for Malatya. Her mood influenced by her  disappointment over the domestic tours, Ciller harshly  reproached the columnists whom she takes on every domestic tour.  When Ciller arrived at Malatya airport, the people showed their  anger over the behavior of the police during the protest march  of the civil servants the previous day, in which around 30  demonstrators were taken into custody. Inonu Square, where  Ciller was to deliver her speech, was mostly filled with people  from opposition parties and civil servants. While Ciller was  delivering her address, pro Welfare Party (RP) people were  giving the thumbs-up and the Grand Unity Party (BBP) members  were making the wolf-sign in a bid to identify themselves.  Ciller had to cut her speech short due to the incessant  whistling and shouting. She later visited the governor of  Malatya, Saffet Arikan Beduk, whom she held responsible for what  had happened.    Ciller became involved in more unpleasant situations before  and after her visit to the Malatya mayor, who had joined the RP.  A group of RP members and ultranationalists known as "ulkucu"  (idealists) protested against her. Police used batons to  disperse them. Meanwhile, one of the eggs and an orange thrown  at the DYP convoy hit Ciller. Despite the protests, Ciller  always kept a smile on her face.    Explaining the reasons for the government's decision to  extend the period of military service, Ciller said that the  government aimed at preventing separatist terrorists from  recovering their strength during the winter months. She said  that the government did not have any other alternative but to  extend the term of military service, since shifting troops from  the western or northern regions to the Southeast seemed  impossible because of developments in Greece and Russia.</p>

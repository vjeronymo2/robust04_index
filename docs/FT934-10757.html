			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Russia switches tack on nuclear weapons PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin has approved a new Russian defence doctrine, abandoning the 'no first use' of nuclear weapons and permitting the stationing of troops abroad. Russia's Security Council approved the outlines of the doctrine, which for the first time specifies the role of the post-communist armed forces after the cold war. Diplomats and military observers in Moscow said the decision 'merely brings Russian in line with other nuclear states'. The 'no first use' policy, promulgated by the Soviet Union, was used as a propaganda weapon with which to beat Nato countries which had no such principle. 'The Soviet-era doctrine was a ploy in which Nato never believed and which was a luxury which a state with overwhelming conventional advantage could permit itself,' one senior western diplomat said yesterday. General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, said Russia would not use atomic weapons against any non-nuclear state which had signed the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty - with two exceptions. Nuclear weapons could be used in defence of Russia against non-nuclear states if they were allied with nuclear states or had an agreement with one. He said the doctrine said nothing on the subject of an attack from a nuclear state - implying that Russia reserved the right for first use. Mr Oleg Lobov, the secretary of the Security Council in which the doctrine was approved on Tuesday, said in an interview with the daily Izvestiya that 'if war is launched against Russia or its partners in the union then we have the right to use all the means we have to defend our most basic interests'. However, he said 'the basic approach of the doctrine is that nuclear war is senseless'. Gen Grachev said that the military was concerned with the growth of conflicts in neighbouring, former Soviet states - and said that 'we must try to stop them earlier'. He said 'a new idea is that in the interests of Russia and of other Commonwealth members there could be cases where Russian forces and equipment are based outside of Russia'. Russian troops are already in Georgia, guarding railways and roads, as a struggle rages between government and rebel forces. In what might prove to be a bold step deeper into the civil war, nine Russian warships off the port of Poti were poised to put paratroopers, tanks and armoured vehicles ashore at dawm today in an area which has changed hands several times during the conflict. Russian troops are also aiding the government of Tajikistan against rebels based in Afghanistan, while Russian divisions remain in Moldova, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrghyzia. In the Baltics, troops remain in Estonia and Latvia - and Gen Grachev made it clear they would stay on until Russian claims that the civil rights of the large Russian minorities there had been satisfied.</p>

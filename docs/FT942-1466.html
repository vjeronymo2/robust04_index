			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Shipyard workers vote for strike Workers at the world's largest shipyard voted to strike for three hours during the telecast early today of South Korea's match against Bolivia. Workers at Hyundai Heavy Industries, near Seoul, voted nearly 2 to 1 for the strike. The company said the strike was so the 22,000 workers could watch the game live, but the union claimed the strike supported a 13 per cent wage rise.</p>

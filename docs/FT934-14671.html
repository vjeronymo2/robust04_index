			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Arts: Tristan on speed - Music in London Under their conductor Franz Welser-Most, the London Philharmonic played Wagner on Wednesday. The result was a draw that flattered nobody. Not uninteresting, not dull or heedless; just not good enough for Tristan und Isolde - especially for Wagnerite Londoners hoping that this Festival Hall performance would be some consolation for the opera's long absence from Covent Garden and St Martin's Lane. What might count as memorable about Welser-Most's account, some good singing aside, is that it may have been the quickest Tristan ever. The first act was delivered smoothly and very briskly. Not a bad idea, one thought, for a concert performance which excluded interpersonal drama though the urgent thrills of the last, fast duet would have counted for more if the wary confrontation of the lovers had built up anything like the right head of steam first. Act 2 was speedy beyond reason. There was no fraught, tingling atmosphere at the start - and rather terrible things seemed to be happening among the offstage 'hunting' horns (who therefore sounded more like the real thing than what Wagner wrote). In the immense love duet, the conductor switched to fast-forward so early that his principals soon sounded like excited puppies in a Disney cartoon, yelping out their phrases without a hope of giving them any erotic slant or expressive colour. The Act 3 prelude was squeezed out very slowly, to little communicative effect: one could not help thinking that Welser-Most is just too young to try that on. But Tristan's great soliloquies were hustled along; the long, heartbreaking swells on high violins were reduced to snappy interjections, and the richest orchestral commentary emerged incoherently. Heinz Kruse's Tristan began to tire (most Tristans get more than just 20-minute breaks between acts). From the start his bright, somewhat impersonal elegance had been a virtue; but now, despite an occasional gleam of passion, the portrayal dwindled to blueprint-scale. Kruse's diction was always a crisp pleasure, for he spent 20 years as a character-tenor before expanding into Heldentenor roles. Yet Elizabeth Connell's Isolde found subtler depths in her words; if she lacked the ideal Isolde's warmth in the mezzo register, her terrific thrust higher up was complemented by luminous character everywhere. (Her Liebestod was almost too subtle; we need it, after all, to be a glorious catharsis.) As Kurwenal, Tristan's staunch vassal, David Wilson-Johnson limned some unaccompanied phrases poignantly, but otherwise faded into the orchestra. For this role, his 'bass'-baritone has neither the substance nor the bottom. Della Jones's Brangaene was an honourable non-starter: peppered with character but shrewish at the top, alternating with crashes into raw chest-voice. We got the real thing only from Curt Appelgren's King Mark  - grandly gentle and broad, quivering with personal hurt; and young Ian Bostridge as the Young Sailor and Shepherd deployed his fresh, non-reedy timbre (and excellent German) to beautiful and sharply immediate effect. And the LPO's lovely flutes distinguished themselves throughout.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Respite for dollar but markets stay nervous The US administration's defiant response to the dollar's renewed plunge earlier this week appeared to be paying off yesterday as the currency held steady. But traders warned that the foreign exchange markets remained extremely nervous and suggested the administration had not yet reversed the general trend of the dollar's decline. In London, the dollar closed slightly higher against both the yen and D-Mark at Y101.15 and DM1.6035 respectively, from Y100.695 and DM1.6006 on Wednesday. In late trading in New York, the dollar was a touch stronger against both currencies. Rumours of central bank intervention punctuated the day, but were not translated into action. 'The dollar is sitting just slightly above the level where intervention might be expected,' said Mr Michael Saunders, economist at Salomon Brothers. The US currency's steadiness helped most European bond and stock markets, although shares traded lower in New York and bonds finished at mixed levels. The US benchmark 30-year bond was unchanged, yielding 7.395 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 25.68 points to 3,699.09 on renewed weakness in the technology sector. Foreign exchange dealers appeared yesterday to have stayed largely on the sidelines, for fear of concerted intervention by the central banks of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. That could change if signs of disagreement emerge among the G7 partners in the run-up to their summit meeting in Naples in two weeks. Administration officials yester day reiterated Wednesday's up-beat assessment by President Bill Clinton of the US economy. Mr Leon Panetta, budget director, tried to reassure the debt markets, saying the budget deficit could fall to Dollars 225bn (Pounds 147bn) in the current fiscal year. Bond markets were strong in Europe with 10-year German bunds up by around half a point, following a Bundesbank decision to leave official interest rates unchanged, and 10-year gilts up by around  5/8 of a point. The German and French equity markets each rose by more than 1 per cent, following a 2.2 per cent increase in Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index earlier in the day. The main exception to the trend was London, where the FT-SE 100 index fell 0.6 per cent.

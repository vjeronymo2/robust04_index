			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Observer: Hans on board Picture the scene. A bunch of central bankers and finance ministers shooting the rapids on Wyoming's Snake River last summer, when certain members of the party start to go adrift. A whiff of panic spreads among the remaining members of the world's financial community, as they realise that they may not be able to walk on water after all. Cue Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer, who turns to his fellow paddler, Nigel Lawson, Britain's ex-chancellor of the exchequer, with the ultimate reassurance: 'The Bundesbank is with you.' Panic over. Well, that's Tietmeyer's version.</p>

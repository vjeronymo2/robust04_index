"Any attempts to solve problems with weapons have failed,"  he  said, noting that he expects to see the eventual unification of  China conducted "in a peaceful manner."    Gorbachev, his wife and an eight member entourage arrived in  Taipei Sunday for a six-day visit at the invitation of the  UNITED DAILY NEWS newspaper.    Commenting on his visit to Taiwan, Gorbachev said "the world  has changed, and my visit here is a proof of it."    "The route from Moscow to Taiwan was once an impossible  journey," Wang Ti-wu, founder of the newspaper said at a welcome  dinner Sunday.    "The journey has been realized as a result of the new way of  thought created by president Gorbachev," Wang said.    This is Gorbachev's first trip to East Asia since he  resigned  as president in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union.    Gorbachev and wife met with Foreign Affairs Minister Chien  Fu  Monday morning over lunch at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.    Chien and Gorbachev exchanged views on world affairs and  future prospects for Taiwan-Russian relations.    Chien praised Gorbachev as a man of vision and  open-mindedness. The liberalization movement Gorbachev initiated  made him a great reformer whose vision changed his country and  the rest of the world, Chien said.    Gorbachev, who presided over the end of the Cold War, the  breakaway of the Soviet satellites in Eastern Europe, and the  beginning of an end to the US-Russian arms race, will give his  first speech in Taipei entitled "The World in My Eyes" Monday  afternoon at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall.    Later in the day, Gorbachev and party will meet with Premier  Lien Chan at the Executive Yuan and will attend a dinner hosted  by Lien in their honor.    The 65-year-old Gorbachev, who led the "perestroyka" and  "glasnost" reforms in his country in the 80s, will speak on "the  reforms and challenge of Russia" at the Grand Hyatt Taipei  Tuesday.    The Russian statesman, who refers to himself as a columnist,  said upon arrival at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport that  he hopes to meet as many politicians, merchants and students as  possible during his stay in Taiwan, "so I can get to know the  Chinese people better."    Gorbachev is scheduled to meet with President Li Teng-hui on  Wednesday and visit the Legislative Yuan Thursday.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Washington correspondent Omago: "Japan, U.S. </F> Could Not Catch `Signs for Concessions'"]    [Text] The Japan-U.S. economic framework talks ended in  failure. However, during the final phase of the negotiations,  there were three chances for reaching an agreement. The United  States once showed its intention to give up the demand for  Japan's commitment on numerical targets for market  liberalization. Also, the nation expressed great expectations  for Japan's tax cut policy pledged by Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata. While the talks have  failed due to mutual misunderstanding and distrust resulting  from a lack of communications, a review of these points may  provide some clue for "reconciliation" in the future.  <H3>  First Chance -- Compromise Plan Shown by U.S.; Dispatch of  Special Envoy Went Wrong </H3>   Commenting on one of the reasons for the breakup of the  framework talks and the Washington summit, a White House  official said: "The bilateral discord at the final stage of the  negotiations started when special envoy Kiuchi visited  Washington." According to U.S. officials, Kiuchi met with U.S.  President Bill Clinton to pave the way for Foreign Minister  Hata's U.S. visit on 9 February. However, he "just conveyed the  prime minister's desire for settling the negotiations without  any proposals." In explaining this, Japanese officials said  "the prime minister's purpose was to sound out the true  intention of the United States." But the envoy could not do so  because U.S. officials were displeased with the lack of new  proposals.  <H5>  Sudden Proposal from U.S. </H5>   On the afternoon of 8 February, or immediately after the  envoy's visit, U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] Mickey Kantor  conveyed his decision to discontinue vice ministerial and  working-level framework negotiations in Washington. His  high-handed attitude intensified the sense of distrust among  Japanese negotiators, and this became an obstacle to mutual  concessions.    The U.S. negotiators had a wrong impression, too. When  Foreign Minister Hata told U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter  Mondale that he wants to "sincerely settle" the negotiations,  the United States had too much expectation for "Japan's new  proposals on tax cut and numerical target."    In fact, Deputy Assistant to the U.S. President Bowman  Cutter  (of the National Economic Council) showed a concession plan on  the objective criteria issue to Deputy Vice Foreign Minister  Koichiro Matsuura. According to him, the United States was  ready to make concessions on the following points: 1) it will be  acceptable if the criteria for government procurement can  measure the trend of import growth of the past; 2) no objective  criteria is necessary on the insurance negotiation; and 3) it  will be acceptable if criteria for assessing auto parts imports  can measure the trend of import growth of the past. He also  proposed an extension of the framework talks by a month. The  proposals made at the initiative of the White House looked  acceptable to Japan. However, Japanese negotiators could not  accept the offer since they did not believe it, which was too  far from the USTR's position.    The first round of the Hata-Kantor negotiations started on  the morning of 10 February, but U.S. negotiators were  disappointed that he had no proposal to break the deadlock over  the bilateral talks. Following this, President Clinton had a  meeting of the National Economic Council (NEC), and declared "no  empty agreement is needed." After this, the USTR's Office became  even more difficult to deal with.  <H5>  Second Chance -- No Commitment on Tax Cut </H5>   Yet, the tough attitude of USTR Kantor was not very obvious  when Hata met him on the evening of 10 February. U.S. officials  said, at that time, the United States was still thinking of a  concession on the objective criteria issue if Japan shows a  clear decision on an income tax cut. However, the United States  could not show its concession plan since Hata did not say "the  tax cut will be continued after 1994" in meetings with Vice  President Al Gore and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. Japan  thus missed its second chance.    Hata and Kantor met again at 0100 local time on 11 February,  and the USTR's Office finally showed its own opinion. U.S.  negotiators again demanded "future-oriented" criteria, and it  was impossible for Japan to accept it. The ministerial talks  broke down when Foreign Minister Hata finally decided to reject  the U.S. demand.  <H5>  Last Chance -- Hosokawa Did Not Clarify Commitments </H5>   The last chance was the Hosokawa-Clinton talks on 11  February. White House officials let the President bring  "concession plans on the objective criteria issue and on  extension of the talks" in expectation for "Hosokawa's definite  pledge on the tax cut and objective criteria issues." Yet,  Hosokawa made no commitments during the summit talks.    While Clinton did not pick on Hosokawa in consideration for  "the prime minister's efforts on the tax cut issue," he had to  get rid of the U.S. concession plan.    After the talks, a senior White House official said "the  President was somewhat disappointed with what the prime minister  said."    Taking this into account, it is obvious that the breakdown  of  the bilateral talks was because both Japan and the United States  could not catch signs for concessions because of lack of mutual  understanding. Due to bureaucratic sectionalism [nawabari  ishiki] in both Japan and the United States, officials of  different ministries and agencies placed different importance on  the issues of tax reduction and the objective criteria. Because  of this, they failed to realize points at issue during  discussions. It appears the failure in the bilateral talks  indicates the need for overcoming bureaucratic barriers to  settle negotiations both on micro and macroeconomic issues.</p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour urges oil tanker ban as Braer breaks up MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, called on the government yesterday to ban oil tankers using routes close to environmentally sensitive areas around Britain's coastline until the cause of the Braer disaster had been established. Amid mounting concern about the extent of the environmental and economic damage inflicted on the Shetland Islands as the wrecked vessel broke up, he insisted that the practice followed by aviation authorities when serious accidents occurred should also apply to oil tankers. To Labour cheers, Mr Smith emphasised that it was customary for aircraft to be grounded pending the outcome of accident inquiries. Such interim action should also be available in respect of oil tankers in view of the 'acute anxiety' around Britain's coastline resulting from the damage caused to the Shetland Islands by the Braer disaster. Mr John Major, the prime minister, promised to consult Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, about Mr Smith's proposal. When Labour MPs demanded 'action now', he said the proposal had many ramifications which needed to be examined before a concrete answer could be provided. Mr Smith pressed the prime minister to involve himself in the matter and not leave it to Mr MacGregor. Mr Major said Mr MacGregor would report to him and 'we will report back to the House'. The battle to salvage anything from the stricken tanker was finally lost yesterday as it became clear that overnight the ship had broken into three sections in continued battering by near-hurricane-force winds. Most of the remaining oil on the ship, which was carrying 84,000 tonnes of light crude when it went aground near Sumburgh Head early last week, has spilled out since the ship's tanks suffered further serious damage on Monday. The oil does not appear to have spread far from the wreck, though, and is either being confined along the shore by storm force winds or dispersing rapidly in ferocious waves. The European Commission yesterday approved more than Ecu 1m (Pounds 800,000) of emergency aid to help the Shetland Islands and their inhabitants recover from the aftermath of the oil spill.</p>

The Russian minister has assured  his partners that the withdrawal of Russian troops from Germany  will be completed before 31 August this year, and military  property will be removed before May.    Grachev has also stated Russia's intention to cooperate  within the framework of the Partnership for Peace program, but  in that initiative he sees only a proposal for cooperation  rather than a step toward a merger with NATO.</p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROURKE IN DISPUTE OVER 'HOMEBOY'  </P> <P> Mickey Rourke's latest movie, "Homeboy," has already reached some European  markets but the actor is trying to prevent its release here in the United  States, arguing in a suit filed Thursday that the film's producers failed to  pay him and denied him creative control.  </P> <P> "We have a contract," said Rourke's attorney Gerald Edelstein. "All we're  trying to do is enforce it." Rourke plays a boxer in "Homeboy," which was  filmed in New Jersey.  </P> <P> The suit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, also seeks $4 million in  damages from producer Elliott Kastner and his Cinema International Corp.  Kastner did not return calls Friday.  </P> <P> Rourke contends that the producers failed to let him approve the film's final  editing and music and violated a 1986 agreement by failing to pay him and his  company $200,000.  </P> <P> He also alleges the producers denied him him approval of where and when the  movie initially will be distributed.  </P></p>

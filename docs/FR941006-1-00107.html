			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although the prevalence of iron deficiency in the U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population is low (Ref. 2), maintenance of adequate iron stores  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in women of childbearing age and in young children is an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important public health issue. A woman's recommended daily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowance (RDA) for iron during pregnancy doubles from 15 to 30  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mg/day (Ref. 3). The importance of prenatal iron supplementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in preventing depletion of iron stores in pregnant women has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shown in several clinical trials (Ref. 4). Thus, pregnant women  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are often counseled to increase their iron intake through dietary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes and the use of iron-containing supplements or drugs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A committee of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended that all pregnant women should be screened for iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiency anemia at the first prenatal visit and at least once  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during each subsequent trimester (Ref. 5). The NAS committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended, however, that iron supplementation should only be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> given when iron status is low or marginal, as indicated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hemoglobin and serum ferritin, in comparison with standard values  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended by NAS for the specific trimester of pregnancy. When  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these clinical indicators reveal deficient iron status, the NAS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committee recommended that the clinician prescribe 60 to 120 mg of supplemental iron per day. If iron status is marginal, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NAS committee recommended that the clinician prescribe 30 mg of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplemental iron per day. If iron status is normal, the NAS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committee recommended that these be no iron supplementation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Aside from the iron needs that arise during pregnancy, women  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of child-bearing age have a higher requirement for iron than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other adults. (The RDA for women of child-bearing age is 15  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mg/day because of the depletion of iron through menstrual blood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loss. It is 10 mg/day for adult males and older adult women  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ref. 3).) The difficulty of obtaining dietary intakes high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enough to replace those losses through consumption of a normal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diet is responsible for iron deficiency in some women of child-bearing age. For these women also, the use of iron-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products may be prudent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Iron deficiency also affects young children (the RDA for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron for children is 10 mg/day), particularly during the rapid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> growth period from 6 months to 4 years of age. Some young  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> children fail to develop adequate iron stores to supply the iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed for their metabolic functions during this early growth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Survey (NHANES II) for children show that the prevalence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impaired iron status ranges from an estimated 3 to 12 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ref. 2). Thus, iron supplementation may also be indicated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> children whose iron needs are not met through dietary intake.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

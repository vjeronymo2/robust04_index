			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Washington correspondent Oszkar Fuzes: "The </F> United States and Eastern-Central Europe -- The Consequences of  Clinton's Tour on Hungary and the Region"]    [Text] In accordance with reality, Washington  differentiates between individual countries and groups of  countries in Eastern Europe. Russia is important from a global  policy viewpoint, and the United States regards the success of  Russian reforms as the pillars of the new world order. As for  the other former Soviet republics, the United States finds it  important that Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan discard their  nuclear weapons and the others stay "clean." If, as it  promised, Moscow honors the independence of the new states, it  will be able to emerge as a crisis manager, or even a judge with  U.S. approval.    Washington is for regional cooperation in the case of both  the CIS and Eastern Europe. Despite all the Czech opposition,  Washington supports and encourages the Visegrad cooperation as  well. Prague, Warsaw, Budapest, and even the "immature"  Bratislava are treated uniformly and placed in the same drawer  of "local affairs" in the big global policy cabinet. Clinton  lifted the ban on the purchase of U.S. weapons to all the four  countries simultaneously, and Christopher also made it clear  that the door leading to NATO can either become wider or  narrower for these countries. They must prove their democratic  maturity in solving their bilateral conflicts. Clinton  specially remarked that violent nationalism and anti-Semitism  are unacceptable for the United States. He did not hide the  fact that the United States is providing greater political and  economic support to the new democratic countries in order to  help avoid the renewal of totalitarianism. Talbott added that  the United States does not want to be the judge in the conflicts  of small countries. Nor will the United States take it upon  itself to "put in a good word" for them in Moscow. In case of a  possible revival of the Russian threat, something that  Christopher definitely regards as only a possible supposition,  the Visegrad countries can count on U.S. security policy help "  to be defined at the proper time." Perhaps this does not seem  to be a big thing -- Christopher said -- but this is a very  serious responsibility on the part of the NATO. It exceeds the  mere consultations. If these countries get deeper into the  peace partnership, conduct military exercises together with us,  and make military plans together, then we will have relations  with them in which their security will become very important for  us. If someone turns back, we can again drop the security  barrier used in the past, although we would definitely not like  to draw a separation line in Europe again. The Russian leader  who claims that we promised Moscow not to allow anyone into NATO  is making a big mistake, Christopher said.    Christopher's deputy Talbott places emphasis on a slightly  different thing: "The real integration of Western, Central, and  Eastern Europe is a very long process. Just like the Russians,  we also fear that Moscow could again become isolated from the  outside world. This does not mean that Yeltsin gets a veto  right in the possible extension of NATO, but we will definitely  take the viewpoints of the Russian reform into consideration,"  Talbott said.    Behind the Visegrad goup, there are the other Eastern  European countries. Most of them have not yet fulfilled the  preliminary conditions of the peace partnership. (Civil and  parliamentary control over the army is not firm enough, the  military budget is not completely public and regulated, unsolved  territorial issues might emerge, and the civil democracy is not  stable enough). Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, and Macedonia are  in this drawer; in addition, these countries are important for  the foreign policy makers in Washington not because of  themselves but because of the Yugoslav crisis.    Given certain U.S. global strategic considerations, the same  makes Albania slightly special. NATO could get access to an  important port at Durres. Besides, Albania is an excellent  place for "keeping an eye" on the Balkans. The third exception  is the most developed country in the region, namely Slovenia,  which, to its misfortune, is still regarded as a former member  of Yugoslavia by the the United States and it is not part of the  Visegrad group. (In addition, Slovenia could have a border  debate with Croatia.)    Small Yugoslavia is last on the list and, together with  Bosnia, they are treated in a global policy connection rather  than an Eastern European connection. In Brussels, NATO  presented three conditions for the Serbs to avoid possible air  strikes: 1. The aid convoys must be allowed to enter  Srebrenica. 2. The Tuzla airport must be opened. 3. The  "strangling" of Sarajevo should end. These are the most clearly  formulated conditions, but who would be certain that the threat  is more serious this time. Besides, it is questionable whether  a Western military intervention is effective at all now that the  Serbs have practically won the war.    The United States' real dilemma now is which bad thing to  choose. If it accepts the international recognition of most of  the violent Serbian territorial gains, the moral and legal basis  of the new world order will suffer an almost irremediable  damage. In addition, this would lead to a long Muslim guerrilla  war, which would reopen the conflicts in Croatia as well. If  the United States wants to force the Serbs to come up with  serious territorial compromises, then it must send troops to  Bosnia and get involved in a serious war. It seems that the  slogan in Washington today is "No solution is the best  solution," and it continues to hope that the impoverished Serbia  would be forced to retreat sooner or later.    In conclusion, we must return to a factor that also  received some new color before and during Clinton's trip. The  United States has always regarded the situation of national and  ethnic minorities as a security factor in words. However, it  drew the conclusion that the more quiet the minorities stay, the  better. Washington never supported the demand for collective  minority rights in any form, mainly territorial autonomy. Now  Clinton repeatedly condemned the etnocentric nationalist state  and national concept, as well as the disadvantageous  discrimination on an ethnic basis, and he also stressed that  guaranteeing the democratic rights of national, ethnic, and  religious minorities is a global interest and, thus, it is also  important for the United States. Vice President Gore and  National Security Adviser Lake stressed for the first time that  the oppression of national minorities causes nationalism and  incites conflicts. Clinton concretely took a stand on behalf of  the Russian minorities in the Baltic, and his staff signalled  that the United States supports the idea that international  institutions and agreements should also guarantee the minority  rights.    In the first year of his presidency, Clinton concentrated on  U.S. domestic policy, and this will hardly change in the future.  However, the concrete balance of his European tour shows that  our wider and narrower region, including Hungary, receives a  place in shaping the new world order according to weight. It  has become clear to a correct and open Hungarian foreign policy  free of over or underestimation and a balanced foreign policy in  its issues and style that it is worth continuing the Visegrad  cooperation and the other subregional cooperation in the benefit  of our Western integration, and we must seek an honorable  rapprochement with our neighbors. The bad-taste rivalry, the  old-style maneuvering between big powers, and all kinds of  revanchism could only cause damage. On the other hand, a modern  foreign policy that is clear and acceptable to the big powers  and a foreign policy free of any exaggerated self-assertion can  only strengthen us. One should not "sell" the particular  Hungarian interests in any sense of the word; instead, we should  harmonize them with the common interests or big powers. And  there are more and better conditions for this now.</p>

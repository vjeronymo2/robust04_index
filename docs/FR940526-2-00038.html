No comments were received during the 30 day comment period. Therefore, the percentages for ``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the rate'' remain as proposed. The final minimum percentages are shown below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``High rate'' is defined as a minimum of 20 percent of graduates in academic years 1990&hyph;91, 1991&hyph;92 or 1992&hyph;93 who spend at least 50 percent of their worktime in clinical practice in the specified settings. Graduates who are providing care in a medically underserved community as a part of a fellowship or other educational experience can be counted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Significant increase in the rate'' means that, between academic years 1991&hyph;92 and 1992&hyph;93, the rate of placing graduates in the specified settings has increased by a minimum of 50 percent and that not less than 15 percent of graduates from the most recent year are working in these settings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Additional Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If additional programmatic information is needed, please contact: Ms. Donna English, Division of Nursing, Bureau of Health Professions, Health Resources and Services Administration, Parklawn Building, room 9&hyph;35, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857, Telephone: (301) 443&hyph;5763 FAX: (301) 443&hyph;8586. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This program, Grants for Nurse Anesthetist Education Programs, is listed at 93.916 in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs (as implemented through 45 CFR part 100).

Zelinskiy, Mowcow; UDC543.544]    [Abstract] Circulating chromatography is a variant of  chromatography where the mixture of substances is repeatedly  passed through a single column or system of columns. Preparative  circulating liquid chromatography, widely used abroad, employs  the closed loop principle and is used for separation of  substances in quantities ranging from milligrams to several  grams of ultra-pure compounds. While multiple recycling of  components through a column may separate portions of a mixture,  such factors as the dead volume of the circulating pump, the  duct work, dosimeters, and connecting joints become major  sources of contamination and undesired erosion of the  chromatographic band. Circulating two cycle chromatography has  been proposed as an alternative to the closed loop principle of  chromatography. The two cycle scheme requires no special pumps  or other elements. The theory of fine separation of binary  mixtures is expanded to include the possibility of programming  the length of the sorbent layer and using step-wise  chromatography. Theoretical analysis and calculations indicate  that two cycle circulating systems with two columns filled with  sorbent particles 10-35 microns in diameter provide high  resolution separation with low pressure drop between the  columns.

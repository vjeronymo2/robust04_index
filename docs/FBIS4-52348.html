			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the the </F> Social Democratic Party of Japan, by NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN; place  and date not given]    [Text] [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you plan to deal with  the new Hata administration?    [Murayama] In dealing with each and every issue, we will  take a free and unbiased approach. Since the Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ] has had a part in drawing up the fiscial  1994 budget, we have our responsibilities toward the people.  Therefore, we will cooperate with the cabinet in enacting the  budget and other relevant bills.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The idea of forming a parliamentary  group with Sakigake [Harbinger] and other parties has been  mentioned. What do you think of it?    [Murayama] I would give a positive consideration to the  idea. I would like to have formal talks with Sakigake when the  long consecutive holidays are over. Topics to be discussed will  include holding party heads' talks and forming an organ for  consultations.  <H5>  SDPJ-LDP Cooperation Is Different From Realignment </H5>   [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] In organizing a parliamentary group,  will you also consider inviting political parties other than  Sakigake?    [Murayama] We would like to cooperate with anyone, and it  does not matter whether they belong to the Japan New Party or  the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP]. We have had troubles with  the DSP but we were orginal partners in working out plans to get  all the liberal Social Democrats together.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How about your relations with the  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]?    [Murayama] I think we should cooperate with each other in  promoting the Diet operations. However, it has to be separated  from the issue on regrouping of political parties. In other  words, the point at issue lies in how various political forces  will be regrouped. And in actually promoting the Diet  operations, we will cooperate with the LDP on all the issues on  which we can cooperate with each other.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Following the enactment of the budget  bill, the LDP may call for a no-confidence vote in the cabinet.  In that case, will the SDPJ act in concert?    [Murayama] It would be desirable to make the decision  depending on the actual political situation at the time. At  present, Japan is suffering from economic stagnation and we have  various serious problems in both domestic and foreign affairs,  with the major one being our relations with the United States.  Therefore, it is preferable not to create a political vaccum at  the moment. However, if the new cabinet should come to a  deadlock and the only alternative left for the cabinet to break  the deadlock is to dissolve the lower house, then I would say  there is no other choice.  Having Signed the Policy Accord, SDPJ Still Has Its  Responsibilities [subhead]    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Among the major policy tasks, how do  you intend to tackle the tax reforms issue?    [Murayama] Since the SDPJ did sign the policy accord in  forming the new coalition government the other day, we still  have our responsibilities. Our activities will no longer be  restricted because we are no longer a member of the ruling  coalition. However, it does not follow that we will start anew  with a completely clean slate.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] You will not change your position of  tolerating an increase in the indirect tax rate. Is that right?    [Murayama] It should be based on the drastic revision of  inequalities in the tax system and on reduction of the  government expenditures. However, if the government should  clearly indicate the amount of funds needed for promoting  welfare measures for the country's aging population in the  future, and then explain that revenues gained from increased  indirect taxes will be used for this purpose, then I am sure it  will be able to win the people's understanding about the tax  reform. The point at issue lies in abruptly starting to  increase the current consumption tax rate. No opposition has  been voiced within our party to efforts to correct the ratio  between direct and indirect taxes.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] When will the SDPJ work out its  final conclusion?    [Murayama] Since the party's tax system research council has  already worked out guidelines, we would like to conduct  full-scale intraparty discussions on the basis of these  guidelines. I think our party plan will be worked out as early  as in June when the ruling parties are going to work out their  conclusions.  <H5>  SDPJ Split Is Impossible </H5>   [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How does the SDPJ plan to deal with  the issue of suspected nuclear arms development by DPRK (North  Korea)?    [Murayama] What is most important is to resolve this issue  through talks. If there is anything that the SDPJ can be of  service, we will do our best. Depending on the situation, a  delegation may be dispatched to the DPRK. When we were a member  of the ruling coalition, our activities were restricted. Now,  we can act on the basis of our independent decision.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] In the course of regrouping political  parties or in dealing with major policies, is there any  possibility that the intraparty confrontation between the  rightist and leftist factions will become intensified?    [Murayama] There are various policy groups within the party.  In the sense that they contribute to promoting the party's  vitality, it is most desirable. However, it will be undesirable  if their activities should go beyond the party's framework and  lead to the split of the party. It should be noted that the  whole party has taken concerted action in seceding from the  coalition this time. Therefore, it is impossible for the SDPJ  to split.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Have you been considering any  measures to increase the strength of the party executives?    [Murayama] We intend to give a briefing on the future course  the party should take and once again call for achieving party  unity at the Central Executive Committee session scheduled for  late May.</p>

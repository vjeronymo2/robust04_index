			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Call for talks to lift ban on GCHQ unions THE International Labour Organisation, the United Nations agency, has called for talks between the government and unions as a way of ending the block on union membership at the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) communications centre in Cheltenham. An ILO committee of experts has renewed its criticism of several aspects of British labour law in spite of hearing a defence of legislation from the government. Britain may be asked to explain further at the annual ILO conference to be held next month. Although the government could ignore the ruling by the committee of experts, it is a signatory to the ILO.</p>

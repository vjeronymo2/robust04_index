			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> UPGRADING BUILDINGS FOR QUAKES WEIGHED  </P> <P> Unreinforced masonry buildings in the Main Street business district of Garden  Grove must be upgraded to meet earthquake standards, under a draft ordinance  unveiled this week.  </P> <P> The proposal was presented Thursday to the city's Parking and Main Street  Commission, where it drew some criticism from commission and audience members  who said it placed too much of a financial burden on property owners.  </P> <P> California law requires that all cities adopt plans to mitigate potential  hazards of old brick buildings that are not strengthened with steel rods. A  survey of buildings in the downtown area, which dates back more than 100 years,  identified 12 structures that appeared to pose a potential hazard in case of a  major earthquake, according to Richard A. Peters, building services manager for  the city.  </P> <P> The proposal would offer owners two options in dealing with the problem. If  owners chose not to immediately anchor roofs and walls to eliminate the most  severe hazard -- a collapse -- all work to comply with the city's ordinance  would have to completed with three years. However, if the anchoring was done  within one year, the full compliance period would be stretched to five years.  </P> <P> Under the proposal, the property owner would pay for all repair work, but the  city is considering paying up to half the cost of engineering reports.  </P> <P> "The state is putting this on the city, and the city is putting this on us,"  said Tom Beem, a Main Street merchant and the commission chairman, referring to  the expenses of studies and planning. "I feel that the city should prove to us  that the building may be unsafe, and I feel that the city should pick up the  soft costs."  </P> <P> The total cost may be substantial, said one property owner. Dorothy Jordan, who  owns a doll shop on Main Street, said: "I had an engineer come out and tell me  it would cost $40,000 to bring the property up to where it would qualify for  earthquake insurance. I haven't got that kind of money."  </P> <P> Beem suggested that property owners and business people who would be affected  by the proposal work through the Main Street Merchants Assn. to ask the City  Council to pay more of the costs involved and to help arrange low-income  construction loans.  </P> <P> Under the proposed ordinance, if a building is not in compliance after the  deadline, an evacuation would be ordered. Non-complying buildings could later  be demolished. JIM TORTOLANO  </P></p>

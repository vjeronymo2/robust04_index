			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: 'Shadow tolls' for private investors - Transport The government last night appeared to have performed a U-turn by accepting that it would be prepared to pay 'shadow tolls' to investors in privately financed motorways. A statement issued by the Treasury said that promoters of private schemes would 'receive payments from the government in relation to the level of traffic using the road'. Ministers have previously rejected the use of shadow tolls, saying they removed much of the risk from investors. Officials said yesterday that the Department of Transport would hold 'early discussions with the construction industry and others to identify appropriate schemes'. The department expects to award the first contracts in about 18 months. In the longer term it expects to adopt a system of electronic motorway charging as soon as the technology is ready. The government also approved a string of schemes which it wants the private sector to finance, build and, in some cases, operate. These included a Pounds 600m modernisation of Britain's deteriorating west coast main railway line. A new Pounds 200m Scottish air traffic control centre for the Civil Aviation Authority is proposed, to expand capacity for flights to and across Scotland and the North Atlantic. A Pounds 100m project will extend the London Docklands Light Railway south from the Isle of Dogs via a new tunnel under the Thames to Lewisham. Bids will be invited during next year with a view to opening the new service in 1997-98. The chancellor cited the Aintree NHS Trust in Liverpool as a model of what the government wanted. Here, the private sector will build and operate a 100-bed low-dependency patient hotel, with conference and catering facilities in the grounds of Fazakerly Hospital. Other private sector finance initiatives include provision for new prisons and secure training centres. The budget also marked a shift in the balance of public spending on transport away from roads and towards rail and underground. According to the department's three-year projections, spending on the national road network will fall from Pounds 2.09bn in this financial year to Pounds 1.96bn in 1995-96. Spending on rail will fall from Pounds 1.5bn to Pounds 975m while London Transport will rise from Pounds 722m to Pounds 930m. Over the three years, however, spending on London Transport will be Pounds 364m less than projected earlier this year. London Transport said it was 'profoundly disappointed'.</p>

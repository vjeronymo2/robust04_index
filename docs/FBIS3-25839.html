And city officials pledge to invest more funds and expand  foreign trade.    The city, renowned for its scenic spot of West Lake, has  continued foreign expansion by improving the investment  environment, said the spokesman Shen Zheshou.    In 1993, 1,078 foreign-funded enterprises were approved in  the city, with investments of 357 million yuan ($41.03 million).    The total number of foreign-funded enterprises in the city  is  1,959, with an actual foreign input at $540 million, he said.    Meanwhile, the commodities special for foreign trade went up  to 11.18 billion yuan ($1.28 billion) last year, a 65.7 percent  increase over 1992.    More than $468 million worth of exports were done directly  by  the enterprises, which previously used foreign trade companies  as agents.    Shen added that five enterprises were set up abroad.    And city businessmen also signed more contracts to build  engineering projects in foreign countries.    The city's industrial achievements in other sectors during  the past year were also remarkable, said Shen.    The city has sped up its infrastructure construction and  renovated buildings to provide a sound investment climate in  1993.    The efforts have paid off.    Four State-level development zones have received 377  projects  worth $941.8 million. Construction of three provincial-level  economic and development zones is also underway, he added.    Total investment in fixed assets was up 45.6 percent over  1992 to 9.6 billion yuan ($1.1 billion).    And 17 major transportation projects, with an expected  investment of 2.3 billion yuan ($254 million), started  construction last year.</p>

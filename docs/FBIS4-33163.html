			<p>BFN     [Text] Luanda, 30 May (PL) -- The Angolan authorities have  always condemned the economic and commercial blockade imposed on  Cuba by the United States, Angolan Ambassador to Cuba Antonio  Burity Da Silva has stated.    In an extensive interview published today by the daily  JORNAL  DE ANGOLA, which has the greatest circulation here, Da Silva  said his government is opposed to the embargo Washington has  enforced on Havana for more than 30 years.    The diplomat also referred to the current relations between  this African state and the Latin American state, and he  described them as very positive.    He pointed out that following the political and economic  changes that have taken place in the world in recent years, ties  between the two countries had to be adjusted to the new  situation. Nevertheless, he advocated conserving the traditional  friendship between both peoples and governments.    The ambassador pointed out that mutual cooperation includes  a number of fields such as education and health, as well as  others. He added that this cooperation will tend to increase to  the degree Angola and Cuba emerge from their respective  difficult situations.    On the other hand, he described Cuban Foreign Minister  Roberto Robaina's visit to Luanda earlier this year as very  constructive. To this effect, he announced that Angolan Foreign  Minister Venacio Da Moura will soon be travelling to Cuba to  reciprocate Robaina's visit.</p>

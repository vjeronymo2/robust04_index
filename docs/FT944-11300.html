			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Company News (This Week): Ice cream sweetens third-quarter profits - Unilever Soaring ice cream sales could be the third-quarter success story Unilever chooses to highlight on Friday when it reports a rise of some 9 per cent in pre-tax profits to Pounds 710m. The Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, the world's largest ice cream maker, will be grateful for any topic which takes minds off its detergents war with Procter &amp; Gamble. Since this spring's launch of Persil Power washing powder in the UK and Omo Power on the continent, P&amp;G has exploited the products' flaw. Its manganese catalyst reacts with some dyes, leading to a deterioration in the textiles. Unilever says the problem is now under control. Unilever points out that the detergent forms only some 1 1/2 per cent of its global sales. The research, development and marketing expenditure on the powder has been large, however. Sales, sharply curtailed by bad publicity, are a long way from giving a reasonable return on the investment. Ice cream is a different story. Unilever has 40 per cent of the Pounds 6bn European market, and an upturn in the third quarter should lift total European profits, which were flat at the half-yearstage. North American profits should get a boost from the acquired Breyers ice cream business. Personal products, such as soaps and shampoos, and specialty chemicals, will also contribute to the upturn.</p>

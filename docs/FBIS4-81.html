			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Workers List Party official Sallim Valli, </F> Workers International Party official Leon Caesar, COSATU  official Neil Coleman, and Nactu offical Cunningham Ngcukana by  announcers Reggie Morobe and Xoli Mazibuko on the "Newsline"  program --live]    [Excerpts] [Mazibuko] Gentlemen, welcome to the studio. We  are joined now by gentlemen from the two organizations, new  political organizations so to speak, as well as the old  federations. Gentlemen, good evening to you and welcome.  Perhaps if I may start with the gentleman from the Workers List  Party, Sallim Valli. Tell me what was the need for the party to  be formed, and to claim that it's looking after the interests of  the workers so to speak.    [Valli] Well, for us in the Workers List Party, we are not a  new party in the sense that 80 to 90 percent of our members have  been involved for many years in trade unions, civic movements,  youth movements, women's movements. And that we feel that the  time for an independent political expression of the working  class and mass workers party -- the idea for a mass workers  party has come. It's not a new call, in 1982 the general  secretary of FOSATU [Federation of South Africa Trade Unions],  before the formation of COSATU [Congress of South African Trade  Unions], made that call. We believe that the interest of  workers against retrenchment for a living wage, a 35-hour week,  self-defense of working people, the right to work enshrined in  the constitution. The established political organizations are  working within the capitalist framework, and we believe that  those changes can only come about, that fundamental change can  only come about through the formation of such a political  expression, and the point is that we want real change, not a new  flag, more black faces in Parliament, that is not real change.    [Mazibuko] Let me just hold you there and see how Leon  Caesar  differs from you in this aspect. Do you differ from him in any  way?    [Caesar] Well, let me start off by saying why we in the  Workers International feel it is necessary to stay in this  election. You see the Nationalist [National] Party [NP] and the  Democratic Party [DP], they are the parties of the capitalist  class. Now the workers do not have a class that is, or, the  working class does not have a party that is really fighting in  the immediate and long-term interest, and we believe that the  parties that used to fight for the oppressed, foremost the ANC  [African National Congress] and the SACP [South African  Communist Party], we feel that they have now forsaken the  working class, and they are rather trying to prop up the  capitalists system, and we feel that the PAC [Pan-Africanist  Congress] is also going in that direction. So we feel that  workers in the [word indistinct] need their own party, but it  must be a party that is committed to socialism, to the overthrow  of, the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism, to  internationalism. So that is why we have decided to come out  now and to stay in this election, to put across....    [Mazibuko, interrupting] Let me see what divides you with  them, because I'm seeing similarities?    [Valli] If I can answer that: I think that we in the Workers  List Party acknowledge the sacrifices made by tens of thousands  of people who support the ANC, PAC, Azapo [Azanian People's  Organization], etc. We don't think that we have the Holy Grail,  we are not a vanguard party in that sense. We put forward the  need for a mass workers party so that even people in those  organizations, who have sacrificed much, can join hands with us,  so that together, we will form a movement for a mass workers  party. We don't believe we are the workers' party.    [Morobe] If I'm to come in here, what you're just speaking  about, isn't it the duties of the unions. Neil, isn't it what  you are supposed to be doing? What is different that they'll do  that you fail to do now?    [Coleman] Well, the question is, Reggie, who has the  capacity  to implement a program which will improve the lives of ordinary  people, the lives or workers in this country, and we believe,  yes it is the trade unions, it is the civic movements and so on,  we also believe that the organization like the African National  Congress have a track record, they have a history, they have a  program, a reconstruction and development program, which would  enable them to improve the lives of ordinary people. So we're  not against anyone forming a political party, even soccer clubs  have formed a party, but the question is who is going to really  change the lives of people.    [Valli] And that is the point because if you look at the  reconstruction and development program. If you look at the  apartmeid debt, the apartheid regime has got a debt of 186  billion rand, and interest on that debt is about 3 billion  rands. The future state, the ANC, regardless of their good  intentions cannot use the money for social spending, because  they are trapped in the debt...    [Morobe, interrupting] Cunningham, you could come in here.  He  is talking about the debts and from the manifesto they say they  will not even repay the IMF monies and the World Bank monies.  Isn't this a disaster for the workers?    [Ngcukana] Let me explain. As Nactu [National Council of  Trade Unions], we recognize that we are living within a  particular social, economic, and international order. There is  no way that we can operate an economy in isolation.  International trade has linked many countries. I do have  sympathy for the views that they are expressing, but the reality  on the ground is a different thing. Recently, we have had Daniel  Ortega having to step down because of international economic  pressure to be able to get a loan, to ensure that Nicaragua  survives. Now, the reality of the international loans, we would  live with it. However, the question will be: How would a  future democratic government use those loans? That is the  fundamental question. There is no way you can say that we will  not be able to repay debts. It is simply -- South Africa will  be cut off and will not function, and even that government that  says so, that is about not repaying international loans, will  not even survive a day because of the international reality.    [Morobe] But I am seeing here four organizations and all  their base line is workers. Can't we have one formation, one  federation?    [Ngcukana] No, they are a political party trying to raise  pertinent issues on a political level. We are a trade union  operating on a day-to-day basis defending the working people.  The question of them coming up, I must say that yes, everybody  has got a democratic right to form his or her own organization,  but what we have to understand is in the class sense whatever is  happening in this country it is the realization of what has been  called a bourgeois revolution. It is coming to an end of its  cycle. Given those realities and the realities of the economic  situation in the country, we would need to hold each others'  hands and work together and to make the country work, to ensure  that our people have jobs, to ensure that people have got  housing. Yes, it is important to have dreams and hopes.    [Morobe] Let me come in there. Workers International, are  you not using this as another band wagon to come into power?    [Caesar] No, no, no. Not at all. We believe also that there  is a place in society for the trade unions as well as a place  for political parties and that they should exist separately.  But what differs us, the Workers International, from the  Workers List Party: In our manifestos there are two points which  are really very different. We lay very strong emphasis on the  reactionarm role of Stalinism and the need to expose and combat  Stalinism. The Workers List Party does not even mention  Stalinism within their manifesto. Secondly, we emphasize that we  can only achieve socialism by means of a revolutionary overthrow  of capitalism, and the Workers List Party also doesn't refer to  the need of a revolutionary overthrow. I would like to just pose  something...    [Morobe, interrupting] We do not have much time. Can I let  you bring in, maybe sum it up. Is this doing the workers, the  future workers, any good?    [Coleman] Well, democracy is good for workers, conflicting  ideas, but workers don't eat ideology. We have to improve their  living conditions, we have to improve their wages, we have to  put in place a political system and an economic system which is  in their interest. We believe that the Reconstruction and  Development Program of the ANC and the tripartite alliance  attempts to do that in a systematic way. That is why COSATU is  calling not only on our own members, but on all working people  in these elections to vote for the ANC.    [Mazibuko] Let me go back to the gentlemen representing  trade  unions. One would read in this set up a whole issue of  deficiencies within the two federations to a point that people  believe they now have to get on the band wagon, form up their  own political parties and go to parliament and to represent  themselves. And what do you tell me?    [Ngcukana] No, they are not deficiencies, Xoli. Our position  as NACTU is simple. Given the present conditions, we are saying  to the workers let them go and vote for the parties that have  historically fought oppression and to vote against the  oppressor. We are not saying which political party they should  vote for because our members come from different backgrounds.  It does not mean that in future we will not consider a position  regarding the interests of the working people. We are saying  let the working people go and vote and vote against the  oppressors, and vote for those who have historically fought for  freedom.    [Mazibuko] Come in, Neil. What do you think? Are you [words  indistinct]?    [Coleman] Yeah. I think the reality is that the vast  majority of our members support the ANC. In a survey which we  did two years ago, we discovered that 96 percent of our shop  stewards were going to vote for the ANC. This is a reality.  The majority of ANC supporters are workers and workers's  families. [passage omiteed]    [Mazibuko] Do you see in this gentleman wishful thinking?    [Coleman] To a certain extent, yes, there is an element of  wishful thinking, but let them speak for themselves.    [Valli] Can I say that wishful thinking is the  Reconstruction  and Development Program, although the basic objectives are  laudable -- housing, employment, etc. -- it cannot be achieved  under capitalism. In the workers charter, which we spent over a  year developing and a quarter of a million rands, where are  those demands? Nationalization without compensation, which the  biggest affiliate of COSATU made? The IMF-World Bank loans? I  think the problem is that throughout the world, through the  structural adjustments policies of the IMF-World Bank they have  impoverished economies. THE FINANCIAL MAIL has projected in  the year 2003 South Africa would owe, its debt would be 119  billion rand. The state....    [Mazibuko, interrupting] Okay, let's (?put aside) the  economic jargon tonight. Let me bring you back to reality, the  people are reading situations here like, we have seen people  climbing on the band wagon of Christianity. We are now seeing  people climbing on the band wagon of workers parties?    [Valli] Xoli, our members have fought to build the trade  union movement. We have many of our members who spent years on  Robben Island. We haven't just come into the struggle today.  We have been around in the union movement, in the civic  movement. I need to say that what we are talking about is  eminently realistic.    [Mazibuko] Let me bring Leon in on this issue. How long will  it take to address some of these issues, to build a socialistic  economy to build an economy that will look after the interests  of workers?    [Caesar] The time to do it isn't really a question. The  question now is that we have to build a strong revolutionary  workers party to overthrow the capitalist system, to begin that  socialist reconstruction. But I would like to address something  that you mentioned about parties jumping on the band wagon. Our  party has been around for about two or three years. We have  worked underground for a few years, and we have got a number of  members that are working within the trade union, within  unaffiliated organizations. Now, I would like to pose something  to the COSATU person. The comrade said that they recognize the  right of parties like ours to exist, but the reality is that  many of our members within the unions, that are in COSATU, they  are being harassed. Why? Because they said, look, it is my  right to vote for any party, and they said they are members of  the Workers International. So some of them are actually getting  some pressure, and I would like COSATU to make a very  unambiguous statement around this issue.    [Coleman] Sure. We would say that the comrades have the  right to operate, but on the other hand he said they are  operating underground. Now, organizations have been unbanned  since 1990 and we think this sort of tactic of entering into  organizations secretly and so on, the trade union is an open  organization. There should be no need to operate underground.  So I think that is an important point to note.    [Valli] Our views have always been open. Comrade Neil,  Comrade Cunningham knows us. We have stood for our views in the  trade unions. We have always fought alongside those workers in  COSATU. Most of our members come from COSATU, Nactu, and  affiliated unions.    [Mazibuko] Gentlemen? I am afraid we have run out of time.  My producer is breathing down my neck, and I need to close  shop. Thank you very much for coming through.</p>

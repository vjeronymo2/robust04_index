			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Japan relaxes controls on share purchases JAPAN'S ministry of finance yesterday relaxed controls on share purchases by individual investors, but the announcement failed to revive turnover on a still ailing Tokyo stock market. Under new regulations, foreshadowed in emergency measures announced in August, individual investors will be allowed to accumulate share holdings in a chosen company by progressively investing a minimum of Y10,000 (Pounds 53) with a securities house. The ministry also said controls on employee share ownership schemes will be eased, allowing members to change their monthly contributions at any time, instead of the present once or twice a year. Also, these schemes will be extended to include stocks traded on the over-the-counter (OTC) market. Japanese brokers hope the changes will encourage individuals to increase their share purchases over the longer term, but said the measures were unlikely to inspire an immediate leap in share trading. The Nikkei market average rose a meagre 20.06 to 16,437.11 in thin trading. The measures have been discussed for several years, but the finance ministry quickened its consideration and signalled the rule changes when the Nikkei average hit 14,301.49 in August. Individual investors' enthusiasm for stock purchases has been cooled by the collapse of prices since December 1989, and by a spate of securities industry scandals last year, when leading brokers admitted that they compensated corporate customers for trading losses. The share of stocks held by individuals has fallen from 27.9 per cent of the total in 1980 to 20.3 per cent last year. Sales of stock investment trusts, preferred by individual investors, have fallen two thirds over the past two years, while redemptions last year were more than four times higher than in 1989. Officials at the Japan Securities Dealers' Association said individuals would return to the market if the finance ministry agreed to tax breaks on dividend income and capital gains. The ministry has given no indication that it will soon provide those tax breaks. A separate securities industry body, the Conference for Securities Associations, said a rise in individual investment would provide greater liquidity in a market clogged by corporate cross-shareholdings that are rarely traded. The body advised Japanese companies to increase their dividend payments, though falling profits this year have forced many companies to cut dividends.</p>

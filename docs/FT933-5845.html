			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / UK Company News: BM to float Austoft arm on Australian SE BM GROUP, the engineering company currently undergoing a programme of disposals and debt reduction, is to float its Austoft Holdings subsidiary on the Australian Stock Exchange. The sale will raise ADollars 36m (Pounds 16m). Austoft, which makes sugar cane and harvesting machinery, will also waive net loans due from BM of ADollars 11m. Mr Howard Sutton, BM chief executive, said the group was taking advantage of the improvement in the Australian stock market. The net effect of the sale would be to reduce net borrowings by about ADollars 30m. BM has borrowings in excess of Pounds 100m and has had its banking facilities extended until next Monday. Earlier this month it announced the sale of BM Plant and Talbot Diesels, its UK distribution businesses, to a management team. The company said yesterday that discussions were progressing satisfactorily with its bankers on longer term financing arrangements. The sale of BM's 75 per cent stake in British Building &amp; Engineering Appliances remains on schedule for the autumn, as do plans to dispose of its remaining construction equipment distribution business. BM paid ADollars 30m for Austoft and Mustang of the US, which it retains, in 1989. Austoft made pre-tax profits of ADollars 7.5m for the year to end-June, when net assets stood at ADollars 32.6m.</p>

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / How To Spend It: Jonathan, Sophie and the perils of the falling pound - Sterling crises, credit binges, a huge bill - what is a gal to do? Buy British MY FRIEND Sophie is not usually given to spending much time pondering the problems of ERM, economic convergences and the like, but currently these matters are furrowing her perfect little brow. From her aerobics-honed, Dior-clad legs to her chic and shining bob, Sophie looks expensive. Sophie IS expensive. She lunches at San Lorenzo's or Le Caprice, buys jackets from Chanel or Valentino. As for shoes, at the moment she is awfully fond of her dear little Pounds 200 Stephane Kelian boots, and if she needs something new will often run into Robert Clergerie to see what he has to offer. To some Pounds 200 might seem extravagant but when you have Sophie's . . . well, taste and refinement were the only words that came to mind . . . then the other choices scarely bear thinking about. Then there's her clutch of Prada handbags which she uses when she feels that the padded ones with the interlocked Cs may look just a little obvious. Her watch (a present from Jonathan on that first trip to Paris) is by Boucheron, her pearls by Mellerio and round her groomed trim person there swirls the tantalising, elusive smell of Shalimar. No vulgar New World sock-it-to-'em power scents for her. Sophie, however, is worried. As she toys with her bold and witty gilt belt - she had rushed into the new Lacroix boutique the very day it opened and couldn't resist it - the matter of her last trip to Paris is beginning to prey on her mind. Jonathan had been distinctly tetchy when last month's credit card bills came rolling in and any minute now the bill for Paris would be arriving. The Chanel jacket which had seemed extravagant enough at FFr12,000 was going to emerge on the credit card bill at somewhere round Pounds 1,440 instead of the Pounds 1,200 she had calculated. There had been the new winter coat (oh, such a delicious shade of blue) from Lagerfeld, the Prada shoes, the Hermes handbag . . . Well, Sophie, take heart. Resolve to turn over a new leaf. I know you were so hoping for something from dear Karl's first collection for Chloe but there are, believe it or not, some alternatives, much nearer home, which can be bought in poor old devalued pounds. First, do try and remember that labels are very, very '80s. Try and be a '90s person. The '90s are all about caring, ecology, quiet refinement, about quality without ostentation. Take it from me: labels are OUT, OUT, OUT. Scarves and scarf-print shirts are all the rage. Take a look at English Eccentrics and I think you will be happily surprised. Luscious creamy silk, heavenly colours, prints that are both bold and subtle. But best of all has to be the price - the shirts are Pounds 295, the scarves, Pounds 89 (you will know better than anybody that at Hermes the shirts are Pounds 750, the scarves Pounds 129). I know, Sophie, that you are addicted to subtle French perfumes - and being a Shalimar addict I sympathise - but at Pounds 44 for 100ml of eau de toilette and, grrr, Pounds 180 for 60 mls of the parfum it is good to know there are other options. All the sweet, old-fashioned single floral notes are very 'in' and nobody does them better than Penhaligon's and Czech &amp; Speake. Look out for Penhaligon's Lily of the Valley, Bluebell, Gardenia, Violetta, Orange Blossom, for Czech &amp; Speake's Mimosa, Rose and Neroli. And don't forget Floris - old-fashioned, traditional, understated, classy. Try Stephanotis, another single-note floral, or Zinnia or Edwardian Bouquet, (Pounds 28.50 for 15ml of perfume, Pounds 32.50 for 200 ml of toilet water). I think the prices will please Jonathan. Talking of Jonathan reminds me - remember Geo f. Trumper, whose clutch of colognes and aftershaves are among the classiest in the world. Extract of Limes, Wellington, Curzon, Marlborough - nostalgic names, nostalgic prices - from Pounds 11.25 to Pounds 17.40. When it comes to shoes I am sure you will agree there is hardly anyone to beat Manolo Blahnik for sheer glamour, but Jonathan would not approve of the prices. So take a trip to Emma Hope, to Johnny Moke, to Patrick Cox. At Gina Shoes, 42, Sloane Street, Knightsbridge, London SW3 three of London's best shoemakers - Gina, Jimmy Choo and Emma Hope - now sell their wares under just one roof. For the new caring '90s, knitwear is the thing - ecologically sound, so much softer than all those sharp jackets. Here you are in luck, Britain has the best knitwear in theworld. Take a look at Marion Foale, at Nicole Farhi,at Joseph, and then there is always cashmere which has fallen steadily in price over the last two years. John Smedley has become a cult name, sought after by the world's most discriminating shoppers as well as top houses such as Hermes, Comme des Garcon, Ralph Lauren. Take a look at the new secondskin range - simple but sophisticated and all in the fine-gauge wool John Smedley is so famous for. When it comes to handbags there is a problem. Britain has not produced a must-have number since the fashion set took a fancy to proper cartridge bags. There are names that are high on quality but less alluring when it comes to design and others that have sassy designs but whose quality is suspect. For sloping into supermarkets or for weekends in the country you couldn't do better than Mulberry. Bill Amberg (The Conran Shop has a good selection) is another name to look for. I know they aren't quite the thing for swirling at The Caprice but they have an appealing sturdy Englishness that makes a nice change from your sassy foreign numbers. And once again you will be happily surprised by the prices. So, Sophie, the falling pound need not spell sartorial disaster. British products may not shout so loudly as their continental equivalents but they have a life, a personality all their own and by and large they are a whole lot cheaper. Vive, say I, la difference.</p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LA JOLLA PLAYHOUSE SNARES A FUGARD PREMIERE;  </P> <P> THEATER: SOUTH AFRICAN'S PLAY TO BE THE CENTERPIECE OF A SEASON THAT ALMOST  WASN'T.  </P> <P> Perseverance paid off big for La Jolla Playhouse this year.  </P> <P> Des McAnuff, the playhouse's artistic director, pursued Athol Fugard's newest  play, "My Children! My Africa!" with a tenacity that convinced the renowned  South African playwright to direct its West Coast premiere at the Playhouse. It  will be the centerpiece of the 1990 season, July 8-Aug. 12 at the Mandell Weiss  Theatre.  </P> <P> "My Children! My Africa!" joins two world premieres by veteran Playhouse  artists Geoff Hoyle and Keith Reddin and Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" in the  six-play season that extends from May 13-Nov. 18. The last two shows, which  have yet to be announced, may be classical or new musicals or dramas, McAnuff  said.  </P> <P> The season was assembled despite the threat that there would be no season. It  was only two weeks ago that the playhouse announced that its fund-raisers had  produced $60,000 over the $500,000 McAnuff said was needed by Dec. 31 to ensure  the 1990 season. The theater still needs to raise an additional $440,000 by  June 30 to achieve financial stability. "But I see a light shining now," said  McAnuff. "We're still here and we're talking about the season."  </P> <P> The Fugard play, which closed in January at the 99-seat New York Theatre  Workshop, was inspired by a tragic incident about a black South African teacher  trying to work within the apartheid system. It marks a return to the overtly  political subjects Fugard has slowly veered away from in his increasingly  inward-looking works like "The Road to Mecca" and "A Place With the Pigs."  </P> <P> Still, Fugard, who is white, said in a telephone interview that despite its  theme, this play is, if anything, more personal than anything else he has  written. That effect was heightened when he cast and directed his own daughter,  Lisa Fugard, in the part of the white student who comes to look at the black  teacher as a mentor and father figure.  </P> <P> "I do think in a way that the black schoolteacher is an intellectual and  emotional portrait of myself," said Fugard. "I stand for what he stands for --  the faith in the power of words which I have him articulate in this play. He's  a man who believes in non-violence."  </P> <P> The theater's pursuit of Fugard's play began as far back as last August when  Susan Hilferty, who designed the set for its premiere at the Market Theatre in  Johannesburg, South Africa in June, came to the Playhouse to design "The  Misanthrope" and told McAnuff about the play. McAnuff read the script and --  through sheer persistence, according to Fugard -- persuaded him to direct his  first show on the West Coast.  </P> <P> "Des and Robert Blacker (associate director of the Playhouse) read it and they  said, 'My God, we'd like to do this,' and they stayed very firm in their  desire. I drove down to (La Jolla to) see 'Macbeth' and that confirmed my  desire to do the play here."  </P> <P> "I think it's one of the great plays," confirmed McAnuff. "(It's) going to be  pertinent for a long time to come. There's just a lot of joy and humanity in  the writing. We were lucky he let us read this play when it was hot off the  press. Someone watched me reading it, and said before I even said anything,  'You really liked that play, didn't you.' I was very moved."  </P> <P> All three of the play's role are being re-cast for La Jolla's production.  </P> <P> The playhouse season will open with "Twelfth Night," under McAnuff's direction,  May 13-June 17 at the Mandell Weiss Theatre. The premiere of Reddin's "Life  During Wartime," a black comedy about a home security system salesman, is  slated for June 24-July 29 in the Warren Theatre. Les Waters, who staged  Reddin's "Nebraska" at the playhouse last year, will direct.  </P> <P> Hoyle, whose La Jolla Playhouse production of "The Fool Show" is headed for New  York in the spring under the title "Feast of Fools," is still developing an as  yet untitled show to run in the Warren Theatre Aug. 12-Sept. 16.  </P></p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow steady amid worries on Iraq raid Wall Street IN SPITE OF the Gulf crisis, US share prices ended mostly unchanged yesterday in trading that was quieter than usual because of the Martin Luther King Day holiday, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 3.79 at 3,274.91. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.31 off at 436.84, while the Nasdaq composite was 0.98 firmer at 698.13. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled a modest 197m shares. The market opened in a cautious mood with investors and dealers unsettled by the latest attack by US and allied forces on strategic military targets in Iraq. The renewal of hostilities has upset the market, which had thought that late January would be a period for concentrating on fourth-quarter corporate results and a relatively smooth handover of power between the outgoing Republican and incoming Democratic administrations. BankAmerica moved ahead Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 49 1/2 on reports that the West Coast banking group was close to selling as much as Dollars 2bn in bad real estate loans and properties to Morgan Stanley Realty Fund. The news, regarded as an indication that conditions in the depressed US property market may be improving, lifted other bank shares, notably Chase Man-hattan, up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 30 1/2 , and Citicorp, Dollars  5/8 ahead at Dollars 23 5/8 . Xerox dropped Dollars 3 7/8 to Dollars 82 3/4 on news that the document processing group is shedding its remaining financial services operations (which will cost Xerox a Dollars 778m after-tax charge in the fourth quarter) and considering issuing Dollars 500m of new equity. Tucson Electric Power was the day's most active NYSE stock, firming Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 2 3/4 in volume of 6.7m shares as investors continued to be encouraged by last week's completion of a restructuring plan. Boeing put on Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 37 1/2 in heavy trading on news that it had won a Dollars 525m contract to supply 12 new 737 jets to Royal Air Maroc, a Moroccan carrier. On the Nasdaq market, Centocor plummeted Dollars 11 1/8 to Dollars 6 5/8 in volume of 10m shares on news that clinical trials and European sales of the company's lead product, Centoxin, had been suspended after an unusually high number of patients died while taking part in research on the drug. Canada TORONTO was mixed overall, but weak pipeline and real estate issues exerted downward pressure on the TSE 300 index, which finished 11 points lower at 3,295.6, although advancing stocks exceeded declines by 315 to 309. Volume came to 36m shares. The pipeline sector index fell 1.8 per cent, real estate lost 1.3 per cent and industrial products declined 1.1 per cent.</p>

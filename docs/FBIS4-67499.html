			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 2 (YONHAP) -- Russia is reportedly poised  to include an environmental conservation provision as well as  human rights protection in its new logging agreement with North  Korea amid criticism over serious environmental depletion at  Pyongyang-administered logging camps in Siberia, a Foreign  Ministy official here said Monday.    International environmental groups have revealed that  forests  in the area have been severly damaged due to poor afforestation  by the North Korean logging camps, the official said.    Russia will therefore push for a provision toughening  environmental regulations as well as human rights protection in  its new logging contract with North Korea, he said.    Pyongyang and Moscow are negotiating renewal of the  contract,  which expired at last year's end, but North Korea's  unwillingness to accept the human rights protection provision is  posing a hurdle.    ``International environmental groups are warning that if  logging continues in Siberia, there will be major environmental  problems since the Siberian forests are one of the world's major  oxygen suppliers,'' the official said.    Greenpeace International says more than 15,000 North Korean  workers at the logging camps randomly kill wild animals,  including bears.    The current North Korea-Russia logging agreement has a  provision on afforestation after logging, but Moscow wants to  toughen regulations, the official said.</p>

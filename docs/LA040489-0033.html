			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Pickens Buys Japanese Shares: Corporate raider T. Boone Pickens Jr. has become  the largest shareholder of Koito Manufacturing Co., a leading auto parts  supplier closely affiliated with Toyota Motor Corp., securities industry  sources said in Tokyo. It's thought to be the first time a U.S. raider has made  a major investment in a Japanese-listed company, sources said. Pickens appears  to have purchased 20% of the outstanding common shares of Koito from Azabu  Jidosha, a prominent real estate speculator, the sources said. The purchase  made Toyota, with a 19% interest, the firm's second-largest shareholder, they  said. Koito's share price has been rising in recent months, apparently because  of Pickens' purchases, sources said.  </P></p>

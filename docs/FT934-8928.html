			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Pasminco plans to raise ADollars 88m PASMINCO, the Australian zinc and lead producer, yesterday announced plans to raise ADollars 88m (USDollars 58m) of new capital by a private placement of 72.1m new shares at ADollars 1.22 each, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. The move will increase Pasminco's issued capital by about 10 per cent. Pasminco's two biggest shareholders, CRA and North Broken Hill Peko will both participate in the issue, subscribing for approximately 21.6m shares, or 3 per cent of the pre-placement issued capital. This is the maximum they are allowed to subscribed for under the Australian law. CRA and North Broken Hill will fund the purchase by converting approximately ADollars 26.4m of a Dollars 40m drawn portion of a loan facility which they have provided to Pasminco. The total facility is for ADollars 100m. Pasminco said that it would use the funds to reduce debt, which has already fallen recently due to the sale of a UK zinc smelter to MIM. It added that negotiations with the Dutch authorities over the Budelco zinc smelter in the Netherlands, in which it holds a 50 per cent interest, had 'progressed constructively' and it expects agreement to be reached before the end of 1993.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 15 March (NOTIMEX) -- Today,  Colombian Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos denied a  Cuban report that he would travel to Cuba in April to sign a  trade agreement between the two nations. "My schedule is full,"  the official said in statements published Tuesday in the  influential newspaper EL TIEMPO.    According to media reports from Cuba, the two countries will  sign a trade agreement in Havana next April at a ceremony which  Santos will attend. "My visit to Cuba is still not definite",  the Colombian trade minister said in explaining that "the  agreement only revises the partial agreement Colombia has with  Cuba within the framework of the Latin American Integration  Association (ALADI)."    According to Cuban versions, a bilateral delegation recently  studied the treaty. It reviewed tariffs and analyzed a list of  more than 800 products to be included in the document.    Santos' denial was made within the framework of an offensive  against Cuba by local right-wing groups as a result of the  release of information on the presumed presence of Colombian  guerrilla commanders in Cuba.    The Santa Fe de Bogota newspaper EL TIEMPO published this  story shortly after Mines and Energy Minister Guido Nule  returned from Cuba and announced Colombia would sell between  15,000 and 20,000 barrels of oil per day to the island. Colombia  and Cuba renewed diplomatic relations on 28 October after a  12-year suspension given the Cuban Government's presumed  interference in Colombia's internal affairs.</p>

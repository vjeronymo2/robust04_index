			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Sunday bill creates size anomaly Wednesday night's vote in the Commons for partial de-regulation of Sunday trading sweeps away the restrictions of the 1950 Shops Act and will allow all shops in England and Wales to open legally for at least six hours on Sundays. But if the Sunday trading bill becomes law next year it will leave one important anomaly. A store of slightly less than 280 sq m (about 3,000 sq ft) would be allowed to open freely, while one just above - whose range of goods may be no bigger - would be restricted to six hours. All shops larger than 280 sq m will be allowed to open for a continuous period of up to six hours between 10am and 6pm. They must, however, observe certain rules, including notifying their local authority 14 days before they plan to open, and displaying their permitted opening times. There are maximum fines of Pounds 5,000 for failing to notify the authority and for trading longer than six hours, and of Pounds 500 for failing to display the opening hours. Some categories of shops, such as pubs, petrol stations, and restaurants are not restricted to six hours but can open at any time. Shops in Scotland, where Sunday trading is fully de-regulated, will continue to enjoy the right to open at any time. The winning option, put forward by the Shopping Hours Reform Council, avoids many of the complications that would have arisen from the strict regulation option put forward by Retailers for Shops Act Reform and the Keep Sunday Special Campaign. Opponents of wider Sunday opening have claimed that the partial de-regulation option is in fact a thinly disguised version of total de-regulation. Retail experts, however, say the six-hour restriction will limit the opening of larger stores by making it unprofitable for many of them to do so.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jose Maria Mayrink: "Church Prepares To </F> Influence Elections"]    [Text] Sao Paulo -- The Catholic Church wants to debate  parties and politicians regarding the country's situation and  proposed solutions to the economic crisis on the basis of  conclusions reached at the Second Brazilian Social Week, which  the CNBB [National Conference of Brazilian Bishops] will sponsor  in July to influence this year's elections. The results of the  debates at that meeting will be supplied to the candidates for  president of the republic, and they will be invited to  participate in the closing session.    "This project of ours dates back to 1992, but we decided to  postpone the end of the discussion until the last half of the  year because 1994 is an election year, and it will provide an  excellent opportunity to reflect on political education and the  exercise of citizenship," says Demetrio Valentini, bishop of  Jales, Sao Paulo, and head of the CNBB's Pastoral Commission on  Social Affairs.    The objectives and agenda of the Second Social Week, the  topic of which is "Brazil, Alternatives and Protagonists," will  be announced on the 24th of this month by Bishop Demetrio and  the president of the CNBB, Bishop Luciano Mendes de Almeida. "We  will publish the text that will serve as the working document  for debate on the basis of the conclusions reached at the  "regional weeks" which, over the past two years, have resulted  in viable alternatives for building the Brazil that people  want," Demetrio announced.    Depending on the results of the debates in Brasilia, the  CNBB  will publish or recommend that the bishops of Brazil's 245  dioceses publish booklets providing guidance for the elections.  The head of the Pastoral Commission on Social Affairs points out  that the church's concern is not limited to the electoral  aspect; it will take advantage of this opportunity to discuss  the future of Brazil.    "Even if we publish booklets, study notes, or any other kind  of document, we are not going to endorse parties or candidates.  We will draw attention to values and principles that will  provide the voters with norms so they can make the best  choices," Demetrio said. The church intends to influence the  process, he admits, but without engaging in partisan politics.  "We want to lay the foundation so that no matter who wins the  election, there will be a consensus capable of ensuring the  country's governability."    The CNBB is also concerned about the tone of the campaign:  "The campaign must not be reduced to personal attacks, because  the people are expecting the candidates to present their ideas  and proposals," the bishop warns. Regardless of their  ideological leanings, all the politicians vying for the most  important offices -- especially the posts of state governor and  president of the Republic -- will be invited to debate their  programs.  <H5>  Booklets for Sao Paulo Faithful </H5>   Two episcopal regions in the Archdiocese of Sao Paulo --  Brasilandia and Santana, both in the capital's Northern Zone --  are already preparing booklets to provide voters with guidance.  Neither of the two will mention the names of candidates or  parties, but their documents, written in colloquial style, will  draw attention to good qualities and denounce manipulations as a  way of helping the faithful make their choices.    The work is being done by groups from the Pastoral  Commission  on Faith and Politics, which are debating alternatives to the  national crisis. "We have the support of our bishop, Angelico  Bernardino, but he is not intervening directly in the  discussion," says social worker Fatima de Araujo Giorlano, one  of the coordinators of the Brasilandia group. The bishop is  merely supervising the publications to ensure that they conform  to the doctrine of the Catholic Church.    At the Alceu Amoroso Lima Center in the Santana episcopal  region, the Pastoral Commission on Faith and Politics vows that  in this year's elections, it will repeat the success it had with  a booklet published in connection with the election of the mayor  and municipal councilors in 1992. "Norma and Maximo, the two  people who illustrated the texts on the municipal elections,  will be back to do their best to convince people that it is  important to vote," said bank employee Sonia Maria Gimenez, the  center's secretary.    The head of the Episcopal Vicariate for Builders of Society,  Canon Dario Bevillacqua, has announced that the Archdiocese of  Sao Paulo will not publish a general booklet because it prefers  to leave that job to the pastoral groups.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Slovak President Michal Kovac visited Slovak  Radio today. He replied to questions by almost 100 journalists  from Slovak Radio and other domestic and foreign media. [passage  omitted]    Kovac briefed them about the international position of  Slovakia and steps being taken to strengthen it. [passage  omitted]    During his visit, the president gave a more extensive  interview to the program "Afternoon on the Radio." We have  excerpted the following passages:    [Begin Kovac recording] In the last period, I would say  within the past four to five weeks, I have really had many  meetings. I received positive news during almost all of them,  at last some positive news about Slovakia, positive news about  the fact that the government is succeeding on the home front in  consolidating the political situation, in stabilizing it--but  most of all, that the government has succeeded in awakening the  necessary trust abroad.    Of course, I was interested in finding out why this did not  happen earlier--what the reasons were for our image not  developing positively and why representatives of individual  states were ignoring Slovakia when talking on various occasion  about possible incorporation into the West European structures.  Regrettably--and this was for me a very unpleasant discovery  that I have to bring into the open--this was mostly connected  with the persona of the [former] prime minister rather than with  the overall activity of the [former] government.    At this point, it is not up to me to analyze the reasons for  this state of affairs. I am only stating the fact, and I  consider it necessary for the former prime minister himself to  analyze, possibly together with others, the reasons for that  situation. I think Slovakia cannot solve its problems without  gaining the necessary trust in the East as well as in the West,  in the United States, Canada, and elsewhere. Furthermore, I  wish to say that the present government, which has succeeded in  gaining a good reputation, should be aware that it has to go on  fighting to keep it. It is not sufficient to gain trust for the  time being. It is a matter that should continue because it may  also easily disappear. I firmly believe that the individual  ministers are aware of this and also that their activities  abroad have contributed to the more positive image Slovakia has  finally achieved.

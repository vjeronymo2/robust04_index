			<p>BFN     [Text] Afghan Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar [as heard]  rejected yesterday's proposal by Borhanoddin Rabbani, the  president of that country, about the formation of a grand  decision-making council in Afghanistan within the next 40 days.    Hekmatyar, who was speaking at an interview with the Central  News Unit in Kabul, said the motive behind forming that council  was to extend the term of the presidency of Borhanoddin Rabbani  and prolong the war and killings in Afghanistan.    He also declared his agreement with the formation of a  coalition government and powersharing between the country's  political parties and groups.    The Afghan prime minister also called for the holding of  general elections in that country by a neutral government  acceptable to all political parties and groups, but did not  refer to the manner of forming that neutral government.</p>

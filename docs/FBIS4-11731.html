			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Capitalizing on Politicization of Hajj"] </F>   [Text] This spring provides an auspicious opportunity for  the leadership of Saudi Arabia to prove its good will towards  all Muslims including the people of the Islamic Republic by  making independent policy decisions relating to the Organization  of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the handling of the  Hajj pilgrimage.    Due to their economic and political potentials, Iran and  Saudi Arabia are capable of bringing about stability and a  spirit of cooperation in the Persian Gulf region and the Middle  East as a whole.    The key role played by both countries in the world's oil  markets, their proximity to the Persian Gulf's northern and  southern shores, together with their common religious heritage  makes them natural allies. A Tehran-Riyadh axis can be  instrumental in creating a political and economic critical mass  large enough to address the problems currently facing the  Islamic world.    Despite their national and regional interests, the Saudis  have subordinated their domestic and foreign policies to the  United States' hegemonic objectives in the Middle East. By  doing so, they have diluted their own political independence and  have identified themselves too closely with Washington's  interests which are at odds with the aspirations of the Islamic  world.    The three salient Saudi policies which run contrary to the  interests of the region and do not bestow much honor on the  Saudi leaders are: producing more than their OPEC quota;  facilitating an American presence in the Persian Gulf; and  reducing the limit on the number of Iranian pilgrims to Mecca in  the Hajj season.    Riyadh has so far failed to formulate a cohesive policy  based  on the recent Islamic and Arab political experiences, and has  not been able to differentiate between its national and regional  interests, and those of the Western powers.    The Islamic Republic recognizes Riyadh's right to make  independent policy decisions, so long as those decisions are  based on the principles of peaceful coexistence with and mutual  respect for neighboring countries. However, Tehran is not  prepared to accept the political and economic cost of its  neighbor's shortsighted policies which will ultimately affect  the welfare of the Islamic Republic and other Muslim countries  of the Middle East.    After 15 years of Saudi enmity towards the Islamic Republic  with the resulting negative consequences for the Islamic and  Arab worlds, a review of Riyadh's policies towards Iran based on  mutual respect and interests is now in order.    The Saudi leadership's decision to lower the number of  Iranian pilgrims was made, supposedly, because of construction  projects to expand the holy Grand Mosque of Mecca which  surrounds the holy Ka'ba. But according to informed sources,  renovations were completed some time ago.    This Saudi decision to, unjustifiably, reduce the number of  pilgrims from the Islamic Republic is politically motivated and  reflects the wishes of certain factions in the House of Sa'ud  whose interests are served by sowing dissension between Iran and  Saudi Arabia.    Under the present circumstances, the Saudi leadership needs  to make a courageous political decision to remove the existing  strained relations between the two countries.</p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour reverses Tories' poll advantage - Public Opinion MR NEIL KINNOCK, the Labour leader, is a step closer to becoming prime minister, if the latest Financial Times compilation of opinion polls is an accurate forecast of UK voting intentions. The slim advantage for the Opposition party over the Tories would be sufficient to deprive the Conservatives' of an overall majority in the Commons. If Mr John Major resigned, Mr Kinnock could try forming a minority government or agree a pact with the smaller parties at Westminster which would hold the balance of power. The latest weighted average, which takes account of the differing sample sizes of the seven polls covered, puts support for Labour about half a percentage point ahead of the Tories - almost reversing a similar lead the Tories had in the survey last week. If the results are transformed into numbers of MPs, the distribution of support for the two main parties would still make the Conservatives the largest party with 305 seats. Labour, however, would have only three seats fewer. The Liberal Democrats would have 19, up one from last week. Since last week's poll of polls Tory support has slipped by about one percentage point while the Liberal Democrats have risen by about the same amount. Labour's standing has remained at about 39 per cent. The survey, however, highlights how evenly balanced support for the two main parties remains, despite frenetic campaigning since the beginning of the year. The difference between the two is well within the margin of error. The only clear trend is a steady rise in support for the Liberal Democrat party, although its standing is still not high enough to suggest its parliamentary representation will stay as high as its current 22 MPs. Labour at present has 230 Commons' seats and the Conservatives 367.</p>

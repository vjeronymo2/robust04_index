			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Observer: Danger money When it comes to high risk professions, being a Fleet Street editor must be among the more hazardous. Yesterday's Maxwell-cleansing reshuffle at Mirror Group Newspapers means that ousted editor Richard Stott has the distinction of having been editor twice of both the Daily Mirror and The People - and he is still not 50. Stott's departure also probably means the end of Sir Peter Parker's efforts to head a management buy-out team since Stott had been the prime mover. The reshuffle is also bad news for Roy Greenslade, who was fired as editor of the Mirror by the late Robert Maxwell. Until now he has been the favourite editor-in-waiting at the Mirror. If Heinz boss Tony O'Reilly ever does manage to get hold of the group, Greenslade may still be in with a chance. But it seems as if the banks, who control 54 per cent of MGN and are still showing a hefty loss on their shares, have decided to let the new management knock the group into shape, rather than hand the job to a new owner.</p>

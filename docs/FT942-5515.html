			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Mayhew pledge on Ulster security: Chinook tragedy 'will not halt' drive against terrorists - Three inquiries launched The government yesterday pledged to maintain the fight against the IRA as three inquiries were launched into the Chinook helicopter crash in Scotland which killed 25 senior security experts and dealt a blow to anti-terrorist efforts in Ulster. After a day of emergency meetings in Belfast, at which politicians, army and security chiefs tried to assess the impact of the accident, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland Secretary, stressed that the tragedy would not undermine the government's anti-terrorism drive. Sir Patrick said the accident, on the slopes of the 1,405ft Beinn na Lice on the Mull of Kintyre, was 'a dreadful and tragic event'. However, he emphasised that the 'operational effects' of the crash would be overcome. Mr John Major, prime minister, said those killed would be replaced and the work of the security forces would continue. Among the victims of the crash were Assistant Chief Constable Brian Fitzsimons, head of the RUC special branch, and Colonel Chris Biles, the most senior army officer to be killed while serving in Northern Ireland. Also on the flight were nine other senior and middle-ranking special branch officers, six Northern Ireland Office officials - including members of MI5 - and eight senior military intelligence officers. Four crew members also died. A senior Stormont official with security responsibilities said: 'It is a terrible blow at a time when we have a clear, upper hand. We will double efforts to demonstrate that we intend to stay on top.' Sir Hugh Annesley, Royal Ulster Constabulary Chief Constable, said the crash was as 'a catastrophic loss'. Despite the blow to morale in the security forces, officials believe any disruption to anti-terrorist operations will be short-lived and that the IRA is unlikely to benefit from the setback. Security chiefs have ruled out the possibility that the Chinook fell victim to sabotage. Among the most likely reasons for Thursday's disaster - which happened as the helicopter took its passengers to a security conference in Inverness - are mechanical failure or the poor flying conditions at the time. The aircraft, which had recently been refurbished by Boeing, the helicopter's manufacturers, with new avionics, engines, transmission systems and rotor blades, was not fitted with all-weather radar or a 'black box' flight recorder. Last night Labour challenged the decision to allow a large number of top-rank security personnel to travel together. Dr John Reid, Labour armed forces spokesman, said he hoped the decision was not affected by financial considerations. Dr David Clark, Labour's defence spokesman, claimed there was 'a shortage of helicopters' and that to save money the government delayed ordering new ones. Sir Patrick defended the practice of allowing so many senior personnel on one flight as 'quite normal'. One senior anti-terrorist source said such flights were judged to run the least risk of successful attack by the IRA. Inquiries into the crash will be conducted by the Department of Trade and Industry's air accidents investigation branch, Strathclyde police and by the RAF for the defence ministry.

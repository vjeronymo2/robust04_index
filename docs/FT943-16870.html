			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / CBI calls on EU to open up markets The Confederation of British Industry yesterday called for Europe to press ahead with opening up its gas and electricity networks to competition as 'part of the drive to restore Europe's international competitiveness'. Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said Europe needed an internal energy market which gave businesses the freedom to shop around. Some of the largest users were in industries such as chemicals and steel which compete in tough international markets where energy costs have a strong bearing on commercial success, he said. Mr Davies was speaking as the CBI launched a paper intended to influence the green paper on energy being prepared by the European Commission. It comes amid growing calls for an 'energy chapter' in the 1996 revision of the Maastricht treaty. The CBI said it viewed such calls as premature. The commission has for several years been trying to force European power and gas companies to open their largely monopolistic businesses to competition, but with only limited success. Although there are signs of change in thinking in states such as Germany which were previously suspicious of liberalisation, even the most enthusiastic supporters of change believe it will be some years before there is a deregulated market in energy.</p>

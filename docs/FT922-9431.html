			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Observer: Musical allegory For more than a decade left-wing intellectuals have been puzzling over the reason for the halt in the forward march of labour. Now the letters column of the journal published by BT's main union, the NCU, offers a possible clue. Retired member Fred Hattley wrote asking what had happened to his union's brass band, once among the best in the land. Answer: the band is now owned by the employers and calls itself the BT band. 'BT took over sponsorship when the band's financial needs outstripped the NCU's ability to offer support,' writes the editor. Shame on the NCU.</p>

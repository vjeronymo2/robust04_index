			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Waverley Mining raises Pounds 14.7m Waverley Mining Finance yesterday announced a placing and offer to raise Pounds 14.7m net. Some Pounds 6.3m will be used to finance a proposed investment in Mining (Scotland), which is the government's 'preferred bidder' to take over British Coal's Scottish interests. The rest of the proceeds will be used to provide funds for further investments in 'some or all' of the companies in WMF's portfolio and to make other investments. Mr Willie McLucas, WMF's investment manager, said the injection of funds would more than double the asset base of the trust. He is to join the Mining (Scotland) board. The value of WMF's proposed investment in Mining (Scotland) will represent about a quarter of its net assets following yesterday's placing and offer of 15.6m shares at 100p each. The open offer to shareholders is on a 7-for-10 basis. WMF's Pounds 6.3m investment will give it 22 per cent of Mining (Scotland). Other investors include Mr Malcolm Edwards' Coal Investments and Northern National Resources. Mining (Scotland) is paying Pounds 39.4m for the Scottish coal region with an additional Pounds 10m for stocks and stores. The bid is funded by a Pounds 28m equity subscription from investors and Pounds 30m debt provided by Clydesdale Bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland. The placing and offer was underwritten by Williams de Broe and the parent of Noble &amp; Company, which advises WMF.</p>

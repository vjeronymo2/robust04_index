			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Minister of National Defense Piotr </F> Kolodziejczyk by Janusz B. Grochowski; place and date not given:  "Poland's Security Is In Our Hands"]    [Text] [Grochowski] Poland has accepted the "Partnership  for Peace" [PFP] program at last. Why?    [Kolodziejczyk] Because there is no alternative to it and  because clear criteria for participating in this program--in  other words, democracy, the market economy, democratic control  over the Army, and clear budget provisions--were finally spelled  out. I am sure these basic features will convince our  neighbors, particularly those in the East, that Poland has  finally entered the road to democracy and is making fast  progress along it.    [Grochowski] These criteria are obvious, and they were  probably not the reason the U.S. delegation left the Belweder  Palace in a worried state. Did you not seek a clarification of  these criteria in Berlin? Did Foreign Minister Olechowski not  do so in Washington?    [Kolodziejczyk] There is one thing I would like to explain.  Neither the president nor the foreign minister displayed any  nervousness. However, we believed that, as Europeans, we have  the right to say what we think of the PFP and security in  general. The original version of the PFP program was very  vague, and clear provisions were only incorporated at the very  last moment, following sharp criticism from Warsaw.    I hope we will shortly be acquainted with other PFP criteria  as well, mainly the technical ones, and, of course, we will do  our best to fulfill them, provided our Western partners are  willing to indulge in scientific cooperation with us.    But more important for me are Clinton's words uttered in  Prague whereby, in the event of a clear threat, the NATO border  will extend to the Bug River. That is a very tangible outcome  of the offensive we waged before the Brussels summit.    [Grochowski] Let us be frank. The NATO heads of state left  Brussels in a satisfied state, but they left empty-handed. The  Polish press said that a "Partnership for Tranquillity" had been  achieved. Tranquillity for whom? Not for us! Perhaps the only  purpose was to calm the consciences of Western politicians?    [Kolodziejczyk] Our press reacted nervously, which is  understandable, but it looks like there is a genuine desire to  implement the PFP, and quickly. I am beginning to fear that we  will not be able to make use of all of the offers that have  already come in and are still doing so.    [Grochowski] The PFP calls for a cooperation accord with  NATO.    [Kolodziejczyk] There is a race going on here, which I  disagree with. The world's media are wondering whether  Lithuania or Romania will be the first to conclude this accord.    [Grochowski] Lithuania has won!    [Kolodziejczyk] Poland's approach toward this matter is very  serious, so we are giving ourselves several weeks' time in order  to hold talks and prepare an offer of cooperation that suits our  possibilities and is serious enough to be considered and  implemented by the other side.    [Grochowski] What are the actual advantages to be gained  from the PFP? Not much is being said about them.    [Kolodziejczyk] But the objective of the PFP has been  mentioned, and that is Poland's incorporation into the European  security system.    [Grochowski] But what happens before then?    [Kolodziejczyk] We must realize that we have a certain road  to follow, involving many changes, starting with such prosaic  ones as changing map symbols and ending with complicated  technical changes. The key problem is to standardize our  communications, command, firepower control, and reconnaissance  systems with those in NATO.    At the same time, we have to alter the Polish mentality  because it is we who are entering NATO structures, and we have  to adapt to the customs prevalent there. I do not think this  will be difficult. We have an Army of good specialists, prepared  to think on their own. But there is no doubt that it will be  useful to have staff command exercises, as suggested by NATO,  carried out on the basis of computer systems. All of this takes  time, but the Polish Army is intellectually prepared for it, and  this road is not going to be excessively long.    [Grochowski] Talking about the need to adapt to NATO  requirements, we often think of the Warsaw Pact, where weapons  were standardized to a very large degree, and even Army  organizational structures were the same. In the West,  compatibility does not mean that there is only one type of  weapon in all of the armies. One reason for this is that each  country has its own weapons industry, whose products it would  like to sell.    [Kolodziejczyk] Of course. The point is not to standardize  our weapons with NATO. Weapons are not even standardized inside  NATO. The point is to bring our technological standards in line  with NATO's.    [Grochowski] Do you expect Poland to have broader access to  technology that is still on Western secret lists?    [Kolodziejczyk] I hope so. We have been very vociferous in  this matter. It turns out that Minister Olechowski succeeded in  starting concrete talks, and a technical team from the United  States is arriving next week. I think it would be inconsistent  if this team merely told us what NATO standards are and then  left us to our own devices. We expect help, and I hope we will  get it.    [Grochowski] Is this NATO business not a little like a  cat-and-mouse game? Everyone knows that integration with NATO  requires huge funds. Yet the Polish Army simply does not have  any money and is fighting for survival.    [Kolodziejczyk] Indeed, the present budget does not even let  us maintain present standards. We are sinking even lower,  though there is really nowhere to sink to. I hope the budget is  amended.    [Grochowski] The National Defense Commission demanded an  800-billion zloty [Z] increase in the defense budget.    [Kolodziejczyk] I appreciate the Commission's understanding  of the needs of the Army, but, in fact, its needs are far  greater if we are supposed to be a military partner for NATO.  What is more, in subsequent budgets, defense expenditure must  exceed 3 percent of the GNP or our Army will cease to exist.    However, the problem possesses a broader dimension. I asked  the Council of Ministers whether greater emphasis should be  applied to integration with NATO political structures. There is  such a possibility--after all, Spain and Portugal belong to NATO  political structures but not to its military ones. That alone  guarantees that NATO will endow these countries with its  attention should a conflict occur. Therefore, this is a way of  improving the Poles' sense of security and of gaining enough  time to modernize our Army at a pace permitted by our finances.  But such modernization is impossible if defense expenditure is  less than 3 percent of the GNP, and there is proof of that.    [Grochowski] What proof, Minister?    [Kolodziejczyk] According to General Staff data, reduced  military spending makes our Army's low technical standards even  lower, whereas higher expenditure allows us to modernize our  equipment and catch up with Western armies.    [Grochowski] None of the politicians with whom I have spoken  agree with the 3 percent you mention. They insist that the Army  should get whatever it really needs.    [Kolodziejczyk] I agree with them, and I hold them to their  word. The Army needs three times the amount of money it is now  getting in order to achieve by the end of the century a  technical standard that prevails in Western armies.    [Grochowski] I have the impression that the defense budget  is viewed not in ternm of the Army's real needs, but in terms of  the need to rescue the Polish defense industry.    [Kolodziejczyk] It seems to me that our defense industry has  gotten in the habit of staging strikes to force the Army to buy  equipment it does not need. This practice leads nowhere. All  it does is demoralize enterprise managers and make their  products unattractive to the Polish Army and to foreign clients.    Why is the Czech aviation industry functioning so well? The  Vodohady plant, which I visited last week, has orders worth $300  million. The Czechs are selling fighter-trainer aircraft to  various countries and displaying a flexibility and zest that are  completely absent in the whole of our industry, not just the  aviation industry. I asked them how they did it. They told me  something to the effect that, if one does not help oneself, the  government certainly will not do so. One can strike, they said,  but at what cost?    This therapy did the trick. Their contracts for this year  involve the production of at least 50 aircraft for the Czech  Army and for export. These aircraft can compete with our own  "Irida" any day. They are fitted with optical-electronic  equipment and suspension locks [zamki powieszenia] in accordance  with NATO standards.    In the meantime, there is a misunderstanding about the offer  from our own Mielec aviation plant. Instead of a  fighter-trainer, we are being offered a simple trainer. That is  why I think it was a mistake to waste money on prolonging the  life of plants that are unwilling to help themselves, and I will  make sure I do not repeat the same mistake. That sounds brutal,  but, with the Army's present condition, I see no other way. We  must not waste money.    [Grochowski] The Polish armaments industry has been thrown  into deep water without being taught to swim beforehand.    [Kolodziejczyk] The Czech Government did not help Czech  aviation plants until it saw that these plants were helping  themselves.    [Grochowski] I fear that our armed forces will also come  under pressure to manage on their own and make the best possible  use of whatever funds they receive because there is no secret  about the fact that the Army has a lot of property that is  little used and very costly to maintain.    [Kolodziejczyk] The idea of appointing a Military Property  Agency was twice shelved by previous governments. We will make  a fresh attempt to appoint this Agency, taking into account  various proposals that have been presented in the meantime. If  this government refuses to create this agency for whatever  reason, we will insist on an alternative solution to relieve the  military budget of the Z2 trillion that are currently spent  every year on maintaining superfluous military property.    [Grochowski] General Wilecki said that, right now, the Army  is guarding what he delicately describes as sleepy garrisons.  Are there many of them?    [Kolodziejczyk] About 14. The description is very  appropriate to the situation. Some garrisons will be not so  much put to sleep as eliminated altogether, especially in the  west of the country. But, at the same time, one would like to  see an influx of funds to restore the infrastructure in those  regions where this is necessary, especially in the eastern zone  and the Krakow military district.    [Grochowski] You have said in no uncertain terms that the  Army cannot afford to act as a charity any longer. If  necessary, the Army will vacate barracks that are not in use.    [Kolodziejczyk] I am close to reaching such a decision,  which  is a very difficult one because it is Polish property we are  talking about. I consider myself responsible for national  defense. Other matters are in the hands of the members of the  government, and they should at least try to cooperate with the  Army on the issues for which they are responsible.    [Grochowski] Another problem is that of the apartments  that belong to the Defense Ministry but are occupied by people  no longer connected to the Defense Ministry. How will that  problem be solved?    [Kolodziejczyk] The law on accommodation for members of the  armed forces is almost ready, and, in early February, we will  discuss it with other ministries, especially with the ministry  of spatial economy, the Ministry of Construction, And the  Ministry of Finance. After that, we will table it before  parliament, with the request that it be passed quickly because  the use of military accommodation by nonmilitary people  represents a waste of Z1.87 trillion for the Army budget.    Of course, we will never regain all of this money, but if  the  apartments in question are utilized in accordance with the law,  we will at least have funds to build more accommodation. We  need 13,000 apartments.    [Grochowski] Is there a danger that the restructuring of the  Defense Ministry and armed forces will be stopped because of a  shortage of money?    [Kolodziejczyk] That is a complicated issue. The armed  forces and command systems must be reorganized, but,  fortunately, that is not as expensive as it seems. The real  problem is with relocating personnel. This cannot be done  without money, and of course there is no money.    The modest funds we have at our disposal must be spent on  improving the technical condition and mobility of the armed  forces. That also solves the problem of providing equal security  for all borders because today we are in no danger of any  unexpected conflict. Therefore, there is time to prepare a  defense system, and there is no need to establish military  garrisons of equal strength at every single border.    [Grochowski] At the end of 1994, there was supposed to have  been a review of the changes inside the Ministry. What were the  results?    [Kolodziejczyk] The review has not been finished. The  results are still being assessed. Right now, those spheres that  have been placed under Jerzy Milewski's responsibility are being  reorganized. This has nothing to do with shifting the burden of  responsibility or transferring tasks from the civilian to the  military spheres, which would be contrary to the principle of  democratic control over the armed forces.    [Grochowski] Some politicians claim you are losing control  over what is happening in your ministry.    [Kolodziejczyk] To this very day, I do not accept outside  interference. Everything going on in the ministry for which I  am constitutionally responsible is under my complete control.  These are completely unfounded rumors. If I really had no  control over the Ministry, there would be no point in my staying  in Warsaw and being a puppet. I will never agree to that.    [Grochowski] I do not mean pressure from outside. I have in  mind the transfer of too many powers from the civilian to the  military sphere.    [Kolodziejczyk] That is fiction. Nothing like that has  happened.    [Grochowski] Well, let us discuss the question of defense  vice ministers. Why do you think there are enough vice  ministers today? In the past, there have been as many as seven  defense vice ministers, and every single one of them had his  hands full.    [Kolodziejczyk] There are enough vice ministers for present  needs. If needs increase, we will make personnel changes.  After all, we experiment all the time. But one thing is sure;  we are going to create several posts of director general, a post  that exists in the defense ministries of many countries. I am  not joking when I say this, but we also need one under secretary  of state to make sure that the government benches are full  during Sejm debates. Such an under secretary would be  responsible for contacts with the Sejm committees. That is  something that takes up a lot of time, and the rules forbid the  director of the Parliamentary Bureau to deal with it.    [Grochowski] Politicians insist that all they want is to  make sure that the Army remains under civilian control, as is  the rule in democratic countries.    [Kolodziejczyk] They are right. I agree with them. But our  democracy is not yet stable, and there is still a temptation to  use the Army for political purposes. All of the parties would  like to influence the Army, which is a very bad thing in a  transitional period such as ours. The Army must have time to  reestablish itself in new forms.    But once these new forms have solidified ,just as the  state's  democratic structures have done, and the responsibility of  politicians has increased, I see no reason that any victorious  coalition should not have increased control over the Army. This  is not just a question of possibility but of responsibility for  one's deeds, and our experience in this regard is not the best,  unfortunately.    [Grochowski] Right now, only a handful of politicians  understand the functioning of an army. No wonder, for where  could they have learned it? Is it not worth bringing them to  the ministry for a little instruction, although I fear their  price might be high?    [Kolodziejczyk] Any politician wishing to be responsible for  defense matters should first of all be taken to the National  Defense Academy in order to acquire a little theoretical  knowledge. Only then could he perform good practical work in  the ministry.    [Grochowski] You are implementing reforms that require  legislative changes. Do you not fear that the Sejm might block  the reforms?    [Kolodziejczyk] Yes. If the Sejm presents rational reasons  why the reforms should not go through, I will accept them. But  if the Sejm blocks the reform for the sole purpose of playing a  political game, as was the case in the past, we might reach a  point where I have no further possibility of action, in which  case... But, knowing how most of the members of the Sejm  National Defense Committee think, I do not expect major  difficulties. I do not think this Committee will play political  games and set itself at a distance from defense matters.    [Grochowski] You have already issued two warnings about  resigning. How serious are you about it?    [Kolodziejczyk] As long as there is a chance to do  something, I will do it. But, if my hands are tied, I will not  pretend I am still a minister. That would be alien to my  mentality and character. But there is no danger of that for the  time being.</p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DECISION TO DISARM RATHER THAN SHOOT  </P> <P> The Santa Ana police officers who responded to the domestic violence dispute  (Feb. 19) where a man was allegedly threatening family members with a loaded  handgun are a credit to the Police Department for not using deadly force when  they were justified in doing so.  </P> <P> Whoever made the decision to disarm the man rather than shoot him has shown a  fine example of restrained response.  </P> <P> These officers were obviously highly skilled and their decision not to take a  human life hopefully will encourage other officers in Orange County to follow  their lead, especially in situations where unarmed suspects are involved.  </P> <P> MICHAEL MOHON  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P> <P>  Mohon is a prisoner in the Orange County Jail.  </P> <P> </P></p>

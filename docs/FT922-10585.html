			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (10): On schedule and within budget - Manchester's largest relocation A FORMER gasworks within walking distance of the inner city areas of Moss Side and Hulme may not seem the most promising site for the British Council, but it was this site, owned by British Gas, which clinched Manchester's largest relocation. The Council examined over 200 potential locations and narrowed the choice down to four cities: Manchester, Leeds, Bradford and Glasgow. The Manchester site, Grand Island, is within the area covered by the Central Manchester Development Corporation and under a complex grant-aided deal allowed the British Council to tenant a purpose-built headquarters. The building, known locally as 'The Battleship' because of its grey exterior, is now complete and houses the British Council's UK operations. These include the student exchange division, the library and English language specialists and the division responsible for winning projects from organisations like the World Bank. There are now around 650 staff in Manchester, though this could rise to over 700. The Council had considered relocation, on and off, for the past 15 years but it was the expiry of a lease on premises off Oxford Street and the seemingly inexorable rise of London rentals which finally pushed it. Dr Robert Taylor, the assistant director in charge of the move, admits that staff are now asking whether the Council would have moved had it realised that London office rents were about to collapse. 'It's a fair question, but we are in a period when all public bodies are under pressure to reduce overheads. We will still be saving Pounds 1.6m a year in Manchester and that doesn't include the Pounds 2m we would have paid in London,' he says. Dr Taylor was recalled from Greece to handle the move which has been project-managed using the Prince methodology, a government-sponsored and intensely-complicated method of project-management. The initial task was to set up a series of project boards at different levels to handle specific aspects of the move. One of the fundamental strengths of the Prince method is that nobody does anything without telling everybody else. The British Council main board set up a sub-committee to monitor the decisions taken by the relocation project. Dr Taylor was then placed in charge of the various project teams. Five separate project teams were set up to cover the areas of: The building. The move. Work organisation. Information technology and personnel. Each project team had its own project manager and board and had total responsibility for its particular task. The 'move' project, for example, was responsible not only for moving people and equipment from London to Manchester but also for re-arranging the remaining London operation so that the staff exodus did not affect continuity. The 'work organisation' project looked at how best to ensure that there was continuity of work during the work, while the IT team looked after telephones and computers. The building project was responsible for delivering the building on time. To ensure that the method was working, each project had a quality assurance team attached. This also allowed progress to be examined objectively. Constant monitoring and assessment underpinned the methodology. Each project was divided into stages and sub-stages, at each of which the project team would meet. There was also a full-time co-ordinator whose job was to examine the dependencies between the various projects. In total, 16 staff worked full time on the move, with others participating during the normal working day. Dr Taylor believes the method has worked exceptionally well, notably in giving warnings of possible delay - 'overall, there is a critical path analysis, and so you know that if one part is holding up the rest, there are alternatives. This is one of the points of mid-stage assessment,' he says. 'What I've been surprised at is the relative ease with which the move has taken place. We are still on schedule and within budget.' Problems occurred when people forgot the methodology: a re-locator bringing a favourite filing cabinet or desk without telling the people responsible for ordering office equipment. Another surprise was the willingness of staff to re-locate. The Council originally guaranteed that everyone who wanted to move could but working on the national average in similar re-locations anticipated that only 150 would take up the offer. In the event, 350 agreed to move. The removing 300 staff have been recruited locally from over 4,000 applications - 'we have far exceeded our target which has meant that continuity has been much easier than it might otherwise have been,' says Dr Taylor. The Council set up family trips to the city, paying weekend hotel bills and laying on coach trips to show housing and schools. It also set up an an information room and published a newsletter showing how the project was progressing. The Development Corporation played an active part in this process. In retrospect, Dr Taylor believes that job security and Manchester itself were the two crucial reasons for the high number of re-locators. 'I'm not just being polite to Manchester. We had people telling us that they had gone on the trip because it was free, but they liked what they saw. In that sense, Manchester sold itself.' Housing and house prices were also important, particularly among junior grades who found themselves able to move from London bed-sits into home-ownership, albeit small homes in less affluent suburbs. The Manchester operation is now at the heart of the British Council's long-term strategic planning. Dr Taylor is bullish about the future: 'I want the British Council in Manchester not to be just an office block but to contribute to what goes on in the city. We can't do that in London because, frankly, no-one's interested in the British Council - it's just one more organisation.'</p>

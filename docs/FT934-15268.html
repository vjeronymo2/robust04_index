			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Referendum idea rejected by Mandela MR NELSON MANDELA yesterday rejected a referendum as a way of breaking an impasse in South Africa's constitutional talks and said that the African National Congress was determined to go ahead with next April's general election as scheduled. The ANC leader, in London to address a Confederation of British Industry conference, was responding to a speech by President F W de Klerk in Stellenbosch on Monday. Mr de Klerk suggested a referendum as a way of ending a deadlock caused by a boycott of the talks by the Inkatha Freedom Party, the ANC's main black rivals, and the extreme right Conservative party. Mr Mandela, who received an explanatory telephone call from Mr de Klerk on Monday night said: 'At no time did President de Klerk make a specific proposal that a referendum should be held. All that he said was that this was a matter which must be addressed in one way or the other. One way might be to have a referendum.' Some political analysts in South Africa have suggested that holding a referendum would allow the government and the ANC to claim international legitimacy and a mandate to govern in the face of right-wing opposition which could disrupt the proposed election. Addressing the CBI conference in London, Mr Mandela said he wanted a reassurance that the Freedom Alliance between right-wing whites and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party would recognise and accept the results of a referendum. 'I got no such reassurance,' he said, adding that a referendum was 'entirely unlikely' to resolve the situation. Earlier, Mr Mandela said South Africa should abolish exchange controls at the earliest opportunity. 'We are fully aware that the existence of exchange controls could act as a deterrent to many potential investors who may not be certain about the full implications of this system to their investments,' he said. Abandonment of the system would be possible 'once some semblance of stability returns to the economy, particularly the balance between capital inflow and outflow,' he said. Mr Mandela, who later met Mr John Major, the prime minister, was nearing the end of a trip to the US and the European Community to promote investment in South Africa.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / MP seeks curb on car boot sales Mr Bill Cash, Conservative MP for Stafford, is to introduce a private member's bill to the Commons today to restrict car boot sales. Under the bill all such events which were not run for charity would have to be granted a licence by the local authority. The bill has no chance of becoming law because parliament is about to rise for its summer recess but is a means of raising interest in the subject.</p>

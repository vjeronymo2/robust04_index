			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Tory vice-treasurer quits after failing to report US trading ban A senior Conservative party fundraiser has resigned after he failed to notify Central Office that he had been banned from cocoa trading in the US for 10 years, Central Office announced last night. The disclosure of the financial past of Mr Anthony Weldon, a vice-treasurer, came as the party took the unusual step of denying reports that it had encouraged defence manufacturers to give money in return for information. Mr Weldon, who is head of Team 1000, a Conservative fundraising organisation, said he had resigned to 'prevent further embarrassment' to the party. His departure follows detailed allegations in the Daily Mirror that he had fallen foul of US financial rules. Central Office said it understood that Mr Weldon regretted the charges laid against him during his three years in the US, relating to actions which took place between 1982 and 1984. But since he regarded them as 'technical and not bearing on personal integrity' he did not defend the accusations in the US court, nor did he previously think it relevant to disclose them to the party. In an attempt to stem further separate allegations about its finances, the party issued a statement saying it never accepted funds in exchange for confidential information. Central Office said it received proposals in a document from Mr David Bryan, who runs a company specialising in police motorcycle radios. The document, which appeared to offer high-level meetings and valuable information to companies, was rejected as soon as it was tendered. The party spokesman said it 'breached policy guidelines' and was therefore never seriously discussed. The proposals were rejected as they could have been seen as a means of persuading companies to donate money in return for information. Mr Weldon was behind the scheme which organised meetings with representatives from the defence and security industries at the party's headquarters.</p>

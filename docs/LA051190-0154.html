			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CHATSWORTH NOTCHES SWEEP IN VOLLEYBALL QUARTERFINAL  </P> <P> Chatsworth High has three City Section 4-A volleyball championship banners  hanging on the gymnasium wall. And needless to say, another would be mighty  nice for the mighty Chancellors.  </P> <P> They are well on their way after after easily defeating Cleveland, 15-9, 15-8,  16-14, Thursday in a quarterfinal match at Chatsworth.  </P> <P> There was a brief letdown in the third game, however. A five-point lead became  a 14-14 tie, but the Chancellors survived the scare after two sideouts and a  missed kill attempt by Cleveland.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Chatsworth (13-2), which will meet Palisades in the semifinals  Tuesday at Chatsworth, played strong defense in the first two games.  </P> <P> In the match, Chatsworth middle blocker Craig Hewitt had 12 kills and 10  blocks. Ryan Labovitch (12 kills) and Mike Nash (14 kills) also played well.  Setter Greg Salzberg, who missed the first round because of a cold, recorded 30  assists.  </P> <P> "The whole team was really on today," Coach Steve West said. "We came into this  game knowing that (Cleveland) was a good team, and we played tough."  </P> <P> Cleveland (5-8), seeded No. 8, was led by Chin Tran with eight kills, 10  assists and nine blocks. Cesar Guttierez added 11 kills and Yan Huang had nine  kills and 19 assists.  </P> <P> "They were good," Labovitch said. "They chose the right angles and we had  problems with their block."  </P> <P> The Chancellors, who won City championships in 1981, 1984 and 1989, were  undefeated in the West Valley League this season.  </P> <P> "It would be especially nice to win the finals this year," Labovitch said.  "We're almost all graduating and it would be really nice to leave with the  title."  </P></p>

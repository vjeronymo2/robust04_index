			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Luxury for everyone  -The mass-marketing of exclusive brands The German motor manufacturer BMW grew powerful not just by producing an excellent range of cars; careful nurturing of the BMW brand image also helped, making BMW owners feel they were members of an exclusive club. But times are changing. BMW is now running press advertising in the UK which features a gleaming BMW bonnet accompanied by the slogan: 'It's just like a Pounds 65,000 BMW, only Pounds 50,000 less.' By stressing value-for-money as much as status, BMW is tinkering  - at what risk is difficult to assess so far  - with that important intangible, brand image. Another luxury German car producer, Mercedes, has decided to take a similar route. Last week its chief executive designate, Helmut Werner, announced that the company plans to transform itself from 'a car manufacturer with a long tradition in the luxury class' into 'an exclusive full-line manufacturer offering high-quality vehicles in all segments of the market'. Once it starts producing smaller, cheaper vehicles, though, will Mercedes also dilute its brand reputation? Not necessarily. Some luxury goods producers have successfully pinned their premium label on cheaper goods, without losing their consumer appeal. In 1973, Cartier launched its 'Les Must de Cartier' brand of trinkets aimed at the mid-market purchaser. The range proved successful, helping Cartier achieve annual growth of 25 per cent in the 1980s, and in 1991 contributing more than half of the company's SFr1.8bn (Pounds 800m) sales. Jean-Louis Dumas-Hermes followed suit in 1978, bringing out cheaper items with the same Hermes badge as is attached to considerably more expensive items; sales have since grown ninefold, to FFr2.4bn (Pounds 300m). Some analysts, though, attribute the relative decline of luxury brand names to an undisciplined extension of the branding to a plethora of products; at one point, for instance, the name Gucci could be found on 14,000 different products, arguably diluting beyond repair a once exclusive name. In the 1970s General Mills extended a sporting status symbol of the time, the Lacoste alligator, into a widened clothing market; sales started to sharply decline in 1982, which may have been due to a dilution of the luxury brand. But brand-stretching of those sorts of luxury goods does not provide the best marketing analogy for what Mercedes is about to attempt. Purchasers of luxury personal accessories are not, on the whole, looking for utility as well as social status from their purchase; nor have the likes of Dunhill, Cartier or Hermes truly attempted to become mass-marketers. Whereas these companies were simply seeking to boost profits at the margin, Mercedes is arguably engaged in a more fundamental fight for survival. In the car world, where technological distinctions are becoming increasingly narrow, price-plus-quality is becoming a marketing must. Werner said that Mercedes was in danger of being priced out of world markets if it stuck only with its luxury models which were 'over-engineered'. Like BMW, Mercedes is starting its mass-marketing from an enviable position of brand strength. The trick is to produce cars for the common person without also becoming, in the minds of consumers, just another box-pusher. After all, far worse than damaging a brand, perhaps, is to see it die altogether.</p>

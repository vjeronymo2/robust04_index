			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> One week before the Supreme Court hears arguments in a key abortion rights  case, an abortion rights group took to the airwaves with a $2-million ad  campaign while an anti-abortion group said it plans to run newspaper ads next  week to stir America's grass roots. The National Abortion Rights Action League  began running television, radio and newspaper ads to present its side and build  on the energy displayed at an abortion rights march that drew at least 300,000  to the nation's Capitol earlier this month. Meanwhile, the American Civil  Liberties Union today plans to deliver more than 200,000 letters to the Justice  Department asking the department to drop its attempt to persuade the Supreme  Court to overturn the landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion. Oral  arguments are scheduled for next Wednesday.  </P></p>

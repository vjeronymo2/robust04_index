			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HARVARD CLAIMS WATER POLO PLAYOFF BERTH  </P> <P> Harvard High clinched its first Southern Section 3-A Division playoff berth in  water polo with an 11-7 victory Friday over Mater Dei in a Del Rey League match  at Mater Dei High.  </P> <P> Freshman Jim Toring had four goals and teammate Eric Deutsch added three for  the Saracens (24-4 overall, 9-0 in league play), who are ranked fourth in the  division. Goalie Antonio Gomez recorded eight saves.  </P> <P> Although Mater Dei (6-4 in league play) scored first, Harvard led, 7-2, at  intermission and the outcome was never in question. "Even when they were ahead  it wasn't close," Harvard Coach Rich Corso quipped.  </P> <P> But Corso, whose team moved up from the 2-A Division this season, has his  sights on more than a league title.  </P> <P> "League wins are fine but what we're really pointing toward is 12 days from  now," he said, referring to the opening playoff match.  </P></p>

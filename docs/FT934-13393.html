			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Matra-Hachette doubles net MATRA-HACHETTE, the French defence electronics, automotive and media group, yesterday announced a doubling in first-half net profits to FFr302m (Dollars 53.4m) from FFr152m and forecast an increase for the full year from the FFr354m achieved in 1992. Lagardere Group, the holding company that controls Matra-Hachette, also announced a sharp improvement, raising net profits to FFr85m from FFr10m Matra-Hachette and Lagardere said they were discussing ways of merging the two companies. The result of these discussions would be known soon, they said. Matra-Hachette, which was formed last year by the merger of the two businesses, said that sales in the first half slipped by 3 per cent to FFr26.3bn. The rise in first-half profits partly reflected a reduction in financial charges, to FFr249m from FFr382m resulting from a reduction in debt. Operating profits remained stable at FFr1.32bn, with the group's space, defence, audiovisual and transport businesses offsetting declines in other activities. The increase in profits was also achieved despite a rise in exceptional charges, to FFr418m in the first six months of this year from FFr251m in the first half of 1992. This year's charges include restructuring costs relating to the merger which formed the group.</p>

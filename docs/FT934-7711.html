			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of Swiss Banking and Finance (3): Private factor is potent attraction - The market is flourishing but beware of competitors THE mood among Swiss private bankers these days is a mixture of gratification and apprehension. They are gratified because asset management for wealthy individuals is now a flourishing market in spite of decades of scepticism about its future. They are apprehensive because the boom has brought with it competition from unlikely sources, including retail banks in Europe and America. The strength of competition has raised questions over whether Swiss banks, and in particular the small privately-capitalised Geneva banks, will continue to exert their dominance over offshore private funds of Dollars 2,100bn. The alternative is that they will be squeezed out by other centres, and by large institutions which attempt to offer similar services from bases in Switzerland. Chase Manhattan estimates that 35 per cent of private client funds are managed from Switzerland. The near-monopoly of Swiss private banks in the inter-war period has been gradually eroded. But the country's political and financial stability, traditional expertise and banking secrecy remain potent attractions, in spite of strong competition from Luxembourg and London. 'Knowing others think this is an interesting sector is a reassuring confirmation that we were right in decades when people said it was not that important,' says Mr Thierry Lombard, one of six partners of Geneva-based Lombard, Odier &amp; Cie. Competition has intensified as banks have looked at private banking as a commission-earning activity with lower capital risks than lending. 'It is a fee-earning business with relatively good margins, and the bulk of it is off-balance sheet, so you can achieve a good return on capital,' says Mr Jean Pierre Cuoni, chief executive of Coutts &amp; Co AG, the international private banking arm of National Westminster Bank. Banks are also encouraged by the potential growth of wealthy individuals in emerging markets in Asia and Latin America. Banks that already manage assets and provide capital markets services to large corporate clients and institutional funds, can offer similar services to rich individuals at relatively low marginal cost. Mr Georges Vergnion, chairman of Chase Manhattan Private Bank in Geneva, says that Chase's derivatives expertise and technology is one example of a transferable resource. International banks, such as Chase and National Westminster, are unconcerned about Switzerland's future as a private banking centre. 'Switzerland is a booking centre, a product, for us,' says Mr Cuoni. 'I am not worried if people say other centres are coming up. We are there too.' The fortunes of Swiss private banks are more intertwined with the country's competitive advantage. Yet maintaining that advantage requires a delicate balancing act. The private banks must be large and expert enough to provide clients with the enormous range of modern financial products and capital instruments. Yet, they must maintain the small-scale, personalised service that allows them to command private client fees big enough to offset larger competitors' economies of scale. Mr Hans Bar, chairman of Bank Julius Bar in Zurich, says that the primary emphasis must be on individuals. 'The margins are slim on asset management and global custodianship. It is the private client who pays the bill,' he says. Mr Lombard agrees. 'We may sell part of our expertise outside, but the bulk of our research must be devoted to our clients,' he says. This principle is more easily enunciated than achieved. The Swiss banks need to boost private client assets with institutional funds: 45 per cent of Lombard, Odier's assets under management, are institutional. This gives them an incentive to concentrate on fund rather than portfolio management, devoting research to overall asset allocation instead of selecting individual mixes for clients. This tendency has been reinforced by the growth in mutual funds from the US, which offers individuals the chance to diversify risk and to spread investments around different markets. Private banks increasingly act as intermediaries between their clients and such funds, sometimes making markets in investment fund holding to allow private clients to swap among them easily. Mr Bar says that private clients have become preoccupied by fund performance. 'It is less and less them asking: 'Is this a good bank?' People ask about the funds now,' he says. This could mean that private banking will become a 'commoditised' business, with margins falling as a growing number of competitors are able to offer fund management expertise similar to the established participants. Nor is it simple to decide which form of institutional business banks should seek. Some are now having to choose between offering large corporations asset management services, or becoming global custodians that manage securities portfolios. Calculating which option is more profitable in the long term is 'a difficult call', according to Mr Patrick Odier, a partner of Lombard, Odier. Mr Vergnion argues that such trends favour big banks which can allow their private banking arms to draw on the expertise of other specialist activities, such as institutional fund management and capital markets. 'We have already seen some of the smaller banks merging. Those that cannot invest in people and technology are going to be squeezed out,' he says. Mr Vergnion believes that international banks with a presence in Switzerland have an edge in attracting new clients because much of the emerging wealth is among entrepreneurs in Asia and Latin America. Chase says that it is gaining market share, although its 31 per cent growth in assets under management, so far this year, includes money entrusted to it by independent advisers. The Swiss banks remain a competitive force. Surveys have found that clients still value their traditions of service highly and are prepared to pay a premium for it. The suspicion that private banking is merely the latest fad for some of their competitors also helps. They have specialised in client asset management for so long that their names and addresses alone are an advertisement. 'We are willing to render service in the very long term, and we devote our capital to our clients' needs. That is important,' says Mr Odier. Yet in a world where the average retail investor can buy equity options or take a stake in Venezuelan equities through a mutual fund, the Swiss banks must work increasingly hard to demonstrate that their expertise remains a unique asset.</p>

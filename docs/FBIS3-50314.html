"We have discussed economic issues and the  results of these talks are very significant," Michal Kovac told  reporters after the meeting. "We have agreed that Prime  Minister Pawlak would come to Bratislava and that our  governments will meet in their full composition," Kovac said.    During the "Visegrad group summit" in Prague Waldemar Pawlak  and Prime Minister Vaclav Meciar agreed that prior to a meeting  of both cabinets, economic ministers of both countries will meet  to assess the progress in preparation of agreements between both  republics.    Commenting upon the decision to postpone the signing of  agreements between Poland and Slovakia, the prime minister said  that "it is worth to devote more time to these agreements to  prepare them better."    Pawlak stressed that it would be good for the cooperation  between Poland and Slovakia to be more concrete. "The problem  boils down not to documents and agreements but above all to  direct contacts of many people," the prime minister said.</p>

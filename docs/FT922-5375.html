			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Individuals and foreigners buy in Japan A STRONGER yen and higher bond prices pushed up futures, and equities rose on arbitrage and short-term buying by dealers, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average advanced 416.50, or 2.3 per cent, to 18,347.75, up 0.7 per cent on the week. It opened at the day's low of 17,968.09 and reached a high of 18,363.51 in the afternoon. Volume rose slightly from 208m shares to 230m. Traders noted activity by individuals and foreigners. Advances led declines by 758 to 201 with 157 unchanged. The Topix index of all first-section stocks rose 20.01 to 1,376.32 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.52 to 1,089.97. Wall Street's rise on Thursday also bolstered sentiment, and speculative theme stocks once again led trading. Meiji Milk Products, the most active issue of the day, rose Y2 to Y912, and JGC, the plant engineering company, advanced Y20 to Y2,120. Ricoh, the office equipment maker, gained Y3 to Y529 on buying by dealers and individuals; some investors regard low-priced blue chips with weak profits as possible merger and acquisition targets. Banks closed higher in spite of poor results. Combined pre-tax profits for the 11 leading commercial banks fell by 14 per cent, but traders said that the negative news had already been factored into stock prices. Foreign brokers were seen buying 'baskets' of bank stocks. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y30 to Y1,850 and Fuji Bank advanced Y40 to Y1,500. Utilities gained on hopes of lower interest rates, Tokyo Electric Power rose Y30 to Y2,790. Some investors were concerned over reports that Yamaichi Securities, a leading broker, was being sued by Showa Mining - a glassfibre material maker listed on the second section of the exchange - for mishandling its investments. Although Yamaichi denied the reports, Showa said that it had posted extensive losses because of Yamaichi's shuffling of investments. Analysts fear further revelations and law suits will hurt confidence. In Osaka, the OSE average gained 277.36 to 20,877.88 in volume of 14.9m shares. Roundup With the exception of Bangkok, still upset by political uncertainty, the region was stronger yesterday. HONG KONG regained nearly all of Thursday's losses, lifted by a continued inflow of overseas money. The Hang Seng index closed 92.02, or 1.5 per cent higher at 6080.15, 3.8 per cent higher on the week in turnover up from HKDollars 5.35bn to HKDollars 5.7bn. Cheung Kong topped the most active list, climbing HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 26.70. Its chairman, Mr Li Ka-shing, declined to comment on a British press report that he was negotiating to buy Olympia &amp; York's Canary Wharf development in London's Docklands. BANGKOK extended its losses on the slow progress in finding a successor for the former prime minister, Suchinda Kraprayoon. The SET Index ended 15.99 lower on the day and 4.1 per cent lower on the week at 688.84 in moderate turnover of Bt4.05bn. TAIWAN recouped less of Thursday's fall, closing 18.25 higher at 4,519.27, 2.3 per cent lower on the week in turnover down from TDollars 21.9bn to TDollars 17.7bn. NEW ZEALAND rose to a 12-month high with foreign buying of blue-chip issues leading the advance. The NZSE-40 index closed up 16.19 at 1,574.87, up 1.5 per cent on the week. Turnover was NZDollars 41m. Fletcher Challenge advanced 6 cents to NZDollars 3.74 while Telecom saw strong US interest lift its shares 4 cents to NZDollars 2.10 in volume of 5.5m shares. BOMBAY was subdued at the start of the new two-week account trading period after carry-forward charges were sharply raised on fears that some brokers might default. The BSE Index fell 66.40, or 2.2 per cent to 3,006.08, 12.5 per cent lower on the week.</p>

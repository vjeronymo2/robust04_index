			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / International Company News: Audi prepares for 'hard work' after falling into the red AUDI, the Volkswagen group's luxury car division, slumped into a DM198m (Dollars 117.1m) pre-tax loss in the first six months of this year as turnover tumbled almost 30 per cent to DM6bn 'With a lot of hard work' the company hoped to return to the black by the end of the year, but this would depend on the state of the market, Mr Franz-Josef Kortum, chairman, told the annual meeting. German sales are already down 20 per cent, and the motor traders' association said earlier this week that it expected new domestic registrations to fall 23 per cent for the full 12 months. Mr Giovanni Agnelli, president of Fiat, warned yesterday that total industry car deliveries in Europe would fall 16 per cent. Meanwhile, Audi's share of the home market has shrunk from 6 per cent a year ago to 5.6 per cent. Employing 3,000 fewer workers than in the first half of 1992, and after 32 days when production was stopped in its two main factories, the company reduced output in the period under review by almost 32 per cent to 174,000 vehicles. Global sales in the meantime fell 26 per cent to 198,000 cars. The difference between output and deliveries was due to heavy inventory reductions, Mr Kortum explained. Commenting on the deficit after a DM315m profit in the comparable part of 1992, Mr Kortum said demand was especially strong a year earlier because of the marque's new models. The market was also still being driven by the post-unification boom which stopped abruptly last summer to be followed by a sharp dive into recession. The VW group earlier this year reported a first-quarter loss of DM1.25bn following Germany's plunge into recession in the second half of last year. Before the summer break, the German car market was still being strongly driven by the effects of unification. The fruits of a joint production venture between Audi and Porsche, the sports car maker, will be shown at the international motor show in Frankfurt in September, the two companies have announced. Production of the new vehicle, based on the Audi Avant S2, will start early next year in Porsche's Zuffenhausen factory and profits will be shared equally between the partners. The project demonstrated a new form of co-operation between two independent vehicle makers, the companies said. Porsche is controlled by the family of Mr Ferdinand Piech, the VW chairman.</p>

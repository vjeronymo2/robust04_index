			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Australia gloom lifts faster than expected: New treasurer is able to announce a higher growth and lower inflation outlook Ralph Willis may have waited a political lifetime to get the Australian treasurer's job, but his timing cannot be faulted. The Australian economy, which looked lacklustre for much of 1993, has sprung into life. Mr Willis made the happiest of public debuts yesterday, announcing a substantial upward revision to the government's numbers. Australia's gross domestic product, said the treasurer, is now expected to grow at 3.5 per cent in the 1993-94 fiscal year. This contrasts with 2.75 per cent forecast in the budget in August. For 1994-95, the new estimate is 4 per cent, hinted at by Mr Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, last week. Inflation is estimated to be 2 per cent for this year, down from a forecast of 3.5 per cent. Meanwhile, the current account deficit should be about ADollars 17bn (Pounds 8bn) this year, or about 4 per cent of GDP, compared with the earlier forecast of ADollars 18bn. The December balance of payments data are published today, but if market predictions of a ADollars 1.3bn deficit on the current account are correct, the slight widening from November's ADollars 1.16bn figure will give no one cause for concern. Even Australia's vexatious unemployment position looks a little brighter, says Mr Willis. While the forecast unemployment rate for June 1994 stays at 10.75 per cent - it was 10.7 per cent in December - the participation rate is adjusted upwards. This suggests that more people have been drawn into the work force and the actual number of jobs is growing at about 1.75 per cent, compared with a previous estimate of 0.75 per cent. Economists, who generally predicted yesterday's revisions and think Mr Willis may have erred on the cautious side, have a variety of explanations. First, it seems the weakness in Australia's private sector capital investment may not have been quite as pronounced as everyone feared. New private capital expenditure rose by 3 per cent in the September quarter, according to figures released earlier this month, and total capital expenditure for 1993-94 is now forecast to be ADollars 25.7bn. If this revised forecast is correct, it would suggest that investment has been flat this year. Previous official estimates suggested a fall of 5 to 6 per cent. Second, consumer confidence is on the rise. Retail trade rose markedly in November, and retailers have talked of encouraging Christmas sales. A round of tax cuts, which affected pay packets in November, has plainly helped, as has greater stability in the jobs market. But while the news is encouraging, the treasurer's life is not expected to be headache-free in the months ahead. In previous cycles, Australia has tended to face a balance of payments crisis once the good times rolled, causing the authorities to slam on the monetary brakes. Some economists think that weak - albeit improving - levels of business investment will cause the same difficulties. 'It's a real supply side problem,' says BIS Sharpnel, the research and forecasting group. 'Investment has been down so much that we've barely covered depreciation. There's 10 to 15 per cent spare capacity to be used, but after that, the bottlenecks could begin.' Since Australian companies source a large proportion of their plant and equipment overseas, the pessimists warn of a current account 'blow-out' by 1995-96. Whether this happens or not, the strength of Australia's export performance becomes critical. The optimists hope that enough structural changes have taken place to make a difference. More of Australia's trade is now within Asia, where growth is widely expected to remain buoyant for the next few years. Some economists, such as Mr Bill Shields, chief economist at Macquarie Bank, also argue that Australia's increasingly deregulated labour market will mean that pay increases - and therefore increases in consumer spending power - will be aligned to productivity advances. In short, if Australians, as consumers, demand more imports, they should, as workers, also be contributing to their companies' sturdiness. The second problem is unemployment. A figure of 10.7 per cent is way above the average in the 24 industrial nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and for a Labor party government, which is still close to the trade union movement, this is doubly damaging. A prime ministerial committee looking into the issue has estimated that if economic growth averages 3.5 per cent for the rest of the decade, unemployment will still be 7 per cent by the year 2000. This would include about 200,000 'long-term' unemployed. Last, and partly related to this, there is the question of whether there are any 'hidden costs' down the road which may push the government's budget deficit reduction strategy off course. The need to act urgently on the unemployment issue, for political reasons, is one possible threat. Also lurking in the background is the as yet unquantified cost of the recent Aboriginal land rights legislation (which should see state and federal governments paying some compensation to the displaced indigenous population). This leaves economists wondering whether Mr Willis may yet raise indirect taxes further or whether fellow ministers will be under pressure to find more revenue sources, from asset sales, for example. Still, even on this score, Mr Willis's luck seems to be holding - for the moment. His predecessor, Mr John Dawkins, encountered scepticism when he outlined a four-year plan, detailing how the government planned to cut the deficit from an expected ADollars 16bn in 1993-94 to ADollars 5.8bn by 1996-97. Now the government is expected within the next week to announce a reduction in the likely deficit for the current year.</p>

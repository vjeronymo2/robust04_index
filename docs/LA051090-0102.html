			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SHORTAGE OF FOSTER PARENTS THREATENS, GRAND JURY SAYS  </P> <P> An increase in children needing placement in foster homes and a decline in  people available to care for them may lead to a shortage of foster parents in  San Diego County, a grand jury report issued Wednesday said.  </P> <P> The report said 5,200 children are served each month in the county's foster  care system. The number of children needing long-term foster care is increasing  by 8.5% a year, while the number of available homes is increasing by only 5%.  </P> <P> According to the report: "The increase in abused children entering foster care  in the (1980s) was due to many factors: increase in population, heightened  awareness by the public, poverty and homelessness, breakdown of the family,  teen-age pregnancies and, most of all, the escalating use of drugs and  alcohol."  </P> <P> At the same time, foster parents have been dropping out of the program. The  reasons given for their leaving varies, from more women entering the work force  to the difficulties they often encounter when dealing with the foster care  system.  </P> <P> The report was issued by the county grand jury's Health and Social Services  Committee after interviews with administrators and social workers for the Child  Services Bureau Division of the Department of Social Services. Also interviewed  were judges, doctors, nurses, psychologists and foster parents.  </P> <P> Although foster parents think that the Child Services Bureau is doing the best  it can with an "overwhelmed and under-budgeted system," many also feel they do  not receive enough support from the system.  </P> <P> "They receive more support from one another than from those trained and hired  to assist them," the report said.  </P> <P> Some social workers often carry caseloads of 35 or more and are unable to spend  enough time with the foster parents or the children.  </P> <P> Among the problems cited in the report was a lack of uniform policy regarding  foster children among the school districts. Some districts were cooperative,  others found the children to be nuisances. One district in the county gave  foster children three days to adjust to their new school environment. If they  did not adjust, they were not allowed to stay in the school. Other schools will  not enroll foster children in their special education programs.  </P> <P> Among the grand jury's recommendations are that advice from foster parents be  used when training programs are planned and that a plan be formulated to ensure  that children receive proper medical care. The medical plan would be created in  conjunction with the Child Services Bureau, the Children's Hospital Center for  Child Protection, and other child health care and child protection agencies.  </P> <P> In addition, the grand jury recommended that a list be prepared of doctors  whose services to children are funded by Medi-Cal.  </P> <P> The grand jury also recommended that the County Department of Social Services  consider foster parents "equal members of the social services team and  encourage more networking between foster parents and social workers."  </P></p>

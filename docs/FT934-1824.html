			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / (CORRECTED) The Gatt Deal: Banks regret 'bad news' on barriers - Services Correction (published 20th December 1993) appended to this article. The failure of the US and the European Union to agree any important measures to open international markets in financial services and maritime shipping drew widely varying responses from the two industries yesterday. Financial institutions mostly expressed disappointment, though some expressed confidence that market forces would gradually bring about the erosion of restrictions and freer trade which official negotiators had failed to achieve. The shipping industry, by contrast, expressed relief it had been left out of the Uruguay Round, claiming inclusion could have formalised restrictive practices rather than remove barriers to trade. Mr Nikolaus Boemcke, secretary general of the European Banking Federation, called exclusion of financial services from the Uruguay Round 'bad news', because offers made during the negotiations might not remain on the table. He was disappointed that countries outside Europe had not agreed to offer reciprocal concessions similar to those available to them under the EU's banking rules. 'Our weapons against entry into Europe are not very strong,' he said. The main hope of European banks and securities houses has been that the Gatt round would increase their access to markets in the Asia Pacific region and Latin America, while protecting their right to establish subsidiaries in the US. However, there is now doubt about the future of some market-opening proposals made in the talks, such as a Japanese offer to allow foreign institutions to manage private sector pension funds. There is also uncertainty about the future status of certain types of cross-border activity, such as advisory work on international mergers and acquisitions, which do not require establishment of a foreign subsidiary. To some institutions, the negotiators' inability to agree on measures which protected existing trade in financial services was as much a source of regret as their failure to open markets. Mr Bob Blower, assistant director of the British Bankers' Association, expressed concern at the lack of a 'standstill' arrangement to prevent future retaliatory action. 'To be certain that the rules will not change is very important if you are considering setting up a subsidiary overseas. At the moment, the dangers of retaliation are theoretical, but the world can change,' he said. Shipowners have argued that their sector is already broadly liberalised and that inclusion in the Gatt provisions would slow rather than speed liberalisation. CORRECTION The Financial Times of December 16 incorrectly quoted Mr Nikolaus Boemcke, secretary general of the European Banking Federation, as implying that financial services and shipping had been excluded from the Uruguay Round agreement on global trade liberalisation. In fact, both sectors are included in the agreement. Further talks are continuing to settle outstanding differences in these areas.</p>

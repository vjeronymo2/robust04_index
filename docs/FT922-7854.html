			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / The NYSE begins to show its age: Stock market is being left behind by its more modern rivals A few weeks ago a delegation from a newly independent Eastern Bloc state was shown around the New York Stock Exchange. The visitors wanted to see a modern stock exchange, and hopefully learn something that would help them develop their own securities market. As the delegation strolled through the trading room, a voice was heard above the fray: 'For God's sake, don't build one like this.' The anonymous advice goes straight to the heart of the problem facing the NYSE, which this weekend celebrates its bicentenary. It may be 200 years old, and it is still the world's largest stock exchange, but the Big Board's power in its home market is waning and it risks being left behind as financial markets head for the 21st century. It has been remarked upon recently that no one, with all the computer technology now available, would design a stock market today along the lines of the NYSE, with its expensive trading floor, its hand-written paper orders, and its specialists who man trading posts every day but who for 90 per cent of the time play no real role in the market. Over the past decade not one emerging country which has developed its own stock market has modelled its system on the NYSE, points out Mr Junius Peake, a US financial consultant who has advised governments on securities exchanges. Why is this so? The NYSE is simply regarded as an expensive anachronism. The priority for many investors today, particularly the big institutions who trade big bundles of stock at one time, and for the brokers who handle large amounts of customer orders, is to cut transaction costs. Increasingly, many are finding alternatives to the NYSE. In 1981, more than 75 per cent of the trading in all US stocks (measured by dollar volume) was handled by the NYSE. Last year, that share had dropped to not much more than half. The NYSE has even struggled to hold on to trading of its own listed stocks. In 1981 it accounted for 82 per cent of all trades in NYSE stocks. Ten years later its share had fallen to 67 per cent. The decline, however, is less precipitous when measured by the number of shares, rather than the number of trades, with the NYSE's share of volume over the same period falling from 87 per cent to 82 per cent. The business the NYSE has lost has gone to a number of sources, including US regional and overseas exchanges, electronic markets such as the over-the-counter Nasdaq market, commercially run trading systems such as Instinet, Posit, Madoff Securities and Spaworks, and in-house matching services run by a few big US brokerage firms. Foreign exchanges - generally London - are popular because they operate more relaxed reporting rules than the NYSE. The remainder are used because they save money for institutions and brokers. Aware that the big issue today is cost, the NYSE has gone on the offensive, arguing that costs cannot be measured purely in transaction fees. It claims the exchange's customer-driven auction market, where there are no intermediaries to take a cut from the spread between the buy and sell price, gives investors the best possible price on trades. This argument was supported by a recent Michigan University survey, which concluded that trades made away from the NYSE were often completed at unfavourable pricing terms, at a total cost to investors of as much as Dollars 55m (Pounds 31m) a year. Defenders of the NYSE point out that some of the business going elsewhere is being bribed away. Increasing numbers of broking firms have been diverting customer orders to rival markets in exchange for transaction fee discounts, which are not passed on to the end investor. The NYSE also likes to emphasise that its system guarantees liquidity. During the 1987 Crash, the NYSE won much support when specialists on the trading floor bought stock from frantic sellers while dealers on rival electronic systems such as Nasdaq refused to answer their phones. Since then, however, the National Association of Securities Dealers has tightened its rules and says in future there will always be a marketmaker on Nasdaq willing to deal. While the NYSE's customer-driven auction system has merits, the continued use of the exchange's trading floor is more difficult to defend. NYSE officials, recognising that the floor seems out-of-date in the hi-tech world, admit it would be possible to design an electronic market that keeps the customer-driven auction system, and the specialists, but dispenses with the floor. The exchange has tried to keep up with changing times, partly by expanding its business hours to encourage more trading. But the after-hours session introduced 11 months ago has been only a modest success, while last year's plan to open earlier each morning was scuttled by opposition from member firms on the west coast. Apart from bringing in new business and stemming the flow of orders to rivals, the NYSE's other priority is to attract more foreign listings. The exchange knows that US investment in overseas stocks is rising steadily, and it is desperate to service that growing demand. Standing in its way, however, is the SEC. Determined to uphold its responsibility of protecting investors, the SEC has refused NYSE requests to relax financial reporting requirements for foreign companies so that their shares can be traded on the Big Board. The two sides remain locked in disagreement, and for the moment the NYSE must put its ambitions on hold. Ultimately, the chances of the NYSE keeping up with the times will depend on the members who run the exchange. To date, they have shown little inclination to instigate change. While the specialists hold sway at the NYSE, they are unlikely to do anything that threatens their valuable franchise. As one cynic noted: 'If bank tellers had run the banks, how many automated cash machines do you think there would be?'</p>

			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TROUBLE AT DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT;  </P> <P> DREXEL SEEKS HELP, BUT 'THERE'S NO LINE FORMING';  </P> <P> SECURITIES: AS THE JUNK BOND MARKET WORSENS, FEWER COMPANIES WANT TO DO  BUSINESS WITH THE STRUGGLING INVESTMENT FIRM.  </P> <P> It was only a week ago that the battle-scarred investment firm of Drexel  Burnham Lambert released its 1989 earnings with a self-congratulatory  commentary. The firm's relatively small $40-million loss was "a tribute to the  professionalism of our staff and the loyalty of our clients," the once mighty  firm said in a statement.  </P> <P> Much has changed in a week. As the junk bond market has continued to fall,  Drexel has confronted a cash crisis that prompted the firm to announce Monday  that it was seeking a merger partner or an investor to shore it up.  </P> <P> Within hours, there were reports that some Wall Street firms were unwilling to  trade securities with the firm, for fear that they would not be paid for what  Drexel bought.  </P> <P> And while Drexel Chief Executive Frederick H. Joseph and other officials at the  firm have insisted that it is still strong, many on Wall Street are predicting  that Drexel may find no partners and that one of the investment world's most  dramatic success stories might end. "I would describe them as in extremis,"  said one investment banker.  </P> <P> Drexel officials declined to elaborate on how the crisis had unfolded. But  sources said the company had been unable to "roll over" some of the short-term  borrowings called commercial paper, as lenders apparently balked at extending  new loans. Drexel has about $200 million outstanding in commercial paper, which  is typically a source of funds for buying an inventory of securities and  keeping them overnight.  </P> <P> Clearly, the major underlying cause of the crisis was the continued fall of the  junk bond market. Prices of the average junk bond have fallen about 20% in the  past year, and the crisis has recently raised new anxieties about the solvency  of life insurance companies and their pension plans as well as savings and  loans and other institutions.  </P> <P> As bond prices have fallen, so has the value of a huge inventory of junk that  is one of Drexel's principal assets.  </P> <P> Wall Street officials said the unwillingness of some firms to do business with  Drexel was a dire sign. "We don't know how deep the firm's problems are, but  whatever they are, this will escalate them," said Michael Lipper, president of  Lipper Analytical Services, a research firm.  </P> <P> By early afternoon, there were reports that more than a dozen dealers in  mortgage-backed securities had put out the word that they would not trade with  the firm through the so-called interdealer brokers. As the afternoon wore on,  traders in other types of securities were pulling back from trades with Drexel  as well, sources said.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to say we're pulling back, because nobody wants to be blamed for  starting a panic," said an official of one brokerage firm. "But nobody knows  what's going on with Drexel, and nobody wants to take the risk."  </P> <P> Drexel still has substantial assets that might attract the eye of some  potential buyer. The firm remains the single biggest factor in the junk market,  with more than 40% of underwritings in 1989; it is also an important factor in  the mortgage-backed securities market.  </P> <P> As the firm noted Monday, it has $800 million in equity capital, down from a  peak of $1.4 billion in 1986. And though its work force has declined to less  than 5,400 from a peak of 11,000, Drexel still has much of the financial talent  that made its reputation during the 1980s.  </P> <P> Some on Wall Street speculated that Monday's announcement might arouse interest  among a foreign buyer -- perhaps an investment bank -- looking for the  important contacts that an acquisition might bring. Some held out hope that  Drexel's lenders would come up with new loans or that some other innovative  arrangement would be devised to help the 152-year-old firm survive.  </P> <P> But others were skeptical that the firm would find many bidders among domestic  or foreign buyers, in large part because of the potential liabilities that the  firm faces from civil suits that may arise from the alleged securities  violations of Michael Milken, the firm's departed junk bond chief, or other  employees. Federal prosecutors are expected soon to bring a superseding  indictment against Milken, who has denied all wrongdoing.  </P> <P> "Given the potential legal liabilities of Drexel, the fact that its main  business is losing money and their stigma . . . I don't think many people would  be interested in buying them," said Doyle Lyons, analyst with Merrill Lynch in  New York.  </P> <P> Another Wall Street executive was more blunt about the level of interest in the  company. "There's no line forming," he said.  </P> <P> Another drawback for any buyer is that the best employees might soon be hired  away by other and stronger firms.  </P> <P> If Drexel filed for bankruptcy court reorganization, among the biggest losers  would be Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, the Belgian concern that is Drexel's largest  single shareholder, with a 25% stake. Also hurt would be the senior Drexel  employees who hold almost all the rest of the company's shares.  </P> <P> But while such a step might also further shake the junk bond market, observers  say it obviously would not have the widespread effects on the market that it  would have had in the mid-1980s, when Drexel was a far more dominant force in  underwriting and trading the securities.  </P> <P> The network of junk bond issuers and investors that Milken assembled in the  early 1980s has long since adjusted to a world without Milken.  </P> <P> "If growing companies want to issue junk bonds to raise capital, you can bet  there will be other firms that will be more than glad to do it for them," said  John C. Coffee, securities law specialist at Columbia University Law School.  </P></p>

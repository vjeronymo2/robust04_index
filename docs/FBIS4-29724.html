			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article: "Who Is the Real Saboteur of the Thai-Lao Trade </F> Market?"]    [Text] Following the progress in Thai-Lao relations,  currently at an all-time high, contacts between the peoples of  the two countries have increased dramatically. Subsequently,  the values of bilateral trade and investment are growing  accordingly.    Statistics from the Customs Department show that the total  trade values between Thailand and Laos in 1991 and 1992 were  recorded at 3.15 and 4.01 billion baht respectively. From  January to October 1993, the value of Thai-Lao trade rose to  4.93 billion baht. Taking into account the illegal trade  activities along the common border, the actual trade values  could be five times more than those in the official records.    However, the governments of the two countries have imposed a  ban on trade in certain types of commodities. Since the two  countries share a common border as long as 1,730 kilometers with  14 temporary and permanent border crossing points, it is not  easy to prevent smuggling of such goods, as restricted products  are available in the markets on both sides of the common border.    Ninty-five percent of commodities on sale in local market  places from the northern to southern regions of Laos come from  Thailand. Both the Thai and Lao Governments admit that they  cannot really control trade between their two countries.    Although Thai goods are now occupying the Lao domestic  market, it is very likely that they will lose their lion share  in the near future, as happened in the case of the Vietnamese  and Burmese markets, which are now being flooded with goods from  China and Singapore. No Thai merchandise is on sale in those  markets except a few along the borders areas.    This is a clear evidence of the failure of the Thai  Government's trade policy. The Thai Government has always  overlooked the significance of these neighboring countries. The  Commerce Ministry, in particular, seems only to pay attention to  distant markets.    Recently, the Chinese and Lao Governments signed an  agreement  on trade cooperation and goods exchange. Hence, Chinese goods  will definitely push Thai products out of the Lao market in the  next one or two years if the Thai Government remains idle and  does nothing to prevent such an eventuality.    Touring different markets along the Thai-Lao border, trade  restrictions are the main obstacle. Laos itself is unable to  produce certain goods for its own domestic consumption; it has  to depend on neighboring countries like Thailand. The goods  flow into the country through both legal and illegal channels.    We are worried that in the next one or two years, when  Vietnam is capable of producing more goods and the roads to Laos  are improved, Thai goods will not be able to compete in the  Lao domestic market.    We know that the tentacles of the Thai mass media can reach  every corner in Laos and attract Lao consumers to Thai  products. Why doesn't the Thai Government do something like  revising the laws and regulations to promote trade between the  two countries and help Thai goods compete with products from  China and Vietnam.    We believe that the present Thai Government can solve the  problem because it is not "that stupid." However, it must be  sincere in dealing with the problem.    It's a pity that Thai business people engaging in the trade  between the two countries are left struggling to safeguard the  Lao market without any assistance from the government. Many  have already given up and are simply waiting to see the end of  the Indochina market for Thai goods.    It is not too difficult for the government to recognize past  mistakes and take the necessary action to keep the entire  Indochina market for Thai products. By so doing, it will  sacrifice some of our immediate benefits for the sake of  long-run interests.    The government must sign trade agreements with the  Indochinese countries, China, and Burma; lower tax barriers; and  reduce import duties on agricultural products from these  countries. We can buy raw materials and agricultural products  from neighboring countries and sell our finished products to  them.    I want to see the day when the Indochinese countries regard  Thailand as "Japan No. 2".</p>

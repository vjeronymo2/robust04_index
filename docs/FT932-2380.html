			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of North American Business Travel (7): Almost like taking the office with you - Business services INNOVATIONS in cellular communications, microcomputers, and even the old stand-by, the telephone credit card, have made the business traveller's chore of keeping in touch with the office a relatively painless one. However, despite the invention and mass-marketing of briefcase-sized portable printers and facsimile machines, and the advent of electronic 'personal assistants,' trying to duplicate the office while on the road can be a headache. International travellers find that reliable and compatible power sources and data ports for all the electronic gadgetry are not always available. Computer checks, even within North America, slow travellers down at airport security stations. And, the truth be told, the gear is awkward to carry and often lacks the one feature you need in a pinch. It is often more efficient to hire office services once you've arrived at your destination, provided you have a clear view of what's available ahead of time. In North America, overbuilding has put most business-class hotels in sharp competition for customers, and led them all to provide basics like copy and fax machines in-house. More elaborate services like typing and meeting planning are also available, for a price, at most full-service hotels. Inquire when arranging accommodation, and be sure to determine what hours the services are available. While convenient, hotel services can be expensive. Simply making a local telephone call from an in-room phone, for example, can add charges of 25 cents to as much as a dollar per call to your bill. If you are pinching your business budget, try looking beyond the hotel. While there are few nationwide chains, a host of small businesses thrive in every city by providing competitively-priced fax, duplicating, instant printing, typing services and other stand-bys. Look for them in the telephone book Yellow Pages under 'office services' or 'copying.' Many of them will pick-up and deliver to the hotel. Kinko's Copy Centers has carved out a niche as a nationwide chain that has 24-hour service at most stores - a boon for time-pressed business travellers. It has 650 stores with locations in all 50 states, as well as Toronto, Vancouver, Waterloo and London, Ontario, in Canada. In addition to typing, copying, instant printing and faxes, Kinkos offers colour copying, makes overhead transparencies and other presentation materials, has self-service and full-service desk-top publishing, and does packaging and mailing. Many of its stores have rent-by-the hour Apple and IBM-compatible computers with a choice of software. Their toll-free number, 1-800-743-Copy, will help locate the nearest one. For frequent travellers who require office or conference space, particularly those who prefer not to conduct interviews in their hotel room, a workable choice is to join an airline club. The perks more than compensate for the cost. American Airlines' Admirals Club, and United Air's Red Carpet Club, for example, rent conference rooms for Dollars 25 per hour at all their airport locations. The clubs also let you make local telephone calls free, offer free copying, have fax machines, and even check cashing services. The clubs are designed to provide sanctuary from the airport frenzy, and most do a good job at this. The Admiral's Club has a Dollars 100 initiation fee and a Dollars 150 annual membership charge, while the Red Carpet Club is a few dollars more. Nearly every airline, national or regional, that operates in the US offers club services. Ask your travel agent for specifics, including a list of cities where clubs are located. International travellers may find away-from-office aid is already in their briefcase. American Express has long been known for providing mail drops in faraway cities to card holders. It also has a service centre in the US that can provide telephone help to customers in 60 different languages. For a fee, American Express can arrange office services, meeting planning, and a variety of other assistance to executive cardholders in nearly any North American location.</p>

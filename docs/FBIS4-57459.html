			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Today, Ecuador paid international banks the first  $25 million of overdue interest, thus beginning to comply with  an agreement whereby this amount must be paid two weeks after  the refinancing announcement was made on 3 May. Government  sources said that another $25 million, equivalent to $5 million  monthly for overdue interest from January to May, will be  disbursed in three days. The amount is due before Friday.    Two weeks ago, the Ecuadoran Government agreed to refinance  the country's commercial debt of $7.5 billion over a 30-year  period with a 15-percent write off with banks. This operation  will make it possible for the country to refinance its debt with  the Paris Club and other lending organizations.    Ecuador's total debt borders on $13 billion, Latin America's  largest per capita. The $13-billion debt is equivalent to $1,000  for each of the country's 13 million inhabitants. Shortly before  reaching this agreement with the creditor banks, President Sixto  Duran-Ballen paid $5 million in April as a gesture of good faith  and seriousness, Finance Minister Cesar Robalino reported at the  time. With this payment, Ecuador ended a 20-month delay in the  payment of overdue interest, which had accumulated up to a total  of $2.5 billion since 1987. As for the remaining principal,  approximately $5 billion, the country will choose among several  alternatives proposed.</p>

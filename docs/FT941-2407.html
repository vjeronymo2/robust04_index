			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Rancour grows on William Hill acquisition The temperature is rising in the dispute between Brent Walker and Grand Metropolitan over the Pounds 685m acquisition of the William Hill and Mecca Bookmakers betting business. Last week GrandMet started court proceedings to seek 'rectification' of the sale agreement, claiming Brent Walker had changed its interpretation of one aspect of the deal. Brent Walker appears incensed by GrandMet's move which it sees an an attempt to rewrite the agreement, and will today issue a statement. It seems to be suggesting GrandMet expects to come off worse in arbitration and so is trying to change the terms of the deal. The two parties have been in dispute over the deal since autumn 1990, and in July 1992 agreed to go to arbitration. A partner of Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm, was appointed and is preparing to receive final submissions. Although the parties agreed the arbitrator's decision would be final, followers of the saga have always thought the loser would resort to the courts. The property and leisure group's statement today will argue that rectification 'is not concerned with the interpretation of agreements, but with the correction of alleged errors in the drafting of an agreement'. Brent Walker and William Hill will say they will resist the proceedings because they do not accept there were errors in the agreement. The statement continues 'the writ issued by GrandMet has nothing to do with interpretation, but is an attempt to rewrite parts of the agreement'. The agreement was signed in September and the deal completed in December 1989. GrandMet promised the business would achieve profits of Pounds 55m in the year to end September 1989. Brent Walker could reclaim part of the purchase price if profits fell below Pounds 51m. In that case it could reclaim 12.82 times the difference between the profits made and Pounds 55m. By September 1990 Brent Walker was claiming a Pounds 160m refund of the purchase price and refused to pay the final Pounds 50m then due. The courts ruled in 1991 that Brent Walker had to pay the Pounds 50m.</p>

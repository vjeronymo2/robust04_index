			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Department of Energy's $81-billion plan to refurbish the nation's aging  nuclear weapons plants leans too heavily toward modernizing production  facilities and proposes too little for cleaning up 40 years of accumulated  chemical and radioactive wastes, the congressional General Accounting Office  said. The DOE's 21-year plan would result in a "revitalized weapons complex,"  Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher told the House Budget Committee, but  "the plan does not adequately address the cleanup . . . and decontamination of  facilities as they are retired from service." Environmental restoration of  weapons plants will extend beyond the year 2010 and may cost $40 billion to $70  billion, Bowsher said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian Popular Front Chairman Zyanon </F> Paznyak by Vital Tsyhankow; place and date not given: "Zyanon  Paznyak: `Empire Cannot Be Democratic' -- Belarusian Popular  Front Chairman on Russia and Russian Elections"]    [Text] [Tsyhankow] How do you assess the results of the  elections in Russia? Were they a surprise to you?    [Paznyak] The results of the elections are natural for an  empire that is experiencing a deep socioeconomic crisis. Such  situations bring people to power who address the lower instincts  of the lumpen-proletariat and promise too much. This is a  well-known path by which some European countries have gone and  by which Russia is now going. The results of the elections were  not startling for the Belarusian Popular Front [BPF]. Moreover,  we did not expect that the elections could improve the political  situation in Russia, because the political platforms of Russian  political parties were nourished by imperial trends. All of  them, in greater or lesser degree, backed a general Russian  imperial mood because -- and I would like to repeat this again  -- an empire cannot be democratic. That is an axiom.    It is evident that Russia is developing in an antidemocratic  way -- this is natural for Russia, though it is at the same time  a tragic way for events to develop. All the power will be  polarized (not only the State Duma!), with the mutual opposition  of the president and legislature. All this can lead to civil  war, even to global war.    Speaking about the results of elections in Russia, we can  state the complete failure of Western policy toward Russia. The  West has once again demonstrated its complete misunderstanding  of the events in the former states of the USSR. In general, I  assess the Western policy as being Philistine. A similar policy  had caused the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentropp Treaty in the  1930's.... The policy directed at the creation of a democratic  Russia is illusory as long as Russia remains an empire.  However, it can exist only as an empire....    [Tsyhankow] That is to say, you think that Russia can exist  only as an empire or it better cease to exist at all?    [Paznyak] Yes, this is the case.    [Tsyhankow] Does this fit the interests of the world  community?    [Paznyak] Yes, it will be better when an empire ceases to  exist. Having reached the peak of its economic potential in the  19th-20th centuries, Russia became a source of military danger.  An empire is always extending its borders, it is ready to  swallow the entire world, foreign cultures and economies and  later deem them Russian. The Romans thought this way, so what  happened later? The Roman Empire collapsed, the Roman nation  and language disappeared.    The Russian nation should specify its nationality. It is  always the national culture that is aspiring to develop and  defend its creative potential. Currently, the Russians have an  imperial consciousness and think along imperial lines.    [Tsyhankow] How can Russians understand that they need to  split the Russian Federation?    [Paznyak] It is impossible to realize. This topic demands a  lot of time and we are limited to a newspaper interview.  However, you should realize: Russia is an empire whose  population thinks along imperial lines.    [Tsyhankow] It is a vicious circle. Is there a way out?    [Paznyak] In the opinion of BPF, the way out lies in the  creation of a counterbalance in East Europe. The Baltic-Black  Sea Association will stabilize the situation in this part of  Europe. This idea was born in Belarus in 1916. The empire can  start falling and this dangerous and lengthy process should be  kept under control.    [Tsyhankow] How do the results of the Russian elections  effect the pro-communist Supreme Soviet majority who advocate a  close union with Russia?    [Paznyak] Communism and fascism have the same roots, they  have similar ideas and symbols. On a certain level of  development, they can change color and even unite with someone  else. However, history demonstrates that communists will never  share power with other political forces. By the way, Russian  history is a vivid example of this: Communists required only a  single night to murder the members of several political parties!  Communists are ready to unite with anyone, however, they will  betray and do away with their allies as soon as they secure  unlimited power. When the position of communists in the State  Duma is strengthened, their Belarusian colleagues will resume  their activities.    Currently, Belarusian communists are at a crossroads -- they  do not know what to do. Please, pay attention to this: More  than two weeks have passed since the Russian elections were  held, and our Supreme Soviet is still silent on the issue; as if  Russia has ceased to exist.    [Text] [Tsyhankow] What conclusions has the BPF made?    [Paznyak] We propose nothing extraordinary. There are legal  norms according to which the international community should  operate. These legal norms were violated for decades and only  now are they being revived. Belarus should introduce its own  national currency and carry out an independent national policy  or, in other words, Belarus should force the world to recognize  it so it can reap the fruits of its labor.    The second and more significant conclusion concerns nuclear  weapons. When adventurers seize power in a nuclear state and  plan to wage aggressive wars and change borders, they should not  get access to the nuclear button. This is clear to everybody.  Therefore, Ukraine and Belarus should both give back their  nuclear missiles to Russia. Belarus does not require nuclear  weapons and I want to remind you that the BPF was the first to  propose that a nonnuclear and neutral status of a Belarusian  state become a constitutional requirement. We do not need  nuclear weapons but we cannot give back the nuclear warheads to  politicians who can start a world war.    [Tsyhankow] In your opinion, can the acting Belarusian  Government arrive at the same conclusion?    [Paznyak] It is not difficult to draw this conclusion,  however, our cabinet members are busy discussing an issue of  corruption in high places and are anxious over how to stay in  power. The problem is that we cannot destroy our weapons  without our Western partners -- it is an expensive affair. Even  today Belarus is dismantling its tanks and missiles, however, no  other state in the world is doing the same. All this is done at  the expense of Belarusian taxpayers and without any Western aid.  What is it? If the West is not going to aid us in the future,  we should find another way out of this predicament.    [Tsyhankow] Can we expect that the policy of the West toward  Russia will change? It will be more embarrassing to change  their policy after the presidential elections are held in Russia.    [Paznyak] All the political, moral, and financial support of  the West is going to Russia, while Belarus and Ukraine are  completely ignored. The West authorized Russia (with its huge  oil and gas potential) to subordinate Belarus and Ukraine. The  West did it consciously, pretending that it was pursuing a wise  policy of creating a "democratic Russia."    However, if the West is concerned with the spreading of  European civilization, it should have started with the  strengthening of Baltic, Belarusian, and Ukrainian statehood.  The West should not have earmarked credits to this procommunist  regime but should have rendered moral and political support to  democratic forces. We do not even require their money -- we  have both labor and intellect. We require consultative visits by  foreign experts. We do not get this -- all the aid is directed  to Russian, where people fight and kill each other.    Will the West change its position on the issue? Of course,  they will introduce some changes. However, as far as my  personal opinion is concerned, the Western mind is very inert  and slow, and cannot be radically changed in a short period of  time. The West thinks that Russia and its neighbors are far  away, however, they are very close to its door.... I am scared  that the West will unwillingly -- as was done with Hitler --  help Russian fascists come to power.</p>

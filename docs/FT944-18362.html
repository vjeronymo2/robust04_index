			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Observer: I'm all right Jack It's all right for some. Neil Kinnock, preparing to depart for his Pounds 103,500-a-year (plus expenses) sojourn in Brussels, yesterday offered the Labour conference the definition of 'rich' which the present party leadership has consistently refused to disclose. Anyone earning over Pounds 60,000 is in that category and faces the possibility of higher taxes, Kinnock told a fringe meeting. He, of course, will not be paying British taxes, Tory or Labour.</p>

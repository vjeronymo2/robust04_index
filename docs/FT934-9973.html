			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Signs of the weakening UK bulls LEADING UK institutional fund managers have turned less bullish about UK equities, according to the latest Gallup survey for stockbrokers Smith New Court, published today. Questioning was carried out before Friday's sharp declines in US and European bond and stock markets. The responses show that for the first time since the monthly poll began in 1990, the managers are evenly divided on whether to increase representation in UK equities, as opposed to the majority being in favour. There is increased interest in Japanese equities, and a continuation of the balance of views expressed in the last couple of months' surveys in favour of raising holdings in continental European equities and running down representation in US equities. While managers still express confidence in the outlook for the UK economy, there are a few signs of increased caution compared with last month. The balance between institutions that are positive and those that are negative on UK equities over the next 12 months fell from 77 per cent in the October survey to 65 per cent. The percentage of managers expecting the UK economy to get a lot better in the next year has fallen from 21 per cent to 14 per cent. There is also a small rise in the number expecting inflation to be going up more rapidly in 12 months' time, and the first upward revision in six months of the inflation forecast, which is put at 3.7 per cent at the end of 1994. Some 93 institutions, handling funds totalling Pounds 732bn, took part in the survey.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed Area N modification would allow for more airspace for aircraft departing LAX and would allow aircraft, northbound over Santa Monica, to execute an earlier turn westbound. Additionally, this change would benefit VFR operations by providing additional airspace for uncontrolled VFR aircraft to overfly Point Dume, CA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation Summary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA has determined that this rulemaking is not a ``significant regulatory action'' as defined by Executive Order 12866, and therefore no Regulatory Impact Analysis is required. Nevertheless, in accordance with the Department of Transportation policies and procedures, the FAA has evaluated the anticipated costs and benefits, which are summarized below. For more detailed economic information, see the full regulatory evaluation contained in the docket. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Benefit-Cost Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal would improve aviation traffic flow and enhance aviation safety by altering Class B airspace in and around LAX while accommodating the legitimate concerns of airspace users.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Costs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA has determined that there would be little or no costs associated with implementation of the proposed modification to the LAX Class B airspace area to either the agency or aircraft operators. The determination for each potential cost is discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule would not impose any additional administrative costs on the FAA for either personnel or equipment. The additional operations workload generated by the proposed rule would be absorbed by current personnel and equipment resources which are already in place. The cost of revising aeronautical charts to reflect the change of the airspace would not add to the normal requirement of routine and periodic updating of the charts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aircraft operating in the vicinity of the proposed expanded Los Angeles Class B airspace area should already have two-way radio communications capability because the proposed expanded LAX Class B airspace area is surrounded by Class C and D airspace areas. Thus, little if any, additional communication equipment should be required by this proposal. To minimize any radio installation costs that may occur, the FAA would provide cutouts along the floor of the proposed expanded Class B airspace area. In addition, procedural agreements between ATC and affected satellite airports could be used to avoid imposing radio installation costs on operators at these airports. Additionally, the cost to pilots who avoid the Los Angeles Class B airspace area should not increase significantly. Only small deviations from the current flight paths would be required to avoid the proposed expanded Los Angeles Class B airspace area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ordinarily, aircraft operating in and above the proposed expanded LAX Class B airspace area would be required to have Mode C transponders as a result of the Mode C rule. However, all of the airspace that would be included in the proposed expanded Class B airspace area lies entirely within the Los Angeles Mode C Veil centered around LAX. Therefore, the FAA contends that all aircraft operating in or above the proposed expanded LAX Class B airspace area already have Mode C transponders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Benefits <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule is expected to generate benefits primarily in the form of improved traffic flow while enhancing safety. Enhancements to safety come in the lowered risk of midair collisions (despite the rise in traffic density) due to the increased ATC control of the modified airspace. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule would benefit GA aircraft operators by reducing the size of the various subareas of the Class B airspace area, thus increasing usable airspace for GA aircraft. Additionally, it would simplify the airspace and reduce possible pilot confusion. Also, areas B and C would be reduced to allow more airspace with less restrictions for emergency response aircraft. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In view of the minimal cost of compliance versus enhancements to aviation safety and efficiency, the FAA has determined that the proposed rule is cost-beneficial. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Determination <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionately burdened by Government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review proposed rules which may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The small entities which could be potentially affected by the implementation of this proposed rule are unscheduled operators of aircraft for hire owning nine or fewer aircraft.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Only those unscheduled aircraft operators without the capability to operate under IFR conditions would be potentially impacted by the proposed rule. The FAA believes that all of the potentially impacted unscheduled aircraft operators are already equipped to operate under IFR conditions. This is because such operators fly regularly in airports where radar approach control services have been established. Therefore, the FAA believes this proposed rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

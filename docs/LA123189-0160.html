			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MINOR LEAGUE HOCKEY TEAM REVOLTS ON NEW BOSS  </P> <P> Twenty players on the Tri-City Americans Hockey Club refused to play their  Western Hockey League game at the Tri-Cities Coliseum against the Portland  Winter Hawks Saturday.  </P> <P> The revolt surrounded Bill LaForge, hired by Americans' owner Ron Dixon Dec. 17  to become director of hockey operations.  </P> <P> A player for the Americans who requested anonymity telephoned the Tri-City  Herald on Saturday and said: "We won't play until Bill LaForge is out of the  organization. If LaForge is fired, we might play (Sunday) in Portland."  </P> <P> Management of the two WHL clubs agreed that the game would be considered  canceled, but the prospect of the teams playing their scheduled game today in  Portland remained uncertain.  </P> <P> Efforts to reach Dixon by phone were unsuccessful.  </P> <P> WHL President Ed Chynoweth, in a telephone interview from his home in Calgary,  Canada, said: "We are attempting to get the players to agree to play in  Portland. I have offered my services as the arbitrator to sort out their  differences."  </P> <P> LaForge, 38, came to the Americans after being fired as coach of the Niagara  Falls Thunder of the Ontario Hockey League. LaForge has a 4-14-2 record this  season.  </P> <P> "What can I say," LaForge said Saturday. "I thought that when I came everything  was copacetic."  </P> <P> The player said the team met for seven hours Friday night and decided to  revolt.  </P> <P> "We had come back from Christmas break and had two days of practice (with Coach  Rick Kozuback) before LaForge showed up," he said. "It was the best two days of  practice we've ever had.  </P> <P> "Then Friday afternoon, LaForge comes in and takes over. He didn't even  introduce himself. He just starts swearing at us and telling us what he's going  to do to us. We wanted to give him a chance. He just lost it. He turned  everybody off. We want him out of here."  </P> <P> LaForge said that he and Kozuback spoke with the players at the hotel earlier  Saturday.  </P> <P> "I told them last night that I would not go behind the bench (and coach),"  LaForge said. "If they want to play for Rick, that's fine. I'm only here to  help them win in the long term, not the short term. I'm here to prepare the  (50-man protected) list for the future."  </P></p>

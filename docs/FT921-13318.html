			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian smelting target 'out of reach' - A look at an overstretched aluminium industry RUSSIA AIMS to export 1m tonnes of aluminium this year, the same amount as in 1991, when the sudden flood of Soviet metal created turmoil in the western industry, caused it to make extensive production cuts and sent prices spiralling down to their lowest-ever level in real terms. But the newly-independent republic has virtually no hope of achieving that ambitious target, says Mr Karl Wobbe, who has just returned after leading the first western delegation to the Russian aluminium industry this year. Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russia's president, worried about his collapsing economy, has decreed that aluminium smelters in the first quarter of 1992 must supply domestic fabricators with at least 70 per cent of the tonnage supplied in the same months last year. Mr Wobbe suggests, however, that there is little chance of smelter managers obeying this instruction. The Russians also recognise that most of their aluminium smelters are big polluters and fall far short of acceptable standards. Two have closed but there are no indications that any more are in line for imminent closure. In all areas Russia's political objectives for its aluminium industry are being undermined by what Mr Wobbe calls 'the human factor'. Smelter managers can hardly enjoy their new-found freedom of action when they cannot provide enough food for hungry workers and their families (most smelters are supposed to be self-sufficient and provide cradle-to-grave facilities for the workforce.) In one extreme case, a smelter is swapping products with a northern Italian food producer - bartering 1 kg of aluminium for 1 kg of powdered milk. Care of the environment must also take second place in these dire circumstances. Smelters at Krasnoyarsk, which produced 800,000 tonnes of aluminium a year, and at Bratsk, 1m tonnes a year, have been closed because each emitted 6,000 tonnes of fluorine, about 20 times the level permitted even by Soviet standards. 'But if people are hungry, smelters will continue to produce, even if it has to be at a reduced rate,' Mr Wobbe points out. Smelters are also extremely short of spare parts. So aluminium is being bartered for spares. Mr Wobbe, who is on the management board of VAW of Germany and is responsible for the group's aluminium production, says Moscow officials want to reduce the number of barter deals because they cut foreign currency imports. For, like the smelter managers, Russia itself is fighting for survival and gives top priority to its desperate quest for foreign currencies to pay for its debts. The Russian aluminium industry's senior management seems well aware of the problems Soviet exports caused last year. They confirm that 1m tonnes of the metal was exported, three times the net exports of about 300,000 tonnes in 1990. This helped to push aluminium prices on the London Metal Exchange down to about 50 cents a lb - at which level 75 per cent of western world smelters are operating at or below their cash costs. 'The Russians are not happy about the price on the LME and asked what they could do. But they need foreign currencies so they have set themselves the political objective of exporting another 1m tonnes this year,' says Mr Wobbe. His team found that most of the former Soviet Union's aluminium production had been taken over by Concernalumini (Aluminium Company), set up recently in the Russian Republic. At first it was to be called the Aluminium Company of Russia but some of the assets are outside the republic: there are a smelter and alumina plants in Tadzhikistan while the biggest aluminium converting operations are in Samara near Tubichev and at Uralski Kamensk. Mr Igor Vladimirovits Prokopof, a former minister of non-ferrous metals and chairman of Sovalum, the Soviet aluminium organisation, heads Concernalumini with another former prominent figure from Sovalum, Mr Vladimir Kaltschenko as his second-in-command. 'The same people are managing the industry but I feel there is not the same power at the centre. Directors of individual plants have much more freedom of decision,' says Mr Wobbe. At the time of his previous visit, in May last year, smelters were charging converters 4,000 roubles a tonne for aluminium. Smelters are charging 30,000 roubles a tonne in the first quarter this year which, at the official rate of exchange, is about Dollars 300 a tonne. Apart from inflationary pressures (Mr Wobbe estimates inflation is 2 to 3 per cent a week at present) smelters also face substantially increased costs. Imports of alumina, the essential raw material for aluminium production, are costing Dollars 180 to Dollars 200 a tonne. 'I did not feel prices are covering costs, particularly of alumina, both domestically-produced and imported alumina,' says Mr Wobbe. Shortages abound - and not just of spare parts for obsolete and worn-out equipment. Russia's alumina industry is short of caustic soda, a vital raw material, and is having difficulty paying for bauxite imports, the ore from which alumina is made. There are shortages of coal products such as coke, coal tar and coal pitch. At one aluminium plant he visited, at Tadshic, Mr Wobbe found only one production line was working, reducing the annual rate of output from 500,000 to 200,000 tonnes. 'My personal impression from plant visits is that Russia's aluminium production will go down by 20 per cent this year,' he says. Russia's annual aluminium production capacity is between 3.5m and 3.6m tonnes. VAW estimates that from this the former Soviet Union produced about 3.2m tonnes last year. 'We expect this to be down to 2.5m to 2.8m tonnes this year.' Transporting raw materials and finished metal is also difficult in Russia. Transport problems seem particularly acute at the moment because some ports are clogged with large grain shipments with which their bureaucratic administrative systems simply cannot cope. 'So,' says Mr Wobbe, 'although in theory 1m tonnes of aluminium exports could be realised, we have considerable doubts that it will.' Nevertheless, even a reduced rate of Russian aluminium exports seem likely to force the closure of more capacity in the west, particularly in Europe. Mr Wobbe points out: 'It is likely that Europe will close modernised and environmentally-friendly smelters to permit polluting and unprofitable smelters in Russia to continue.' The European Aluminium Association and some governments are attempting to find a formula to prevent this happening - but not simply by putting up barriers against the Russian industry. The European Aluminium Association's search for a compromise solution will be the subject of a second article on Friday.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (As at Monday's close) tonnes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Aluminium          +7,000      to    1,043,375 Copper             -9,750      to      318,100 Lead                 -625      to      126,925 Nickel               +432      to       15,252 Zinc                 +475      to      160,425 Tin                   -45      to       14,010  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

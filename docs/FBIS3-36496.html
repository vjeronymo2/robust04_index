This is the chief result of talks  between General of the Army Pavel Grachev, Russian minister of  defence, and his French counterpart, Francois Leotard, who is  currently in Russia on an official visit.    The defence cooperation agreement provides for exchanges of  military delegations and consultations on defence matters. The  military-technical cooperation accord envisages joint tackling  of defence industry conversion matters, the development of some  types of armaments and military hardware, those for the Air  Force, in particular, and the coordination of matters concerning  arms trade with third countries.    The agreements signed bring Russia and France to a  qualitatively new level of relations, the two ministers  emphasised during their meeting.    M. Leotard together with Grachev visited the Taman Guards  Motorised Rifle Division, took in specimens of arms and combat  hardware, and familiarised himself with the living conditions of  personnel.    The French guest's trip to the Tula Airborne Division,  scheduled for Friday, has been cancelled.</p>

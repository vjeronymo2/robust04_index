			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OF JUDGMENT AND EXCESS: LOOKING FOR BAD TASTE IN L.A.  </P> <P> Bad Taste. Like pornography, no one seems able to define it -- but everyone  claims to know it when they see it.  </P> <P> Unlike bad morals, bad taste is basically harmless, benign, even funny. And  unlike bad manners, bad taste is a subjective blight, existing in the eye of  the beholder.  </P> <P> "Los Angeles is everything a great American city should be: rich, hilarious, of  questionable taste and throbbing with fake glamour," says director John Waters  ("Hairspray"), who has made a career out of tackiness; his 1972 film "Pink  Flamingos" was even advertised as "an exercise in poor taste." He cautions,  however, "to understand bad taste one must have very good taste."  </P> <P> Other artists have tackled the topic as well. Pablo Picasso once said, "The  chief enemy of creativity is 'good' taste." And the French surrealist Andre  Breton asserted, "In the bad taste of my epoch, I strive to go farther than any  other."  </P> <P> </P> <P> In Search of Answers  </P> <P> One wonders what Picasso and Breton would make of Los Angeles circa 1989: a  town where a supposedly formal party can mean more bras on cars than on the  women who drive them. But after asking L.A. professionals who work in a variety  of fields to elaborate on their notions of bad taste, one can only draw a  single conclusion: bad taste is merely a question of . . . taste. "De gustibus  non est disputandum."  </P> <P> </P> <P> "It's a vast topic," giggles Jackie Collins, the British-born novelist whose  best-selling books "Hollywood Wives" and "Hollywood Husbands" recount bad  taste, L.A. style, in lip-smacking detail. "There's always been plenty of bad  taste in L.A. Hollywood is more flashy than other American cities, except maybe  Las Vegas; it has more glitz, more gossip, more hustlers."  </P> <P> "Bad taste results when people don't understand limit or dimension. Then,  tackiness and pretense become emphasized," says restaurateur Piero Selvaggio,  who has had a bird's-eye view of the behavior and misbehavior of the rich and  famous at his restaurants Valentino and Primi.  </P> <P> Selvaggio is bemused rather than annoyed by the bumper crop of bad taste he  sees in L.A.  </P> <P> "It is a growing, new city, with all the problems that go with that," he says.  "Money has been pouring in so incredibly that suddenly people are rich and  finding themselves behaving in the most pretentious manner. Isn't that all a  part of a city with very little culture or diversification? Material things  become a part of the status quo."  </P> <P> "Someone who in the fin-de-siecle of the 20th Century wants to live in an  all-Chippendale room is exhibiting a lack of taste and a lack of judgment,"  says Charlie Scheips, formerly the associate publisher of ARTCOAST magazine and  the current project manager for ART-LA89, the annual L.A. Contemporary Art  Fair.  </P> <P> "Bad taste, to me, is the attempt to express style without humor or mystery,"  Scheips says, "and you can certainly see plenty of that in L.A. But there are  really no external standards for taste, despite the fact that the whole camp  and kitsch sensibilities are based on an understanding of bad taste."  </P> <P> Merchant Fred Hayman, who set the style in Beverly Hills first with Giorgio and  now with his own eponymous shop on Rodeo Drive, thinks that taste in L.A. is  improving, "but there's still lots of bad taste everywhere. It's part of L.A.  being a much younger, much more fun city."  </P> <P> It's easier to stick to generalities when discussing bad taste; when it comes  to specifics, there's a wide range of opinion. Certainly most people, for  instance, would agree on the poor taste of something as ludicrous as a mink  bikini. But what about that hotly debated symbol of conspicuous consumption,  the fur coat?  </P> <P> Animal-rights activists might argue that merely owning one would be an act of  the poorest taste imaginable, but others would qualify the coat by where and  how it was worn: to a PTA meeting, for instance, or on the back of an Eskimo.  </P> <P> "Fur coats are in bad taste. Period," Collins says, while Scheips demurs, "I  think some fur coats are beautiful. But they're more practical in colder  climates. In Los Angeles, where no one really needs a fur coat it's a major  issue (of taste)."  </P> <P> "I think they (fur coats) are more an example of poor judgment, not poor  taste," says screenwriter/novelist Bruce Wagner. Wagner limned the vulgarities  of the rich in his screenplay for the film "Scenes From the Class Struggle in  Beverly Hills," which gleefully delved into a world where family wakes come  with cocktail pianists and the rich seek diet quacks to lose weight. After a  moment of reflection on the fur-coat issue, however, Wagner revises his  opinion.  </P> <P> "No, I take that back. If I see them on those young actors who fancy themselves  to be celebrity poets, those fur coats are in bad taste."  </P> <P> Others disagree. Longtime Beverly Hills socialite and charity worker Ellen  Byrens says simply, "If you have 'em, you wear 'em. But I would not purchase  the fur of a trapped animal."  </P> <P> Clothing, that ultimate personal expression of style, is particularly fraught  with the potential for bad taste.  </P> <P> "A polyester pantsuit is, of course, in bad taste," Collins says. "But so is  wearing too many diamonds. Good and bad taste has nothing to do with wealth.  Diamonds are great and rhinestones are great -- but not with diamonds. Someone  who would mix rhinestones and diamonds would be exhibiting very bad taste."  </P> <P> "Don't you know that the people who are against big diamonds are only the ones  who don't have them?" Byrens laughs.  </P> <P> Rhinestones and diamonds, tasteless as they may be when mixed together, are  hardly a common sight outside the charity bowls of Beverly Hills. What about  the far more common -- and growing -- phenomenon of wearing workout gear  outside of the gym?  </P> <P> "I've seen men wearing weightlifting belts in the supermarket," Wagner  shudders.  </P> <P> "Someone wearing gym clothes to a restaurant is in bad taste," says Scheips,  for whom workout gear crosses the line even in a town famous for its casual  clothing at all occasions. "In L.A., casual means having expensive loafers and  a Missoni sweater. I call it faux-casual."  </P> <P> And when it comes to evening wear Scheips is equally adamant.  </P> <P> "No colored bow ties or cummerbunds," he says.  </P> <P> Others agree.  </P> <P> "I've seen tuxedos made of screaming-green Lurex," Jackie Collins says. "The  only person I think could get away with that is someone like Michael Jackson,  whose taste is impeccable," she adds.  </P> <P> Wagner, whose everyday wear is more Melrose than Brooks Brothers -- thick  black-rimmed glasses and baggy jackets -- finds clothing to be more of a  relative matter.  </P> <P> "I think things that are either studiously boring or studiously affected are in  bad taste," he says. "But different people can get away with different things.  What's inexcusable is if you have bad shoes."  </P> <P> "A plaid tuxedo is in absolutely horrible taste," Byrens says. "I know a guy  who has one and wears it!"  </P> <P> Subtlety is the key to avoiding bad taste, say both Hayman and Selvaggio, who  think that a tasteful tuxedo is one that is not noticed or out of place. "Less  is much, much more, as long as it doesn't become boring," says Hayman, who  professes "a great dislike" for ruffled or colored tuxedo shirts or -- worst of  all -- wearing brown shoes with a tuxedo. But what of men's evening wear in  colors other than black or white?  </P> <P> "If you have the guts to wear it, I take off my hat to you," Selvaggio says  diplomatically. "But some of those things I've seen are purely . . .  hallucinogenic."  </P> <P> Designer clothing that bears the designer's name also rankles Scheips ("I'm not  an ad"), while Collins thinks, "It depends on the designer. Fendi, for  instance, is never in bad taste."  </P> <P> The chic L.A. restaurant scene can be a breeding ground, a veritable petri dish  of bad taste: a place where eateries boast of their unlisted telephone numbers,  potential customers will wait two hours to pay for the privilege of being  abused, and it's often a draw as to whether the staff or the customers behave  the worst.  </P> <P> "We see things at Valentino that . . . puzzle us," Selvaggio says, choosing his  words carefully. "Recently we had a birthday party for a 1-year-old with real  lions and a circus and a lavish buffet -- for a 1-year-old! Then we had a  bachelor party, which ended with the arrival of a 240-pound lady wrestler.  </P> <P> "I have also seen people order a $5,000 bottle of wine, merely to impress a  girl. And then when they only drink about three ounces of it -- it really blows  your mind."  </P> <P> Sometimes bad taste in restaurant-going begins even before one enters the door.  Which is in worst taste: the restaurants that force customers to queue up for  no reason at all, or customers who willingly put up with such treatment?  </P> <P> "What's the point of going to a place that doesn't want you to be there?"  Wagner sneers, speaking of the boites and private clubs whose pretentions to  exclusivity result in long humiliating lines for the proletariat. "I think it's  in bad taste for both the restaurant and the people waiting to get in, like it  was Six Flags Magic Mountain. To me, it's in bad taste to wait for anything  except a movie or an AIDS test."  </P> <P> Says Scheips: "I don't understand anybody wanting -- or paying -- to be treated  badly."  </P> <P> "Bad taste in restaurants is just poor manners," Hayman says. "It's when people  are too loud or obnoxious, or the waiter or captain tries to become too  personal."  </P> <P> And speaking of personal, Collins claims to have been in trendy L.A.  restaurants where "people are having sex with girls in adjoining rooms. That is  in horrendous taste, as is using drugs. I also hate it when I'm out and I see a  couple who are passionately making out nearby; I figure that they don't even  touch each other once they get home."  </P> <P> "These people that pay $350 for box seats at the Lakers, or $500 to see  'Phantom of the Opera' -- it becomes about status, not sports or theater,"  Selvaggio says. "Certain people play into that sense of inferiority, that  confusion about values. I've been to some picnic orgies at the Hollywood Bowl,  where Tchaikovsky is playing to the stars, and people are eating, kissing,  doing everything but listening to the music."  </P> <P> One aspect of L.A. life that several people singled out as being in bad taste  was the proliferation of bodyguards on the Hollywood scene, and the celebrities  who, for whatever reason, feel the need to surround themselves by intimidating  musclemen at industry functions.  </P> <P> "I have seen movie stars with six bodyguards," Collins states in  half-fascinated, half-horrified tones, "who send a bodyguard or two over to  another table to try and get a woman for the star. Appalling."  </P> <P> According to Selvaggio, "That is insecurity, not bad taste. They've come to  accept and need an entourage to cope with success. I mean, I know people who  make money by being professional company, going out with celebrities and  laughing at their jokes and everything."  </P> <P> Can bad taste sometimes become good taste? That is, can it go so far, with such  abandon, that it transcends traditional notions of taste and becomes an  expression of style all its own?  </P> <P> "Oh, absolutely," Collins says. "Las Vegas is the very capital of bad taste for  instance -- but it can be fun. Look at the style in films like 'Married to the  Mob' or 'Hairspray.' You can get away with a lot if you have humor."  </P> <P> "Kitsch transcends all that," according to Wagner, mentioning the Tail o' the  Pup (the venerable L.A. wienie stand shaped like a hot dog) as an example of  bad taste so transcendent it becomes good taste. "The worst thing about it is  if it becomes boring or self-conscious."  </P> <P> Conversely, Wagner cites The Burger That Ate L.A. (a new Melrose hamburger  stand shaped like a hamburger), as true bad taste -- "an artificial landmark.  Like Epcot Center in Florida, trying to replicate the Eiffel Tower and the  landmarks of the world. It's bullying the public, rubbing people's nose in it."  </P> <P> What about someone like Liberace, who took rococo kitsch to such an extreme  that he still stands as perhaps the bad taste beau ideal of our time?  </P> <P> "Liberace's home is not bad taste," Collins insists. "He was an entertainer,  and this was part of his persona. If a bank manager decorated like that, it  might be bad taste."  </P> <P> Wagner agrees. "Hollywood is, after all, a repudiation of one's roots," he  points out, while Scheips thinks it was actually good taste on Liberace's part.  "He did it with humor. He transformed kitschy candelabras into a statement."  </P> <P> What's the ultimate in bad taste?  </P> <P> "I've lived in L.A., for 25 years, and I've seen people making fools of  themselves in so many ways," Selvaggio says, begging off the question. "Let's  forgive L.A., shall we, for being so young and rich?"  </P> <P> "Flaunting excess," Fred Hayman says. "Publicizing your wealth. You know,  there's nothing wrong with having a hell of a lot, but when you show too much,  that is in awful taste."  </P> <P> "I think criticizing other people is in very bad taste," Scheips says. "And  making someone feel as if they were in a lower station than you is the very  ultimate in bad taste."  </P> <P> To Byrens, the ultimate in bad taste "is putting someone in an embarrassing  position. If you want to yell at someone who is your social equal, that's OK --  but never at a salesgirl or a waiter."  </P> <P> Isolating bad taste in L.A., according to Wagner, "would be like taking a slide  of a cancer patient and pointing your stubby finger at which cells are growing  and where. Come on! This is the very crucible of bad taste!"  </P> <P> But Wagner is a pragmatist as well.  </P> <P> "The bottom line, of course," he sighs, is "as long as you make a lot of money  in L.A., people do tend to ignore bad taste."  </P></p>

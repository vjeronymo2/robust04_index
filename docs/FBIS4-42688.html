			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the National Security Council </F> Secretariat General on 6 June]    [Text] The National Security Council [NSC] held an  extraordinary session at the Cankaya Presidential Mansion on 6  June under the chairmanship of President Suleyman Demirel, with  the participation of the prime minister, the chief of the  General Staff, NSC member ministers, the force commanders, the  general commander of the Gendarmerie, and the secretary general  of the NSC. The state minister and deputy prime minister also  attended the meeting.    The developments in northern Iraq within the context of  Operation Provide Comfort were discussed during the meeting.  The NSC determined that the conditions in the region have not  reached the point that call for the termination of the said  operation. In view of this situation and in light of the  importance of protecting Iraq's territorial integrity, the NSC  decided to recommend to the government to extend the mandate of  the multinational force as of 30 June for a period to be deemed  appropriate.</p>

			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROJECT IN WALNUT HITS OPPOSITION;  </P> <P> HOMEOWNERS COOL TO DEVELOPER'S PLAN  </P> <P> It is a city that draws affluent families to its bucolic suburban life style,  prestigious schools and safe neighborhoods. Half-million-dollar homes are not  uncommon and residents take neighborly pride in their hometown.  </P> <P> But a number of residents have given the developer who wants to build 695  luxury homes, a hotel, and recreational facilities on the last undeveloped site  in the city a decidedly unfriendly welcome.  </P> <P> The developer, Newport Beach-based The William Lyon Co., has scaled down the  project several times since the city first rejected the original proposal to  build 1,200 homes on a hilly 551.5-acre site just south of West Covina and east  of the BKK Landfill.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drain Resources  </P> <P> Despite the reduction in size, dozens of residents and several homeowner  associations still bristle at the thought of pristine hillsides being graded  and leveled to make way for extravagant homes, a 125- to 200-room hotel, an  equestrian trail, a nine-hole golf course and a shopping center.  </P> <P> Residents say the development would pose landslide and earthquake hazards. Some  of them are worried about the proximity of the site to the landfill, and fear  that the development's wells could be contaminated one day by chemicals from  the dump that have seeped into the ground water.  </P> <P> Consultants for the Lyon Co., one of the largest home builders in the state,  are expected to release an environmental impact report for the project next  month. At an Aug. 1 meeting called to collect comments for inclusion in the  report, more than 50 people showed up in protest. The project's more vocal  opponents have vowed they will continue the fight to kill the plan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'We Will Resist'  </P> <P> "There are too many damn people here already," Maurice Cofer, president of the  Gartel Fuente Homeowners Assn., said last week. The association, which includes  homeowners in the area bounded by La Puente Road, Amar Road and Lemon Avenue,  claims approximately 400 members. "We will resist it any way we can. We are  opposed to the raping of the hills simply for profits."  </P> <P> Cofer said the five Walnut homeowners associations have a plan of action to  ensure that the City Council will reject the developer's latest plan, but would  not disclose details.  </P> <P> What concerns residents and city officials most is that the project calls for  twice as many homes as are allowed under the General Plan.  </P> <P> The area is zoned for .6 units per acre because of deep ravines that make  access to the hilly slopes difficult, said Planning Director George Shindo. The  developer wants to build 1.28 units per acre. Those homes would be concentrated  on 60% of the site. In order for the project to be approved, the City Council  must amend the plan to allow for the increased density.  </P> <P> "It's the same old story of people saying, 'I'm here, I'm looking at these  beautiful hills and I want to keep looking at the beautiful hills,' " said  Shindo.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cutting Up Hills  </P> <P> "They've been cutting up hills all over the city," said Kyen Jenkins, president  of Snowcreek Homeowners Assn. "What is the rush to develop it all now? Walnut  has gone through a major growth in last several years."  </P> <P> But the Lyon Co.'s manager for the project, Bryan Austin, said the zoning rules  were based on misconceptions about the area's topography. The hills could  actually support a higher density of homes if a significant amount of grading  were done. That would cost from $35 to $40 million, Austin said. He pointed out  that the area across the street from the site, west of Lemon Avenue, is zoned  for 2.5 units per acre, and 1.0 unit per acre is allowed on land east of Lemon.  </P> <P> Austin said that instead of fighting the project, the city should welcome more  residents, because the $700,000 homes would provide a wider property-tax base.  And the hotel and shopping center would provide the city with more sales-tax  revenue, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Revenue Producer  </P> <P> "The city has been looking for revenue-generating uses to support current  budget levels," he said. "That's the primary reason the hotel was considered."  </P> <P> Councilman Ray Watson said that more commercial development, especially large  department stores, would be desirable. Watson said he is "keeping an open mind"  about the proposal until the impact report is issued. But, he added: "(I) can't  see where adding more homes is going to be any long-term benefit to the city  because it'll cost us more in services. If it doesn't benefit the city, I'm not  going to vote in favor of it."  </P> <P> He said he was concerned about the environmental impact of developing the hills  so close to a dump site, despite a 2,000-foot-wide "buffer zone" around the BKK  Landfill which cannot be built on.  </P> <P> "There are fault areas and slide areas," he said. "I don't want to see people  spend money for homes and then have a major earthquake wipe out everything they  have."  </P> <P> Austin said the proposal's detractors are only a few loud voices, and that the  Lyon Co. had sent out more than 600 notices in the area, but "only 60 people  were in attendance."  </P> <P> City Manager Linda Holmes disagreed, saying objections to the proposed  development are coming not only from the immediate area but from throughout the  city and from residents in West Covina, which is adjacent to the site on the  north side.  </P> <P> "(Opposition) wasn't just in the area," Holmes said. "It's throughout the city,  the Creekside houses, Hunters Hill, Marlborough all throughout the city they're  complaining."  </P></p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / German finance minister promises era of austerity: Supplementary budget cuts deficit by DM2.6bn MR Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, yesterday sought to reassure the international community that he would bring public spending under control by 1995 with a determined austerity programme. He also resolutely rejected calls for tax increases to reduce the budget deficit, describing them as a 'recipe for recession.' Mr Waigel said the government was doing everything it could to create the economic conditions, which would allow the German Bundesbank to bring down interest rates. 'If we succeed in getting all levels of government to reduce spending, if wage agreements are appropriate, if the rise in wage unit costs can be stopped, then we will be creating political and economic preconditions which open scope for movement on the interest rate front,' he said, stressing the independence of the central bank in deciding monetary policy. He won unanimous backing yesterday from the German cabinet for a medium-term consolidation plan, which would keep the nominal rise in central government spending to 2.5 per cent per year, maintain a moratorium on new spending plans, and cut the budget deficit from a forecast DM42.7bn (Pounds 14.5bn) this year to DM25bn in 1995. This year's budget deficit is already going to be lower than anticipated by DM2.6bn, thanks to a supplementary budget also approved yesterday, providing for increased tax revenues and other income of DM6.5bn, against increased spending of DM3.9bn. Mr Waigel did not spell out concrete measures to cut government spending, apart fromstopping central subsidies of the Federal Labour Office, which pays out unemployment benefits, and finances training and job creation schemes in eastern Germany. However he made it clear that the German government will not subsidise any big prestige projects in the coming years, such as Hanover's plans for an international Expo 2000, and Berlin's hopes to stage the Olympic Games in the same year. He showed the real sensitivity of the German government to international opinion when he promised to bring forward presentation of his 1993 budget to July 1 - two weeks ahead of normal - in order to be able to present it to his colleagues at the Group of Seven (G7) world economic summit in Munich the following week. The lack of adequate austerity in German public spending was sharply criticised at the last G7 meeting in Washington, and by the International Monetary Fund last month. Mr Waigel's medium-term financial plans are based on an assumption of overall 2 per cent growth this year, followed by 3 per cent in 1993, and 3.4 per cent in 1994. With a nominal 2.5 per cent growth in central government spending, and 3 per cent in the rest of the public sector, that means real cuts will have to be found.</p>

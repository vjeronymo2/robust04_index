			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: The benefits of legal insurance WHEN PEOPLE think of buying a property, they look at its price, condition, position, and the mortgage terms. Equally important, but often ignored, can be the neighbours. Even if you complete the purchase after confirming they are environmentally perfect, this situation might not last. They could themselves sell and move, to be replaced by hordes of hyperactive children playing hyperactive games until midnight, or by groups of motorcyclists all seemingly practising for a race. And even if you buy a property in 10 isolated acres, your neighbour could decide to change from arable to pig farming so that your land smells not of vine but swine. Situations such as these, along with rubbish tipping, car parking and boundary disputes, often lead to arguments and, in the worst cases, to violence. A London-based group, the Right to Peace and Quiet, claims some people can even be driven to suicide by such ever-increasing urban noises as barking dogs, loudspeakers and DIY activities. So, how so you deal with these difficult (and sometimes life-threatening) situations? You have two remedies: mediation and litigation. John Crawley is an authority on the former and one of the authors of a new book Neighbour Disputes (Institute of Housing, Pounds 10.95) which deals with the various rules and laws that apply in such cases. He says you should first talk to your neighbour about the problem. If that fails to produce an amicable solution, approach the local mediation service. Mediation UK (0272-241-234), funded by charitable organisations, supplies its various addresses free of charge while Conflict Management Plus (081-802-3525) provides a professional mediation service. Persistent noise-makers may be served a notice by the local authority under the Environmental Protection Act. Failure to comply will lead to court action and the offender could be fined Pounds 2,000. The London borough of Camden has evicted nine tenants for noise over the past year, including one which the judge called 'the worst case of nuisance I have ever heard.' Another 59 cases are in the pipeline. Even if you opt initially for mediation, it is still wise to cover yourself with a legal expenses policy in case you have to take further - and more costly - action. This type of policy is often sold as an add-on to other insurance policies, but family legal benefits insurance, from the Legal Protection Group, (081-661-1491) is sold direct or through intermediaries. It gives you the choice of two levels of indemnity: Pounds 25,000 a claim for an annual premium of Pounds 195, or Pounds 50,000 a claim (up to an annual total of Pounds 250,000) for a premium of Pounds 234. There is an extra Pounds 55 charge for any additional property you might own in the UK. DAS legal expenses insurance offers two types of protection. Consumer and accident cover, from DAS legal expenses insurance, helps to protect your legal rights in domestic and contractual disputes. It is sold as an add-on to household insurance policies through DAS agents. The Homeowners legal protection policy is sold direct (0272-290321) or through intermediaries and covers disputes arising over the renting or occupation of your own home or any other you might own in the UK. It costs Pounds 120 a year for cover up to Pounds 25,000 for each claim, including hotel expenses up to Pounds 50 a day. (In an emergency, such as a burst pipe, you can call DAS for one of its repairers, although you will have to foot the bill.) Hambro's family legal protection (0206-870-570) can be sold as an add-on to almost any type of personal insurance or financial service. It covers one family living at the same address for legal claims relating to this residence, plus a variety of other claims. Maximum cover is Pounds 25,000 for each. One thing to remember. With all legal expenses and protection policies, it is essential to check the exclusion clauses.</p>

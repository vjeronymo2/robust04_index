			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / UK relaxes Ulster security in response to IRA ceasefire Britain yesterday scaled down security patrols in Northern Ireland and at the same time appealed for an 'unequivocal' permanent ceasefire declaration from Sinn Fein. The appeal followed an apparent endorsement of Sinn Fein's good faith by Mr Al Gore, the US vice-president, who said during a stop-over at Shannon airport that Northern Ireland was at the top of the US foreign policy agenda. Mr Gore said Tuesday's joint statement by Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, and Mr John Hume, Social Democratic and Labour party leader, 'speaks for itself'. The statement, issued after a meeting in Dublin, said the three leaders were 'totally and absolutely committed to democratic and peaceful methods of resolving our political problems'. Last night Mr James Molyneux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, said he had been assured by Mr Gore in a telephone conversation yesterday that the US was not acting as an intermediary in the peace process. Mr Hume said Mr Gore had urged him to do everything possible to involve Unionists in the process. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, said the army and the RUC had already responded to the reduced terrorist threat in Northern Ireland. 'Certain things are not in place that were,' he said. In a further indication of British willingness to reduce the security presence, Mr John Major said that 'a whole range of options' would be open once the government was convinced that there would be no return to IRA violence. But he said there could be no progress until Sinn Fein clarified last week's declaration of a 'complete' end to terrorism. 'All that has to be said is for Sinn Fein to say quite clearly, 'yes, under no circumstances will we go back to violence'. That is all I am waiting to hear,' he said. Mr Major refused to be drawn on Mr Reynolds' decision to meet Mr Adams. 'The Taoiseach and I have worked together and I don't doubt his personal commitment,' he said. Sir Patrick told members of the Orange Order in Belfast last night there was no question of the British and Irish governments imposing a solution on the people of the province. Mr Jim Rodgers, a Belfast councillor with contacts in the Loyalist community, said he believed the Dublin meeting was viewed by some terrorists as confirmation that republicans were influencing government policy. Mr Rodgers claimed that the reduction in security announced by Sir Patrick had been agreed at a secret meeting last week. Mr Martin McGuinness, a member of Sinn Fein's ruling executive, said there had been no reduction in security levels. Mr Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionists, accused Mr Major of acting like a dictator, but said the party had no plans to ask its supporters to take to the streets.

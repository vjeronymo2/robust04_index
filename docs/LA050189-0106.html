			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> OGILVY RESPONSE TO TAKEOVER BID BOOSTS STOCK $16  </P> <P> The price of Ogilvy Group Inc. stock soared $16 a share in early trading on  Wall Street today after the U.S. advertising company gave a cool response to a  $725-million takeover offer from Britain's WPP Group PLC.  </P> <P> The combination of the two would create an advertising giant second only to  London-based Saatchi &amp; Saatchi PLC among world advertising companies.  (Story, Part IV, Page 1.)  </P> <P> The strong trading on Wall Street indicated a belief that a higher offer will  emerge for Ogilvy.  </P> <P> Ogilvy, the New York-based parent company of Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide,  said Sunday that the offer by WPP Group PLC was unsolicited and that the  company wanted to remain independent.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, "former Palestinian </F> chief negotiator in the Washington peace talks," by Tessa  Szyszkowitz; place and date not given]    [Text] Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi, 75, is a doctor, the chairman  of the Red Crescent in Gaza, the former head of the Palestinian  delegation in the peace talks in Washington, but, first and  foremost, he is the moral instance of the independent, lay  Palestinians. Despite his criticism of PLO Chairman Yasir  'Arafat and the basic agreement with Israel concluded in  September, 'Abd-al- Shafi advocates the success of autonomy for  reasons of state.    [Szyszkowitz] How paradoxical: The Palestinians are given  an autonomous territory and are not even able to pay the  salaries of their police. Who is responsible for this disorder?    ['Abd-al-Shafi] I cannot defend the behavior of the  Palestinians. 'Arafat has only now nominated the provisional  government! He should have planned much further ahead, which  would have been possible. Another thing is the money, which  cannot be distributed because there are no structures. The  Palestinians themselves are to blame for this chaos. Of course,  the Israelis are not exactly making things easier for us. We  cannot move freely, the autonomous territories are closed off.  And we can, of course, not accept that Israel continues to try  to keep Jerusalem out of the debate.    [Szyszkowitz] From the very beginning you have been against  the agreement. Does this not harm the national cause?    ['Abd-al-Shafi] This autonomy agreement is bad. The  Israelis still control everything. In Gaza they still keep  almost 40 percent of the territory occupied. Yet, despite the  shortcomings of the agreements, things are starting to change.  This is why I am appealing to all Palestinians to cooperate in  implementing the autonomy agreement as long as we do not forget  to point to the problems.    [Szyszkowitz] What deficiencies can you spot in 'Arafat's  leadership style?    ['Abd-al-Shafi] There is still not enough democracy. Our  people are tired of permanently getting orders from above.  'Arafat must strengthen and enhance the democratic structures.  Officials should not be nominated only on the basis of personal  considerations.    [Szyszkowitz] Still, the list of nominated ministers  includes the longest-serving PLO leaders: men such as Faysal  al-Husayni from East Jerusalem or Economics Minister Abu Ala,  who worked out the agreement with Israel in Oslo.    ['Abd-al-Shafi] Oh well, there are many more excellent  people. It is not so much a question of whether these people  come from the inner circle or from the outside, but whether they  are qualified for their job. With all respect for the problems  within the Fatah movement, the building of institutions requires  competence and not personal loyalties.    [Szyszkowitz] The preparations for the first elections of  the autonomy government are dragging on somewhat. Is this  'Arafat's intention?    ['Abd-al-Shafi] First of all, we would need a neutral  commission to prepare these elections. And then the polls have  to be held as soon as possible. Everything we can do has to be  done soon, there is no reason to put things off.    [Szyszkowitz] So what is the reason that all these  preparations have not been made? Is it only because 'Arafat is  not sufficiently organized?    ['Abd-al-Shafi] To put it bluntly: 'Arafat has all the  strings in his hand and does not want to let loose a single one.  At any rate we must insist in close monitoring of the election,  like in South Africa. We need all guarantees because we cannot  afford to fail.    [Szyszkowitz] It looks as if even 'Arafat's severest critics  were slowly getting ready to make a truce. Even parts of the  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] leadership have recently  made relatively liberal statements.    ['Abd-al-Shafi] I welcome this change by Hamas, of course.  Nevertheless, I do not think that it will participate in the  election to the autonomy government, but I would regard it as  good if Hamas were to found a political party. The Islamists  will never win a majority here, anyway.    [Szyszkowitz] Not even if the Palestinians here in Gaza were  to lose faith in the current leadership?    ['Abd-al-Shafi] At the moment, we first have to establish  the structures. Then we will see. However, we all must try  hard to act quickly. After all, the position of the Israelis is  clear: They will go ahead with extending autonomy to the West  Bank only if everything works here. This is why any delays that  are our fault are excellent excuses for the Israelis. That way  they can say: You see, they cannot even establish peace in  Gaza. This is why it is so important for the Palestinians to  concentrate all forces on implementing this agreement. I only  hope that the PLO has understood that, too.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Tamara Ivanova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 14 Feb -- Vyacheslav Kostikov, press  secretary of the Russian president, has promised editors of  central newspapers assistance in holding another meeting with  the Russian Federation president. It is likely to take place in  late February or early March, depending on the president's  working schedule.    This was one of the main upshots of the conversation that  Kostikov had today with editors in chief of leading  publications. In an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent,  the president's press secretary clarified that the meeting was  called for by the growing concern of the media over "the  abnormal situation in the press market".    "Newspapers are going bankrupt, and complex contradictions  have emerged between the striving of newspapers to be  independent and the understanding of the fact that the press  will not survive without assistance from the state", he said.  According to Kostikov, "it is necessary to find a precise  combination of state aid to the press without infringing upon  glasnost".    The head of state's press secretary added that the purpose  of  the meeting is to obtain first-hand, critical information that  should be made known to the Russian Federation president.</p>

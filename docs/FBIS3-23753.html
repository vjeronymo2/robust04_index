			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mikhail Bugayev, under rubric "Press </F> Conference": "New Deputies Being Drawn to the `Center'"]    [Text] On 28 December V. Klevtsov, chairman of the Sakhalin  District Electoral Commission, delivered temporary credentials  to deputies in the new Russian parliament Yevgeniy Krasnoyarov,  Mikhail Romanovskiy, and Boris Tretyak. In addition, Klevtsov  handed over to the deputies the voters' mandates that the  commission had received. The chief mandate is to do everything  possible and impossible to preserve civil peace in the country.  The second is to strengthen legality, and to fight decisively  and in an uncompromising manner against corruption and organized  crime.    After the ceremonies were over, the deputies answered the  journalists' questions.    Yevgeniy Krasnoyarov thanked the public of Sakhalin Oblast  for the work that had been done. "Our task," he said, "is to  represent the population properly in the Federal Assembly. We  must influence the process of reforms and must make them more  reasonable, especially when this pertains to shock therapy.  Currently we are being advised to do more therapy and less  shock. I am opposed to shock therapy in the Far East. The three  of us have already met and we have decided to act as a single  bloc, and in the new parliament we shall try to unite the Far  East deputies into a single front."    Boris Tretyak assured the journalists that he is going to  Moscow to work, and for him Sakhalin will be in first place.    "I am in no hurry to enter any blocs," he said. "For me the  basic consideration will be the Sakhalin voters."    At the same time, after the journalists' direct questions,  the deputies admitted that they do have definite political  priorities. For example, Romanovskiy and Tretyak keep more to  the "center," and they like the Shakhray bloc. But Krasnoyarov  prefers "Russia's Choice," with one stipulation -- excluding  from its program the shock therapy for the Far East.    Speaking about the future election to the local parliament,  the oblast's administration head said, "Within a few days I  shall sign the statute governing elections. We will have to  create a new organ, consisting of two houses. The lower house --  the oblast Duma -- will include 19 persons. Eighteen of them  will be elected by districts from an equal number of residents.  One deputy will represent the indigenous nationalities of  Sakhalin, and he will be elected for a single district -- the  oblast district. The upper house -- the Oblast Council -- will  consist of one representative from each rayon."    The journalists were also interested in hearing about the  positions taken by the new people on the political scene,  Romanovskiy and Tretyak, concerning a serious question -- the  question of the "northern territories."    Replying to this, Boris Tretyak said, "This is a complicated  question, and we must study it. But if we are talking about  whether or not to give back the Kuriles, I take a very cautious  attitude toward the concept of `giving back.' Especially when  this pertains to Russian land. That which currently exists in  Russia belongs to Russia, and to Russians. But, to put it  honestly, I am not sufficiently knowledgeable about the history  of this question."    Mikhail Romanovskiy agreed with his colleague that this is a  very complicated problem: "I was asked that question frequently  when I met with the public. Once I gave this answer: Gorbachev  said that there is no problem, since we won that war. Yeltsin  said that we should wait 10-15 years and let a younger  population deal with it. But I think that today we should not  make this question any larger than it actually is. The country  is in a complicated economic and political situation. There are  many national conflicts, and if we give back part of the  territory this will cause a row. There will be a confrontation  of forces --leftists, rightists, and others. Therefore we  currently should give back absolutely nothing -- either in  Kaliningrad, in Karelia, or on the border with China. We ought  to wait three or four years and then return to the problem,  because the problem does exist and should be resolved.    "Currently we should invest money in the Kuriles. Otherwise  the population there will go to Japan, if we do not change the  attitude to those islands and do not develop them."</p>

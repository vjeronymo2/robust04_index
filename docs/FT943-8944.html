			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Ethnic Greeks go on trial in Albania today The trial of five members of Albania's ethnic Greek minority on charges of treason, espionage and illegal possession of weapons, opens today in Tirane following several weeks of angry diplomatic exchanges between the two neighbouring governments. Greece is threatening to veto Ecu23m (Pounds 18m) in European Union financial assistance to Albania because of the Albanian decision to go ahead with the trial. The EU has already tried to assuage Greek concern over the minority's position by linking release of the aid to Albania's record on protecting human rights. However, the stand-off with Albania, together with Greece's six-month trade blockade of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, underline the continuing reluctance of Greek policymakers to try to reduce tension in the Balkans. The five defendants, all prominent members of Omonia, an ethnic Greek political organisation, were arrested in April, shortly after an attack on a military post close to the Greek border left two Albanian soldiers dead. The incident caused a sharp deterioration in Greek-Albanian relations, already uneasy because of complaints of discrimination against ethnic Greeks, who claimed they were refused titles to land being privatised or were unable to bid for small businesses being sold off by the state. Greece rejected an Albanian accusation that the raid was carried out by Greek commandos on orders from the government. However, speculation persists in Athens that it was organised by a group of dissident Greek soldiers, opposed to the Socialist administration's efforts to improve ties with Tirane, in co-operation with hardline ethnic Greeks in Albania. The indictment claims the five ethnic Greeks were conspiring with nationalist organisations in Greece to establish autonomy for Northern Ipiros, the region adjoining the Greek border where the minority lives, and eventually unite it with Greece. The Greek government is also threatening to expel many of the estimated 150,000 Albanian immigrants working illegally in Greece and to block remittances in drachmas to Albania. However, there are fears that a wave of expulsions could bring retaliation against the ethnic Greeks in southern Albania. The dispute has already slowed down Greek investment in Albania, which has been promoted in the past by the Greek government as the most effective way of improving bilateral relations.</p>

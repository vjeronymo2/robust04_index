The party has been describing al-Hariri's government in its  statement as "murderer and killer." Although the official  Lebanese stand is opposed to the agreement, similar to the  Syrians', Hizballah was the only organization that chose to take  the trouble to go out into the streets in order to proclaim its  opposition. This has prompted President Ilyas al-Hirawi and  Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri to wonder about whom this party  is demonstrating against in Beirut streets since the government  is already adopting the same stand the party itself is  advocating.    The timing of the demonstration was significant. The party  called for the demonstration following the return of Shaykh  Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah from one of his frequent visits to  Tehran during which he met with Iranian President Rafsanjani and  the leader of the Islamic revolution Ali Khamene'i. The party  sources said that discussions during this visit dealt with  coordinating stands with regard to the new situation the area is  entering under the title peace with Israel on all fronts. This  has led to many questions being raised regarding the role the  party should be playing in Lebanon at this stage, and how far  this role clashes with the Lebanese government which closely  coordinates its stands with Syria's.    Although Shaykh Fadlallah is called by party members  "al-Sayyid" [master or lord], he does not have any official or  organizational title. He introduces himself as a worker in the  Islamic movement. Yet the great influence he wields in the broad  intellectual field and the political and media contacts in  Lebanon makes him the actual leader of the party whose secretary  general is Shaykh Hasan Nasrallah. In his speeches and  statements Shaykh Fadlallah rejects the coming peace and  believes that if the Lebanese Government were to sign a peace  agreement, its signature would be that of a government not  recognized by its people. Therefore, whether the government  signs an agreement or not is immaterial, because the people  reject all that.    Shaykh Fadlallah has close ties with Iran that date back to  school days in al-Najaf where he established close ties with  Khomeyni when he was in exile there. He also established  contacts with Iranian leaders of various inclinations. In  al-Najaf Fadlallah was taught by leading Shi'ah scholars  including Ayatollah Montazeri, Muhsin al-Hakim, and Abu-al-Qasim  al-Khu'i. When he returned to Lebanon in 1966, when the Shi'ah  tide was not what it is today, he began his social activities in  an easter Beirut suburb (Hay al-Nab'ah). After the inhabitants  of the area were evacuated from there, he moved to the southern  suburb where he is still there.    Fadlallah was the target of an assassination attempt carried  out by the CIA near his house in Harit Hurayk quarter, following  the destruction of the Marines headquarters in Beirut. Hizballah  was then accused of being the perpetrator. Fadlallah is 57 years  old, was born in 'Aynata town in southern Lebanon. He is married  with 11 children.</p>

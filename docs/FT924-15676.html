			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Raising jute from the ashes of the sackcloth industry - Efforts to revive demand in the face of fierce competition from synthetic materials DUNDEE IN Scotland earned the sobriquet Jute City in the 19th century for its pre-eminence in processing the material. However, it is to Manchester in England that the International Jute Organisation has turned in a bid to revitalise the industry. The British Textile Technology Group, a research-based company, has just completed the first part of a Dollars 200,000 programme to find new markets for jute, which has most commonly been woven into sacking. Jute has been steadily losing its traditional markets to synthetic materials such as polypropylene for years. Since 1965 total world imports of jute have fallen from 1.4m tonnes to less than 950,000 tonnes. But the crop, which needs lots of water, remains important to the five countries which produce it - India, Nepal, China, Thailand and particularly Bangladesh, which accounts for 55 per cent of world exports. The Bangladeshis rely on jute for 10 per cent of jobs and the crop accounts for 7 per cent of GDP. In addition the stems account for 70 per cent of the fuel used by peasant families. The conventional textile route for processing jute uses carding and spinning to reach a spun yarn. But this is a crude process for jute, which has fibres up to two metres long and produces a yarn of great inconsistency in thickness and strength. BTTG decided to look instead at non-woven fibres. The classic example is felt, made from cross-layered wool which is then consolidated into fabric. The non-woven fabrics market is large and growing at a time when the textile market in general has been in recession. Mr Alfred King, executive director of BTTG, points out that the processing for non-wovens is a very cheap way of transforming fibre into fabric. Developments in processing have brought new markets into being, such as disposable nappies and medical goods. BTTG has been able to create several jute-based non-woven fabrics of different strengths by chopping the jute fibre into 5-centimetre lengths and combining it with at least 15 per cent and up to 30 per cent of man-made fibres. One method involves passing the layered raw material through heated rollers; the man-made fibre melts and reforms as it cools, binding the fabric together. Another, cheaper method is stitch-bonding, where lines of stitching are run both across and along a layered mat of fibre. Tests have shown that the resulting materials are unsuitable for disposable nappies and medical goods as it is both uncomfortable and expensive to bleach. But Mr King believes there are many other markets for the jute-based products, which can easily be coated and impregnated. Among others, BTTG has identified the markets for filtration systems, fabric stiffeners (eg in luggage), agriculture and horticulture, and automotive trimming, where jute based products are ideal for deadening sound. Mr King's team is looking again at traditional markets for jute, such as upholstery, floor covering, and secondary carpet backing. BTTG is also proposing jute material for civil engineering projects, for example as temporary strengthening for earth embankments. 'You don't have to recover it  -it's absorbed by the soil,' says Mr King. BTTG now has funding from the UN Common Fund for Commodities and the Japanese government to continue its research to the end of September next year. 'We are now refining the processing and looking to have the materials tried out as products,' says Mr King. He is hoping that the technologies involved will be passed on to the jute producing countries. 'Ultimately we hope they will produce these materials themselves rather than exporting just the fibre.'</p>

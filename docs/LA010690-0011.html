			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL PROBLEMS OF HOMELESS FAMILIES AND MENTALLY ILL  </P> <P> "The Homeless Are Getting Younger" was an appropriate editorial for Christmas  Day. Although you stated that 36% of the homeless are families with young  children it is important to understand what these numbers mean.  </P> <P> Children cannot learn if they are hungry. Children cannot feel secure or good  about themselves if they have no home. Children cannot play if they have no  sleep. And, worst of all, children cannot laugh when they have nothing.  </P> <P> According to the state Department of Social Services' most recent statistics,  between 156,000 and 200,00 children were homeless during 1989. We estimate the  number of homeless children in Los Angeles to be at least 50,000 based on the  DSS statistics.  </P> <P> The homeless assistance program, which is jointly funded by California and the  federal government, provides for three to four weeks of temporary shelter in  addition to last month's rent and security deposit. Although this successful  program has assisted 80,000 families in 1989, this is only a slice of the  homeless family population.  </P> <P> Many families are not AFDC eligible or do not qualify for these funds. If one  parent is working more than 100 hours a month, or if the family is undocumented  they do not qualify for this program. There is still fear among homeless  families that their children could be taken from them. Therefore, many families  are afraid to admit being homeless and will not apply for assistance.  </P> <P> Your editorial also mentioned that 1,800 people were being turned away from our  shelters each night. Although we are increasing the number of shelter beds  yearly in Los Angeles, our shelters are not the answer to homelessness. People  need housing that is safe, decent and affordable.  </P> <P> We must urge Congress to restore the $25 billion of federal housing funds that  were lost over the last eight years. It has been estimated that California  needs over 800,000 affordable housing units. State Senate President Pro Tem  David Roberti has recognized the shortage of affordable housing as a major  cause of homelessness and has developed the Housing and Homeless Bond Act for  the June ballot.  </P> <P> Congress requires each state to prepare a plan to educate all homeless  children. The purpose of the plan is to ensure access to school for homeless  children and youth and to promote quality education and equal access to special  programs and services. The state Department of Education is "encouraging"  school districts to adopt the plan. However, to date, little has been done.  </P> <P> It is true that homelessness is getting younger, especially in California. We  must recognize the disastrous effect of homelessness on our children and  support affordable housing programs, education programs and other essential  programs that work with homeless and at-risk populations. Are we going to allow  another decade of children to experience homelessness, hunger and a lack of  appropriate education? Let's make sure that we give laughter and joy back to  our children in the 1990s.  </P> <P> TONI REINIS  </P> <P> Co-director  </P> <P> California Homeless Coalition  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ROMANIA LEADERS ARE CEAUSESCU COLLABORATORS, EX-KING ALLEGES  </P> <P> Former King Michael of Romania said today that the country's new leaders are  Communists who collaborated with the executed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.  </P> <P> "The people who are at the head of the provisional government are true  Communists who collaborated with Ceausescu," he said in an interview in the  French-language daily 24 Heures.  </P> <P> "Everybody there knows it," he said. "The Romanians did not fight to be ruled  once again by the same people. They do not want to continue with the same  order."  </P> <P> The National Salvation Front named a government Tuesday headed by President Ion  Iliescu, a former Communist Party Central Committee secretary who was demoted  after criticizing the Ceausescu regime.  </P> <P> Deputy Foreign Minister Corneliu Bogdan said Wednesday that while some of the  new leaders had been party members, they had all been elected by consensus of  the Front. Vice President Dumitru Mazilu, who also suffered under Ceausescu,  pledged Romania would never return to communism.  </P> <P> The Communists forced King Michael, now 68, to abdicate in 1947.  </P> <P> He said he would have preferred a normal trial of Ceausescu and his wife --  executed Christmas Day after a swift, secret trial -- but he said it was  understandable especially in view of the immense hatred the people had for  Ceausescu.  </P> <P> "I do not like revenge, but this execution was understandable," he said.  </P></p>

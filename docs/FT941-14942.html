			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Business and the Law: Guarantees can be restricted - European Court Companies selling luxury goods under guarantee in the European Union are entitled to restrict guarantees to those goods sold through a European Commission-approved selective distribution network, the European Court of Justice ruled last week. The case concerned the sale of Cartier watches sold via selective distribution networks organised around distributors selected according to qualitative criteria. The distribution agreements made between Cartier and the distributors were found by the Commission not to fall foul of Rome treaty competition rules. A dispute arose between Cartier and Metro, a German cash and carry chain. Metro was not an approved Cartier distributor, but nonetheless had sold Cartier watches bought from third country markets such as Switzerland for several years. Under Swiss law, approved dealers in selective distribution networks cannot refuse to supply non-approved dealers. Cartier watches are sold with a manufacturer's guarantee. However, the guarantee will only be honoured if there is proof on the guarantee certificate that the watch was bought from an approved distributor. Metro claimed such a restriction was contrary to EU competition rules and brought an action before the Dusseldorf courts, seeking a declaration that Cartier was lawfully bound to honour guarantees for watches sold within the Metro network. After a long series of hearings, involving two appeals to the Court of Appeal, the lower court referred the issue to the European Court. Under German law, the main issue was the effectiveness of the distribution agreement. The Appeal Court had ruled that the restrictions under the selective distribution agreement relating to guarantees would only be valid if the agreement was totally effective, in other words was capable of being completely respected. The question that was therefore asked of the European Court was whether the validity of a selective distribution agreement in terms of EU competition law was put into doubt by the fact that the agreement in question was not wholly effective in countries outside the Union, thereby leading to a situation where supposedly protected goods were freely available to non-authorised dealers for eventual sale within the EU. The European Court found that the principle which had evolved under German law, but was practically unknown elsewhere in the EU, did not necessarily imply that contractual validity was dependent on the total effectiveness of the obligations in question. It pointed out that if the validity of selective distribution systems were submitted to this principle, then the paradoxical result would be that the most rigid agreements would be treated more favourably than the more flexible agreements which allowed for parallel trading. Given that, and the fact that in some member states the application of such a principle is prohibited, the Court said that a selective distribution agreement, such as the one in question, was not put in doubt because it was not totally effective in countries outside the EU. The Court also examined the question of the validity under EU competition law of restrictions placed on the grant of guarantees for watches sold by agreed distri-butors. The Court first found that a contractual obligation limiting the grant of guarantees to approved distributors and thus withholding such guarantees from non-authorised distributors had the same effect as the contractual restrictions limiting the sale of the products to the approved distributors. Given that the contractual obligation undertaken by the manufacturer only to sell the relevant products to approved distributors was legally valid, as well as the obligation undertaken by the approved distributors only to sell the products to consumers or other approved distributors, the Court found that there was no reason to submit the restrictions placed on the grant of guarantees to a more onerous and strict legal regime.

			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / International Capital Markets: More Russian licences given to foreign banks TWO more western banks yesterday received licences to set up subsidiaries in Russia as the Russian central bank attempted to head off a plan by parliament to ban foreign banks from dealing with Russian customers. Western bankers said that the central bank had confirmed general banking licences for Credit Suisse and the Netherlands' ING Bank. This extends to six the number of banks that have received permission to start operations in Russia. On Friday, parliament is due to decide whether to confirm a resolution confining foreign banks to dealing with foreign clients from 1994 to 1996. Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, is thought to be trying to present parliament with a fait accompli by giving licences to as many foreign banks as possible before parliament takes a decision reversing the terms of the licences. Banque Indosuez is to close its Japanese share broking operations in Tokyo, Reuter reports from Tokyo. This follows an earlier decision to shut its Indosuez Capital Securities operation in London.</p>

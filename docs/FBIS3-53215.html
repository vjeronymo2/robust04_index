The daily KAYHAN INTERNATIONAL said Central Asian Republics  were aspiring to follow the heroism of the Afghans against the  "Russian bear" and through cooperation make the region into a  strong bastion of resurgent Islam.    Unfortunately, it said, "the leaders in Afghanistan have  turned out to be lesser beings with inflated ego, ready to  infringe upon the rights of others and cut each other's throats  at the behest of outside forces.    "To make outsiders happy they are even indifferent to the  plight of the innocent peace-loving populace whose hopes and  aspirations after the end of communist rule, were soon dashed by  the much acclaimed victors of the unequal war," the article  stressed.    However, commented the article, it is not too late to find a  remedy to the blood-curdling bickerings for power, adding that  the first thing the Afghan groups should realize is that  national reconciliation and not un-Islamic rivalries for  domination of the country is the need of the hour.    "Time and again Iran has shown its brotherly intentions of  healing rift, and in the spirit of true Islamic brotherhood  likes to see a strong and stable Afghanistan as its neighbor,"  the daily noted.    The paper concluded by saying it is now up to the warring  factions to continue their "self-destructive dance" and feel  accountable before God for the wanton devastation of a nation,  or to regain their senses and strive in earnest in the interests  of peace and prosperity.</p>

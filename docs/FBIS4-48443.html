			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The UNHCR has accused the Rwandan Patriotic  Front [RPF] of killing Rwandan civilians. This is according to  a UNHCR member based in Tanzania, who received his information  from refugees arriving in Tanzania. The so-called investigator  claims to have received the information, but did not furnish any  proof. [passage omitted]    The UNHCR has not shown any credibility concerning these  allegations, because they have not taken into account reports by  those who have visited territory controlled by the Rwandan  Patriotic Army, such as Mr. (Anderson) of the BBC, who declared  that he had visited the area and witnessed that the RPF was not  committing atrocities. If the UNHCR has seen civilians being  massacred, why does it not send representatives to see what is  happening in areas occupied by government forces? Why should  the UNHCR condemn the RPF on the basis of false rumors without,  up to now, condemning the Gitarama government? It is well known  that the RPF allows anyone interested in visiting the territory  under its control to do so freely. That is why international  journalists continue to visit these areas. They have witnessed  for themselves the brutality with which the puppet government of  Rwanda committed genocide.    The UNHCR, which acquired its information from the most  partisan of sources -- fleeing criminals [words indistinct], is  now accusing the RPF. This will just encourage the criminal  Gitarama government. The same UNHCR has not even condemned the  government. This is the first time that members of the  organization have accused the RPF. It should be recalled that  last month they spread lies, according to which the RPF had  closed the Rusumo border, so as to stop people from fleeing to  Tanzania.    Fortunately, [words indistinct] and humanitarian  organizations have done everything possible to show that this is  not correct. One can ask why the UNHCR does not go to see what  is happening in the area controlled by the government army, what  is happening in Gikongoro, Cyangugu, and Kibuye, for example.  It is well known that the genocide already has been completed  in those three prefectures, according to the words of Mr.  Theodore Sindikubwabo who, during his visit the day before  yesterday to Kibuye and Cyangugu, thanked the killers for  cleaning up Kibuye Prefecture. This refers to the extermination  of all Tutsis and all non-extremist Hutus.    It is regrettable that the UNHCR does not seem to give any  importance to the horror, and just keeps on wrongly accusing the  RPF of committing crimes, basing its opinion on the incoherent  allegations of those killers who fled after decimating innocent  people.</p>

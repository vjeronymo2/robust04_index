			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Talks on Ulster's future move closer to collapse TALKS ON Northern Ireland's political future moved closer to collapse yesterday with little agreement between the participants - and with apparent last-minute difficulties over procedural arrangements. A scheduled plenary session of all the participants failed to take place. Instead Sir Ninian Stephen, the independent chairman, met heads of delegations and said that no plenary would take place until Tuesday. Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, the unionist leaders, have said that they will walk out of the talks after Tuesday, in effect marking the end of the process. They object to the calling of an Anglo-Irish Conference meeting the following week. Sir Ninian is believed to be trying to draw up a 'heads-of-agreement' document to salvage something from the talks process which started in April. But the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party insists that such a publication must have a meaningful content. Another possible cause for the delay is that the unionists could have argued that the calling of a general election in the Irish Republic undermines the mandate of Irish ministers attending the talks. Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, will make a statement to the Commons when the talks end. He has spoken of an 'intermission' before talks can be restarted, but it is unclear how quickly unionists will agree. They want the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement ended and agreed to talk only because its workings, including the Anglo-Irish Conferences, have been suspended. The Irish government is seeking an agreement which would in effect 'bridge' the Anglo-Irish Conference meeting on November 16, and allow time for the Irish election to take place and a new government to settle into office. Only a brief outline of possible new institutions for Northern Ireland has been agreed. Unionists and nationalists are far apart on the powers that new institutions should have.</p>

			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEGION STATE BASEBALL TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> BROMBERG MOVES WEST WITHIN VICTORY OF TITLE  </P> <P> Corey Bromberg nearly worked himself into a lather the night before the most  important start of his young career, for Woodland Hills West in the third round  of the American Legion state baseball tournament on Monday.  </P> <P> He tossed. He turned. He buried his head in the pillow.  </P> <P> He then repeated the sequence, thought not necessarily by choice. It seems that  a few high-spirited teammates tossed and turned him some more late Sunday  night.  </P> <P> Bromberg, in his first year with West, was being officially welcomed to the  club while sleeping. His teammates held him down and jokingly threatened to  shave him from head to toe if he didn't win Monday.  </P> <P> The next morning, Bromberg and West more than pinned down Stockton, 11-1, in a  game that was called in the bottom of the seventh inning because of the 10-run  rule. West, 34-6 overall and 3-0 in the double-elimination tournament, has  automatically qualified for a berth in the regionals on Aug. 15-20 in either  Union City, Calif., or Eugene, Ore.  </P> <P> West plays Escondido (15-3) for the state championship today at 10 a.m. If West  loses, a second game will be played in the afternoon. A win by West in either  game would mean a state title, something that eluded the team last season en  route to its World Series title.  </P> <P> Bromberg (7-1) struck out four, walked none and recorded 18 of the first 19  outs via fly ball (16) or strikeout (three) Monday. His defense -- particularly  left fielder Chris Castillo and center fielder Jeff Marks -- repeatedly bailed  Bromberg out by pulling down an assortment of loopers and liners in the gaps  and at the fence.  </P> <P> Staked to a 6-0 lead after three innings -- by which time West had banged out  11 of its 16 hits -- Bromberg reared back and fired. And he came within a  whisker of the tournament's only shutout.  </P> <P> Leading, 10-0, in the top of the seventh, he needed three outs for the game to  be halted because of the 10-run rule. But Stockton (25-4) strung together a  single, double and a run-scoring ground out -- its only two-hit inning of the  game -- to crawl within 10-1.  </P> <P> West put the game away in the bottom of the inning on Bobby Kim's run-scoring  hit off the fence in left field.  </P></p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / IMF chief urges German rate cut: Camdessus calls for more global co-ordination of economic policy GERMAN interest rates need to be reduced by about two percentage points as part of a strategy to reduce 'intolerable' levels of unemployment in Europe, Mr Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said yesterday. And in a rare intervention in US politics, he urged the incoming Clinton administration to seize a 'great opportunity' to reduce the structural budget deficit by raising taxes as well as cutting spending. Mr Camdessus said more effective global co-ordination of policies was needed to address a 'crisis of confidence'. The IMF, like the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, has cut its world growth forecasts and expects a 1 per cent growth in European Community economies next year. At the National Press Club in Washington, he said abating demand and wage pressures in Germany had made a 'progressive lowering of interest rates' possible. 'But let me be blunt . . . what is needed is not a half-percentage point reduction of the key interest rate of the Bundesbank - welcome as that may be - but a more substantial cut in real interest rates, say of two percentage points.' He said the responsibility for achieving a big cut in rates lay more with European governments, that had allowed large public-sector deficits to develop, than with the Bundesbank and the other central banks. He said Germany and Italy should take stronger steps to cut deficits. A lasting reduction in European unemployment from its 'intolerable level of 10 per cent', would also require structural reforms to increase the flexibility of labour markets. The US had to address the 'Achilles heel' of its economy which was the 'continuing and alarming weakness of its saving and investment performance'. The US had the lowest ratio of net national saving to gross domestic product in the industrialised world. This had led to one of the lowest levels of private investment and a lack of attention to public infrastructure. Bold medium-term consolidation of the budget was the only reliable way of boosting sustainable growth. With the cyclical recovery from recession gaining momentum, the US had a great opportunity 'to set fiscal policy unambiguously on the course of deficit reduction'. The scale of the needed fiscal adjustment required 'the adoption of both revenue and expenditure measures'. Tax reform was also needed to increase incentives to save and invest and to reduce consumption. Mr Camdessus praised Japan for taking monetary and fiscal action to revive its economy. But he noted renewed signs of weakness and warned that further policy actions might be needed. Revised IMF forecasts to be released later this month will show growth of barely 2 per cent in industrial countries next year against a forecast of 2.9 per cent at the annual meeting in September.

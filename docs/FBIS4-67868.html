			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- Japan will back down  from its plan to promote plutonium use for nuclear recycling,  International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai said  Tuesday [19 April].    Kumagai was referring to reported calls by the Advisory  Committee for Energy, his advisory organ, for reviewing Japan's  policy in favor of plutonium use as a way to meet energy demand  in the future.    The committee is now formulating a report on Japan's new  energy policy by accounting for recent rapid changes in the  energy field.    Speaking before a regular press conference, Kumagai said the  committee is moving toward a consensus against active use of  plutonium.    ``Discussion so far by the committee seems to be  convincing,'' Kumagai said.    Japan has come under global criticism for its plutonium  policy as leading to nuclear proliferation. Doubt has also been  cast at home over the feasibility of commercial use of  plutonium.

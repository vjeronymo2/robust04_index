The victims, a driver and a woman passenger, were at the  head  of the convoy when an unknown number of rebels suddenly appeared  out of the night and opened fire, police added.    Saturday's attack, about 30 kilometers (20 miles) from  Agadez  in the centre of the dry, landlocked central African country, is  the second since a ceasefire between the government and nomadic  Tuaregs ended last December.    Seven people, four rebels, two paramilitary police and a  villager, were killed on January 19 when rebels attacked the  market at Tahoua, 400 kilometers (250 miles) northeast of Niamey.</p>

He told the GHANA NEWS AGENCY at Goaso on Tuesday that a  total of 228 cases had been recorded in the district at the end  of last October, as against 75 cases recorded last year.    Dr. Nuertey expressed concern about the increase in the  incidence of the disease and called on chiefs and assembly  members to assist the district health management team to educate  the people on how to prevent and control the disease.    Dr. Nuertey advised people who use water from streams to  boil  it before drinking.    He further advised them to observe environmental hygiene.    Dr. Nuertey said the district health management team would  re-introduce the screening of foodsellers as part of measures to  check the spread of the disease.</p>

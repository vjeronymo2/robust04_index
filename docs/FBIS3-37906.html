He stressed that the organisers are not political, but  common  criminals. "There are no political crimes or political prisoners  in Russia", Shumeyko said.    The revolt organisers face criminal charges and it is only  the court which can make the final verdict, according to  Shumeyko who said that his upper chamber does not plan to  discuss the amnesty.</p>

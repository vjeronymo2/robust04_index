			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / What will be running during day of chaos: As commuters across Britain face widespread disruption, FT writers assess the strategies of the unions A FRIDAY rail strike will be a good excuse for workers in many parts of the UK to extend the weekend or arrange to work at home. For those who must get into work or who enjoy overcoming commuting adversities, here is a guide to what's on and where. Rail: British Rail is advising passengers not to try to go anywhere by train today. The odd train may be running - listen to local radio - but there is no guarantee that if you reach work by train you will be able to get back home again, said BR. Non-BR services, for example the Tyne and Wear metro, the Greater Manchester metrolink supertram, the Glasgow Underground and the Docklands light railway should be operating normally. London Tube: There were rumours yesterday of unofficial action by Tube workers but London Underground said it planned to operate a near-complete service. Assurances had been received by the RMT rail union that none of its Tube members would be striking but there could be a 'few extremists', said management. The only parts of the Tube likely to be shut today are those that have tracks and signals run by BR. Probably hit will be the Bakerloo line north of Queen's Park, Turnham Green to Richmond on the District line, and Putney Bridge to Wimbledon, also on the District line. London buses: A day of industrial action today, the third in a series, will mean about two-thirds of red buses in the capital are likely to be off the road. Buses operated by private contractors should run normally. London parking: Commuters will be able to use an emergency car park at Greenland Pier, Surrey Docks, and then use the Riverbus. There will also be extra parking at Masthouse Terrace, off West Ferry Road in Docklands, which is near Island Gardens station on the Docklands light railway. London parking inquiries: 071 276 0800. Coaches: National Express, which runs services throughout the UK, is guaranteeing to take anyone who buys a ticket early in the day. It usually has about 600 coaches on the road and will probably increase this to about 1,000. National Express: 021 626 6226. Roads: Main problem areas are likely to be heading into Glasgow and the Forth and Tay road bridges, the main routes into Bristol and Exeter and all routes into London. Extra ferries will be running across the Mersey. Automobile Association hotline: 0336 401 700. Air: British Airways said shuttle services would be increased. Passengers needing to get to London Stansted airport will be able to catch a half-hourly coach service from Walthamstow Central station on the Victoria line. Extra coaches from Victoria will serve Gatwick airport. Beware taxi touts.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WHERE THE AA FEARS THE WORST TRAFFIC BLACKSPOTS WILL BE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Apart from main roads into all major cities the AA picked these sections of the UK trunk system as most likely to experience the worst delays.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SOUTH EAST  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- M25 Surrey section M3 London bound Heavy congestion at M25-M4 interchange A40 Perivale A205/A3 junction Putney A23 Pease Pottage  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SOUTH WEST  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- M4 Severn Road Bridge M32 M5 at Exeter  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MIDLANDS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- M6, A38M at Birmingham A38, A34, A41 and A45 M1 contraflow on north side of M6 interchange  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NORTH  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- A696 Gateshead-Newcastle A69 Newcastle M621/A58(M) at Leeds M62/M63/M56 at Manchester  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SCOTLAND  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- A90 Forth Bridge Tay Road Bridge - lane closures  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

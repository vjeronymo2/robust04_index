			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> R. L. KELLEY, 93; FIRST PUBLISHED BLUE BOOK ON USED-CAR VALUES  </P> <P> R. Leslie (Les) Kelley, a minister's son who as a car dealer in 1926 began  publishing a Blue Book that has since become the bible of the used-car business  in terms of establishing automobile market value, died Wednesday at his home in  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The one-time owner of the Kelley Kar Co. and Les Kelley Ford -- once the  largest Ford dealership in the world -- was 93 and had been ill for some time,  a company spokesman said.  </P> <P> Born in Arkansas, the son of a Methodist minister, Kelley moved to Los Angeles  as a youth and attended USC before opening his first used-car dealership in  1918. That was the forerunner of his car company and eventually his Ford  dealership, which at one time had 625 employees.  </P> <P> Kelley closed the dealership in 1962 and retired. At that time, his Kelley Blue  Book was in use by 95% of the automotive trade, banks, financial institutions  and courts of law in the West in establishing the value of cars.  </P> <P> The company in recent years has expanded and now publishes subscriptions to  valuations of both new and used cars and motorcycles as well as recreation  vehicles. Kelley Blue Book remains a family enterprise and today is operated by  Les Kelley's brother, S. H. Kelley, a nephew, Robert Kelley, and a grandnephew,  Michael Kelley.  </P> <P> Les Kelley was a philanthropist and funded a family health center and clinic at  Santa Monica Hospital and contributed to the restoration of the Hollywood sign,  which he could see from his home. A golf tournament at the Bel-Air Country Club  where he was a longtime member has been named for him.  </P> <P> With him when he died was his wife, IngLis. His other survivors include an  additional brother, two daughters, a granddaughter and a great-granddaughter.  </P> <P> A funeral service will be held Monday at 12:30 at Wee Kirk o'-the Heather  Chapel, Forest Lawn Memorial-Park, Glendale.  </P></p>

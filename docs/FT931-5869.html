			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / North attracts advice shops A DISPROPORTIONATE number of the government's new one-stop business advice centres may be located in the Midlands and north of England if the spread of partnerships applying to run them is reflected in contract awards. These areas are well represented among the 57 applications received by the Department of Trade and Industry. The response in the south and the south-west has been weaker. Most of the partnerships are led by Training and Enterprise Councils, the employer-led bodies which deliver government training schemes in England and Wales. Interviews to select 15 pilot outlets, announced last December by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, will begin shortly. Mr Heseltine hopes the shops, which will eventually number 200, will revolutionise support for British companies. The outlets will bring together the business services of chambers of commerce, local authorities, local enterprise agencies and the DTI. Mr Heseltine has allocated Pounds 3.5m for the 'one stop shops' from the Tecs' budgets and the government hopes the services, many of which are now free, will be charged for. Mr Heseltine was asked in the Commons last year whether the pilots would be spread to represent regions of high business failures. He replied that the basis for choosing the successful bids would be 'one of quality'. 'It is critical that the 15 are seen as pace setters, even if that results in districts that might have the most immediate need having to wait for a period,' Mr Heseltine added.</p>

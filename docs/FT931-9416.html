			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Food &amp; Drink (The Flavours of Switzerland): The great autumn mushroom hunt - Nicholas Woodsworth enjoys eating game and finding one of the prizes of the forest, the steinpilz, in the Bernese Oberland, where old customs die hard BAD WEATHER, as every alpine mountaineer knows, can come out of the blue with astonishing speed. I am not a mountaineer, and when on a crisp autumn morning I looked out of the window and saw the Eiger, Monch and Jungfrau rearing brilliant white against a clear sky I set off without so much as an umbrella or a moment's thought. Set in some of the most dramatic mountain scenery in Europe, the Bernese Oberland is a renowned tourist destination - restaurants and hotels here have been providing polished Swiss hospitality to foreign visitors for more than 150 years. But Oberlanders are not just members of a cosmopolitan service industry  - like mountain people everywhere, they remain strongly attached to old customs and to the land. Leave the sophisticated resort towns behind, get just a few yards off the beaten track, and you can find yourself led into a world of mountain traditions as old as man's instinct for hunting and gathering. I was, and I blame it on mushrooms. I had set off for the narrow, steeply sloping valley of the Lauterbrunnen, a spectacular place of cliffs and dark pine forests, high, thin waterfalls and jagged peaks, for a closer look at the looming 11,000 foot Jungfrau. But when I discovered a few buttons of exotic-looking wild mushrooms sitting in the fine spray at the foot of a waterfall, and then, a minute or two later, more mushrooms poking their delicate caps and gills out of the damp soil at the forest's edge, I forgot about the Jungfrau. I am not a mushroom expert, but always find the hunt for these strange fungi enticing. For the next few hours I wandered along paths with my eyes set not on the great wonders above, but searching for smaller wonders below. There were many sorts; brown, grey, white and yellow ones, some smooth and round, other crinkly and angular. Some I thought I knew, others I had never seen before. All went into my day pack. I was not planning to saute and wolf down the lot, but like berry picking or clam digging, mushroom hunting fast becomes compulsive. By the time I heard the angry growling of mountain thunder above and looked up to see the peaks obscured in black cloud it was too late; not even the fastest dash down the valley could save me. In a few minutes I was soaked through, and the delicate mushrooms, liberally doused and jogged up and down on my back, had become a soggy mess. In the end, though, I was not disappointed. When I returned to the village of Wilderswil and told Fritz Zurschmeide, my host at the Hotel Baren, of my misadventure, he laughed and said I should not worry. I was not the only one whose head was turned by nature's offerings - every autumn half of Switzerland disappears into the hills to return with all manner of wild plant and beast. Nor do these hunter-gatherers hoard their gains to themselves: like restaurants throughout the country, the Baren each year offers the best of this wild fare, to locals and visitors, on their Jagdwild, or hunting menu. It was not long before I was dried, changed and installed in the Baren's simple white-pine-panelled dining room. At hand to ward off the effects of my afternoon soaking was a glass of Appenzeller schnapps, aromatic with the alpine herbs and roots that give it its dark brown colour. It is much favoured by both mountain hunters and those who sit down to enjoy the results of the hunter's efforts. Also at hand was a steaming bowl of fine game consomme made of a stock of chamois, the horned alpine antelope, and delicately flavoured with one of the most prized of forest mushrooms, the steinpilz. I was just as lucky, Fritz told me as I savoured it, that I had lost my cargo of mushrooms; they had not been checked by the local pilzkontrolle, or mushroom examiner. The Swiss, I found out, are just as meticulous and careful about mushrooms as about everything else in life. In each village in Switzerland, said Fritz, there is a qualified specialist whose duty it is to certify the safety of the mushrooms picked in the surrounding area. With an activity as popular and competitive as mushroom gathering - there are individual quotas and spot checks by foresters to give everyone a chance  -enthusiastic pickers can sometimes make mistakes. Was I likely to turn green and keel over in agony after my consomme? Hardly  -to qualify for their post, village mushroom examiners must themselves be examined, and be able to identify 70 different fungi varieties in less than 20 minutes. One mistake and chances for the job vanish like toadstools in the morning sun. It is not only the pilzkontrolle that is busy in the Alps in the autumn. All Wilderswil, it seems, abandons regular work. Most villagers are part-time farmers, and fill in the rest of the year as ski instructors and lift attendants, alpine guides or employees on the miniature mountain railway that runs nearby. But for a few days in September and October older, deeper instincts take over - villagers drop whatever pacific task they are at and take to their guns. How, I asked Franz as, one after another, a series of exotic game dishes appeared and disappeared from the table, can such a rich fare be offered year after year? There was game terrine served with pear sauce and tart, fresh cranberries taken from mountain bogs 4,000 feet up. There was home-made ravioli filled with minced stag meat followed by jugged chamois marinated in red wine. Only then did the piece de resistance, a tender escalope of venison, arrive. It was accompanied by two sweet side-dishes that perfectly contrasted the meat's slight gaminess - fragrant, freshly picked roast chestnuts and a ripe apple stuffed with forest mushrooms and baked. If large numbers of Swiss went in for this sort of thing every October, I wanted to know, how could there be anything left moving up in the hills? The answer is simple. Some of the game meat is imported from nearby Austria, where it is plentiful. But more important, Fritz explained, the Swiss manage their own game stocks as carefully and as wisely as their numbered bank accounts. In many other countries it is easy enough to get hold of a license and blast away at anything on four legs, or even two, as sometimes happens. In Switzerland it takes a year of hard study, followed by tough written and practical exams, to get a license. In the Wilderswil area an annual permit costs around Pounds 650 and much more for anyone out of town. Individual hunting quotas are decided by committee with the maintainance of ideal herd numbers as a priority. This year, for example, Wilderswil has decided to limit chamois kills to three per hunter - not just any chamois, but one male and two female. There are also practical measures that even up the odds between the hunter and the hunted. Anyone wanting a chance at shooting an animal, said Fritz, is obliged to take his turn at feeding the herds through the lean winter months. In high altitude hunting the enthusiast is allowed to drive only to a certain height; thereafter he must search for and track the animals on foot - no mean task in the craggy and dangerous Alps. And in some parts of Switzerland a hunter must be over the age of 60 before he is allowed telescopic sights on his rifle. I finished my meal with a Swiss-Italian specialty, Coupe Nesselrode - icecream and meringue topped with pureed chestnuts passed through a press so they come out looking like spaghetti. The fresh air, the long day's mountain walk, the schnapps and the stupendous dinner had conspired against me; I am not yet over 60, but by this point I could have been given a rifle with sights, led up to a tethered chamois, and still have missed it. I was done in. The only slope I was prepared to negotiate was the stairs up to bed. Besides, I had an early-morning project for the next day. If bad weather stayed away from the Jungfrau, if I could find the same trail once again, I would take my pack and go off on my own hunt. I planned to give the pilzkontrolle more work than he had had in a long time.</p>

Petushkov, Central </F> Aerological Observatory; UDC 551.510.534(215-17)]    [Abstract] The reasons for the appearance of ozone  miniholes over the northern hemisphere in January 1986 and 1987  are discussed. This phenomenon is usually observed in the period  October-March, its appearance has an irregular character and may  vary from year to year. These miniholes occur in the northern  hemisphere middle and high latitudes when there is no global  ozone hole in the Arctic. An attempt is made to establish  correlations between changes in wave activity in the lower  stratosphere and ozone distribution anomalies in the northern  hemisphere high latitudes. The many processes involved in the  development of these miniholes are analyzed. A comparison of the  computed three-dimensional Eliassen-Palma flows and variations  in the total ozone content indicated that the appearance and  evolution of ozone miniholes over the North Atlantic, Europe and  Siberia are related to changes in wave activity and the  direction of vortical transport of ozone by planetary waves.  Weakening of wave activity and anomalous transport from the low  latitudes may be reasons for the appearance of ozone miniholes.  The filling of ozone miniholes is associated with an increase in  wave activity. The analysis of these ozone anomalies in the  northern hemisphere middle and high latitudes indicates that  natural, not anthropogenic factors are responsible for the  formation and evolution of ozone miniholes.

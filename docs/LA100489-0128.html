			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: FROGS WIN IN RIBETTING PERFORMANCE  </P> <P> Last Saturday my wife and I drove up to La Canada High School to watch a game  between the Ribet Frogs and the Antelope Valley Christian Eagles.  </P> <P> Our granddaughter is a Frog. When her family moved out of the Marshall High  School district she had to change schools, and she elected to go to Ribet, a  small private prep school in La Canada Flintridge. Having been a member of  Marshall's classy cheerleading team, she immediately joined Ribet's six-girl  team.  </P> <P> Our daughter-in-law Jacqueline had called us and asked us to go to the game.  "Mr. Smith," she said in her beguiling way, "it's such a little school. They  really need support."  </P> <P> She said she had not chosen the school because the name was French. It was just  a coincidence. I wondered how my wife would feel about cheering a team called  the Frogs. Being of French descent, she had once slapped a schoolmate in  elementary school for calling her a frog.  </P> <P> We picked up our son in Linda Vista to take him to the game. Jacqueline and our  granddaughter had gone on ahead. Our son said the game was to be played on a  field in Oak Grove Park, a heavily wooded park below the Jet Propulsion Lab.  "It's supposed to be north of La Canada High School," he said.  </P> <P> We drove past the high school and turned into Oak Grove. We wandered over dirt  roads that meandered through the oak trees, looking into this clearing and  that. No football field.  </P> <P> "I don't see any goal posts," I kept saying. Finally we asked a forest ranger.  He gave my son some arm directions. They led to another dead end. Then we  noticed that we had picked up a tail. Four cars were following us. They were  looking for the field too.  </P> <P> Finally we went back to the entrance to start over (the other cars still  following). A small sign nailed to a tree said the game was across the street  on a field north of the school. We missed the kickoff.  </P> <P> The field was only 80 yards long. There were no goal posts. The Frogs wore  green jerseys, the Eagles white. There was a small grandstand across the field  for the visitors. It held about 50 people. Ours held about 100. Our  granddaughter's pep team was off to one side, running through their drills.  They wore white sweat shirts and short white skirts. They chanted:  </P> <P>  Frogs in the front,  </P> <P>  Let me hear you grunt;  </P> <P>  Frogs in the back,  </P> <P>  Show us where it's at -- right here!  </P> <P> The Eagles had a big back who seemed to be pummeling the Frogs. There were only  eight players to a team, and six or seven reserves on each bench. I was afraid  the Eagles were going to demolish the Frogs.  </P> <P> Suddenly a Frog broke through and ran 30 yards for a touchdown. It was called  back for clipping. Later, on defense, a Frog back intercepted a pass and ran it  back 35 yards for a touchdown. There being no goal posts, they had to go for  two points. The Eagles held: 6-0 Frogs.  </P> <P> The girls ran through another drill:  </P> <P>  GO! Let me hear you say GO!  </P> <P>  That's right, UNITE!  </P> <P>  Let me hear you say FIGHT!  </P> <P>  WIN! Let me hear you say WIN!  </P> <P>  Together, again!  </P> <P>  Let me hear you say GO! FIGHT! WIN!  </P> <P>  The Frogs had two very fast backs. Twice they broke away for long touchdowns.  I couldn't tell whether they were inspired by the girls or not. Across the  field four little girls in checkered miniskirts were cheering the Eagles.  </P> <P> There were no food stands. At halftime my wife and our daughter-in-law and I  drove up Foothill Boulevard to a McDonald's and bought four hamburgers and four  Cokes. We missed the kickoff again.  </P> <P> The Frogs were too good for them. Late in the fourth quarter it was 34-0. Then  the Eagles scored, and just as the Trojans were to do that same day up at  Washington State, they passed for the two points and made it.  </P> <P> Final score: Frogs, 34, Eagles 8.  </P> <P> Going back on Linda Vista we ran into the UCLA-UC crowd heading for the Rose  Bowl.  </P> <P> I didn't see anything about our game in the Sunday paper.  </P></p>

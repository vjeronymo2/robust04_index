			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara--The General Staff headquarters on Sunday ]1  May] denied press reports that military leaders are trying to  promote the idea of setting up a government under former Central  bank chief Rusdu Saracoglu and moves to extend the term of  office of Chief of Staff General Dogan Gures who faces  compulsory retirement in August.    On Sunday, mass circulation daily SABAH published a claim by  Culture Minister Fikri Saglar, also the secretary general of the  ruling Social Democrat People's Party (SHP), saying that General  Gures and some other leading members of the Turkish Armed Forces  were making contacts to set up a government of technical experts  led by Saracoglu as an alternative to the current government of  Tansu Ciller.    Saglar said Gures has to reply to such claims and give a  straight answer as to whether he is making such contacts. Both  SABAH and daily GUNAYDIN also reported on Sunday that Prime  Minister Tansu Ciller has had secret meetings with State  Ministers Necmettin Cevheri and Bekir Sami Dace to seek ways of  extending Gures' term of office.    Both the papers said Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin,  the chairman of the SHP, did not object to such an extension.  SABAH said only Demirel is against such a move, because legal  experts say such an extension is legally impossible.    GUNAYDIN, which has military links, said Ciller asked her  ministers to work on the extension maneuvers in strict secrecy  and that parliamentary approval should not be necessary.    The paper said Ciller told the two ministers that she had  agreed with Gures on a democratization package and added she did  not want the general to become a target of criticism if such an  extension is carried out.    The general staff announcement said the public knows well  that the military is not the authority to set up governments.  The announcement said the newspaper reports are based on  political assumptions "which have nothing to do with the duties  of the military."    It called the press reports absurd and said the public  should  not give any credence to such allegations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Tad Stoner] </F>   [Text] TVB has been accused of self-censorship because of  a decision not to show the anti-Beijing documentary Laogai:  Inside the Chinese Gulag. Nine days before it was to broadcast  the programme, the station replaced it in the schedules with a  BBC Horizon documentary on tuberculosis. The station denies the  documentary was pulled for political reasons.    Last night the chairman of the influential human rights  organisation Justice, Nihal Jayawickrama, said he may refer TVB  to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.    Laogai sketches a portrait of China's nationwide network of  so-called "reform through labour" camps -- detention centres  where dissidents and delinquents are held, frequently without  trial. The 50-minute documentary was scheduled for TVB's  English-language Pearl channel on December 4, last year. At  about the same time, TVB also decided not to screen the  controversial one-hour BBC documentary Mao Zedong: The Last  Emperor. The station has not screened the highly critical  examination of the late Chinese Communist Party chairman saying  the public was not interested. It broadcast its own production,  Mao Fever, in December.    A range of community leaders, including legislators, urban  councillors and media commentators, have accused TVB of  self-censorship, a charge the station denies, although it has no  plans to screen the BBC programme and Beijing has been vocal in  its opposition to it.    A station spokeswoman Lily Chan, yesterday denied that  self-censorship had motivated the cancellation of Laogai:  Inside the Chinese Gulag. "It was purely a programming  arrangement," she said. Cecilia Tan, the TVB controller of  programming, said. "It's difficult to explain programming  decisions. If you think of the number of programmes we run per  day, during one year, it's more fair to comment on what has been  scheduled. I would not care to comment on what has not  appeared," she said. Veronica Chiu, the publicity manager for  the Pearl channel, said the December 4 schedule was only  tentative, and the cancellation had been "routine and normal".  "There were no other political reasons," she said.    Jayawickrama, the chairman of Justice, called the refusal to  show the programme "tragic". Justice is the Hong Kong chapter  of the Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists which  holds an advisory seat at the UN. "The problem with  self-censorship is that it's a manipulation of information," he  said. "It's far more dangerous than government censorship  because nobody knows about it, and here is an institution whose  sole rationale for existence is the dissemination of  information. This is one of the matters that the (UN's) Human  Rights Commission would be quite interested in. We've referred  TVB to the commission in the past and we would do it again."    Another Justice member Hing-lee Wong, said TVB had done a  disservice to Hong Kong. "I think it's ridiculous. We should  be attacking the Government's licensing policy, and I plan to do  something about this myself," Wong said. TVB is facing a  mid-term review of its licence, although broadcast policymakers  at the Recreation and Culture Branch have refused to become  embroiled in self-censorship and scheduling disputes.    A Chinese dissident, Lau Shan-ching, who spent 10 years in a  Guangzhou jail and has organised a series of private Hong Kong  showings of Mao Zedong: The Last Emperor, said he was appalled  by the cancellation. "TVB seems to have changed its policy with  the intention not to make the Chinese angry because (the station  has) expanding interests in China." A Liberal Party legislator,  Christine Loh, said self-censorship was a serious denigration of  Hong Kong's civil liberties.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter, who supports the implementation of ``Change 6.04A Enhanced'', requests that the FAA issue a supplementary notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to propose installing this revised software by June 30, 1995. This commenter states that significant differences exist between ``Change 6.04A'' and ``Change 6.04A Enhanced''. The FAA does not concur. Comments received in response to the proposed AD reflect unanimous support for implementing ``Change 6.04A Enhanced''. The FAA considers the logic change (which reduces non-crossing RA's) to be minor. The intent is to correct the unsafe condition by installing modified TCAS II computer units that incorporate updated logic. The FAA has determined that the requirement to implement Version 6.04A software, including the latest enhancement, will (1) correct the unsafe condition; (2) maintain the same intent originally proposed without altering the substance of the proposed rule; and (3) impose no additional burden on the public than was previously proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, issuing a supplemental NPRM would necessitate (under the provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act) reissuing the notice, reopening the public comment period, considering any additional comments received, and eventually issuing a final rule. The time required for these procedures could take as long as four additional months. In light of this, and in consideration of the amount of time that has already elapsed since issuance of the original NPRM, the FAA concludes that soliciting further public comment is not necessary and that further delay of the final rule action is not appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters request that the FAA revise the economic impact specified in the proposed AD to reflect costs associated with the development, testing prior to certification, and certification of the modified processor. These costs would be absorbed by suppliers, installers, and airline operators. The FAA does not concur that the economic impact statement include this information. The 5 workhours necessary to accomplish the proposed action was provided to the FAA by the TCAS II processor manufacturer based on the best data available to date. This number represents the time required to install the revised software and test for proper operation after installation. The cost analysis in AD rulemaking actions typically does not include costs associated with development, testing prior to certification, and certification of a modified processor. The proposed action remains unchanged as a result of these comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of all available information including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for the change in compliance time, the logic reference change, the option of reprogramming certain units on board the aircraft, reference to Collins SB No. 16, TTR&hyph;920&hyph;34&hyph;16, dated December 9, 1993, and minor editorial corrections. The FAA has determined that these changes and corrections will not change the meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden upon the public than was already proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 1,995 TCAS II processors in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 5 workhours per processor (1 workhour for installation and 4 workhours for operational testing) to accomplish the required action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $548,625. These figures are based on the assumption that none of the operators of the airplanes equipped with the affected TCAS II processors have accomplished the actions specified in this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader and kwaZulu Chief  Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi has defended his government's  purchase of a luxury jet. A Sunday newspaper yesterday revealed  that kwaZulu had paid 33 million rands for the Hawker 800 jet.    [Begin Buthelezi recording] A plane like this, according to  the Department of Finance, is therefore cost-effective in the  sense that it is an asset which could be sold by the government  at a profit at any time. So I mean all the song that is made  about it, the hullabaloo about it, is amusing because it seems  to me that they want to seek anything that can be used  negatively against the kwaZulu government in particular.

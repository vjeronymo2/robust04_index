			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (7): Phones start to ring again - David Boggis finds business aviation executives more optimistic OPTIMISM is returning to the UK's business aviation industry after a period that left companies 'punch drunk' and 'shell-shocked', according to Mr Danny Forman, chief executive of the General Aviation Manufacturers and Traders Association. Gamta, which works from offices near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, represents business aviation in the form of companies ranging from equipment suppliers to executive-jet dealers. It promotes the growth of general aviation which, it explains, makes up more than 90 per cent of all UK-registered civil aircraft. With the dark days of recession finally over, Mr Forman says, 'the phones are ringing' with inquiries - not just about aircraft acquisition but about flying training. Flying training is important because many of the industrial company executives responsible for placing orders for aircraft or charter services are pilots first and buyers later. Upbeat confidence also comes over from Mr Anthony Hutton, director of the Flight International Business and Light Aviation Exhibition, a trade-oriented showcase for general aviation due to be open at North Weald airfield, Essex, on September 8-11. Mr Hutton, who notes that his show has no flying display or other crowd entertainment, reports 'an extremely optimistic' view of the future among companies. That has emerged since last September's Farnborough air show after a deterioration in confidence over the preceding year. Not all the indications are so buoyant. In some companies, the corporate aircraft fleet has become a casualty of the recession. United Biscuits has sold its King Air twin-turboprop. BP, the oil multinational, has got rid of a much costlier fleet, all jets: an intercontinental Gulfstream IV and two medium-range British Aerospace 125-800s (otherwise known as the Corporate 800). United Biscuits explained: 'In the present climate, we could not justify the aircraft.' The company's executives are still travelling, but mostly now on airlines. If business is pressing, or if several people need to travel, the company will charter an aircraft. BP's decision follows a recent management change. The company said: 'We decided it was not cost-effective to use the jets this way.' Now BP's use of charters has increased, mainly to countries of the former Soviet Union. Ms Janice Hahn, of the Business Air Centre, a London charter broker, agrees that business from industrial companies has increased. Having received little such business during two years of recession, BAC now finds old clients returning with urgent requests. 'Bookings are up by about 30 per cent,' Ms Hahn says. The proportion of business that BAC receives from industry is going up. 'They are going out there to look for business.' Business for the centre looks unlikely to come from Glaxo. The company operates four jets and, after a review of costs, is getting rid of only one, a Gulfstream IV. The other three are staying, Glaxo says, because 'it makes efficient use of executive time'. The aircraft that remain are a BAe 125-800, operated within the US; a Dassault Falcon 900 used by the board; and another G-IV, which runs a shuttle between Heathrow and the company's facility in North Carolina. There is no direct airline flight on that route. Glaxo comments: 'Our senior people are encouraged to visit the markets.' Sir Anthony Bamford, chairman of JCB, makers of earth-moving equipment, says of the company's BAe 125-800: 'It's my office in the air.' The company places importance on the amount of work that can be carried out actually during a flight. Sir Anthony adds: 'We have looked at giving up (the jet) as one of the ways of cutting overheads, but I think it is a valuable sales tool - particularly during a recession when you have got to go out and get customers.' JCB, which exports more than 70 per cent of its production, also operates an Agusta A109 helicopter from its base at Rocester, Staffordshire. One recent operation involved ferrying 20 clients from Rocester to a site at Milton Keynes. It took four flights but, in all, the company says, the helicopter proved 'more cost-effective than rail'. Whatever the pros and cons of owning your own aircraft against chartering time on someone else's, one dealer believes it can give a company the best of both worlds. Air Hanson, of Blackbushe, Surrey, which distributes Beechcraft's range - including the King Air, market leader in the twin-turboprop cabin class - is offering aircraft on lease as well as for sale. Mr Mike Lacey, Air Hanson's aircraft sales manager, says: 'Aircraft are being targeted by accountants as unnecessary expenses.' In the light of that, leasing becomes attractive, as the aircraft remains off the balance sheet. Air Hanson's drive for more customers, in either form, reflects worries about the health of the UK economy in relation to economies in Europe. 'A great number of businessmen don't take the continent seriously,' Mr Lacey says. He adds: 'My concern is that there has been a net exodus of aircraft from the UK, and the French and German aviation community is growing.' The dealer's campaign for lease customers emphasises the Beech Starship, a strikingly unusual design with a canard foreplane, fins at the wingtips, and turboprops driving pusher propellors. The Starship's impact on the European market has so far been limited. Its competitors include Cessna's Citation range of twinjets. Cessna, which is based, like Beech, in Wichita, Kansas, has a representative office in Surrey that handles marketing for the UK, the Iberian peninsula and the Middle East. Mr Barrie Sampson, regional sales manager for the Citation, says that, with the 2,000th of the type recently rolled out, the aircraft has overtaken the Learjet range to become market leader in the light jet category. Citation clients may deal through a finance company that will own the jet and lease it to the end-user, but Cessna wants sales, not leasing deals. Mr Sampson is optimistic that his office will sell six or so of the 120 Citations that Cessna hopes to move this year. Over the past quarter, he says, 'there has been a significant pick-up in the level of interest in the market.' His positive tone is echoed by Bob Crowe Aircraft Sales at Cranfield, Bedfordshire. Mr Bob Crowe says the mood among buyers has altered in recent months compared with the previous couple of years. 'We have never been so busy, talking to qualified buyers,' he says. 'Sales this past six months have been extremely strong. There has been much interest from UK buyers in the past two months.' Otherwise, many sales have been to buyers abroad. The company handles a big proportion of used aircraft, as well as dealing in new aircraft sales of the turboprop Cessna Caravan I and II. Up to 25 aircraft a year pass through the company's hands, giving a turnover in a typical year of Dollars 7m. The 'punch-drunk' days for the UK business aircraft market seem to be over. The industry is off the ropes and beginning to fight back.</p>

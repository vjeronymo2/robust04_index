			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT KIND OF SOCIETY KEEPS ITS CHILDREN IN POVERTY?  </P> <P> We are seeing an extraordinary celebration of freedom in Europe. With  breathtaking swiftness, we are witnessing the emergence of a new world. As my  heart thrills to this burst of new life, I am called to assess the state of  freedom -- and the state of children -- in my own country.  </P> <P> I guarantee you, no East German family in pursuit of liberty would wisely go to  Main and Fifth streets in Los Angeles. Nothing inhibits expression, action,  movement and personal freedom more than oppressive and grinding poverty.  Nothing so impoverishes a person as a deficient education.  </P> <P> Most shocking of all is the way the burden of this poverty makes captives of  our children. In California, the richest state in the nation, the poor go to  bed hungry, if they are lucky enough to have a bed. After the staggering  amounts we spend to defend ourselves externally, there isn't enough left over  to feed the ones we're defending internally -- to help give them decent  shelter, decent schools, decent care when they're sick and old.  </P> <P> A serious measure of a society is how it treats its children. By that standard  America is in deep trouble. The United States may be the first society in  history where children are worse off than adults. Children are now 40% of the  nation's poor -- 25% of everyone under the age of 18 lives in poverty. Have we  created a society that doesn't love children?  </P> <P> W. C. Fields once remarked cynically, "Anyone who hates children and dogs can't  be all bad." That used to be funny because it wasn't true. But today we have  created a society where children are abused and neglected, and where the  "throw-away child" has become a walking social catastrophe in our time.  </P> <P> In June, 1989, California received a grade of D for its services to the state's  7.6 million children, in a report prepared by Children Now, a nonpartisan group  of distinguished Californians.  </P> <P> The picture is grim. One out of five children in California lives in poverty.  Half the state's 2-year-olds have not been fully immunized against  communicative diseases.  </P> <P> Education is a well-documented disaster, with one-third of all students  dropping out of high school before graduation -- and for blacks the figure  reaches 48%, for Latinos, 45%. These bleak figures will worsen when the impact  of Gov. George Deukmejian's $25-million cut in family-planning services hits  the families of our state.  </P> <P> What we've allowed to happen to our children is scandalous. It grieves the  heart of God. A society in which children are the poorest citizens loses every  claim to greatness. As citizens of this rich state, we can change that if we  choose.  </P> <P> The Greeks had a saying: "There will be no justice in Athens until the  uninjured parties are as indignant as the injured parties." In 1990 my deepest  hope is that we commit ourselves to be advocates for those who have no voice,  to create a society worthy of our children.  </P></p>

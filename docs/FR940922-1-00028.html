			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's proposed action is authorized by several Clean Air Act provisions. As discussed in the NPRM, EPA has authority to approve the OTC's LEV recommendation under section 184(c). EPA also has independent authority to require that states submit LEV SIP revisions under sections 110(a)(2)(D) and 110(k)(5). EPA disagrees with the comments of the automakers that argue that EPA lacks authority to approve the OTC LEV recommendation because the section 184 process is unconstitutional and because an EPA SIP call requiring state regulation of emissions from new motor vehicles violates sections 177, 202, and 209 of the Clean Air Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. EPA's Authority To Act Under Section 184 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 184 provides a clear statutory basis for EPA's action here. EPA described that provision in detail in the background section above, and in its April 26 proposal. See 59 FR at 21722&hyph;24. In summary, the OTC is a body created by operation of law under sections 176A and 184 of the Act, and is comprised of the Governor (or Governor's designee) and an air pollution control official appointed by the Governor for each state in the OTR, as well as the EPA Administrator (or her designee) and the affected EPA Regional Administrators (or the Administrator's designees). Decisions of the OTC are by majority vote of all members other than the EPA representatives. Under section 184(c), the OTC may, after notice-and-comment, develop recommendations for additional control measures to be applied within the OTR as necessary to bring any area in the region into attainment by the dates provided in subpart 2 of part D. The OTC is then to transmit such recommendations to EPA to require such measures throughout the OTR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 184 grants EPA authority to approve the recommendations and issue SIP calls requiring that the affected states adopt the recommended measures if EPA determines that the measures are ``necessary to bring any area in [the OTR] into attainment by the dates provided by this subpart and are otherwise consistent with the Act.'' Upon approval, section 184(c)(5) authorizes the Administrator to issue a finding under section 110(k)(5) that the SIP for any state to which a requirement of the approved recommendation applies is inadequate to meet the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(D) of the Act. The effect of the finding is to require that any such state revise its SIP to include the approved recommended measures within one year after the finding is issued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. State Obligations and EPA's Authority To Act Under Section 110 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA also is proposing to interpret section 110 of the Act to provide that the Agency has independent authority for today's proposed action under that section, apart from any authority provided by section 184. Under section 110(a)(2)(D), each state is obligated to submit SIP provisions prohibiting sources in the state from contributing significantly to nonattainment or interfering with maintenance in any other state. If EPA finds that a SIP is substantially inadequate to adequately mitigate interstate pollution transport, section 110(k)(5) authorizes EPA to issue a SIP call to correct the inadequacy. Under EPA's proposed interpretation, sections 110(a) and (k) allow EPA to find at any time that a SIP is inadequate due to pollution transport. Thus, EPA is proposing to find that, because of the transport of pollution, OTC LEV (or LEV-equivalent) is necessary for areas in the OTR to achieve or maintain the ozone NAAQS, and therefore, that EPA has authority under sections 110(a)(2)(D) and (k)(5) to make a finding of substantial inadequacy and to issue a SIP call requiring adoption of OTC LEV. Rather than make a general finding of SIP substantial inadequacy, EPA is proposing to find the SIPs substantially inadequate only to the extent they do not contain the OTC LEV program. EPA is therefore proposing to require these states to adopt the OTC LEV program to correct the deficiency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments broadened each state's long-standing obligation to address in its SIP the contribution of emissions in its state to air pollution in other states. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  The changes expand the provision beyond stationary sources that prevent downwind attainment or maintenance to other sources and emissions activities that contribute significantly <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  to downwind nonattainment or interfere with downwind maintenance. The expanded provision encompasses, among other things, mobile source controls in light of the impact of mobile sources on downwind attainment and maintenance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Prior to 1990, section 110(a)(2)(E) required that the SIPs:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contain adequate provisions *&blank;*&blank;* prohibiting any stationary source within the State from emitting any air pollutant in amounts which will *&blank;*&blank;* prevent attainment or maintenance by any other state of any such national primary or secondary ambient air quality standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the 1990 Amendments, this provision was re-codified at section 110(a)(2)(D) and broadened to require that a SIP submitted under the Act shall:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contain adequate provisions *&blank;*&blank;* prohibiting, consistent with the provisions of this title, any source or other type of emissions activity within the state from emitting any air pollutant in amounts which will *&blank;*&blank;* contribute significantly to nonattainment in, or interfere with maintenance by, any other state with respect to any such [NAAQS].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> To some extent the reference to contribution merely codified an EPA approach taken under the old section 110(a)(2)(E) and that at least one court decision had upheld. See Air Pollution Control District of Jefferson County, Kentucky v. EPA, 739 F.2d 1071 (6th Cir. 1984).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The mechanism for EPA to take action to require compliance with section 110(a)(2)(D) is the SIP call authority provided in section 110(k)(5). That provision directs:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Annie Thomas] </F>   [Excerpts] Kigali, June 13 (AFP)--Rwandan rebel leader Paul  Kagame said Monday [13 June] that his fighters had seized  control of the town of Gitarama, where the self-proclaimed  interim government fled and set up its base in April.    The fall of Gitarama, 50 kilometres (30 miles) southwest of  the embattled capital Kigali, could not be confirmed by UN  officials in Kigali or government forces.    The rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) had been battling the  army for two weeks for control of Gitarama. "We control 90  percent of the town, including the centre, and the situation  will be completely clear this afternoon," Kagame told reporters  at Kanombe military camp near Kigali airport. "There was a big  fight yesterday and last night it was taken by our forces,"  Kagame said, adding that the entire town was in rebel hands  except for "one or two hills" where beleaguered government  forces were still holding out.    "We are following government forces as they are moving  towards Ruhengeri (a town north-west of Kigali)," Kagame added.    Some members of the interim government proclaimed after the  April 6 death of president Juvenal Habyarimana fled Gitarama  several days ago, UN spokesman Jean-Guy Plante said.    UN officials were unaware of the whereabouts of Prime  Minister Jean Kambanda.    Fierce artillery and small arms battles meanwhile raged in  Kigali. According to Kagame, the rebels gained ground.    Philippe Gaillard, head of the International Red Cross in  Kigali, said two shells presumably fired by the rebels had  slammed into the Red Cross hospital compound in a  government-held area of Kigali on Sunday. Four or five others  landed just outside. Nobody was hurt, and Gaillard said he had  lodged protests with both sides.    Rebel and army commanders meanwhile resumed UN-brokered  truce  talks Monday at UN headquarters in Kigali's Amahoro hotel.    Brigadier-General Marcel Gatsinzi, representing the army,  told reporters he had no information about Gitarama.    The rebels control a large section of the road south from  Gitarama to the town of Butare and the Burundi border. [passage  omitted]    UN soldiers meanwhile resumed the evacuation of civilians  trapped behind hostile lines in Kigali, but some refused to  leave rebel-held areas for places they considered less safe.    The UN has moved about 2,000 people from rebel-controlled  areas to government-held sectors and vice-versa. But  evacuations were suspended last week after a convoy came under  fire.    The UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) decided to  continue evacuations Monday after both sides agreed to a  four-hour truce to allow the convoys to get through.    A convoy of empty trucks set out Monday morning for the  Sainte- Famille church, where about 8,000 people are sheltering  behind government lines. Another convoy went to the rebel-held  Amahoro stadium. Each was to ferry about 150 people to areas  the UN considers safer. But none of the 5,000 civilians  encamped in squalor at the stadium would go. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 30 (YONHAP) -- Bank of Korea Governor  Kim Myong-ho estimated Saturday the first-quarter growth of the  economy at above 8.5 percent. Kim said in a press conference  before his departure for Manila to attend the annual Asian  Development Bank meeting that the economic growth in the  January-March period was estimated to be more than 8.5 percent,  thanks to increased exports and capital investment in all  sectors except agriculture, though the estimate was not based on  accurate data.    Kim's estimate is compared with the 8.3-percent growth  estimated by the Korea Development Institute, indicating that  the economy will grow 8 percent this year against the Bank of  Korea's earlier projection of 6.3 percent.    It is too early to say that the economy is overheating  because the economy is not yet showing such signs of overheating  as supply shortages and rapid wage hikes. But the economy has  entered an expansion period after a recovery from the recession,  he observed.    Commenting on the current-account deficit of 2.5 billion  U.S.  dollars recorded in the first quarter, he said, "When the  economy is recovering or expanding, imports are usually greater  than exports chiefly because of the rapidly increasing demand  for imported equipment and machinery. So, the deficit is a  temporary phenomenon and I think it will not last long until the  end of the year."    Kim said there would be no revision of the money supply  growth goal of 14-17 percent for this year because the financial  situation is so good that such revision is not needed.</p>

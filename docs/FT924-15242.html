			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Carey calls for more foreign aid THE ARCHBISHOP of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, intervened yesterday in the campaign to protect Britain's overseas aid budget from government expenditure cuts. The archbishop, in a speech in which he defended the church's right to express views on political issues, called on the government to have the 'moral courage and the moral self-respect' to increase aid. 'I do not underestimate the financial difficulties and political pain which the government faces,' he said. 'But if we think the going is rough here, let us remember the calamities unfolding in other parts of the world struggling with the catastrophe of mass starvation, chronic poverty and disease.' Dr Carey's comments came as Mr David Bryer, director of Oxfam, one of Britain's leading overseas aid charities, expressed fears that the Treasury was seeking cuts of up to 15 per cent in the Overseas Development Administration budget. Dr Carey said in London that many people feared they had no 'real stake' in Britain.</p>

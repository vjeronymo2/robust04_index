			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Protesters attack Kohl CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl, on a one-day visit to the depressed chemicals area of east Germany, yesterday tasted the wrath of a small group of demonstrators when he was hit in the face by eggs in Halle, near Leipzig, David Marsh reports from Bonn. Mr Kohl, on his third trip to the east during the past month, told a meeting of chemical industry workers at the Buna plant south of Halle that the sector would have to be reduced to a 'competitive core' to allow chances of survival. Brushing off attempts by security officials to rush him into the building, Mr Kohl went ahead insistently to shake hands with well-wishers who had turned out to see him. Although his reception from local people was on the whole friendly, Mr Kohl was made well aware of the concern about mass unemployment in the region, heavily reliant on largely outdated and heavily polluting chemicals plants. Agreement was reached yesterday on a 7 per cent wage increase for 180,000 west German printing workers.</p>

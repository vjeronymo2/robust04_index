			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> AUSCHWITZ PACT SUPPORTED  </P> <P> Three of the four Roman Catholic cardinals who signed an agreement with Jewish  leaders to move a Carmelite convent away from the Auschwitz death camp in  Poland said the pact must be carried out. In a statement issued in Paris, the  three clerics said that Cardinal Jozef Glemp, the primate of Poland, "could  only have been speaking for himself" -- not for the church -- in suggesting a  renegotiation of the accord. Glemp was quoted on Saturday as saying it would be  "a scandal" to move the convent under the 1987 agreement. The new statement was  issued by Cardinals Godfried Danneels of Brussels, Jean-Marie Lustiger of Paris  and Albert Decourtray of Lyon, France. The fourth cardinal was Franciszek  Macharski of Krakow, Poland.  </P></p>

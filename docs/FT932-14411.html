			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Economics Notebook: West can help make Russia's reforms stick Mr Boris Fyodorov, Russia's finance minister and deputy prime minister, complained recently that ever since the old state-planning system had started to collapse, no single government had been given the freedom to conduct any consistent policy for any period of time. 'Give six months to somebody, give it to the Bolsheviks for all I care,' he said. A big frustration about Russia, the heart of the former Soviet Union, is that it has indeed become ungovernable, not least because it has been so badly governed of late. As a result, the country runs on a mixture of inertia and anarchy, while the parliament and government squabble about who understands the Russian people better. Now, even as he returns from Tokyo with a new package of support for Russian reforms, Mr Fyodorov admits the economy is unlikely to 'stabilise' any time soon because Sunday's referendum will probably be followed by early elections in the autumn. But still he soldiers on, saying that for the time being there is no alternative to President Yeltsin if reforms are to be carried forward. As an illustration of the sort of political manoeuvring which is likely to continue for the foreseeable future, President Yeltsin appointed a conservative as first deputy prime minster, directly above Mr Fyodorov, just as he was negotiating with the G7 in Tokyo. But by placing their bets on President Yeltsin and the programme drawn up by Mr Fyodorov, western leaders hope that the referendum will at least clear some of the cobwebs and give Mr Yeltsin a mandate to move ahead with stalled reforms. If this indeed happens, two fundamental problems will still need tackling. One is the need to develop efficient mechanisms for unfolding western assistance, which would be tied to reforms continuing. The other is to boost the Russian state's ability to implement reforms. Given western traditions of efficiency, rapid progress can be made on the first front now that the west has been frightened into action by fears of President Yeltsin being removed by an inchoate parliament. The Russians are also beginning to understand that they are in a position where they have the leverage better to formulate and make demands of the west. At a recent Moscow dinner party, a group of young Russian politicians asked angrily why 'the west' had not told the government this time last year what it was doing wrong. They cited as an example the fact that Russia tried to start financial stabilisation on its own when 15 central banks of the former Soviet Union could still issue roubles. For its naive faith in western omniscience, the question was more interesting than any embarrassed answer to the effect that there had been no united view in the west about how Russia should best go about launching reforms, although Mr Yegor Gaidar at least had the merit of starting the process. Now the west too is learning from the past and is less afraid to interfere. But the Russian people remain plagued with inefficient government in the broadest sense - from the top of the pyramid in Mr Yeltsin's Kremlin offices to the grass-roots, whether in tax collection or law enforcement. Mr Fyodorov estimated recently that only 60 per cent of tax revenues are collected. Mr Andrei Nechayev, the economics minister sacked as part of the business of trying to improve the government's efficiency, recently shared an insider's view of the problems. He singled out, for instance, the fact that the cabinet's work was duplicated and sometimes superseded by parallel presidential policy-making structures such as the Security Council. But perhaps the biggest threat to both coherent policy-making and the very unity of the country are the numerous exemptions to federal taxes and other political and economic concessions granted to various regions and enterprises to buy political support. Both the president and government have recently vowed to do away with this practice even though their whole power base has so far relied on it in the absence of institutions capable of making reforms binding for all. The system whereby benefits are granted not on the basis of a selective policy but, as Mr Yeltsin himself put it, to 'whoever pays a bribe, has the sharpest elbows or the loudest voice', is mirrored at local level. In spite of justified accusations of inefficiency at his own institution, Mr Jacques Attali, the visionary chairman of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, is right to stress the need to help Russia build an efficient administration. 'We advised them to dismantle the old system but they have nothing to put in its place,' he said during his last visit to Russia. But there is going to be no quick fix in attempts to push forward Russian reforms with western help. Robert Conquest, the historian, provides an ironic picture of what happened to western aid when the Bolsheviks starved peasants in 1921, and the US responded generously to Soviet appeals for help. Whereas a 1926 Soviet encyclopaedia acknowledged that US relief workers fed 10m people at the height of their activity, subsequent editions reported that they had been a front to support western counter-revolution and sabotage. Even though some Russian politicians, in the time-honoured practice of looking for the external enemy, are even today trying to blame the west for Russia's problems, closing off the country again is no longer a real option. But an erosion of the west's ability to influence events remains a distinct possibility unless it can provide the glue to make reforms stick. The west is rightly nervous about being drawn into the Russian mire. However, the advantage of it doing so is that it makes it increasingly difficult for Russia to wriggle out of an embrace it cannot do without.</p>

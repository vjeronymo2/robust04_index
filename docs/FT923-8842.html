			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Private View: An Aussie with a grip on the numbers game - Bill McLennan, 'a cheery Australian ankle-biter', is shaking up the Central Statistical Office 'G'DAY]' said the director of the Central Statistical Office, and held out a big paw. He looked like a rugby wing forward as he bounced around the grand Whitehall office in his shirtsleeves. An Aboriginal bark painting hung above the polished desk. Bill McLennan is the result of one of the most unusual - or imaginative - appointments ever made to the top of the British civil service. There is nothing of the self-deprecating mandarin about his person. He is a cheery Australian ankle-biter with a good international reputation who was recruited to smarten up the service on which the government depends for its steering of the British economy. He reportedly told the Whitehall selection panel that UK statistics were 'crook,' a reference to the fact that some vital numbers - the trade figures and GNP growth, for example - were so late and so approximate as to be near-useless. In private, he uses expressions like 'It's a load of crap.' In public, he is a lot more tactful, but flaunts his Aussie background as boldly as a kookaburra in a cageful of pigeons. Since taking office in March, he has once or twice come nearly to blows with Treasury men who objected to his manner. I asked him if people commented on his Australian behaviour. 'Yes, they do.' Do they say it with approval or disapproval? 'When they're talking to me, with approval. When they leave, I don't know what they say.' He chuckled. Has anyone said to you: 'Look, old boy, couldn't you calm down and be a bit more like us?' 'No. I expect that'll happen eventually.' Did you think about it before you came? 'I realised that things would be different here and I had to be a bit cautious and not be my normal aggressive self, I suppose. So I've tried, for me, to be a bit quiet about it.' Is your language less colourful than it was in Canberra? 'I think the answer's Yes. Until I get cranky.' McLennan is no fool. He helped make the Australian Bureau of Statistics, of which he was deputy head, one of the best in the world by vigorous management, computerisation, and marketing new lines of statistics for public sale. He is the son of a dairy farmer in New South Wales who died when the boy was only 10. The family moved to Wollongong and his brothers went to work in the steel industry. He considered a career in the air force but instead joined the statistics bureau as a 17-year-old cadet and was put through the Australian National University in Canberra, reading pure mathematics. There he met his wife, Christine, also a statistician, who now has a job in the operations research division of the British Treasury. Although wooed by private companies who offered him jobs in corporate planning or information systems, he did not want to leave Canberra or the security of the civil service. 'Also, I had got involved in running people, running organisations, dealing with the management side of things.' McLennan is very keen on management. He solemnly gave me a copy of his own profile, one of those quasi-scientific assessments in which consultants tell managers in suitably ponderous jargon what the managers have already revealed about themselves in the consultant's questionnaire. According to this document, McLennan is an 'assessor-developer' in the Team Management Wheel. He also has a bit of the explorer-promoter in him, likewise the thruster-organiser. All his senior colleagues have been put through the same unhappy process. The new director of the CSO is not afraid to use more old-fashioned methods of inculcating team spirit. He takes his colleagues away for discussion weekends or down to the pub for a drink. Being Australian, he cannot escape the reputation of having hollow legs. Do you like drinking? I asked him. 'I've had a couple of beers. I don't beat my wife, either.' You've got a good head, have you? 'What, for figures?' McLennan likes figures as well as beer. I asked him to describe the appeal of his ascetic profession. 'I think I like the precision of it. I like the idea of producing numbers accurately, that people will use. I like the management side of it, working in an organisation where you try to get all the people to think the same way. 'It's not everybody likes to work in an organisation where the truth is paramount. But you can't be a statistician if you don't believe that, I think.' Is it creative? 'Oh, certainly. You're creating new collections, new ideas all the time.' Are you looking for a truth? Or just for one facet of it? 'What's truth, I wonder? I think you might be right. You're actually looking for the best possible answer to a particular problem. You never get the perfect answer.' Is it clear that people know what question they're trying to answer? 'That's one of the difficult things, which is why we spend so much time testing the questions to see whether people understand them.' What are you really trying to do? 'To change the collective thinking of senior staff, to think more corporately, to think more long term.' How will we, the public, benefit? 'You'll obviously get better statistics. But the name of the game is not even getting better statistics. It's getting the numbers out that people will actually use. There's no point me giving you the best statistics in the world if you never use them. That means providing what they want, when they want it, at the price they want it.' McLennan's enthusiasm for selling statistics has led some people to fear that his appointment exposes a hidden agenda to turn the CSO, the first job of which is to supply the Treasury, into a sort of business. So far, he has proposed nothing more outrageous than to build up an electronic subscriber list, to revamp press releases and sell them directly to the outside. Will you sell for money what at present you're giving away for nothing? 'Oh, I don't know about that. What I'd be inclined to do is put all our major releases in deposit libraries round the country, so anyone can get them free if they want, and charge for personal copies or special tabulations or figures provided electronically. 'The real thing, though, is this: if I'm charging you a pound and it's not what you want, you won't pay a pound for it. So there's immediate feedback. But when you've got it right, you can charge them almost anything.' McLennan's appointment, coming after the CSO's conversion from a government department into an agency, is seen as evidence that ministers will tolerate more openness and independence in its statistical service. The CSO director is certainly construing things that way; he has already ruffled feathers by insisting that statisticians at all the other ministries publish their figures according to a timetable that prevents tactical delays for political convenience. As for openness, what other permanent secretary in Whitehall would sit and talk, on the record for an hour, about his public responsibility and personal habits? But McLennan knows when not to go too far. I asked him what struck him most about the British civil service. 'It's got different ways of working - almost working at a different pace.' Slower or faster? 'Slower, I think. It's more considered, more deliberate. Responsibilities in Australia are more devolved to department heads than here. It's heading that way here.' Would you call the British system antiquated? 'It's different. I don't know if it's antiquated. I wouldn't want to use such a pejorative word.' What word would you use? 'It's certainly more formal in some ways. On the surface a lot of things look the same, but in actual fact they're really not. It's the way people think. 'It's very difficult for me to make any strong statement because I just haven't been here long enough. It's certainly very different. But when I've been in to bat on a couple of issues, the result's been very positive very quickly.' I thanked him for talking to me. 'OK', said the director of the Central Statistical Office. 'No worries.'</p>

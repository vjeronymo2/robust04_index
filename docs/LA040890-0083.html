			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONE LINCOLN THAT'S NO MONUMENT  </P> <P> Lincoln Boulevard is practically a paradigm for what troubles Southern  California.  </P> <P> This is the major thoroughfare that runs through the city of Los Angeles'  Westchester community, the county's Marina del Rey and north into Santa Monica.  The street also borders Culver City.  </P> <P> Lincoln Boulevard is a living, if gridlocked, example of why the notion of  regional government must move out of the realm of civics lectures and into the  real world where Southern Californians are choking from environmental problems  that do not respect municipal boundaries.  </P> <P> Along a four-mile stretch of the Lincoln corridor, various developers and local  governments are currently proposing to add office space equal to nearly half  that in downtown Los Angeles, enough retail space to house four Westside  Pavilion malls and more housing units than in all Hermosa Beach. Just picture  it.  </P> <P> At the heart of the matter, of course, is money, and the potential tax revenue  that one locality can hope to gain by allowing construction of a huge  commercial or residential development. Of course, the traffic, air quality or  sewer demands caused by a particular development spill over into surrounding  communities as well. That's the unhealthy fallout.  </P> <P> No local government is blameless in this kill-or-be-killed game, a game fueled  by the increasingly cutthroat competition for tax dollars. When city and county  governments know they cannot count on sufficient state and federal help to  provide government services, the "I've-got-mine" mentality translates into the  kind of runaway development proposed for the Lincoln corridor.  </P> <P> That is why so many urban planners who are thinking beyond neighborhood  boundaries recommend regional government for the "big picture" items like  transportation, air quality and water. The regional government bill introduced  last month by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and other efforts like it deserve  serious and thoughtful discussion by concerned citizens as well as by  lawmakers. Our lungs, idling cars and water faucets really don't care whether  they're choking in Marina del Rey or Culver City.  </P></p>

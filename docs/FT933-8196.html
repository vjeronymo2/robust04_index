			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Takare improves to Pounds 6.58m - Care in the Community Act has limited impact on occupancy TAKARE, the largest UK nursing home operator, yesterday reported a 16.8 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits, excluding exceptional items, to Pounds 6.58m. The period, to end-June, covered the implementation on April 1 of the Care in the Community Act which shifted the burden of public funding of nursing home patients from central to local government. Mr Keith Bradshaw, chairman, said the effect of the reforms had been to reduce occupancy levels from 98 to 97 per cent. Takare's success during this period led him 'to view our prospects with a greater degree of optimism than ever before'. He said that local authorities had now got the clinical and financial procedures in place to handle admissions. Local authority admissions, depressed partly by a rush of patients into homes before April 1, had totalled 36 in April, 41 in May, 79 in June and 107 in July. The July total had already been achieved in August, he said. Turnover rose 65 per cent to Pounds 34.9m, and operating profits on continuing businesses rose 73 per cent to Pounds 8.27m. A 45 bed home was sold during the period for Pounds 712,000, giving a profit of Pounds 370,000 included as an exceptional item. Another home, the only one remaining in Takare's portfolio which does not conform to its purpose-built standard, is being actively marketed. It has 120 beds and is expected to raise substantially more than the other sale. Takare paid interest of Pounds 1.7m, compared to interest receivable of Pounds 838,000, after capitalising Pounds 985,000 (Pounds 2m). The group opened 480 beds and another 450 are due to be commissioned in the second half, to give a year end total of 5,220. Mr Bradshaw said by the end of 1994 there would be 6,600 beds in operation and another 1,400 under construction. Mr Bradshaw said the construction programme was biased towards the second half and total capital spending for the year would be similar to the Pounds 40.9m spent in the whole of 1992. During the half year, the group spent Pounds 14.1m on fixed assets, reducing cash by Pounds 7.4m. The balance sheet showed net debt of Pounds 45.2m (Pounds 37.8m at the year end) to give gearing of 46 per cent (41 per cent). Next month Takare is freed from a promise not to issue equity for two years. Mr Bradshaw emphasised the company had cash of over Pounds 5m and undrawn bank facilities of Pounds 45m, and could continue its expansion programme until the second quarter of 1995 before needing to raise more money, although if that option was pursued it would push gearing towards 100 per cent. Earnings per share were 6.6p excluding the exceptional profit or 7p including it (5.7p). The interim dividend goes up from 0.6p to 0.7p. COMMENT The nursing home sector of the stock market is now worth Pounds 600m, with Takare the leading force. Its results, like those last week of Westminster Health Care, the number two, are encouraging in that the April 1 reforms seem to have had little serious effect on operations even in the short term. In the longer term, Takare and its like should benefit from the changes, providing the right cost/quality combination to local authority purchasers. As the sector expands, though, there will be some sorting out. Takare is one of the better placed, and on forecasts of about Pounds 14.2m excluding exceptionals, the shares are on a prospective p/e of 16.6 which is still good value.</p>

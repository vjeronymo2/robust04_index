			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - The World's Economies  -Europe (39): An enlightened monetarist - Profile / Hans Tietmeyer Hans Tietmeyer started off living up handsomely to the consensus characterisation in the welter of profiles which marked his installation as Bundesbank president last October. Circumstances quickly conspired either to encourage or oblige him to demonstrate both the stubbornness attributed to him by colleagues, and the application of enlightened, pragmatic monetarism on which he prides himself. He has also had occasion to show his temper. Within three weeks of his taking the chair of the central bank's policy council, a surprise cut in the Bundesbank's internationally-sensitive discount rate earned the bank rare praise from foreign authorities which had been pressing - without much optimism - for action. While announcing the opportunistic move, Mr Tietmeyer used the press conference effectively to define his attitude to the job. What emerged was that no matter how enlightened he might be, he was still a monetarist in the old Bundesbank mould. One perceptive observer had forecast earlier that the world could expect more pragmatism from the new president but 'the same amount of monetarism' as his dry predecessor, Helmut Schlesinger. Even while Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, was congratulating the Frankfurt authorities on the rate cut's contribution to international economic recovery and job creation, Mr Tietmeyer was insisting that central bank policy was not driven by external requirements, economic conditions or exchange rate considerations. Then, on a theme he had consistently voiced in the past, and was to return to and expand on frequently in the subsequent months, he added: 'We cannot be a central bank for Europe.' He seemed concerned to dispel any expectations, fuelled by the profile-writers' focus on his sensitivity to international matters, that his fundamental approach to monetary policy would be influenced by any interests other than those of Germany. His streak of stubbornness and temper have appeared more recently, during bouts of financial market turbulence caused not least by the confusion over the bank's eccentric M3 measure of money supply. Demands from analysts and a usually compliant domestic press corps that the bank should either clearly explain the whirligig gyrations of its inflation weather vane or scrap it, have met a stonewall defence. After some confusion in Bundesbank ranks over how to restore faith, Mr Tietmeyer, flanked mainly by directorate colleague Otmar Issing, set about trying to patch up the damage in a series of carefully orchestrated speeches. Mr Tietmeyer's stance became clear at a heavily-attended social gathering of international bankers in Frankfurt in mid-June, during which he suggested obliquely that fellow council members should shut up on the issue. Difficulties with M3 needed to be explained and clarified, he said, and it would be better done in 'symphonic rather than cacophonic' form. A speech from Alexandre Lamfalussy, president of the European Monetary Institute, obligingly supported the Bundesbank standpoint: 'Money supply does matter for the medium- to long-term behaviour of prices,' he said, and left the microphone to Mr Tietmeyer. There were many reasons why the Bundesbank had relied on monetary targeting as a policy anchor for 20 years, and as far as he was concerned, there were no grounds for the central council to call it into question now, Mr Tietmeyer said. He followed up with a deft review of how the merits of monetary targeting outweighed its demerits, and a side-swipe at the 'not-very-enticing' and opaque alternatives practised in the Anglo-Saxon world. Despite appearances, the Bundesbank was far from fixated on M3, he said. Even in Frankfurt, the conduct of monetary policy allowed room for intuition, flexibility and pragmatism. But in an especially revealing passage he effectively admitted he had learned hard lessons from recent events. He noted wrily that even a missed money supply target had some value. As the 'financial markets seismograph' had shown, it should act as a warning not to push pragmatism too far. Mr Tietmeyer had formerly taken some pride in the fact that, unlike his two predecessors, he had never rattled foreign exchange markets through careless talk about the D-Mark. He still refuses steadfastly to comment on exchange rate swings. But during May and June he found himself confronted by wider turmoil in world financial markets to which actions and statements from the German central bank had contributed to no mean extent. The bank's credibility - by his own admission its most valuable asset - suffered as a consequence, and by association, so did President Tietmeyer's.</p>

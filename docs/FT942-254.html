			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Germany to seek new EU deal for east Europe Germany will push for a new deal for the emerging democracies of central and eastern Europe during its six-month presidency of the European Union, including more measures to open the EU market and to promote closer political co-operation. The aim is to help all the emerging democracies with practical measures for the whole transitional period leading up to eventual EU membership. At the same time, the main German themes of the coming six months will be making Europe relevant to its citizens, and deregulation of the labour market to create more jobs, combined with strict financial discipline to keep spending under control. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, yesterday spelt out a cautious programme for the presidency, which begins tomorrow, insisting that it went no further than what was agreed by all the other member states. 'We will do everything in our power to promote the cause of Europe in this limited period,' he told the German Bundestag in Bonn. But he added: 'The German image of Europe is identical with that of our partners.' He laid the greatest stress in his presentation on the German desire to bring central and eastern European states ever closer to the EU. 'If there is one special foreign policy responsibility of Germany in the light of its history, it is that the Europe which we are striving towards should be built together with the new democracies of east and central Europe,' he said. He said new proposals would be presented to the EU summit in Essen in December to give concrete form to 'getting through the difficult transition phase in which the reforming states find themselves up to the point of accession. 'Further market opening and closer political co-operation (even before accession) are at the top of the list.' The German thinking is in line with European commission plans, with Sir Leon Brittan, UK commissioner, planning to put forward a new report on faster trade liberalisation in the autumn. He will also propose a common competition policy over a three-year period. Mr Kinkel said Germany would be pushing also for closer co-operation on crime prevention, and seeking to turn its Franco-German initiative to combat racism into an EU-wide strategy in time for Essen.</p>

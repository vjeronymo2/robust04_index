			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 23 (TANJUG) -- Delegations of  Bosnian Croats and Moslems failed Saturday [23 April] to reach  agreement in Sarajevo on naming the future president of the  Moslem-Croatian Federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. As reported  by the Croatian radio, the deadline for reaching the agreement  was extended until next week. The delegations headed by Bosnian  Croatian leader Kresimir Tubak and Prime Minister of the Moslem  Government in Sarajevo Haris Silajdzic set forth, as claimed by  the same source, their pros and cons of the candidate for  president, giving legal and political reasons.    Invoking the Washington Accord on forming Moslem-Croatian  Federation in Bosnia, signed earlier this year under strong U.S.  pressure, the Croatian side sought to see a Croat as head of the  first president of the Moslem-Croatian Federation. The same  source set out that the Croats were prepared also for a  compromise: This post they would yield to the Moslems, but on  condition Silajdzic be named instead of the proposed Moslem  leader Alija Izetbegovic, whom the Croats have no wish to see  under any circumstances heading the joint federation.</p>

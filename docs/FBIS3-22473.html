They were among 37 people admitted to the hospital with the  disease which had broken out in the Jirapa Lambussie and Nadowli  districts.    Dr. Francis Banka, medical superintendent in charge of the  hospital, briefed Mr. Joseph Yieleh Chireh, Upper West Regional  Minister, who visited the hospital at the weekend.    Dr. Banka said although the disease had not yet been proved  to be yellow fever, clinical tests so far carried out indicated  a high probability that it is the major cause of the deaths.    A medical team from Accra in collaboration with personnel  from the regional directorate of health services was currently  in the district to establish whether the disease is yellow fever  or a combination of hepatitis and jaundice, he said.    Dr. Banka said the team had been divided into three groups  to  carry out the survey in the affected areas and also vaccinate  and educate the people on preventive measures.</p>

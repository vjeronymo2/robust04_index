			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 15 (CNA) -- Taiwan is making more  concessions in removing tariff and nontariff barriers in an  effort to pave the way for the country's smooth entry into the  general agreement on tariffs and trade, or GATT.    Import restrictions on a host of farm products, including  turkey meat, whole duck and 16 types of fruit, including apples,  peaches and apricots, will be removed, as will area  restrictions, according to Council of Agriculture (COA)  officials.    The tariff concessions will be finalized by an  interministerial GATT strategy task force on Thursday [15 June].  The task force originally was to have met later this month, but  moved the meeting up "because time is pressing."    Taiwan is expected to submit a list of its market-opening  moves before a GATT special working party convenes its sixth  meeting screening Taiwan's application for GATT membership in  late July.    The task force will also discuss Taiwan's opening up to rice  imports, the officials added.    In liberalizing its rice market, Taiwan will not insist on  adopting the "Korean formula," which will allow rice imports of  up to 4 percent of domestic consumption within 10 years, but  will sacrifice some of its own agricultural production to  foreign imports.    It is likely that Taiwan will take a road midway between the  Korean and Japanese formulas. The Japanese formula stipulates  that the country will open 4 percent to 8 percent of its market  to foreign rice in six years, but without opening up its market  to other agricultural products.    Meanwhile, Taiwan officials will hold other tariff-reduction  negotiations with more GATT member countries in early July  before the GATT special working party meets.    The Taiwan delegation, to be headed by Vice Economics  Minister Sheu Ke-sheng and Board of Foreign Trade  Director-General Y.C. Huang, will hold bilateral tariff and  nontariff negotiations at Geneva with officials from Mexico,  Argentina, Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, Australia, and  most European countries.    Taiwan is also scheduled to hold its third round of trade  negotiations with the united tstates in mid-July. A ministry  official said that if the United States finds Taiwan's offer to  slash tariffs, remove area restrictions and open up the service  market satisfactory, it would go a long way toward solidifying  Taiwan's GATT entry.</p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Ukraine stops missile shipments to Russia in row over stockpiling UKRAINE has stopped shipping its tactical nuclear missiles to Russia, where they were to be destroyed under pledges made to the international community, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, announced yesterday. The decision was provoked by Ukrainian fears that the weapons were not being dismantled in Russia, but were being stockpiled. 'We cannot guarantee that weapons transported to Russia will be destroyed or that they will not fall into undesirable hands,' Mr Kravchuk said. At the same time, Mr Konstantin Morozov, defence minister, announced that he had taken control of the Uzin air force base near Kiev which was formerly under the collective command of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The aircraft at the base are capable of carrying nuclear weapons, but Mr Morozov said Ukraine was not seizing the weapons themselves. The decision was taken because CIS military commanders had banned Ukrainians serving in their forces throughout Ukraine from swearing allegiance to the republic, he said. Both moves are likely to complicate already tense relations with Russia. Mr Kravchuk's motive in the nuclear missiles decision could be partly to gain leverage with Russia by hanging on to the weapons in the run-up to what are expected to be difficult negotiations on the future of the former Soviet army in Kiev on March 20. Ukraine feels mounting unease at the presence of a nuclear power on its north-eastern border. Mr Kravchuk yesterday insisted that Ukrainian tactical nuclear warheads 'should not be used to strengthen anyone's nuclear arsenal'. The move is likely, however, to jeopardise Ukraine's promise to destroy all its tactical nuclear missiles by July and its commitment to become a non-nuclear power by 1994. The only facilities for destroying nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union are located in Russia, but Mr Kravchuk proposed the construction of a separate site in Ukraine. Western diplomats confirmed Mr Kravchuk's assertion that existing facilities in Russia are unable to accommodate all Ukrainian missiles. Mr Andrei Kokoshin, deputy director of the USA and Canada Studies Institute, a Moscow think tank, commented recently that 'it can't be done overnight . . . The weapons have to be stored in a central place, then sent to storage facilities attached to plants for the dismantling. We also need storage for weapons-grade enriched plutonium and uranium. There are bottlenecks at every phase.' The move is the most recent example of Ukraine's efforts to establish independent institutions rather than operate through collective structures of the CIS. It may also be an attempt to win a greater share of western funds earmarked for the destruction of nuclear weapons in the former USSR.</p>

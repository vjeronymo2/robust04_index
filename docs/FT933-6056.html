			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: A gamble at Ladbroke Given the financial strains on Ladbroke, it is worth asking whether the board would be wise to choose between a rights issue and a dividend cut with its interim figures this week. Balance sheet gearing and total outstanding debt are both uncomfortably high, while potential disposals would fetch little more than book value and cut gearing only marginally. A rights issue would bring greater comfort to the company's finances. On the other hand, the dividend is clearly out of line with the underlying trading prospects of the group. If the company were to follow Forte's lead, it would cut its dividend to a sustainable level, then try to regain credibility with the market before deciding how to proceed. Certainly attempting a rights issue while the threat of a dividend cut was still in the air would make many institutions gag - all the more so if it were below the level of the 220p issue in 1991. Then again, Ladbroke's chairman, Mr Cyril Stein, is proud of his unbroken dividend record over a generation. He will be loath to spoil that in the latter part of his career. The temptation will be to soldier on until things improve. That, however, will mean more shareholder value leaking away to the banks through high interest charges. Perhaps the company might risk further market displeasure by cutting the cash outflow of dividends and sneak in a mini-rights issue through another enhanced scrip dividend. It may even be tempted to follow the lead of Rank, and roll the full-year dividend into the interim as a larger enhanced scrip. With Ladbroke's high yield, however, that would mean adding more than 10 per cent to the equity which needs to be serviced in future years.</p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Books: Shades of the past GHOSTS by John Banville Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 14.99, 244 pages THE MUSEUM OF LOVE by Steve Weiner Bloomsbury Pounds 15.99, 214 pages AIR AND FIRE by Rupert Thomson Bloomsbury Pounds 15.99, 311 pages ODO'S HANGING by Peter Benson Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 14.99, 251 pages ON AN island facing the Atlantic, the unnamed narrator of Ghosts serves out a personal penance for an unnamed crime. He has done his stint in jail; now he is working on a book in the shadow of the island's resident art historian and an irascible side-kick idiosyncratically named Licht. Islands contain in narrower confines psychological as well as physical geographies. Hence their fascination for writers. They invite intrusion no less than metaphor. To this island, intrusion comes in the form of a disparate group of people to shake up the narrator's near arcadian existence, invoking unwelcome ghosts from his past. 'This is what happens to you in prison,' the narrator reflects, 'you lose your past, it is confiscated from you'. However, the past is richly retrieved in extensive inner monologues evoked by the narrator's interplay with the newcomers. This is a strange novel of startling contrasts: a brooding gothic mood suffuses a pleasant pastel-tinted ambience. Ghosts is Banville's ninth novel. His originality has not deserted him. Much of the writing flows with a lyrical rhythm, and what a joy that is. Yet this is only half a commendation, for the full-bodied resonance of language obtrudes, exposing baldness of plot and some imperfectly-focused ideas. By contrast, Steve Weiner's The Museum of Love is diamond-hard and lean. Its opening sentence is compelling: 'In August that year a Lutheran farmer named Ed Gien shot a social worker in the cranberry bogs.' From there on the hold on the reader is sustained to the end with hardly a let up. The hero, Jean-Michel, is a French Canadian Catholic. His father, a prison warden, is depressive and violent. The young Jean-Michel hits the road, embarking on an odyssey whose arbitrary comic brutality recalls William Burroughs. Just about everything happens to him. His friends, his family, move in and out of his story like a parade of exotics in a circus. Jean-Michel is tough, resilient, totally without self-pity, and therefore engaging. This is a first novel of astonishing power and accomplishment. The writing is superbly economical. Only a certain rawness of moral vision makes this novel a whisker short of being brilliant. At the close of the 19th century, the setting for Air and Fire, a steamer makes its way to Santa Sofia, a remote copper-mining town in Mexico. On board is a French engineer Theophile Valence, with his beautiful young wife, Suzanne. His mission is to erect a metal church, whose 2,348 components are packed in the ship's hold. The project is the brainchild of Gustave Eiffel, with whom M. Valence corresponds. Ethereal and inexperienced, Suzanne yearns for the kind of romantic love her eminently rational husband is incapable of giving. Wilson, an American drifter can, so Suzanne believes, but won't. Montoya, the flamboyant local army commander, wants to but is rejected. Rupert Thomson manages some marvellous writing here, in a style well-suited to the evocative, semi-fantastical landscape he creates. But the promise he skilfully upholds through more than half the novel, is never quite realised in the end: there is more Air than Fire to the story. The Bayeux Tapestry propels the story of Peter Benson's charming novel. Turold, a master Norman designer of imposing stature and turbulent character, is commissioned by William the Conqueror's half-brother, Bishop Odo, to create the tapestry. Reluctantly, Turold sails for England with his dumb assistant Robert, the story's narrator. The 'real' story evolves side by side with that which the commissioned tapestry records for posterity. And it's a good one.</p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / International Company News: Strategy for Next generation of workstations - Alan Cane assesses the challenge facing the US computer group's new chief executive IF Mr Peter van Cuylenburg harbours any lingering resentment about being passed over for the top job at Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecommunications company, he hides it well. His enthusiasm for his new company, Next Computer, the innovative computer venture established by Apple Computers' founder, Mr Steve Jobs, borders on the evangelical. In March he took on the newly-created post of president and chief operating officer, sharing the 'office of the president' with the mercurial and abrasive Mr Jobs. That the ambitious Mr van Cuylenburg, highly regarded as chief executive of C&amp;W subsidiary Mercury Communications should have left the company after Mr James Ross was appointed to the position that he clearly craved was understandable. But the move to Next, a three-year-old, privately-held workstation manufacturer that has failed to make much of a mark in the computer business, was a surprise to many. He then emphasised the uniqueness of the opportunity: 'Once in a lifetime', he described it. That view has seemingly been reinforced by his first three months at Next's Redwood City, California, headquarters. Now he says it is odds-on that Next will be a billion dollar company within three years, that an initial public offering planned for 1993 will be a success, and the company will make a lasting impression on the business environment: 'It is not a question of whether Next will be a success, but how much of a success.' Others have still to share his optimism. Mr Jobs started Next after he left Apple following disagreements over corporate policy with the chief executive, Mr John Scully. His aim was to develop an innovative workstation, a high-performance personal computer, packed with the latest technology including high-quality stereophonic sound, optical disk storage and laser printer. Prospective purchasers were discouraged, however, by high prices - Dollars 10,000 a unit to corporate customers - and a shortage of software and non-standard features. Sales have been tiny. Last year the company turned over Dollars 127m, up from Dollars 30m in 1990, and 'cash-flow is still negative', according to Mr van Cuylenburg. But lessons have been learned. New, low-cost models were developed, software houses, such as Lotus Development Corporation, were encouraged to develop programs for the new machines, and versions of Next's operating software written to run on other group's computers. The company has influential backers. Canon, the Japanese company, famous for cameras and laser printers, is a shareholder. So is Mr H. Ross Perot, the potential US presidential candidate. Mr van Cuylenburg says his role has been to bring professional management and marketing skills to an organisation that has lacked both. In his first three months he rewrote the business plan, slimmed down the management and helped to secure a Dollars 55m credit line from Canon. Together with a further Dollars 10m credit line from Mr Jobs, the company's largest shareholder, Next is now fully-funded and Mr van Cuylenburg says: 'These credit lines provide more than we require to fund our anticipated growth, yet give us the flexibility to use as little additional funding as possible.' Mr van Cuylenburg and Mr Jobs work in tandem, Mr van Cuylenburg providing the day-to-day management of the business, matching growth to cash-flow and so on. Mr Jobs takes the role of visionary, planning Next's product strategy for the mid-1990s and beyond. None of this, however, explains Mr van Cuylenburg's excitement at sharing in the Next story. He believes the company is at the forefront of a revolution in the way in which software is developed for business applications. The emphasis today on re-engineering business processes and on improving service industry productivity means high-quality software has to be generated more rapidly, he says. Next is a leader in a novel method of programming called object-orientation, which turns conventional programming methods on their heads but which offers the possibility of building high-quality software quickly and cheaply. Essentially, it involves the creation of software modules which can be stored and re-used. The Next machines and programming software area based on object-orientated principles. Mr van Cuylenburg believes object-orientated techniques can be used to 'glue' together low-cost packaged software - word processors, spreadsheets and the like - to create electronic desktops tailored to individual customers needs. He points to the example of large brokerage houses - some of them Next's customers - where dealers combine a range of different information, from computer files to video, to give them a single picture of the financial world. Next is focusing on three such markets, financial services, health care and legal services, in its bid to spread the message about object-orientation through the workstation market. The leader in the workstation market, however, Sun Microsystems, has revenues of more than Dollars 3bn, and major players include IBM and Hewlett Packard. There are, therefore, tough hurdles to be surmounted before Mr van Cuylenburg will know if his new orientation will satisfy his career objectives.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Forces loyal to unity and national alignment  succeeded yesterday morning in storming the camp of the 2d  Armored Brigade at (al-Rahah), in the governorate of Lahij,  following repeated loudspeaker appeals from members of the Armed  Forces. They warned their brothers in the camp of the  consequences of being dragged into this war, which the  adventurers want to use to defend their flimsy, collapsing rule.  Hundreds of 2d Armored Brigade soldiers surrendered, and  announced they were joining the ranks of the people defending  unity and democracy. The camp was seized after a small remnant  of fighters fled. These persons had pledged themselves to evil,  and to defending the regime of the military family ruling in  Sanaa.    During the attack on the camp, appeals were made to the  fighters and citizens to preserve the lives of their brothers,  and to preserve the those possessions of the 2d Brigade which  were left in the camp after its members had fled. All these  possessions are now with the Yemeni Armed Forces.    After entering and touring the camp, the fighters and  citizens were surprised by the fortified defenses set up by the  brigade, in accordance with instructions from the military  family ruling in Sanaa, which displayed the absolutely divisive  mentality with which it views Yemeni unity. The family was  under the illusion that the brigade and its fighters were in a  hostile zone. This exposes the premeditated intentions for war  this tyrannical gang held. Had it not been hostile intentions  which motivated them, simple defenses would have been sufficient  in a permanent military zone -- like the ones set up by units  transferred from Aden to Sanaa.    Immediate instructions were issued by the Defense Ministry  following the storming of the camp, which called on the soldiers  and citizens to preserve the lives of their fighting brothers,  and to reassure those who had fled to the mountains that they  were in their homeland and among their brothers. All military  efforts should be directed against the hearts of the al-Ahmar  gang and its clique.</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEANER, MEANER TV NEWS IN THE SCALED-DOWN '90S  </P> <P> In 1982, at the height of the last recession, reporter Doug Bruckner flew to  Guadalajara for a local Los Angeles TV station. The assignment was to interview  California retirees who had moved to Mexico to avoid the high cost of living in  the United States.  </P> <P> On that three-day trip, Bruckner was accompanied by a union cameraman,  soundman, field producer and translator -- even though the field producer spoke  Spanish. What with overtime, per diem, hotel bills, meals, transportation and  air fare, Bruckner figures the total bill for a bit of videotape that  eventually translated into about four minutes of air time on a Los Angeles  evening newscast was somewhere in the neighborhood of $15,000 to $20,000.  </P> <P> Bruckner has since worked at all three network owned-and-operated Los Angeles  TV stations at one time or another. Nowadays, he works harder for a non-network  evening newsmagazine and on more of a shoestring than at any other time in his  career. But, on whole, he has learned to be leaner, meaner and -- recession  aside -- happier.  </P> <P> Six months ago, on a Friday afternoon, the syndicated Paramount TV newsmagazine  "Hard Copy" bought Bruckner a round-trip ticket to Tahiti. The assignment was  to cover the funeral of Dag Drollet, Cheyenne Brando's lover who allegedly was  slain by her half-brother, Christian, in the Beverly Hills home of their  father, actor Marlon Brando.  </P> <P> Bruckner's boss gave him 10 blank videocassettes and $35 a day per diem pay and  told him to come back Monday with a story. He did and, according to the  ratings, it was seen by more people in a single night than saw him on Los  Angeles TV in a week.  </P> <P> Surviving TV news in the scaled-down '90s will have to be more like the Tahiti  story and a lot less like the Guadalajara junket, says Bruckner.  </P> <P> "The economics of the business have changed," he said.

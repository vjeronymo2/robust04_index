			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Gummer moots change to council housing provision Local authorities should not be expected automatically to provide permanent accommodation for homeless people, Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, told the Commons yesterday. After helping with an immediate crisis, he said, councils should be able to take a 'considered view' about the proper allocation of available homes. He said the results of consultation on the allocation of council accommodation would be published next month. Mr Gummer accused Labour MPs of maintaining their 'deep-seated hatred' against the private rented sector. Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, attacked the 'failure' of housing policy, and highlighted the growth in the amount of social security benefit which reached the pockets of private landlords. Much of the rent rises in the private sector had been 'publicly subsidised' through housing benefit. Mr Straw renewed Labour's demand that local authorities should be able to draw on the capital receipts obtained from the sale of council properties. The money should be made available to increase the number of properties available to let and enable the unemployed in the construction industry to return to work.</p>

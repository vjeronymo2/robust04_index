			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: reports by </F> diplomatic correspondents Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy, and  others]    [Text] The issues of interaction between Russia and NATO,  in the framework of the Partnership For Peace program also, will  be discussed during a visit to Brussels to be paid by Defence  Minister Pavel Grachev on May 24-25. However there are no plans  to sign the program during his visit. Interfax learned this  from Yuriy Ushakov, the chief of the European Cooperation  Department of Russia's Foreign Ministry.    According to him, the issue of Russia's joining the  Partnership For Peace program is still being considered. "At  the moment it's hard to say what time interdepartmental  discussions will take. Neither has it been decided in what form  Russia will submit its considerations concerning its joining  NATO's Partnership For Peace program," he said. "At first we  would like to discuss with NATO the content of our relations,  and settle the issue of joining the Partnership program in one  way or another only afterwards."    When asked whether Moscow intends to receive guarantees that  upon signing the program Russia will not find itself in a  position of NATO's "junior partner", Ushakov said "Yes". "We  want to discuss the entire format of our relations with NATO in  advance," he said.    As Interfax's interviewee said, Moscow is deciding "when and  in what form it will submit to NATO its presentation document  which concretizes the possible directions of interaction between  Russia and NATO in the framework of the Partnership For Peace  program."    When asked about NATO's reaction to the cancellation of  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's visit to NATO's headquarters  in Brussels planned for April 21 because of the developments in  Bosnia, Ushakov said: "NATO's program says that a potential  partner decides on its own when to sign the document and on what  level. For Russia it is not important whether it will be the  fifth, sixth, or fourteenth to join the Partnership program.  What is important to us is to make this partnership meaningful  in real terms."</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt Pre-election angst appears to be a condition limited to foreign observers of the German scene, who parted with their D-Mark investments in increasing numbers last week as opinion polls suggested a close-run election next weekend. German analysts and investors are altogether more phlegmatic. Many weight the scale heavily in favour of a return to power for Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his conservative/liberal coalition. One favoured theory among the not-so-sures is that even if the Social Democrats come to share power in a grand coalition with the Christian Democrats and the Christian Social Union, there is no real risk to economic, monetary or fiscal stability. They argue that, by virtue of its majority in the powerful upper house of parliament, the SPD is already effectively a partner in government and law-making. But the most rousing noises emerged from Deutsche Bank's institutional investors' team in Dusseldorf on Friday, where they appeared to be putting out the flags a week early, rating the current coalition with a 70 per cent chance of returning to power, and promising 'fireworks' if it does. These would include a gain of up to 300 points in Frankfurt's over-sold DAX index of 30 leading shares, and a 'powerful rally' in the bond market.</p>

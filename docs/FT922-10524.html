			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Technology (Software at Work): Keeping the cash flowing - Claire Gooding continues a series on getting the most out of software by tackling the thorny subject of maintenance British banking is behind the times. Despite the millions spent on technology it still takes three days to clear a cheque. Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) are often not working or out of step with a customer's banking details. This is partly due to the constraints imposed by the software which runs large banking systems. These represent a big investment but, once implemented, become a liability as much as an asset. A simple amendment to the software can cause chaos out of all proportion to the scale of the change. In the banking industry, maintenance raises questions of scale, and not just because so many systems run on multiple mainframe computers serving thousands of ATMs. There are personnel and staffing issues, and multi-country operations to be considered. Custom-built or bespoke systems pose the thorniest problems because knowledge of them tends to be esoteric, and confined to the original developers. It is for this reason that the Standard Chartered Bank has taken a long-term view of the maintenance issue when implementing new systems. 'The main foundation of our policy is that we do not develop programs, we buy packages in,' explains Phil Reed, group IT manager. The bank also believes in developing in one central site, and then shipping out to others. The policy is the result of a large technology review carried out by the bank between 1986-87. The issue of multi-country operations loomed large, as the systems in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and the UK varied widely. The businesses were of different sizes and all supported home-grown systems and maintenance teams. In Hong Kong, a Unisys system ran the retail side and an NCR system was used for corporate systems. A review by Andersen Consulting focused on economies of scale. 'The issue we faced was not just cost, but whether we could do it with the resources available,' explains Reed. Standard Chartered's strong presence in the Far East also brought home the high expectations of customers there. 'As a customer, I regularly use banks in the Far East and the US, and I can be in and out in a couple of minutes having done everything I want,' says Reed. 'For the last two years, anyone in the Far East has been able to pay in money at the counter and check the correct balance on the ATM outside within 10 seconds.' This gave the bank a strong incentive to introduce improved business benefits at the same time as streamlining its technology on a worldwide basis. 'The level of service we offered as a retail bank in the mid 1980s in the Far East was restricted: very similar to that offered in the UK now.' The main aim was improved functionality, and 'real time banking' was chosen as the best route forward. The implications of this were 24-hour banking and a high degree of on-line resilience; far higher than that needed by batch systems. There were three main components in the plan: retail, treasury, trade finance and business (including corporate) systems. Standard Chartered decided on the package route for all. 'The attempt to create new banking systems from scratch has proved time and again to be too difficult,' says Reed. He sees two big issues in the decision characterised as 'the maintenance issue' and 'the big picture'. The trouble with all-singing, all-dancing systems, he observes, is that one person cannot keep the whole picture in their brain. To this he attributes the downfall of several large-scale banking schemes that have been shelved several years, and several millions of pounds, down the development line. 'The project manager and the MIS manager cannot have the whole view. Both have large teams which, although they might be termed development teams, are maintenance teams as well.' The solution to both these problems was to buy packages, sticking closely to those perceived as 'standards' in the IBM world. 'There had to be a common technical structure, however much people claim to be different,' says Reed. This fitted the bank's policy of delivering functions from one country to another. 'The issues facing us when implementing packages are very different from bespoke software. The question is: do I modify my working environment to fit the software, or do I modify my package to suit my working environment? 'The answer is yes to the first - any other route throws away the benefit of using packages.' It was a board decision that the packages should be 'modified to a limit'. Senior management is closely involved in the IT process, and recognises IT as a 'people issue'. 'IT and personnel report to one executive director because IT affects all employees and the way they operate. It's a personnel and union issue. We haven't got it right yet, but we do have a product management methodology.' This consists of managing the 'product' from the cradle to the grave, the product meaning Reed's 'big picture' of software product, benefits, culture and lifestyle. As with many successful projects, the first step is to get the most senior person in the business to sell it down the line. The maintenance issue is woven into this philosophy. 'Maintenance and development are intertwined. Everything has to be tested and tested well.' But, he points out, user-testing is too expensive on a manual basis, involving users and programmers working day and night, larger machines to run test systems alongside live ones, and so on. Reed's team came up with the concept of having various tools and products for maintenance. 'If you glue them together with a methodology, you have a much-enhanced set of benefits so that you can use it over and over.' The package approach ruled once again, and the bank turned to products from Dunstable-base Compuware. Compuware's Playback and File-AID packages have formed the basis of a re-useable system for the testing phase - generally the Cinderella of the software development cycle. The pressure to deliver new systems often means that developers fail to test every possible path, and therefore miss the repercussions of 'minor' changes. Ian Weavers, manager of development environments for group IT, heads a small team in charge of testing. He believes few developers bother to treat their test data as a re-useable asset. 'Completed test data were often discarded after use. This is a tremendous waste - as crazy as throwing source code away.' Testing is estimated to take up 40 per cent of the total development cost: a figure that stays constant in later releases, even where development costs lessen. Here the Repeatable Test System proved its worth. The International Banking Application, from banking software specialist Hogan, was tested and implemented in Hong Kong initially. The two-year cycle was cut down to six months when the process was repeated in Singapore, and an even shorter cycle in Malaysia. The bank plans to use the system with IMMS and Imex from Surecomp. Reed recognises his re-usable test harness as an asset, which saves the valuable time of programmers, users, and technical staff who would otherwise be involved. On average, the combination of RTS and Playback has brought down the amount of user-acceptance testing down from 28 per cent to 2.3 per cent of total effort. Actual costs of testing dropped from Pounds 431,250 to Pounds 53,000. 'In a world where 53 per cent of defects are caused by changes, we have raised the quality of the software and reduced the time it takes to deliver working systems to users,' concludes Reed. BUZZWORDS REAL-TIME OPERATIONS demand speed and reliability because they are instantaneous. Often the computer code also triggers off a 'real' or mechanical event, such as the control of an ATM. BATCH SYSTEMS process high volumes of transactions, usually overnight, and are the basis of most older mainframe systems. ON-LINE SYSTEMS provide 'interactive' access to information, though the data may not be up to date if it fed by batch rather than real-time systems. Company Snapshot Standard Chartered Bank, founded in 1853, operates from 700 offices worldwide. The group's main strength is in the Pacific Rim, Africa, the Middle East and south-east Asia. It was formed from a merger of the Standard Bank and the Chartered Bank in 1969. Its Shanghai branch, opened in 1858, makes it the oldest foreign bank in China. Operations in Singapore and Hong Kong were opened the following year. Nature of business: International banking, with operations in 50 countries. Turnover/profit: In 1991 the bank showed a 37 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 205m. Trading profits in the Far East rose a fifth to Pounds 184m. Employees: 30,000 worldwide, of whom 1,200 work in information technology. IT expenditure is about Pounds 100m annually. Technology File Software: Core packages include Imex, a financial trading package, and IMMS, a back office support system, both from Surecomp. Also Hogan's International Banking Application, IBA. Hardware: Five IBM-compatible mainframes running IBM's MVS/CICS operating environment are located in Malaysia, Hong Kong (IBM), Singapore and Wales (Hitachi Data Systems). The bank also runs more than 100 mid-range IBM computers (AS/400s, System 36 and 38s) and systems from ICL, NCR and Unisys. Standard Chartered's policy is to remove its mid-range computers entirely and transfer applications to Novell PC local area networks, or to the large mainframe-based data centres. Maintenance and testing: The Repeatable Test System has been developed on the back of two software testing products, Playback and File-AID. Suppliers: Compuware, a privately owned US software house based in Michigan, with UK headquarters in Dunstable, specialises in automated software testing tools. Value of contract: Initial licensing costs at the time of installation (1988) were around Pounds 150,000. Product maintenance fees are typically 16 per cent of contract value.</p>

In the view of Wlodzimierz  Cimoszewicz, justice minister and deputy prime minister,  sponsorship of the police ought to be decisively broken off.    [Unidentified correspondent] In the course of a news  conference, Minister Cimoszewicz revealed that there had also  been a wish to sponsor the prosecutor's office. Fortunately,  this did not come about, he added.    [Cimoszewicz] "This was unambiguously cut off after the  first  case. This was never ever repeated."    [Correspondent] In the minister's view, the police ought to  behave similarly. In accordance with the law of June 1990, the  police are financed from the state budget. Today, there are not  sufficient legal grounds for them to be sponsored. The  principles for the accepting of gifts by the police are  regulated by three documents, of which none is law. There is  the minister of internal affairs' decree, an instruction by the  director of the finance department of the Ministry of Internal  Affairs, and a letter from the main commandant [of the police].  It is not precluded that the issue of sponsorship will be the  main thread in the investigation into corruption in the Poznan  police. Minister Cimoszewicz was surprised at the decision of  the voivodship prosecutor's office in Warsaw, which shortly  wishes to interview Dariusz Rossati, the candidate of the  Democratic Left Alliance for [the post of] minister of finance.  The interview is in association with Rossati's work on the  supervisory board of the Foreign Indebtedness Servicing Fund  [FOZZ].    [Cimoszewicz] "What the composition of the supervisory board  of this fund was has been known for a long time. Why is it only  now necessary to determine the address at which Mr. Rossati  lives in Geneva? He has been living there for quite some time."    [Correspondent] The minister's doubts are also shared by the  head of the prosecutors' department.    [Waldemar Smardzewski, director of the prosecutors'  department of the Ministry of Justice] "In the near future, I  will clarify the reasons it has been acknowledged that it is  appropriate now to precisely carry through this procedural  event, which could have been carried out a long, long time ago.  So, why is this raised only now?"    [Correspondent] According to the information in the hands of  journalists, the capital prosecutor's office today asked the  Ministry of Justice whether it is to question Rossati. Such an  obligation has been laid upon it by the appeal court,  instructing the questioning of all of the members of the FOZZ  Supervisory Board. Smardzewski denied that there had ever been a  document with such a question.</p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Gas caution British Gas was the most heavily traded stock in the FT-SE 100 Index and the second most active stock option as a big two-way pull developed in the shares. They underperformed the market, closing only a fraction higher at 302 1/2 p on volume of 16m; turnover in the traded options totalled the equivalent of a further 3.3m shares. Specialists said the market had begun to reappraise British Gas's recent statements on dividend strategy after a lunch held on Tuesday between Gas and a number of leading analysts. The majority of analysts increased their dividend forecasts for Gas following the big strategy presentation held in London at the end of September. A number of favourable regulatory decisions have enabled Gas to outperform the market by 13 per cent since June. Burmah Castrol jumped 16 to 855p ahead of the trip by analysts to the group's lubricants operations in Thailand and Vietnam at the end of the month. Barclays was restrained by news that Kleinwort Benson had taken the shares off its buy list, downgrading the stock to a hold. The stock price edged up only a penny to 563p. National Westminster dipped 5 1/2 to 497p ahead of figures expected today from US subsdiary NatWest Bancorp. HSBC raced up 16 to 726p, with Swiss Bank Corporation said to have been an aggressive buyer of the stock. Insurance brokers made further rapid progress after broker buy notes and talk of potential bid moves. Willis Corroon added 4 1/2 at 165 1/2 p and Lloyd Thompson 15 at 176p. Drinks group Matthew Clark tumbled 36 to 589p after it announced a Pounds 109m acquisition of rival Gaymer Group, and a Pounds 64.6m rights issue to help fund the deal. However, market watchers welcomed the deal. A clutch of brokers' recommendations supported Unilever, the shares closing 8 ahead at 1130p. The prospect of increased competition in the snack foods business, together with unconfirmed rumours of a negative broker's note, left shares in United Biscuits 3 lighter at 309p. Storehouse improved 6 to 208p, boosted by a profits upgrade and recommendation from UBS. The securities house raised its current year profits estimate by Pounds 5m to Pounds 90m and said: 'Trading seems to have gathered pace at Storehouse in the last couple of months.' High street retailer Lloyds Chemists forged ahead 16 to 299p after posting a sparkling set of full-year figures which revealed a 17 per cent increase in profits to Pounds 58.3m, and a 31 per cent rise in the dividend. The favourable sentiment in Lloyds Chemists spread to Boots, which climbed 13 to 525p. UBS reiterated its buy recommendation on the stock, pointing to good prospects for the healthcare market. Overnight selling in the US on Tuesday hit ICI, whose shares closed 2 lower yesterday at 814p. Amersham international surged a further 52 to 995p on consideration of the company's Japanese deal announced earlier in the week. Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the paper maker, slipped 4 to 258p on disappointment that it had failed to secure a portion of SD Warren, one of the dominant US players in the sector. Warren was snapped up by Sappi, of South Africa, for Dollars 1.6bn. Other Statistics, Page 45</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Between 17 and 18 January, the warmongering  communist Vietnamese puppets gathered 1,000 puppet soldiers from  the 196th, 12th, and 6th Divisions; from Battambang District;  and from provincial troops and attacked the people's liberated  villages in the area of Boeng Kandal and Dambok villages on the  south Sisophon battlefield.    The people and the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea  [NADK], however, clearly had advance warning of the enemy's  attack plan and ambushed the enemy forces. The NADK, in  cooperation with the people, divided their forces into two  prongs. The first prong attacked the communist Vietnamese  puppet troops as they left Lvea village; the second prong  attacked the troops leaving Ampil Pram Daeum. In these two  attacks, the NADK and the people killed 38 communist Vietnamese  puppet soldiers, wounded 32 others, and seized a large quantity  of guns and materiel. The remaining soldiers were really  scared. A large number fled because they were afraid of dying  and were angry with their commanders for forcing them to attack  the Democratic Kampuchean resistance forces and the people and  die on their behalf.</p>

But I fully agree that we are at a decisive  stage, while finances and the economy have found themselves in a  sense on the top of a mountain," said Russia's Acting Finance  Minister Sergei Dubinin in an interview with Vladimir Gurevich,  MOSCOW NEWS Deputy Editor-in-Chief.    If we are atop a mountain pass we can only go down in  any case.    The question is what will go down, whether we will secure a  reduction of inflation or roll down the mountain side ourselves.    Expectations of a mounting inflation and then of a  financial collapse resulting from the actions of the present  government are quite widespread today.    These may be deceptive expectations. In any case no steps  towards a catastrophe have been taken so far. As for inflation  in the near future, it will certainly go down to about  15% in  February compared to 21-22% in January.    But everybody is talking about major injections of  money on account of the last years' government debts.    Everybody also says that debts should be repaid and begin to  count how much the treasury owes them. Meanwhile all obligations  for expenditure under the budget drawn up last summer and  submitted to the then Supreme Soviet were fulfilled by the  government. There would have been no debts if expenditures had  not been indexed in the fourth quarter. Besides that some people  are fond of counting debts only one way. The agrarians, for  instance, borrowed heavily in 1992 but returned very little in  1993, and there was no big fuss, although the sums were very  large.    The government is now repaying some of its debts. A decision  has been made to pay in the first quarter 3.8 trillion rubles on  account of contracts concluded last year. This is a  comparatively safe level with respect to inflation. We will not  induce the collapse of the financial system. It should also be  pointed out that the entire situation is a stern warning to the  government itself when it undertakes further obligations.    There is a case in point now that the discussion of  this year's draft budget is under way.    The draft was drawn up with great difficulty but has been  made sufficiently strict, as it should be. The planned budgetary  deficit of 54 trillion rubles, plus the repayment of about 60  trillion rubles of 1993 debts makes it possible to keep the  finances within permissible limits. It is envisioned that 19  trillion of this deficit will be covered by external borrowing,  4.5 trillion by state bonds and the rest by credits from the  Central Bank.    Boris Fyodorov makes a much more pessimistic appraisal.  He believes that in reality the deficit of this year will exceed  critical limits and reach 100 trillion rubles.    This will happen if the proverbial "financial blanket" is  torn to pieces during and after the draft's discussion. But  today I hold a more optimistic view. It is realistic to expect,  under the draft budget, the reduction of inflation by the end of  the year to 10% a month and maybe even lower. More serious  results could be expected, but I am not sure this is realistic  in the present situation.    By the way you are, along with the First Deputy  Minister Andrei Vavilov, conducting another round of  negotiations with IMF which usually links its credits to the  realization of "more ambitious" results.    We expect representatives of the fund and the G-7 countries  to also be realistic. No one hopes, of course, that they will  pull us out of the crisis, but the situation would have been  much more grave without their assistance.    What and who else do you count on? On just yourself?  The question is not very correct, but aren't you pressed by the  word "acting" preceding your title?    I find even some advantages in it, for nobody expects  something special from me, but if I manage to do more... I count  on the Finance Ministry's team which is a strong one largely  thanks to Fyodorov. And I certainly count on the premier who  supports our draft budget. This is important since, in my view,  he is fully in control of the situation in the Cabinet. Finally,  I count on cooperation with the Central Bank, without which it  is difficult to think about financial stability. It was somewhat  unexpected but we met with the Central Bank's call for even a  "stronger" policy than the Finance Ministry itself planned.    How do you explain this? Is Mr. Gerashchenko satisfied  with Fyodorov's departure and ready to offer his assistance?    I explain this by the fact that the Central Bank has looked  beyond the edge of the abyss, has assessed the consequences of  the possible financial injection of which we spoke. Everyone  will have to answer for a collapse. The situation is very tense:  one or two steps can lead us to conditions in which nobody will  be able to do anything and a financial collapse will become  inevitable.    According to forecasts, this may happen in the  autumn.    This has an inertia of its own. The rise in prices occurs  over two months, we inject money today and have a flare-up of  inflation in two months. To start an uncontrolled hyperinflation  would require, I think, six to seven months. Then we would have  40% monthly inflation by autumn, 50% by the end of  the year,  and things would finally get out of control in the first quarter  of the new year. I consider the prevention of hyperinflation my  main task, although it is in fact only a minimum task, and I  shall consider myself successful if inflation falls from its  present level.    What do you consider the main threat?    It is the fact that our society is built on a corporative  or,  more simply, a sectoral basis. Various "corporations" are drawn  into the escalation of demands. If this is not firmly resisted,  in time the pressure will grow so that resistance will be almost  useless.    Are you a supporter of high duties on imported  goods?    I am ready to agree to demands for sky-high duties on the  import of agricultural products based on the argument that every  country in the world protects its own farmers by high taxes on  agricultural imports. But then we must tell our consumers that  this means a sharp rise in food prices. Second, we should look  honestly at what will happen to our agricultural sector if it's  protected from competition. Will this raise its efficiency or  will it remain the same? It was protected before, why didn't it  develop greater efficiency then?    The logic of producers is clear: the tax on imports  should be raised and taxes on production should be lowered. An  increasingly popular idea of late is that most taxes should be  lowered or cancelled altogether and the budget should be formed  from two sources: the tax on the extraction of raw materials and  the tax on land. These taxes are easier to collect, incomes will  be more stable, and manufacturing industries, freed from the tax  pressure, will begin to develop.    But what will raw-materials' industries, crushed by this  tax,  begin to do? They will further raise prices of their goods which  will reach manufacturers and affect them as badly as taxes do.    Do you think that the present tax system works well?  Even though tax contribution to the budget has diminished?    It was about 16% of the gross national product in  the first  quarter of the last year, then went down to 9% and rose  somewhat by the end of the year. Still I must say that the  existing system works quite well. During two years we introduced  a complicated tax, the VAT, which is functioning.    But the tax arrears are immense.    Let me specify. The arrears of taxes, which have been  accurately calculated, total 4.5 trillion rubles. The defaulters  have been identified, but they don't pay. Because they have  nothing to pay with.    But besides, arrears there are sums which are concealed  from taxation, which are, according to estimates, immeasurably  higher.    They are great indeed, but I would not say that their share  is unprecedented. In the United States with its immensely  developed tax laws, great experience and "tax abiding"  traditions, only 80% of tax that should theoretically be  collected is actually collected, and 20% is concealed. We  collect about 60%, which, incidentally, greatly impressed  foreign financial experts who expected a much lower figure. But  if you think that 40% of concealed taxes makes me happy  you are  badly mistaken.    Have you agreed to make very complicated and difficult  decisions?    It seems to me that such decisions would have to be taken  anyway. It is, of course, possible not to take them and let all  proportions in the economy be formed in a purely market way, but  they will actually develop under the powerful impact of various  interests. It should be pointed out that interests within  economy complexes, within industries are also contradictory.    Can the present government be successful?    It seems to me that the current government situation closely  corresponds to the situation in society where none of the major  political blocs has a stable majority. Any political homogeneous  government would now serve as an object of political passions.  But then any government formed by various forces as a coalition  one would be much too amorphous and unable to do anything. Today  we have a government of technocrats, managers of production who  are prepared to obey the premier who is politically neutral  enough. The president as well, did not align himself with a  specific party during the elections. As a result, we have a  government which can act more successfully in this situation  than we could have expected.</p>

			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: ACT sale severs link with hardware ACT Group, the Birmingham-based computing services company, yesterday continued its programme of disposals with the sale of its computer maintenance and systems integration arms. The disposal marks ACT's final retreat from any involvement in the computer hardware business, following the sale of its Apricot workstation business to Mitsubishi of Japan three years ago. ACT Computer Support and ACT Network Si, have been sold for Pounds 14.5m cash, implying an exit p/e of about 7, to a new company involving the management of Computer Support together with NatWest Ventures Investments and Phildrew Ventures Third Fund. The two companies made pre-tax profits of about Pounds 3.5m in the year to March 31, but operating profitability has been falling sharply. Assuming current interest rates, earnings this year will be diluted by about 1p a share, ACT said. The new company will be called Network Si Group and will be run by Mr Simon Hunt, chairman, and Mr William Bayly, recruited from Cray Communications.</p>

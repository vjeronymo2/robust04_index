He noted that the Palestinian National Authority intends  to build 13 new cities in Gaza, the West Bank, and Jericho areas.    Dr. Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, PLO Executive Committee member and  head of the PLO Economic Department, has noted that the  Palestinian economy is in bad shape as a result of the  destruction sustained by the infrastructure at the hands of the  Israeli occupation authorities.    Speaking to a MENA correspondent, Dr. al-Nashashibi pointed  out that the first stage of rebuilding the infrastructure  requires more than $365 million. He added: We need 80,000  housing units urgently to provide housing for low-income people,  who suffer from a major housing problem.    On the economic development projects in Palestine, Dr.  al-Nashashibi pointed out that a Palestinian bank for industrial  development will be set up with a capital of $100 million. He  added: We have prepared an investment law and a law for  companies, and we welcome private and joint enterprises by Arab  investors. He noted that the port of Gaza will be modernized  and a floating dock will be urgently built, adding that the  Netherlands has agreed to share 40 percent of the costs of this  project, which amounts to $50 millions. He noted that contacts  are under way with Spain, the Netherlands, Germany, France,  Britain, and Greece to finance infrastructure projects separate  from those financed by the World Bank.    Dr. al-Nashashibi stressed that the Palestinians are in  urgent need of 130 megawatts of electricity in Gaza and 220  megawatts on the West Bank, noting that there are contacts with  Egypt in this regard.    On Palestinian-U.S. relations, the Palestinian official  noted  that the Americans have promised to consider financing some  projects other than those financed by the World Bank and the  donor countries. They also promised to abrogate all laws enacted  by Congress banning dealings with the Palestinians, to give  Palestinian officials a chance to meet with U.S. businessmen,  and to open U.S. markets to Palestinian products, he added.    Concluding his remarks, Dr. al-Nashashibi added: We need to  create 50,000 jobs urgently. He noted that there are 100,000  unemployed, representing 75 percent of the work force. He  added: We will conclude an economic agreement with Egypt soon to  encourage Egyptian construction companies to carry out projects  in the West Bank and Gaza.    Dr. al-Nashashibi left Damascus at noon today after taking  part in the meetings of the Arab Agricultural Development  Organization, which concluded its work here last night.</p>

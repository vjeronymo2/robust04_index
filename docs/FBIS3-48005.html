			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hans Peter Steel, president of Germany's Federal  Chamber of Commerce, 62, came to Seoul to have, as he put it, a  first-hand look at the investment environment in the ROK. He  came to Seoul on 12 January after winding up his visit to Japan.  The reporter met him at the office of the ROK-German Chamber of  Commerce in Seoul on 13 January.    [Ho Mun-myong] What is the purpose of your visit to the ROK?    [Steel] The German economy is export-oriented. But the  settlement of the Uruguay Round made the German Government take  even greater interest in international trade. The Asian region  has a great growth potential and its investment environment is  improving with each passing day. I have come to Seoul on behalf  of the German industrialists to explore prospective business  areas for investment and ways to promote economic cooperation.    [Ho] You said there has been a change in the investment  environment in the ROK, did you not?    [Steel] Yes. Comparing it with that of one year ago when I  visited Seoul, I find a considerable change not only in the  external appearance of Seoul but in its economic environment, as  well. Many of the restrictions have been lifted and the  investment environment is changing positively. [end Steel]    President Steel said, "The ROK is trying hard to export its  goods, but is blocking its domestic market from foreign  exporters. A typical example is that the ROK is discouraging  people from buying foreign-made cars while allowing them to be  imported."    [Ho] Is there any problem in Germany's internationalization?    [Steel] Germany's exports and imports account for two-thirds  of its gross national product. This explains how much we depend  on trade with other countries. We have an urgent need to secure  not only the European market but the East Asian and South  American markets. Many German businesses are moving their  plants to Southeast Asia and East Europe avoiding high  production cost in Germany, therefore, this will activate our  advance into these areas.    [Ho] Do you think this is a good time for the ROK to  internationalize its economy?    [Steel] Yes, it is the right time for the ROK to do so  because the ROK economy is now capable of sustaining itself to a  certain degree. The ROK has liberalized much of its markets,  but it has yet to open up more of them.    President Steel is the director of the Steel Company, the  electric saw manufacturer that has 30 percent share of the  entire world market, and was elected president of the German  Federal Chamber of Commerce in 1988.</p>

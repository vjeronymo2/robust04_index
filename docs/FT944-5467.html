			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / International Company News: NKK revises cuts to steel workforce NKK, the Japanese steelmaker, is now to cut steel jobs by 4,200 to 10,500 and costs by Y200bn (Dollars 2bn) by March 1997, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The figures are upward revisions of targets NKK announced in March this year, NKK said. NKK, second in crude steel production in Japan after Nippon Steel, was hit by Japan's prolonged economic slump. In November, it posted a parent current loss of Y37.91bn yen in the six months to September 30 1994. It then said it would cut steel jobs by 3,300 by the end of March 1997 from 14,700 in March 1993 and would cut costs by Y175bn. The revised cuts will be realised by streamlining production at two steelworks in Japan.</p>

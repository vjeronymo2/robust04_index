Increasingly, PCs are  coming equipped with special sound chips that alow them to "talk," provide  special sound effects for games and even play music on compact discs. Compact  discs will also become a more popular form of storing data. Erasable optical  discs are also expected to hit the market for the first time in 1989.  </P> <P> Personal computers will also increasingly use the Unix operating system, a  sophisticated software base developed nearly two decades ago in the  laboratories of AT&amp;T. Until the last couple of years, Unix had been used  primarily on large computer systems, but with the increasing power of  microprocessors, the PC is now able to take full advantage of this complex and  powerful system.  </P> <P> This year is also expected to see the arrival of portable digital audio tape  players from Japan, where they are already extremely popular. Cellular  telephones are expected to be one of the most popular consumer electronics  items in 1989. Experts expect them to drop significantly in both price and  size. CARLA LAZZARESCHI  </P></p>

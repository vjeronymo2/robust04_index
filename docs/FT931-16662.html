			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Wrapping shrinks in Germany Excessive packaging of consumer goods sold in Germany has largely disappeared since an anti-rubbish law came into force last April 1, Mr Klaus Topfer, environment minister, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Bonn. Under the law, shoppers unhappy with packaging added to make goods more attractive can take the wrapping off in the shop and dump it there to be picked up by the manufacturers. Nearly three quarters of all German drinks were now sold in reusable containers, a slight increase over the last year, Mr Topfer said.</p>

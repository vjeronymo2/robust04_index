			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: MY INDIA BY JIM CORBETT (OXFORD: $8.95)  </P> <P> Jim Corbett served as a colonial administrator in northern India during the  1940s, up to the time of India's independence and partition.  </P> <P> The sketches in this volume of memoirs focus on his efforts to help the  peasants in their struggles with poverty, disease, robbers, bureaucracy and  wild animals (including the requisite man-eating tigers). Although Corbett  writes with obviously sincere affection about "my friends, the poor of India,"  he patronizes them furiously: Secure in his status as a lord of the Earth, he  surveys the humble and meek from his lofty vantage point. A curious souvenir of  the final days of the British Raj.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTERN ATHLETIC;  </P> <P> WYOMING IS 8-0 AFTER WIN OVER STUBBORN WEBER STATE  </P> <P> Unbeaten Wyoming has the most victories in the nation, but stubborn Weber State  made earning that honor tougher than expected Saturday in a nonconference game  at Laramie, Wyo.  </P> <P> Tom Corontzos passed for two touchdowns and Dwight Driver rushed for 105 yards  and a touchdown as the No. 21 Cowboys held off Weber State, 21-12, to improve  to 8-0.  </P> <P> Weber State (4-4), an NCAA Division I-AA school, outgained the Cowboys, 427  yards to 347.  </P> <P> "We didn't play like we should play with a record like ours," Wyoming Coach  Paul Roach said. "We thought we were going to be capable enough to dominate  this game and we didn't. I have an empty feeling."  </P> <P> Wyoming led only 7-6 at halftime and didn't put the game away until Corontzos,  who completed 17 of 31 passes for 206 yards, connected with Robert Rivers on a  29-yard touchdown pass play with 1:30 left.  </P> <P> Utah 37, Texas El Paso 23 -- Mike Richmond came off the bench and passed for  three touchdowns to lead the Utes in a Western Athletic Conference game at Salt  Lake City.  </P> <P> Utah, 3-4 overall and 1-3 in the WAC, snapped a four-game losing streak.  </P> <P> UTEP (3-5, 1-4) led 16-13 midway through the third quarter before Utah scored  24 consecutive points.  </P> <P> Colorado State 47, New Mexico 7 -- The Rams generated a school-record 607 yards  in offense and cruised in a WAC game at Fort Collins, Colo.  </P> <P> Tony Alford rushed for 116 yards and scored two touchdowns and Todd Yert scored  three touchdowns as the Rams (5-3, 4-1) broke their old total offense mark of  583 yards, set against Texas El Paso in 1978.  </P> <P> New Mexico (2-6, 1-2), which absorbed its 20th consecutive WAC road loss, had  entered the game ranked 19th in the nation in run defense, yielding only 109.7  yards per game. But the Rams ripped through that defense for 348 yards on the  ground.  </P></p>

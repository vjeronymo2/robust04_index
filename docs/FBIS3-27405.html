			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Liang Guihe (2733 6311 0735)] </F>   [Text] Paris, 16 Feb (XINHUA) -- During an interview with  a Xinhua News Agency reporter today, French Senate President  Rene Monory pointed out: As permanent members of the UN  Security Council, France and China should continue to coordinate  their actions in political affairs. The two countries are  highly supplementary to each other in economic activities,  science and technology, and culture. They should keep  developing in-depth, equal, mutually beneficial, and friendly  cooperation.    Senate President Monory is scheduled to arrive in China on  22  February for a formal, friendly visit at the invitation of Qiao  Shi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's  Congress. He will be the first French Senate president to visit  China since the two countries established diplomatic ties 30  years ago. Monory told the reporter that, during his visit, he  will meet with Chinese leaders for discussions on ways to  improve and strengthen political, economic, cultural, and  scientific and technological cooperation between the two  countries.    Monory expressed admiration of the success China has  achieved  in economic construction. He said: China is a big country with  a population of more than 1 billion. The economy enjoys very  rapid development at an annual growth rate of more than 10  percent. He continued: "It is a major event to which people  cannot but attach importance." "Everyone in Europe and  particularly in France is talking about China now."    Touching on relations between the two countries, Monory  said:  In the past few months, the French Government issued several  statements, "unequivocally" guaranteeing that France will no  longer sell arms to Taiwan. "It clearly indicates that the  French Government is willing to develop friendly economic and  political relations with China." He continued: "I completely  agree with the Government's stand" on the issue. He said that  the main purpose of his visit to China is to further improve and  promote friendly Sino-French cooperation. He stressed that, as  a major country in Western Europe, France should play an active  role in promoting the development of political and economic  relations between China and Western Europe.    Monory held: The potential for France and China to expand  cooperation is tremendous. The two countries are highly  supplementary to each other in economic cooperation and trade.  China's rapid economic development is in the interests of  Europe. He maintained: The development of economic and  technical cooperation between the two countries should not be  limited to only large enterprises and large construction  projects. They should bring into full play the role of medium  and small-sized enterprises and strengthen exchanges between  provinces and municipalities. France may take advantage of its  scientific and technological superiority to participate in  China's economic development.    In his capacity as minister of national education, Monory  visited China in 1988. Looking back on the visit, he said that,  during his meeting with Li Peng and other Chinese leaders then,  they focused discussions on developing cooperation between the  two countries in culture, education, and personnel training. He  said long-term friendship should be established between France  and China, and bilateral cooperation should be expanded to all  fields of endeavor.</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures And Options Trading THE overnight fall in Tokyo, together with reports pointing to a gloomy outlook for the UK economy, produced a dull day's trading in the derivatives market, writes Joel Kibazo. In stock index futures, the September contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,608, which proved to be the day's high point, for September went into retreat thereafter, sending the underlying cash market lower. With dealers remaining on the sidelines, September continued to decline in the morning on very light volume, and figures showing a narrowing of the UK's trade gap for May had no effect on trading. While the early afternoon saw September continue to drift lower, the poor opening on Wall Street caused further falls in the contract and by 3.30pm September had fallen to 2,580. September ended at 2,578, down 49 from the previous session's close and below its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 35. Turnover at the official close was a very poor 5,580 lots. In traded options, volume was also dull, reaching only 24,842 contracts. The FT-SE option saw 12,014 contracts transacted. Midland Bank led the league table of the day's best performing stock options. It traded a total of 1,785 contracts, with the June 420 calls particularly busy.</p>

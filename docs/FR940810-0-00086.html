			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, where the employer cannot demonstrate that a Class I job is likely not to overexpose employees, the employer must ventilate the regulated area to move contaminated air away from employee breathing zones.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (g)(5) sets out five listed control methods which OSHA has evaluated during this rulemaking. The Agency finds that using these methods pursuant to the limitations and specifications in the paragraph is likely to effectively control employee exposures when performing Class I work. The first control system listed for Class I work is the Negative Pressure Enclosure System (or NPE). The extent to which OSHA should require these systems for major asbestos work was a remanded issue. As discussed in detail below, OSHA has found that NPEs, when constructed and used according to the criteria in this standard, can be effective in protecting employees within and outside the enclosure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other listed systems also may be used for Class I work under stated limitations. Paragraph (g)(5) sets out these limitations. These systems are: glove bag systems, negative-pressure glove bag systems, negative pressure glove box systems, the water spray process system, and a mini-enclosure system. OSHA emphasizes the use of the term ``system.'' Each method consists of tangible materials and devices; and of procedures and practices. All the listed elements must be complied with before OSHA's finding of effectiveness are relevant. Other, unspecified control methods, ``alternative control methods,'' may be used if additional notification is given OSHA, and if a specially trained ``project designer'' or a certified industrial hygienist certifies that the controls will be protective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participants in this rulemaking requested that OSHA's revisions allow alternative systems. OSHA agrees that asbestos removal technology is evolving. If another control method is used, or if a listed control method is ``modified,'' the standard requires that a certified industrial hygienist or licensed professional engineer who is also qualified as a project designer certify the control method using the criteria set out in the regulatory text. Additional discussion of these issues is found later in this document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Specific Issues Relating to Methods of Compliance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. A major issue in this proceeding is when NPEs should be required. In the 1990 proposal OSHA would have required the erection of negative pressure enclosures for all asbestos removal jobs, except for ``small scale short duration work.'' This proposal responded to the Court's order for OSHA to clarify the conditions under which negative pressure enclosures were required in the 1986 standard (see discussion on Issue  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The major rationale in the 1986 standard for requiring negative pressure enclosures was to ensure that contamination from large-scale asbestos projects did not spread beyond the work area. OSHA there stated that ``general contamination of the workplace has resulted from failure to confine asbestos using strict regulated area procedures, and asbestos-related diseases have been found in workers of a different trade exposed to asbestos contamination from the activities of asbestos workers.'' (55 FR at 29716). The effectiveness of NPEs in protecting employees working within the enclosure was not the explicit basis for their adoption in the 1986 rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the 1990 proposal, OSHA primarily based the requirement for universal NPEs for major asbestos work on limited data relating to contamination of workspaces adjacent to asbestos work, and reports of historic disease experienced by employers in trades other than asbestos work who worked alongside asbestos workers. OSHA stated however, that the Agency ``has not been able to estimate the risk to bystander employees *&blank;*&blank;*'' and asked for comment and data on their exposure (55 FR 29716). OSHA also asked for information about alternatives to work in full containment, such as glove bag and box systems and ``new technologies'' (55 FR 29717). Although OSHA proposed more tightly drawn exemptions to the required use of negative pressure enclosures, the Agency also raised the possibility that data to be submitted about alternative control systems might result in a limitation, rather than an expansion of the walk-in enclosure requirements (55 FR 29720).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

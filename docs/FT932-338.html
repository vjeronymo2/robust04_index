			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / International Company News: Eastern Sugar buys stake in Slovakian beet refiner EASTERN Sugar, a joint venture between Tate &amp; Lyle, the UK-based sugar and sweeteners group, and Generale Sucriere of France, has bought a 51 per cent stake in Juhocukor, a Slovakian beet sugar refiner. Eastern Sugar already holds a 34.6 per cent stake in Kabai Cukorgyar, a Hungarian sugar beet processor. The joint venture will invest 441m Slovakian crowns (Dollars 14.8m) in Juhocukor over four years, partly in cash and partly through a technology deal. This will include subscribing to an increase in share capital, taking Eastern Sugar's stake to 66 per cent. The remaining shares in Juhocukor are held by investment funds and individuals. Juhocukor produces 30,000 tonnes of sugar a year, compared to consumption in the Slovak Republic of up to 200,000 tonnes a year. The country produces about 150,000 tonnes and imports the balance from the Czech Republic. Generale Sucriere is a subsidiary of Saint-Louis, the French food and paper group. See Lex</p>

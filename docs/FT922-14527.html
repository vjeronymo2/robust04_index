			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Election 1992: SNP fails to bridge gap LABOUR has retained a commanding lead over the Scottish National party in Scotland, according to two weekend opinion polls. These contradicted a poll last week showing a narrowing of the gap between the two parties. Mori in The Sunday Times newspaper put Labour on 44 per cent and Market Research Scotland put the party on 43 per cent, in line with the findings of most polls since the campaign began. Backing for the SNP was 27 per cent in the MRS poll and only 23 per cent in the Mori survey. The Conservatives were on 21 per cent in the Mori poll and 18 per cent according to MRS.</p>

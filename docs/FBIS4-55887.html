			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Zbigniew Grzegorzewski: "The Medicine of </F> Commercialization; There Will Be Fewer Disputes Among Chiefs of  Economic Ministries; Position of Managers of Deficit-Stricken  Enterprises Will Be Weakened"]    [Text]By the end of 1998, there will be no more  state-owned enterprises in Poland -- such is supposed to be the  result of a government-adopted commercialization program. The  Ministry of Ownership Transformations [MPW] will gain in  importance -- it will no longer have to listen to what  foundation organs [organy zalozycielskie] have to say.    The most important part about the commercialization program  is that a shape of the ultimate, future model of the Polish  economy has been defined with some precision. For the first  time, the program suggests separating the flow of revenue from  income. Revenue from privatization would go not just to the  state budget. A restructuring path is to be established in  industries, supervised not by the state administration, but a  trust agency based on commercial principles. And that is more  important than the fact that state-owned enterprises -- through  commercialization -- will be transformed into Treasury-owned  joint-stock companies [JSSP].    There are still about 5,300 state-owned enterprises, but not  all of them are to be covered by the commercialization. Small  enterprises will be excluded, due to the cost of such a  transformation -- they are supposed to be simply sold as soon as  possible.  <H5>  Not for the Weak Ones </H5>   What is more important, the commercialization will not cover  those enterprises whose funds are negative (or at zero level) as  it is impossible to establish a company in which the capital  would not be effectively covered -- this would be against the  Code of Commerce.    The program clearly suggests -- even though it happens  through dispersed provisions -- that enterprises will no longer  be so easily bypassed by bankruptcy proceedings. According to  the changes being proposed, notions of a mandatory and  non-mandatory bankruptcy will appear in the law on state-owned  enterprises. The mandatory type of bankruptcy is supposed to  take place when the value of the property being given away for  usage exceeds half the financial resources of the enterprise.  It means more radical policies toward those companies that have  reported profit, not through production, but through the leasing  of national wealth.  <H5>  Managers, Beware! </H5>   An attempt to have the enterprises financially disciplined  is  also demonstrated by the proposal that foundation organs be  empowered to recall those managers who conduct irrational  policies, and also -- perhaps even more important -- those who  resist declaring bankruptcy.    MPW's position would also be stronger as a decision on  commercialization could be undertaken without the consent of the  enterprise's organs, and even without the consent of the  foundation organ. If this were to be implemented, the recent  dispute between Ministers Kaczmarek and Pol (and two other  ministry chiefs) would not happen again; the dispute created a  danger that privatization might go in different directions,  depending on the ministries' policies.    Instead of collecting a capital tax (so-called interest  rates  on JSSP's capital) which is completely detached from company  profit, the State Treasury is supposed to derive income from  dividends on profit. The dividends for the budget would be  divided (it is not known yet in what ratios). A part of them  should be reinvested, and destined for a restructuring of  JSSP's. That should not be dealt with by MPW, but by agencies  operating on commercial principles.    When it comes to enterprises, the decision on whether to  accept the commercialization program could be determined by the  proposition that the enterprises be able to decrease their  initiation capital by the value of redundant property, and then  to just bear the cost of securing the property. But at another  point, it is mentioned that a transfer of redundant property to  the State Treasury will be possible. May it be only in those  cases where the State Treasury will think that it may somehow  use the property, otherwise the taxpayers will feel the impact.    Only after deliberating on these consequences of a massive  commercialization, can one mention the obvious: In developed  market economies, there are no state-owned enterprises (with  employee boards), but there are instead companies based on the  Law of Commerce, and these may even have the state as the main  shareholder.    Commercialization may also turn out a job offer for  managers,  since MPW has to come up with 14,500 candidates for filling up  the posts on the supervisory boards of about 4,000 companies,</p>

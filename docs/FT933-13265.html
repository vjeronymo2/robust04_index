			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Share price plunge greets UK Land reconstruction THE STOCK market expressed disquiet yesterday at the reconstruction plan announced over the weekend by UK Land. From last Friday's price of 30p the shares were marked down to 4p. UKL said reconstruction would provide a 'sound financial base' from which it could maximise revenues from the Elephant &amp; Castle shopping centre in London, its main asset, and subsequently seek property acquisitions. With a deficit of shareholders' funds at March 31 1992 of Pounds 31.9m, the alternatives were insolvent liquidation, administration or receivership. In addition to the capital reconstruction, backed by its secured banking creditors, UKL is raising Pounds 256,000 to meet that expense through a fully underwritten rights offer. Every 22 existing ordinary shares will be consolidated into one ordinary of 5p and one deferred of 545p - the latter will later be cancelled. A total of 5m new ordinaries, or 64.44 per cent of the new capital, will be issued to creditors. Lloyds Bank will be issued 2m, a syndicate of banks will get 2.35m in respect of their secured advances, and unsecured creditors under a company voluntary arrangement will be issued 650,000. An open offer of 2.56m shares at 10p each (33 per cent of the capital) will be made to shareholders on the basis of 13-for-1. A holder with 1,100 shares would receive 50 new shares from the consolidation and be able to subscribe for 650. Lloyds will also be allotted Pounds 250,000 of 10 per cent convertible secured loan 2003, convertible into 1.84m shares, unless that pushed its holding to more than 29.9 per cent of UKL voting capital. The issued capital will be 7.76m shares, or 9.6m on a diluted basis. Mr James Grace and Mr Christopher Woodhouse, who are sub-underwriters, will join the board. The existing facility from Bank of Scotland will be converted into a Pounds 9m term loan, repayable 1998-2003, and a Pounds 2.3m overdraft, reducing over the five years to April 1988. Lloyds and the syndicate banks may require Lillybrook, the underwriter, to purchase up to 2m shares of their entitlement at 10p each. Lillybrook is controlled by Mr Colin Tett, chairman of UKL.</p>

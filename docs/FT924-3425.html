			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / US troops due in Somalia tomorrow TWO American F-14 fighter jets flew low over the Somali capital Mogadishu yesterday, giving anxious Somalis their first glimpse of the US military force poised to land in Mogadishu tomorrow to protect relief efforts. The reconnaissance came on a day when 48 people were killed and 50 were wounded in fierce clashes yesterday between rival Somali clans vying for control of Baidoa before US troops arrive. The clashes involved rival families apparently struggling for control of the famine-hit town. Two hours after the F-14s had flown over Mogadishu, Mr Robert Oakley, US ambassador-at-large, and Marine Brigadier General Frank Libutti flew into the city to liaise between US force commanders, relief agencies and Somalia's warlords on the American-led multinational intervention which is expected to number 28,000 to 36,000 troops by Christmas. 'This is a humanitarian operation, not a military operation. It is the opposite of Desert Storm,' in which US-led troops retook Kuwait, Mr Oakley said after meeting aid agencies. 'We hope it will remain a humanitarian operation,' he added. The final contingent of an advance party of 1,800-2,000 US marines and western correspondents completed its transfer last night from the Lt Jack Lumus to the USS Tripoli, a helicopter assault ship which is part of the US flotilla of five ships lying 30km off the Somali coast. The Lt Jack Lumus, a supply ship, also had a number of M1A1 Abrams tanks on board. An expeditionary French force coming from neighbouring Djibouti may land at first light today either at Mogadishu airport or in the southern port city of Kismayo, scene of some of the worst inter-clan violence. France yesterday appointed Marine General Rene Belhome to lead the 2,000-strong force. Mr Pierre Joxe, the French defence minister, has said the French force will secure Kismayo and be the first troops to land on Somali soil. France will also supply helicopters and aircraft. In Mogadishu yesterday secret police operating under the authority of General Mohamed Farar Aideed, Somalia's fiercest warlord, seized an Italian water expert working with Unicef, the United Nations children's agency. He had not been released by evening. Aid workers have suffered constant harassment and intimidation by Gen Aideed's forces for several months. As the two aircraft from the USS Ranger carrier dropped flares, excitement spread rapidly across the city. Somalis poured out of their houses and looked to the sky in expectation of an imminent landing. Hundreds flocked towards the airport where US troops are expected to land, shouting: 'America  -come America.' Heavy weaponry and armoured trucks with mounted anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons were meanwhile being moved out of the city. Mr Dick Cheney, the US defence secretary, has said US forces will disarm the gunmen and marauding gangs which have terrorised Somalia for two years and prevented western food aid from reaching the starving.

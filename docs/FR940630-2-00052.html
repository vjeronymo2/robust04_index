These new regulatory fees, which are likely to change each fiscal year, will be used to offset costs associated with the Commission's enforcement, public service, international and policy and rulemaking activities. The new fees are in addition to any application processing fees associated with obtaining a license or other authorization from the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=3 --> When Fees Will Be Due <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> All Space Station and Earth Station licensees must remit their regulatory fees to the Commission by August 19, 1994, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in order to avoid a 25% late penalty: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> FCC Form 159 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory fee payments  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> must <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  be accompanied by FCC Form 159 (``FCC Remittance Advice'').

We recognize the benefits to be gained by all the parties involved. Notwithstanding the published schedule of payment due dates, consolidation of 100 or more regulatory fees due from different entities by a single payee will be due on  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> September 2, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Entities participating in such consolidated payment arrangements that are eligible, and choose, to pay by installment, should pay one-half of the regulatory fee eligible for installment payment by September 2, 1994.

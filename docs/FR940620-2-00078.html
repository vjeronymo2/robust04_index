			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Each Fund, by participating in the proposed Joint Account as proposed to be modified, and the Advisers, by administering the proposed Joint Account, could be deemed to be ``joint participants'' in a transaction within the meaning of section 17(d), and the proposed Joint Account could be deemed to be a ``joint enterprise or other joint arrangement'' within the meaning of rule 17d&hyph;1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Applicants believe that the proposed method of operating the Joint Account will not result in any conflicts of interest between any of the Funds or between a Fund and its Adviser. Although the Adviser will gain some benefit through administrative convenience and a possible reduction in clerical costs, the primary beneficiaries will be the Funds because the Joint Account will be a more efficient way of administering these investment transactions. Applicants believe that the operation of the Joint Account will be free of any inherent bias favoring one Fund over another. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Applicants further believe that future participation in the Joint Account by one or more Funds which do not presently exist or are not presently advised by an Adviser would be desirable without the necessity of applying for an amendment to the requested order. Applicants represent that additional Funds will be permitted to participate in the Joint Account only on the same terms and conditions as the existing Funds have set forth herein. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Existing Funds have received the Prior Order from the SEC permitting the operation of the existing Joint Account with respect to repurchase agreements with a maximum maturity of seven days and commercial paper and U.S. Government Securities with maximum remaining maturities of 30 days. Applicants submit that the proposed amendment to the Prior Order is consistent with the findings required by section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d&hyph;1 thereunder for granting orders pursuant to rule 17d&hyph;1, including the finding that any Fund would participate in the Joint Account on a basis no different from or less advantageous than that of any other Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Joint Account will operate subject to the following conditions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Each Fund will transfer into the Joint Account the cash it wishes to invest through the Joint Account after the calculation of its daily cash available for investment and will specifically indicate whether the cash is to be used to purchase commercial paper, Tax-Exempt Securities, repurchase agreements, or U.S. Government Securities. The Joint Account will not be distinguishable from any other accounts maintained by a Fund with its custodian bank except that monies from a Fund will be deposited on a commingled basis. The Joint Account will not have any separate existence which will have indicia of a separate legal entity. The sole function of the Joint Account will be to provide a convenient way of aggregating individual transactions which would otherwise require management by each Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Cash contributed by a Fund to the Joint Account will be invested in one or more of the following, as directed by the Fund: (1) Interest bearing or discounted commercial paper with a remaining maturity not to exceed 60 days; (2) repurchase agreements, with maturities not to exceed 60 days, ``collateralized fully,'' as that term is defined in rule 2a&hyph;7 under the Act, by U.S. Government Securities; (3) U.S. Government Securities with remaining maturities of up to 30 days or one month; (4) VRDNs that have demand features providing for maturities of up to 30 days or one month; or (5) securities other than VRDNs exempt from federal and/or state income tax with remaining maturities of up to 60 days. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Any investment made by a Fund or Funds through the Joint Account will satisfy the investment criteria of all Funds participating in that investment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. All investments held by a Fund or Funds through the Joint Account will be valued on the basis of amortized cost to the extent permitted by applicable Commission release, rule, or order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Each Fund valuing its net assets in reliance upon rule 2a&hyph;7 under the Act will use the average maturity of the instrument(s) in the Joint Account in which such Fund has an interest (determined on a dollar weighted basis) for the purpose of computing the Fund's average portfolio maturity with respect to the portion of its assets held in the Joint Account on that day. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. In order to assure that there will be no opportunity for one Fund to use any part of a balance of the Joint Account credited to another Fund, no Fund will be allowed to create a negative balance in the Joint Account for any reason. A Fund's decision to invest through the Joint Account will be solely at the Fund's option. No Fund will be obligated to invest through the Joint Account or maintain any minimum balance therein. In addition, each Fund will retain the sole rights of ownership of any of its assets held through the Joint Account, including interest payable on such assets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The Adviser and the custodian of each Fund will maintain records (in conformity with section 31 of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) documenting, for any given day, each Fund's aggregate investment in the Joint Account and each Fund's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  share of each Short-Term Investment made through the Joint Account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Not every Fund participating in the Joint Account will necessarily have its cash invested in every Short-Term Investment held in the Joint Account. However, to the extent a Fund's cash is applied to a particular Short-Term Investment made through the Joint Account, the Fund will participate in and own a proportionate share of such investment, and the income earned or accrued thereon, based upon the percentage of such investment purchased with monies contributed by the Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Exercises in the East?"] </F>   [Text] A controversy on security policy has broken out  between the governments in Bonn and London. Britain would like  to transfer several units of its Rhine Army to eastern Germany  for exercises. Last week, the Foreign Ministry categorically  rejected Britain's request. The background lies in disputes  about the Two-Plus-Four Agreement on German unity. Under that  agreement, all of Germany will be counted as NATO area once the  Russians have pulled out. However, the agreement stipulates that  "foreign armed forces" would "neither be deployed in nor  transferred to" the former GDR. In 1990, the allies agreed with  the two German states to leave it to the united Germans to  interpret the term "transfer." The British request has  maneuvered Bonn into a dilemma. The Russian Government might  regard the authorization of Rhine Army exercises in eastern  Germany as an affront and slow down the faster-than-planned  troop withdrawal. Yet, Bonn does not want to put off the  British either, which is why the Federal Government is playing  for time at the moment.</p>

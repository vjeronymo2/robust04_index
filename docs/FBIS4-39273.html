			<p>BFN     [Text] A National Council for Television and Radio has been  set up in Ukraine in accordance with a decree by Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk.    The presidential and government press office told  INTERFAX-Ukraine that the council had the right to suspend the  activities of television and radio broadcasting stations which  violate Ukraine's legislation and annul their broadcasting  licences.    The council will be subordinate directly to the Ukrainian  Supreme Soviet.    Among other functions entrusted to the council, there are  granting licences for using broadcasting channels and control  over the use of the private band.    According to the decree, the council will pursue state  policy  in the field of television and radio broadcasting regardless of  the stations' form of property and supervise the implementation  of the law on mass media.</p>

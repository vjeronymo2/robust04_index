			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- Many calcium silicate  brick houses are under construction in Korea.    In recent years alone, more than 400 rural villages of  calcium silicate brick houses have made their appearance in some  120 cities, counties and ri. Dwelling houses for more than  35,000 families have been built in these villages.    Houses of this type are very convenient for rural life. Each  flat has a floor space of 90 to 120 square metres.    Cooking and heating are done by methane gas at the dwelling  houses in many rural villages including Yongjin-ri, Kaechon City.    The construction of calcium silicate brick houses in Korea  began at the end of the 1980s.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, always paying deep  attention to the betterment of the people's living, saw to it  that calcium silicate brick production bases were built in Anju,  Pihyon and Hamhung to more satisfactorily meet the increasing  needs for dwelling houses, and wisely led their construction.  Thus, the construction of calcium silicate brick factories with  a total production capacity of 1,000 million bricks was  completed successfully in two years.    Comrade Kim Chong-il saw designs of calcium silicate brick  houses in May, 1986. Saying it was the wish of the great leader  President Kim Il-song and his own determination to enable all  the people to live in such good houses, he stressed that such  houses should be built on an extensive basis in Pyongyang and  local cities and rural villages.    As a result, peculiar dwelling houses have appeared in  Pyongyang and provincial, city and county seats and rural  villages.</p>

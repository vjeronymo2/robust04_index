			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Oleksandr Stoyan by Oleh Husev under the </F> rubric "In the Parties and Movements": "O. Stoyan: "There is No  Need to Serve an Overseas Uncle...," with subsequent commentary  from O. Sheykin presented by commentator Volodymyr Skachko under  the rubric "In Place of Commentary": "It is True--It is Time to  Be Concerned About People"]    [Text] The editors received copies of letters the  other day whose content evoked great astonishment and a desire  to comment on them. Which the chairman of the Federation of  Trade Unions of Ukraine (FPU), Oleksandr Stoyan, agreed to do.    It is not so much a matter of some unusual appeals of  the "dear brother" type as it is, first and foremost, the  content of the letters. We are talking about the letter of the  leader of the Solidarity Trade Unions of Ukraine, O. Sheykin, to  the president of the American trade unions, Lane Kirkland, whom  the author asks to "organize a boycott and halt all ties of the  United States at all levels with the reactionary leadership of  Ukraine." The motivation for the letter is a simple one--it is  the author's idea that there is no democracy in Ukraine, there  are no guarantees of the rights of the workers, and the  independent trade-union movement continues to be oppressed.    The floor then to O. Stoyan:    [O. Stoyan] As you see, the reproaches directed toward  Ukraine and its trade unions are quite serious.    [O. Husev] Are concrete cases known to you of violence,  arrests, murders or attempts at the physical annihilation of the  leaders of trade unions?    [O. Stoyan] They are not. If they were to happen, then  doubtlessly we would come to the aid of representatives of all  union groups to fight them at the level of the FPU.    I recall in this connection an incident with the president  of  the Association of Trade Unions of Flight Personnel, V.  Bulashov, that arose under unclear circumstances. The FPU  allocated funds for the funeral of the trade-union leader.    [O. Husev] A few words, if you would, on the relations of  the  FPU with the newly created trade-union organizations.    [O. Stoyan] We are doing everything in principle so that our  relations are of a normal, businesslike nature. We feel that the  path of confrontation with the new trade unions is not  promising. The federation has to reach a general rate agreement  with the government for 1994, and draw up a declaration in  mutual actions aimed at the building of a sovereign Ukraine,  with their participation.    These new creations, however, have lately begun to act  against us without any restraints--moral or legal. Here is the  recent declaration of Oleksandr Mryl regarding the creation of  the Free Trade Unions of Ukraine. The professional associations  of engineers, aviators, and the Solidarity trade unions, among  others, are part of it. Their size is not more than a hundred  thousand members. The first thing that the chairman of their  executive committee does is to draw up a letter to the FPU with  the proposal to allocate in Kiev, at the Trade Union Hall,  accommodations with an area of no less than 580 square meters  for its commissions and departments. It must be said that there  are 40 sector committees at the republic level located in that  building, and each of them unites considerably more members than  the new created trade unions all together. And, I emphasize,  have more rights accordingly, especially since they paid a great  deal of funds for the very construction of the union hall. The  Independent Trade Union of Miners, by the way, had already been  allotted accommodations there. But it has been leased out, which  is improper in principle.    We know that a citizen of the United States is working in  that office, who devotes a great deal of her work time--as can  be seen from telephone bills--to conversations with North  America and Great Britain.    Also surprising is the fact that O. Mryl is demanding the  granting of accommodations for the union of miners in the center  of Kiev and not in the Donbass, not at the place where most of  the mines are located and, by the way, the trade union of  workers in the coal industry of Ukraine, uniting over a million  members, operates. I cannot fail to mention the tone of  ultimatum in the letter of O. Mryl, where he says in particular  that "I ask you to address very seriously the question of  allocating to the Free Trade Unions of Ukraine the spaces  necessary for their work in the Hall of Trade Unions, and not to  instigate our member organizations to decisive acts in reply to  your possibly poorly thought-out decision."    Tell me, is it possible to work with this author in a  fruitful and good-hearted manner after such a letter?    And more. Reading the appeal of the newly created trade  unions to the American Federation of Labor and Congress of  Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), I cannot help but be  surprised at the very fact of its appearance. The so-called Free  Trade Unions of Ukraine, having absolutely no grounds to speak  of any pressure or persecution in Ukraine, are however calling  on the president and government of the United States for  sanctions of a political and economic nature against Ukraine,  whose citizens they are, not even stopping short of a boycott of  it. I would like to ask whether our own or foreign trade unions  permit themselves that? And is that a pluralism of ideas? Hardly.    I understand that there could be differing views within the  FPU and in the newly created associations on the nature of the  actions of the state authorities, but their aim is a common  one--to bring benefit to Ukraine. We have something else in  practice. While the FPU is conducting systematic negotiations  with the government with regard to improving the life of all of  Ukraine, the newly created trade associations often are  concerned only for concessions for certain categories of  workers, winning them for themselves at the expense of others.  Recall that the FPU has in recent months proclaimed a pre-strike  situation, and posed the question to the next session of the  Supreme Soviet of the abrogation of the penalties for  enterprises that are operating normally, of a rise in the level  of minimum wages and pensions, and other questions of social  protections for the population. The newly created trade unions,  in their appeals across the ocean, are posing the question of  undermining the foundations of our state--our own citizens are  appealing to the United States to organize a boycott against  Ukraine. That is, to wage political and economic blackmail.    [O. Husev] I would like to hear your thoughts regarding the  fact, as KYEVSKYYE VEDOMOSTY has reported, that a flag was  raised over the Capitol in the United States in honor of the  Kiev engineer Semen Karykov, the chairman of the Free Trade  Union of Railroad Engineers of Ukraine.    [O. Stoyan] I know and will answer thus: what would you  journalists have written if a flag was raised over the building  where the President of Ukraine works, say, in honor of the  chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions of Ukraine? Take your  time to answer--I can envisage such reporting to the last  detail, and even its key words: "The FPU are trade unions that  serve the president!"    The question arises, "So just what merits the raising of the  national flag of the United States over the Capitol in  Washington in honor of Karykov?" I will cite the reasons, for  they really do exist; in the summer of 1992, an engineers'  strike paralyzed the harvest in southern Ukraine, posing demands  of essentially their own--on the whole, small--group of people.  The miners were leaving the face with the same demands--raise  wages only for them; at the beginning of the summer of 1993, the  Independent Trade Union of Miners once again organized a strike.  Ukraine once again loses billions of karbovantsi in it. The  engineers stop transport once again... Can we really act only in  the interests of a comparatively small group of people in the  future as well? I am sure that we cannot, since that would be  both unfair and costly for the economy of the whole country.    Perhaps it is for these services that they raise the  American  flag in honor of a citizen of Ukraine? Not such a high honor,  really.    There is another aspect of the problem--I have in my hand  material from the new trade union associations, in which it is  indicated without the slightest shame that they were printed on  equipment that was given to them by the Americans--the AFL-CIO.  Is that not real interference by one country in the affairs of  another? And can we even talk about any real independence of  these "independent trade unions of Ukraine" in that case? The  AFL-CIO is the same group of trade unions that has been bought  by the American government. They are naturally trying to pursue  this policy with us among those who call themselves  representatives of the independent trade unions of Ukraine;  making use of the latter, the government across the ocean is  causing harm to Ukraine, the consequences of which are difficult  to overestimate.    [O. Husev] It would be interesting, Oleksandr Mykolayovych,  to know your thoughts about the copy of another letter by the  same author addressed to U.S. President B. Clinton, in which he  asks the addressee to stop giving Ukraine assistance until its  leaders take "concrete steps in the direction of developing  democracy..."    [O. Stoyan] I will not elucidate once again the level of  veracity, but I will gladly talk about the last paragraph. Does  it really become patriots--among which O. Sheykin, I think,  counts himself--to appeal to the leader of another country to  exert influence "on the government and President of Ukraine,"  demanding a halt to assistance that is being allotted to Ukraine  today? That is the same as trying to throw the noose around the  neck of one's own mother.  <H6>  It is True--It is Time to Be Concerned About People </H6>   Insofar as the interview with O. Stoyan is very similar  to a "critique" within the trade unions, with accusations that  opponents are trying to "throw the noose around the neck of  one's own mother," I asked for comments from the chairman of the  Solidarity Trade Unions of Ukraine, O. Sheykin. And here is what  I heard from him.    "Yes, we wrote the letters cited, but I have to say that we  were forced to do so by the overall situation in Ukraine, cases  of repressions against the free trade unions, against other  democratic movements and the mass media. The convicted Kharkiv  journalist and member of the Solidarity Trade Unions Oleksandr  Volosov, who has been stripped of the right to engage in  journalism for a certain time, in particular. Vasyl Fedorenko,  the chairman of the Kiev organization of the Solidarity Trade  Unions, and Serhiy Klymenko, the chairman of the trade union of  taxi fleet workers, were arrested. Klymenko has been subjected  to reprisals in general for his attempt to post a trade-union  announcement. There are also other instances, more than 20,  while the employees of the law-enforcement bodies have been  displaying passivity.    "I can say with regard to the letters that the comments by  O.  Stoyan have shifted their focus somewhat. I did not demand that  assistance be halted overall, but asked only that assistance not  be given to a non-democratic Ukraine. I wrote in the letter to  President Clinton, "I earnestly request that you exert influence  on the government of Ukraine and the President of Ukraine so  that only the democratic development of Ukraine, guarantees of  the rights and freedoms of citizens, and economic reforms can  become the foundation for the development of ties between the  United States and Ukraine, and that the assistance that the  United States is giving to Ukraine today not go to strengthen a  totalitarian regime, but is rather temporarily halted until  concrete steps by Ukraine in the direction of the development of  democracy." The shift in focus seems to me somewhat reminiscent  of the dishonorable practices of 1937--they were looking for  "enemies of the people" then, too.    "I would also like to add that the Solidarity Trade Unions  are in favor of seeing that no political or public organization  makes use of the law-enforcement or state bodies to settle  accounts with political rivals."    So we have letters to America and comments on them. There is  something else that has escaped the attention of both  trade-union leaders, namely that there is no unity in the  trade-union movement in Ukraine today. And this is important for  our country--not only because the trade unions, protecting the  economic interests of the workers, are each doing this at their  own discretion, are pulling the blankets on themselves at the  expense of others, but also because the trade unions in Ukraine  today are a real political force, and not an instrument for the  protection of the socio-economic interests of people. This is a  continuation of Soviet times, when the trade unions were the  "school of communism" and had to serve as the instrument of a  certain ideological blunting of the workers, a political means  of turning them away from an organized workers' movement. This  feature of the Soviet trade unions was also manifested because  in Ukraine they were decisively in favor of the parliament  granting them the right of legislative initiative and were part  of various political acts.    The situation in Ukraine, to put it mildly, is of course  uncertain with respect to the productivity of the economic  changes and the effectiveness of democracy. Whatever the  politicians may say, the people are slipping into poverty, and  this is not the best background for democratic reformation and  for spiritual and cultural resurrection.    And yet in O. Sheykin's place I would not have appealed to  those "high" Americans not to assist today's Ukraine, and in O.  Stoyan's place I would have said as little as possible about  nooses. And not because I am some kind of Ukrainian  jingoist-patriot who wants to get fat off American assistance.  It will not help us, neither large nor small. First of all,  there are very many of us, and second, we, not pursuing economic  reforms owing to a lack of political will for it on the part of  our leadership, will devour it in short order.    But the trade unions still have a way out of this situation.  It seems to me that it consists of the fact that since our trade  unions already frequently come forward as a kind of political  parties formed along professional lines, since they are able to  organize the people, they have to unite and, relying on the  support of the people, jointly demand of the authorities that  they display political will and finally begin reforms. This  pertains to the President, who is obligated to propose to  parliament a government of reformers, and to parliament, which  should confirm that government, and to the government, which not  only has to propose a program of reforms, but also be able to  fulfill it. If everyone gets to work himself, if the economy is  revived, then the trade unions can fight not for a place in  parliament, but rather fulfill their traditional function of  protecting the people. As much as they write to Clinton, as much  as they talk about social protections, a barefoot person will  not rescue a naked person from cold and hunger...</p>

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Hurd in Kuwait for talks on Iraqi build-up Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, flew to Kuwait last night for talks with Gulf ministers and Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, on the build-up of Iraqi troops along the contested border between Kuwait and Iraq. Mr Hurd told the Conservative party conference in Bournemouth that he would fly to Saudi Arabia for further talks after meeting the foreign ministers of the Gulf Co-operation Council countries. Mr Hurd said that he and Mr Christopher had been invited to join the foreign ministers of the Gulf states 'to show our determination to protect the security of the Gulf'. He told delegates: 'We have to show Saddam Hussein that we are not going to be intimidated or divided. 'I will reassure our servicemen and our friends of the support and resolution of this government and this conference.' Mr Hurd said that the headquarters staff and leading company of Britain's 'spearhead' battalion of 800 troops would leave for the Gulf immediately because the situation remained 'confused'. He added: 'Our navy is offshore and we are doubling the number of Tornados patrolling the skies. We have to work further with our friends and allies to promote security and peace throughout the Middle East.' 'I am sorry and sad to miss the rest of this conference but I am sure I should be there,' he added to loud applause. Mr Hurd said that intelligence reports on the intentions of Saddam Hussein had not been clear. 'Obviously there has been a threat. There might be other threats. There is still a good deal of anxiety and that's why I think it's notable that the six Gulf foreign ministers have suggested that friends from outside should join them at their meeting tomorrow and I welcome that.' Mr Hurd said that Saddam was 'certainly playing a very dangerous game. We can't be sure what his next moves are. He says one thing, but he doesn't always do what he says.' The west had underestimated Saddam's 'boldness' in the Gulf war, he told BBC Radio 4. 'If he has been deterred this time, if he is drawing back, it is because President Clinton, Britain, France and others have been immediate and robust in saying he won't get away with it.' Mr Hurd dismissed speculation that the Western powers were considering a pre-emptive strike against Iraq. 'It is not being seriously considered at the moment. Our aim is defensive,' he said. Downing Street added last night that British deployments to the Gulf would go ahead because there was 'no concrete evidence' of Iraqi withdrawal.</p>

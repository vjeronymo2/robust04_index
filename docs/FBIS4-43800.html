			<p>BFN     [Text] The Dutch Defense Minister Relus ter Beek has said  he wants the UN Security Council decision to send a 5,500 strong  force of African troops to Rwanda to be given preference over  the French plan to send its own force to the African country.  Mr. ter Beek's statement follows talks between him and the UN  Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus Ghali in New York. Mr. ter  Beek said he was not opposed to the French plan, but he  preferred the option of a UN force because of the credibility  the UN has. The UN Security Council has just been meeting to  discuss the French plan to send a military force to Rwanda, but  no decision is expected until later today.</p>

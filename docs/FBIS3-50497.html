			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Lima, 31 Dec (NOTIMEX) -- Peruvian President  Alberto Fujimori today called on the Armed Forces to redouble  security measures in Lima and other major cities to prevent more  terrorist attacks like those that have taken place in past days.    During a meeting held this afternoon with the National  Intelligence Service (SIN) high command, the president gave  several guidelines to the official forces to encourage them to  continue struggling effectively against the subversive groups.    Fujimori demanded more protection for the population,  particularly now when the nation is preparing to celebrate the  new year.    Fujimori later traveled to the southern Andean city of  Arequipa, where he will celebrate the year's end. There he  evaluated the country's political violence along with the  intelligence services chiefs and the military high command.    Armed Forces and police authorities increased security  measures in the capital city after several attacks this week  resulted in two deaths, dozens of injured, and considerable  property damage.

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Reforming the welfare state The cost of the welfare state is one of the most challenging policy issues facing the world's leading economies. Increases in welfare spending have been a significant factor in the budget deficits which burden almost all the 24 states in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. As the UK government is learning, failure to control such spending leads eventually to the political odium that accompanies higher taxes. Demographic trends mean that reform cannot be long delayed. The number of people over 65 in OECD countries will almost double by 2050. At the same time, lower birthrates mean that there will be fewer people of working age. In 1990, there were five people of working age for each one over 65: in 2050, there will be fewer than three. The rising cost of pensions and healthcare for the elderly will fall on a shrinking band of people at work. They are unlikely to find acceptable the increases in taxes needed to pay the bill. The techniques being deployed across the developed world to control welfare costs vary according to national circumstance. But in the FT's series on welfare state reform around the world, which concludes on the opposite page today, it has been possible to discern some common themes. One is a greater emphasis on persuading individuals to make their own provision. In the UK, persuasion is open, with incentives to take out personal pension schemes. In other European countries, such as Germany, state pension benefits have been reduced, encouraging individuals to do more for themselves. Public welfare spending will inevitably take a larger share of national income unless individuals can be persuaded to save more for their retirement. Part-time work A second theme is reform of the labour market to increase effective working life. One way is to encourage more opportunities for part-time work for older people and those with home responsibilities; this requires looser regulation. Another is to raise the retirement age so that individuals may work for as long as they wish, and continue paying taxes longer to support the welfare state. In the current recession, employers often retire older workers before pension age to reduce their staff. But demographic pressures will soon require them to retain their older staff for as long as possible. Thirdly, user charges will also come to play a greater role in welfare services, particularly in health. Such charges can foster responsibility among users by providing an incentive not to waste resources. And as in President Clinton's health reforms, asking patients to share the cost of treatment can encourage them to exert downward pressure on charges. Safety net In making these sort of reforms, the nature of the welfare state will inevitably change. No longer will the aim be to support citizens 'from the cradle to the grave'. Instead, the welfare system will become more of a safety net which helps those who are unable to provide for themselves. This withdrawal of the state in favour of individual provision should be seen as a natural step in societies which are becoming more affluent and consumers more choosy. Such a transformation is not easy. It can only happen gradually, since those currently in work must continue to pay the pensions of those already retired while building up their own savings. And there is a danger that a more targetted welfare system creates disincentives to save. Greater compulsion to save for old age may be required as the state withdraws from universal pensions. However, it is in ensuring that the welfare system does not reduce the efficiency of labour markets that the greatest challenges are faced. There is an inexorable decline in opportunities for full-time unskilled labour and a growing demand for part-time and flexible workers. Participation in this changing labour market can be discouraged if the withdrawal of means-tested benefits combines with the taxation system to create a poverty trap with very high effective tax rates. Finding ways to ensure that this does not happen is not only the key to avoiding welfare dependency. It is at the heart of the economic success which is necessary to underpin any form of welfare state.</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Leaders that have lost their way: The difficulties facing the three best known Italian companies - Fiat, Pirelli and Olivetti The flag bearers of Italian industry are in trouble. Fiat, Olivetti and Pirelli, the three best known Italian companies abroad, have ushered in the new year with a chorus of grim business tidings. Sales are falling or at best stagnant, and profits have lost all the shine they displayed during the 1980s boom. In the latest FT 500 ranking of European companies, published last week, Fiat slipped from 15th place last year to 53rd, Olivetti from 178th to 375th and Pirelli Spa from 257th to 362nd. The plight of these three companies epitomises the problems facing Italian industry as a whole. A recession-hit domestic economy and fierce international competition have exposed the country's high labour and financing costs. And unlike in the past, the government is not in a position to bail its companies out. Numerous key industries now face their biggest restructuring since the mid-1970s - well after their European rivals in such sectors as defence, petrochemicals, ship-building, steel and textiles. 'This is now the third year that Italian industry has suffered a loss of competitiveness due to high fixed costs and labour rigidities,' says Mr Innocencio Cippoleta, managing director of Confindustria, the Italian industrialists' confederation. 'We are preparing ourselves for large-scale redundancies,' says Mr Ottaviano del Turco, assistant-secretary general of CGIL, the largest union federation. Undoubtedly, Fiat, Olivetti and Pirelli are victims of wider circumstances. They, like many other Italian companies, are also paying the price for failing to invest in new products during the late 1980s; for failing to strike up suitable international alliances as many companies of comparable size elsewhere in Europe have done; and for failing to react swiftly enough to the economic downturn. Yet there are other reasons why this is a critical moment for all three, and they have to do with their top management. Fiat and Pirelli are under increasing pressure to resolve the issue of generational changes in management and in particular the question of what role their 'ruling' families - the Agnellis and Pirellis  - should play. At Fiat, Mr Giovanni Agnelli, chairman, is 70, and has designated as heir his younger brother Umberto, aged 57. But the Agnelli family seems increasingly absorbed by its private entrepreneurial activities outside the car sector and outside Italy, highlighted by the spate of recent acquisitions and strategic alliances in France, notably in food and drinks. At Pirelli, Mr Leopoldo Pirelli, grandson of the founder, is 66 and is considered unlikely to hold the reins much longer following the acrimonious collapse of the company's bid for Continental, the German tyremaker, last November. Mr Pirelli will almost certainly step down after a decent interval. At the same time, the family is having to dig into its own pockets to recapitalise the company. Management changes are also in the air at Olivetti, where first half losses last year of L73.7bn (Pounds 34.4m) prompted the return to direct control in November of Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the 57-year-old owner/entrepreneur who controls 42 per cent of Olivetti stock. Originally brought in from Fiat to rescue Olivetti in 1978, Mr De Benedetti, a skilled financial engineer, now faces the far tougher task of proving that he is also an industrial strategist. Such difficulties have prompted some Italian commentators to call into question the future of Italy's unique system of corporate ownership and control. 'Within 20 years the system of family capitalism will be considered industrial archaeology,' says Mr Beniamino Andreatta, a former treasury minister. 'In Italy this system has lasted longer than it should.' That may be an exaggeration. Some companies that grew up under family control are faring well: for example is still run by its active founders; Zanussi, the white goods maker, which has been absorbed by the Swedish multinational Electrolux; and Ferruzzi-Montedison, which has trimmed its ambitions after it failed to take control of the petrochemicals joint venture Enimont 14 months ago. Even so, prominent economists such as Prof Franco Reviglio, a former finance minister, say Italian companies are two and three years behind their international competitors in reacting to the changing world business climate. Unlike its main European partners, Italy has few large industrial groups, a limited number of medium-sized industrial ones and a myriad of small companies, particularly in the north. Less than 20 per cent of all Italian companies employ more than 500 people, compared to 52 per cent in Germany and 47 per cent in the UK. The largest companies have a bigger impact on the Italian economy than even these figures suggest because of the broad range of their interests. Above all comes Fiat, the bellwether of the private sector. While car manufacturing generates more than 80 per cent of turnover, the group's diversified activities - taking in aerospace, civil engineering, defence, financial services, leisure, metallurgy and publishing - account for 4 per cent of Italy's gross domestic product, 10 per cent of total spending on research and development and 32 per cent of private R and D spending. Yet the company's core business is under siege. Last year Fiat sold 147,000 fewer cars at home than in 1990 while foreign competitors sold 139,000 more. The Turin-based group's share of the Italian market, generating two thirds of sales, has fallen by 15 percentage points to 45 per cent in less than five years. For much of last year, a third of Fiat's 300,000 workforce was temporarily laid off or on short time; another round of large lay-offs is due at the end of this month. Financial results for 1991, to be published at the end of the month, are likely to be disappointing; first half profits were almost halved and in September, Mr Agnelli forecast a difficult 1992. Fiat's problems relate fundamentally to its car and components business where it has traditionally relied on a strong local market. A compliant government has also provided tax incentives for consumers to buy the small cars on which the group has concentrated. Yet too many of Fiat's models are considered technically less sophisticated than foreign competition. For example, Fiat is some two years behind its main competitors in introducing catalytic converters for exhaust emissions. Fiat executives are at pains to emphasis their commitment to car production; L40,000bn, they point out, has been pledged in investment over the next decade. This includes a government-funded greenfield plant at Melfi in southern Italy, firm investments in Poland and Algeria and a proposed project in Russia. However, these latter investments are politically risky to say the least. Fiat's plans also do not, in the eyes of many observers, take sufficient account of the biggest challenge facing the European car industry: the increasingly powerful presence of Japanese manufacturers. Scarcely a week goes by without some rumour of a Fiat tie-up with the Japanese. But it is doubtful such an alliance would prove politically acceptable. A strategic alliance with the Japanese - following the example of Fujitsu's link up with British computer maker ICL - is one option for Mr De Benedetti as he considers how best to reverse the slump in Olivetti's fortunes. But this, too, would provoke a political storm in Rome and Brussels - Olivetti is one of Italy's three largest industrial groups in terms of market capitalisation and the fourth largest information technology (IT) group in Europe. Olivetti's computers and office equipment business has been badly hit by the worldwide saturation in this market. First half losses in 1991 totalled L73.7bn with the prospect of full-year losses of about L200bn. Industry analysts say Olivetti is paying the price for not investing enough in R &amp; D and for failing to develop the software end of its business. Mr De Benedetti is searching for a partner to help him complement the company's traditional strengths in computer hardware by developing a software business, but so far without success. Last autumn IRI, the Italian state holding company, rejected his offer of a merger of Olivetti's software interests and Finsiel, IRI's software and IT arm. The choice facing Olivetti is clear: it can either form a strategic alliance in which it would almost certainly be the junior partner - talks are now being held with France's Cap Gemini, the French IT group - or it must accept that to stay independent, it needs to operate on a reduced scale. Last year Olivetti cut its worldwide workforce by more than 6,000 to 47,000; management told unions this month that it wants to cut another 2,500 jobs on top of the 3,000 cut last year in Italy as operations are slimmed down or transferred to cheaper production sites in Mexico and Singapore, where costs are one tenth those in Italy. Last week unions at Olivetti began a series of stoppages, underlining the fact that forcing redundancies is more costly and complex in Italy than elsewhere in Europe. As for Pirelli, the family-run cables and tyre business and one of the most revered names in Italian industry, it is licking its wounds after its long-running bid to take over German tyre maker Continental collapsed in November. The bid was badly handled and Pirelli incurred large costs in the process, which - including indemnities to allies  - are likely to amount to some L340bn of the group's L670bn forecast losses for the current financial year. One prominent casualty may be Mr Leopoldo Pirelli, the chairman, who is expected to be replaced soon. Pirelli's failed bid ended, temporarily at least, its ambitious plans to create a European rival to France's Michelin, the world's biggest tyre producer. Adjusting to its reduced circumstances is already proving costly: last week Pirelli announced it would cut 5,000 jobs from its cable and tyre activities and sell off non-core business. 'We are going to put on the market all that is not cables and tyres, dozens of companies employing 13,200 and with a turnover of L1,780bn,' Mr Pirelli said in December. The big names of Italian industry have, of course, faced troubled times before. In one important respect, however, this time may be different: the government, burdened by a huge public sector deficit, is talking about privatisation rather than increasing its presence in the economy. In the past industrialists relied on the state to buy out loss-making operations, provide investment funds and help with redundancy payments. Weak government and lax rules worked in their favour. But with the public sector deficit now totalling 10.5 per cent of GDP, and the government under mounting pressure in the EC to reduce it, the treasury can no longer afford to spend freely - even in this election year. Indeed, for the first time in the post-war period, Italian industrialists find themselves trading accusations of blame with the politicians for the state of the economy and their own plight. Mr De Benedetti recently gave forth a litany of complaints: he bemoaned the poor quality of Italy's public services; the paltry amount spent by both private and public sectors on R &amp; D - currently 1.3 per cent of GDP, half that of its EC competitors; the faltering growth of Italian exports - up 12 per cent in the last three years when the economies Italy exports to had grown by 23 per cent; and the restricted nature of Italy's capital markets - more limited in scope, he said, than those in Madrid. So long as Italian industrialists have to contend with the the inefficiencies of the economic system - including woefully inefficient public services - and the complexities of party politics, they will remain at a serious disadvantage to their main international competitors. It is precisely these problems which also deter international investors from forging strategic alliances with the Italians. However, in an election year, a radical shake-up is just what Italian politicians seem most unlikely to deliver.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FLAGSHIPS OF ITALIAN INDUSTRY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fiat                           1991*     1990    1989 Turnover (Lire bn)       29,497    57,209  52,019 Pre-tax profits/loss      1,455     3,120   5,321 Employees               294,766   303,238 286,294  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Olivetti                           1991*     1990    1989 Turnover (Lire bn)        3,943     9,037   9,031 Pre-tax profits/loss        -79       125     355 Employees                47,000    53,679  56,937  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pirelli Spa                           1991*     1990    1989 Turnover (Lire bn)       5,118     10,139  10,342 Pre-tax profits/loss       -65        297     515 Employees               68,703     68,703  69,329  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Interim figures  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company reports  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Fine Art up 16% to Pounds 34.4m FINE ART Developments, the mail order and greetings card company, continued to buck the trend in the retail sector and yesterday unveiled a 16 per cent increase in pre-tax profits in the year to March 31. The record pre-tax outcome of Pounds 34.4m (Pounds 29.7m) was struck on turnover up 8 per cent at Pounds 311.5m (Pounds 287.3m). The mail order side was the main engine of growth, contributing operating profits up 10 per cent at Pounds 22.8m from turnover of Pounds 171.1m (Pounds 150m). Both profits and turnover in the cards and paper products division grew by 2 per cent - to Pounds 19.7m (Pounds 19.3m) and Pounds 140.5m (Pounds 137.4m) respectively. Sales at Express Gifts slipped 5 per cent to Pounds 89m, as did they did in the charity trading business to Pounds 22.1m, due mostly to the recession-driven decline in average order values. However, sales in the hampers business rose 24 per cent to Pounds 19.6m and overseas sales more than doubled to Pounds 23.6m. Tom-Wat, the loss-making charity mail order services company acquired for Dollars 1m last May, is now breaking even. In cards and paper products, wholesale sales slipped 1 per cent to Pounds 58.3m as retailers reduced stock levels towards the year-end. As leases reverted to the group, Papertree, the retail chain, expanded to 90 outlets, although Mr Keith Chapman, chairman, said last May that he wanted to reduce the then-80 outlets to less than 70. However, the chain was, for the first time, in the black at the operating level. Interest charges fell by Pounds 2.57m to Pounds 7.69m because of lower rates and also because borrowings (including finance leases) declined to Pounds 39m (Pounds 48.3m). A final dividend of 9.75p (8.3p) is proposed, to make a total of 12.75p (11p), payable from earnings of 30.26p (25.36p) per share. COMMENT As and when the recession recedes Fine Art should reap the rewards of the capital investment it has made during the slump. A thorough-going redesign of the cards, an increase in the retention of agents, and these better-than-expected results all augur well. Moreover the management has said that Fine Art's constituent businesses are running smoothly enough for it to explore expansion possibilities. A US manufacturing acquisition or a greenfield start-up there could be on the cards, as could an attempt to offset the UK mail order side's Christmas bias. Although the shares - up 6p at 552p - stand at a not undeserved premium to the sector, they may not have too much upside, possibly limiting acquisition options.</p>

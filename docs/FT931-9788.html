			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / German union leaders call protests over steel job cuts TRADE union leaders in Germany called yesterday for mass protests by steel workers, after reports that the newly-merged Krupp and Hoesch steel companies plan to close down an entire plant in either Dortmund or Duisburg. Union officials said that Mr Hans Wilhelm Grasshoff, chief executive of Hoesch Stahl, told a meeting of union members at the Westfalenhutte plant that company plans to cut monthly production capacity from 700,000 to 550,000 tonnes meant that an entire steel plant would have to close. There was no formal confirmation last night from Hoesch Stahl, where a board meeting was still in progress late into the evening. The plan would be much more drastic than last week's joint announcement by Krupp Stahl and Hoesch Stahl that one blast furnace would be closed down temporarily because of the downturn in the steel market. That proposal is for the furnace to shut down for five months. The shut-down, beginning on March 1, will put 600 steel workers on short-time working. The growing backlash from the unions over a potential threat to as many as 25,000 steel jobs follows a call from the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) in the German parliament for an emergency national congress of steelmakers, unions, and central and state governments, to draft a plan of action to tackle the growing crisis. However, the steel industry in Germany has broadly welcomed the plan proposed by the European Commission for an EC-wide response, including capacity cuts in exchange for new state aid. Mr Ruprecht Vondran, head of the German steel industry association, told an emergency debate in the Bundestag yesterday that the proposals were close to those put forward by the industry and the German parliament. It was critical to see the final form which would emerge from negotiations between the 12 member states. He said the aim should be not merely to stop the slump in profits of European steel-makers, but simultaneously to ensure a fair market for steel products in the EC. If the industry was expected to find a common way out of the crisis, then all must operate on a clear legal basis, he added. Subsidies to the industry had created a backlog of restructuring which would be painful and costly to overcome. The entire burden could not be put on the public purse, and the steelmakers would have to pay for their own restructuring to a large extent, he said. If one enterprise was expected to help its competitors to close down surplus capacity, finance social programmes for redundant workers, or even create alternative employment, it must be certain of being able to use higher capacity itself in return, Mr Vondran said. The industry must be protected from market dumping by competitors in eastern Europe , and from producers who have been forced out of the US market by the protectionist measures introduced by Washington.</p>

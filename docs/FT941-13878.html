			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Arts: Light out of darkness - Fragile survivors of the Middles Ages collected in Cologne This is an exhibition to make you pinch yourself in case it is a dream. There are no fewer than 70 north European panel paintings of the late 14th and 15th centuries. Roughly half of these fragile survivors from the Middle Ages and early Renaissance have been loaned from other museums and a handful still belong to private collections. There are vestments and manuscripts, including the delightful little Darmstadt Book of Hours which Lochner, the most admired German artist before Durer, illuminated. So obscure is Lochner, and so little represented outside German collections, that this extraordinary exhibition is like a laboratory assembled so that art-historians can test their hypotheses. Who were this innovative artist's teachers and models? Who were his fellow-pupils, and whom did he teach? These questions justify the exhibition, so the public has reason to feel grateful. At the same time, this is also an exhibition which displays a more profound contempt for the lay visitor than any I have ever seen. Apart from labels saying 'Upper Rhine', 'Italy', 'Followers', and so on, there is not a shred of information inside the gallery. Outside there are tediously slow interactive videos. Unless you read German and feel like balancing the hardback catalogue on your arm, you could leave the exhibition knowing little more about Lochner and his contemporaries than when you arrived. He was born near Lake Constance and died in Cologne in 1451, a prosperous master who invested his wealth in real estate. Probably he died from the Black Death, which wiped out half the population of this exceedingly rich city. Details of Lochner's life and work are conjectural and not one signed painting survives. A few years ago, an heretical scholar even suggested that the famous 'Adoration of the Magi' altarpiece in Cologne Cathedral is not by Lochner. (It hardly needs saying that a trip to see this is a must.) To the Wallraf-Richartz Museum's own collection of works by Lochner have been added many others. My favourite was the 'Presentation in the Temple' from the Gulbenkian Museum, which shows Lochner's gift for tenderness and his original way with themes. Simeon looks at the lively, golden-haired Christ Child in his arms with an expression which is grave and full of foreboding. Contemporaries would have known to supply his words, 'Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace.' Frankfurt has loaned the two wings of the 'Martyrdom of the Apostles'. In 12 small panels, Lochner achieved the gayest, most varied compositions out of the horrible litany of torture. These apostles surely sang as they died and their executioners have the grace of dancers. The gold backgrounds and solid haloes were the hallmark of the Cologne school. Arriving there in about 1430, Lochner wisely made it his own. So much gold can become monotonous, particularly in comparison with Flemish contemporary painters like Flemalle and Robert Campin, with their views through windows onto landscapes and lively street scenes. The exhibition shows how long it took for Cologne's burghers and churchmen to change their view that paintings, like statues and books, should be gleaming and hieratic, a foretaste of heaven. The greatest Flemish masters are also represented by loans to the exhibition. There are a half-dozen wonderful paintings by Jan Van Eyck (the 'St Jerome' from Detroit), Petrus Christus, Robert Campin and Rogier van der Weyden (the lovely panel from Leipzig of the meeting of SS. Elizabeth and Mary, both heavily pregnant). There are guided tours which will give you the sadistic pleasure of standing en bloc in front of important pictures such as Lochner's 'Last Judgment', hung in a central bottle-neck, and preventing anyone else getting a look in for minutes at a time. The longest wait will probably be to see the magnificent triptych on the last wall. It is not by Lochner but by an artist who, to my mind, is his superior. Memling's 'Last Judgment' is a sublime vision of terror and beauty. Why does this masterpiece appear in the show? Because Memling was Rogier van der Weyden's pupil, and accompanied him to Cologne where, like many other artists, he looked hard at Lochner's 'Last Judgment'. However, Memling's vision is far more novel and compelling than the Cologne master's. Here are no feebly literal jaws of hell, no bloated bodies or condign punishments. This is a hell of sickening vertigo in which elegant bodies plummet into stygian smoke and flame. On the left side, the blessed walk up a glass staircase of breathtaking beauty. A grey-haired man bobs a curtsey as St Peter shakes his hand. At the top, angels slip sumptuous garments over people's heads. Memling's vision is the grandest finale to an exhibition which, despite its lack of information about the pictures on show, will beckon to anyone who loves the northern Renaissance.

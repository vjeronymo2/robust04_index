			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Homes data hamper dollar rise THE DOLLAR staged an early rise on the foreign exchange markets yesterday following the publication of a strong set of US economic indicators, writes James Blitz. But its progress was hampered during European trading in the afternoon by another disappointing set of US home sales data. The dollar reached a high of DM1.6152 in European trading after the US leading indicator data for April showed a 0.4 per cent rise against forecasts of 0.2 per cent. The March indicator was also revised to 0.4 per cent from an initial 0.2 per cent estimate. However, these figures were overshadowed in the afternoon, when the home sales data effectively ended hopes that the housing market would lead the economy into recovery as it did in the first two months of the year. The figures showed that single-family home sales had risen just 1.3 per cent in April to 530,000, when a much stronger rebound to 552,000 had been expected. Furthermore, the already huge 14.8 per cent March drop was revised to 15.9 per cent. 'The data were pretty bad,' said one economics analyst in London. 'They mean that practically every housing indicator we watch, from sales to mortgage applications, is now down or, at best, flat.' As a result, the dollar ended down on the day at DM1.6075 after a previous close of DM1.6100. In late American trading it was hovering at DM1.6072. It also lost ground to sterling. closing at Dollars 1.8250 from a previous close of Dollars 1.8230. Despite this poor performance in Europe, the US currency managed to withstand another bout of intervention by the Bank of Japan in overnight trading in Asia. Dealers said that the BoJ had purchased Dollars 20bn-Dollars 30bn worth of yen at the Y127.40 rate. But the dollar managed to shrug off the intervention, ending the day in London at Y127.50, slightly up on its previous close of Y127.40. The D-Mark also recovered some ground against the yen in European trading. The BoJ sales of dollars for yen overnight had helped push the D-Mark down to its lowest opening level against the Japanese currency for almost three months. But it clawed back up to DM1.2622 per 100 yen by the finish, well above this morning's DM1.2655 opening. The Danish krone made fresh gains yesterday on hopes that Denmark would give a confident 'Yes' to European Monetary Union in its referendum yesterday. The krone ended at DKr3.8442 against the D-Mark, slightly stronger after last night's close of DKr3.8455. Analysts believe that heavy investment in the krone could push it up from the floor of the European Monetary System's grid, pushing the Italian lira, and possibly sterling, to the bottom two places.</p>

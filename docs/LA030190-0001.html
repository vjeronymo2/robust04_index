			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COUNCILMAN ADMITS FILINGS WERE DEFICIENT;  </P> <P> POLITICS: NATIONAL CITY'S JESS E. VAN DEVENTER, TARGET OF A PRIVATE  INVESTIGATOR, RELEASES AMENDED DISCLOSURE STATEMENTS. THE ORIGINALS LISTED ONLY  ABOUT A THIRD OF HIS EXTENSIVE PROPERTY HOLDINGS.  </P> <P> National City Councilman Jess E. Van Deventer reported only about a third of  his extensive property holdings and also failed to report 14 sources of income  in his 1988 economic disclosure statement.  </P> <P> The "glaring omissions" were made public when Van Deventer, a businessman with  financial interests ranging from construction to rental property, released  amended disclosure statements he had filed for 1985-88.  </P> <P> He announced the new filings Tuesday night at a City Council meeting, saying  publicly that "my previously filed statements are deficient in certain  aspects." Van Deventer and his attorney, George Schultz, blamed the omissions  on "previous advisers" who took care of the councilman's disclosure statements.  </P> <P> Van Deventer has been the subject of a six-month investigation by an Orange  County private investigator, who has been hired by a yet-unnamed National City  businessman to probe the councilman's financial and property interests.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Linda Miller, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office,  said the office has received reports about Van Deventer, but stressed that he  is not under investigation.  </P> <P> Both Van Deventer and Schultz said they are aware of the investigation.  However, Van Deventer insists that his decision to correct his previous filings  was not prompted by the inquiry.  </P> <P> "That did not play a role in what I did, none at all," he said. "A few months  ago, my lawyer and I started checking out the people that I had hired in the  past to do my statements. During that checking, numerous things came to light,  and I was concerned that things were not done properly, and we wanted to  correct them."  </P> <P> Schultz, who acknowledged that the original 1988 filing contained some "glaring  omissions," minimized Van Deventer's fault in preparing the statements.  </P> <P> "I'm not saying that he's not responsible. I would say that the people  preparing them weren't completely accurate, and Jess didn't do a good job of  reviewing them adequately before he signed them," Schultz said. "But where's  the damage?"  </P> <P> In 1988, Van Deventer listed interests in only four National City properties,  including three on East 17th Street. Under the state's reporting laws,  politicians are not required to report their personal residences. The amended  filing listed eight additional properties that he either owns or has an  interest in. All of the newly listed properties except one are in National  City.  </P> <P> At Tuesday's council meeting, Van Deventer acknowledged that some of the  properties are in the city's redevelopment area. To avoid a conflict of  interest, he said, he has decided not to participate in votes involving future  redevelopment projects "until this matter is sorted out by my attorney."  </P> <P> "Of primary concern at the present time is the status of certain property  interests which I have acquired" in the redevelopment area, he told the  council.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Van Deventer said that he, or the properties he owns, did not  benefit from his previous votes on redevelopment projects.  </P> <P> "There was never a conflict of interests. . . . As far as the taxpayers are  concerned, I never voted improperly," he said.  </P> <P> In 1988, Van Deventer listed income from only four sources. The amended  statement lists 14 additional sources of income, ranging from rents collected  from commercial property he owns to interest from loans made to individuals and  businesses. Ten of the new incomes were listed at more than $10,000 each.  </P> <P> The new 1988 statement also lists four previously unreported loans received by  Van Deventer. Three of them were for more than $10,000, and one was paid off in  1988. Van Deventer posted several of his commercial properties as security for  the loans; individual properties were used as security for up to three loans  from different lenders.  </P> <P> Van Deventer also failed to list income from four rental properties in the  original statement. Each property generates more than $10,000 in income a year.  </P> <P> Originally, Van Deventer listed only two investments -- Vancon Corp. and Vancon  Trust. The corporation is listed as a construction company, while the trust is  listed as a property management and financing business. The construction  company is listed as being worth more than $100,000 on both the original and  amended forms, but the trust company's value is listed at more than $100,000 in  the new form and between $10,000 and $100,000 in the old one.  </P> <P> The amended form also includes four additional investments, including an  individual retirement account, ranging in value from $1,000 to $100,000.  </P> <P> Attorney Schultz blamed Pacific Professionals, a San Diego accounting firm that  represented Van Deventer, for causing confusion in the disclosure statements.  In previous statements, some of the properties were listed as owned by Pacific  Professionals, with Van Deventer holding deeds of trust on the properties,  Schultz said.  </P> <P> "The holdings were listed under deeds of trust, when in fact he was the owner.  There was no deliberate attempt to mislead anybody. . . . We were very  concerned to get these properties back in Jess' name. That was our primary  concern," he said.  </P> <P> Accountant Jerry Sagawa, who owns Pacific Professionals, could not be reached  for comment Wednesday.  </P> <P> According to tax records, several of the properties owned in National City by  Van Deventer and his wife, Sharon, have Pacific Professional's mailing address  on 5th Avenue in San Diego.  </P> <P> Schultz said Van Deventer recently obtained title to the properties previously  held by Pacific Professionals.  </P> <P> He said Van Deventer volunteered on his own to amend his previous statements,  once he recognized that there were "serious deficiencies in the old filings."  </P> <P> National City Atty. George Eiser and the state Fair Political Practices  Commission were notified that the corrected statements would be filed, Schultz  said.  </P> <P> "This wasn't a situation where someone came in and told us, 'Amend the  statements or else,' " he said.  </P></p>

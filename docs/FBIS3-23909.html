			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Zoya Shpanko: "Half a Million--Is It a Lot or a </F> Little?"]    [Text] There may be up to half a million unemployed  in St. Petersburg soon--this is the forecast of First Deputy  Mayor Dmitriy Sergeyev, who spoke yesterday at the Palace of  Labor. The palace was the site of a conference with the  participation of mayoralty representatives, the city's Trade  Union Federation, heads of rayon administrations, enterprise  directors, and representatives of rayon employment centers.    Such a development of events is possible if prices for fuel  and power continue to rise, resulting in mass bankruptcy of  enterprises. Alas, the maximum number of unemployed the city  employment fund can handle is 150,000-160,000.    According to Dmitriy Cherneyko, chairman of the mayoralty's  committee on employment, seasonal work is unlikely to provide  solution to the unemployment problem. For instance, last year  there were no requests in Leningrad Oblast for the labor of  student construction brigades.    Trade unions took a rather tough position on the issue of  employment. As the chairman of the Trade Union Federation of  Petersburg and the Oblast put it, trade unions do not care why  people become unemployed. According to the estimates of  international experts, the number of unemployed in our city  exceeds the official figures by a factor of three. Only a  regional employment program, which will envisage well-considered  conversion, small business development, and seasonal works, can  change the situation.    The conference adopted a resolution. One of its points  instructs the economic development committee jointly with the  finance committee to look into the issue of targeted  appropriation to support socially significant enterprises.</p>

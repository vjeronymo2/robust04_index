The total area of farmland under cultivation last year fell  by about 10 per cent.    Total agricultural output stood at 42.2 million tonnes,  about  5.19 million tonnes less than in 1992.    Officials said the fall in the autumn harvest was more  marked  in Guangdong, Fujian and Zhejiang provinces, where supply lagged  far behind demand.    The opening up of the grain market had also led to fierce  competition.    In the face of a drop in agricultural output, localities had  raised their price offers for grain to increase their reserves.    "This has resulted in a continuous increase in grain  prices,"  officials pointed out. In northeastern provinces, for example,  the grain purchase price soared from 0.66 yuan (HK$0.59) per  kilogram to 0.85 yuan.    Unlike 1992, when the state grain purchase price, or the so-  called "protected price", was higher than market prices,  officials said the trend was reversed last year.    Farmers began to hoard grain for higher prices.    Many of them also wanted to secure a substantial amount in  reserve in the face of the expected drop in production this  year, officials said.    As a result, the state-owned shops could not meet their  grain-purchase targets.    "The rise in grain prices then went out of control," the  officials said.</p>

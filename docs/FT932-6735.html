			<p>930527 FT  27 MAY 93 / B&amp;Q women in setback on Sunday trading FOUR WOMEN shopworkers who claimed that enforced Sunday closure of a West Yorkshire branch of B&amp;Q, the DIY chain, amounted to unlawful sex discrimination, yesterday lost the first round of their legal battle in the High Court. Mr Justice Ferris struck out an application for an injunction preventing Kirklees Borough Council from enforcing the 1950 Shops Act at B&amp;Q's Dewsbury store. The women and B&amp;Q, which was supporting their application, all said they would appeal. B&amp;Q said: 'The staff are willing and wanting to work. The only people who will lose from this are the customers and the employees.' The judge said their application - which was opposed by Sir Nicholas Lyell, attorney-general, as well as Kirklees council - was 'doomed to failure', having regard to 'the importance of enforcing what appeared to be the law of the land'. The women, who all face redundancy if the Dewsbury store is forced to close on Sundays, were suing Kirklees for lost wages of between Pounds 182 and Pounds 465 after the enforced closure of the store for 12 weeks in 1991. They argued that the act amounted to unlawful sex discrimination because a ban on Sunday working in the retail sector affected women more than men, as most Sunday-only workers were women. The judge said the material effect of the Shops Act was that no Sunday retailing jobs should be made available except for the limited transactions permitted by the act - not that such jobs might be made available subject to a discriminatory condition. Enforcement of the act meant simply that there would be no Sunday jobs for either men or women. B&amp;Q said it would not trade at Dewsbury on Sundays after May 31 after the judge indicated he would grant Kirklees a temporary injunction against Sunday opening pending the dispute's resolution.</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> 'MOD SQUAD' STAR AT HER 'PEAK'  </P> <P> Peggy Lipton (you remember -- "the blonde" on "Mod Squad") quit show biz 17  years ago to be a wife and mom. Now this displaced homemaker is on the comeback  trail, starring in "Twin Peaks."  </P> <P> "It was great, but I was scared," Lipton, 42, said of her return to work. "It's  true for any woman because your sense of yourself has changed so much.  </P> <P> "My whole energy has changed. But you have a great advantage: You know yourself  better. I had no idea who I was at that age. None," Lipton said in this week's  issue of USA Weekend.  </P> <P> When "Mod Squad" went off the air, Lipton ditched her bell-bottoms to marry  producer Quincy Jones and raise their daughters, Rashida, now 14, and Kidada,  16. The couple split up in 1986, but they're still close, Lipton said.  </P> <P> Now, Lipton plays a diner owner on "Twin Peaks," an avant-garde television  series by director David Lynch.  </P> <P> "I love working and I get upset now when I don't do enough," she said. "But it  was a conscious choice to be a wife and mother. Right now I don't have any  mother-work conflicts because I stayed home with my kids and I wouldn't trade  that experience for being the biggest star."  </P></p>

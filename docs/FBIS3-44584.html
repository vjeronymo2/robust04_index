Chen Xitong extended a welcome to the Japanese friends and  praised Mr. Hashimoto Ikari for his contributions to  Sino-Japanese friendship when serving as the ambassador to  China. He said: China and Japan are friendly neighbors, and  their long-term friendly cooperation is conducive to the peace  of Asia and the world. China's opening wider to the outside  world, its economic development, and its greater cooperation  with other countries will, instead of affecting its cooperation  with Japan, help develop Sino- Japanese cooperation still  better. China's development will not affect the development of  other countries, and its effort to develop extensive cooperation  will be helpful to the development of all countries.    During the meeting, Chen Xitong expressed congratulations  and  support to the establishment in Beijing the "Babaiban  multi-national women's volleyball team," holding that sports  will promote friendship. Both sides also discussed joint  investment in establishing the "Beijing Babaiban International  Material Exchange Center Company Limited."    Wada Kazuo said: I am very pleased to come to Beijing and  find a very good cooperation partner. Chinese commodities are  good and more of them will enter the world market. The Babaiban  group wishes to sell more Chinese commodities.    Vice Mayor Lu Yucheng and others were present at the  meeting.</p>

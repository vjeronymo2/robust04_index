			<p>BFN     [Text] Continuing his visit to Albania, Van der Stoel,  CSCE high commissioner for national minorities, upon his request  and with permission from the procurator general of the Republic  of Albania, met this morning with the five Albanian nationals of  Greek origin that were arrested for anticonstitutional activity.    Before his departure from Albania, Van der Stoel gave a  short  interview to correspondent Shpetim Roqi. Asked what opinion he  formulated from the meeting with the arrested, he answered:  This morning I met five of the six arrested, as one of them is  further along in his defense. I am very pleased that I, along  with my adviser and an interpreter, was given the opportunity to  meet with them alone and not in the presence of the Albanian  authorities.    Asked what he gathered from the conversation with the five  arrested regarding their treatment, Van der Stoel answered: Of  course, we should wait for the trial. The defendants told me  that they were given the right to defense attorneys and that  they have already met with them. Regarding whether they are  guilty or innocent, that is for justice to decide. I did not  hear any complaints about their treatment.    Asked what influence his visit will have, he said he hoped  that his visit will influence the normalizing of Greek-Albanian  relations.</p>

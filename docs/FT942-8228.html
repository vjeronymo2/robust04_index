			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Little joy in a good news week: Perils may lurk beneath optimistic forecasts for steady economic growth in the UK This month's UK economic statistics have confounded the Cassandras. Although yesterday brought news of a fall in bank lending in April, the overall picture is of an economy that is growing well, with low inflation in spite of last month's tax increases. The past fortnight has brought news of rising first-quarter industrial output, record retail sales last month, a fall of 260,000 in unemployment over the past year and the lowest rate of underlying retail price inflation for a generation. Both Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, have held out the prospect of an extended period of steady growth. 'The opportunity that we have now,' said Mr George, 'is to continue the expansion at or perhaps a bit above its recent rate, bringing a continuing gradual fall in unemployment, with continuing low inflation, for several years ahead.' However, Mr George made clear that 'this won't come about automatically or of its own accord'. Rosy though Britain's outlook seems, there are some worries. In spite of the welter of official figures over the past two weeks and the plethora of comment that these have generated, Britain is still largely shrouded in statistical fog. The data that policymakers and markets have been given on trade, manufacturing output and retail sales are, to varying degrees, unreliable. A big question mark continues to hang over Britain's trade figures even though the Central Statistical Office and the Customs and Excise last week unveiled the results of a far-reaching review and quality audit of the new system used to collect trade data in the European Union, known as Intrastat. The CSO's analysis resulted in only a small upwards revision of last year's visible trade deficit to Pounds 13.7bn from Pounds 13.4bn previously. But it has failed to convince many UK economists. The Treasury's independent forecasters, the so-called six 'wise men', said this week that they 'remain concerned about the reliability of the trade figures'. Some panel members still found the figures 'implausible' and suggested that the annual trade deficit could be understated by Pounds 3bn. Distorted figures for trade and export prices have potentially serious implications for our understanding of domestic UK economic activity. Because industrial production figures are largely computed by adjusting output or sales data to take account of price increases, any error in the way Britain's export prices have been measured could have a big effect on the figures for manufacturing output and economic growth. Mr Gavyn Davies, chief economist of Goldman Sachs International and a member of the Treasury panel, believes official statistics could have overestimated the rise in UK export prices by about 4 to 6 per cent. In that case manufacturing output could have been underestimated by about 1.5 to 2 per cent and real economic growth in 1993 by about 0.5 per cent. In his contribution to the recent discussions of the 'wise men', Mr Davies observed that UK gross domestic product, instead of growing at an annual rate of 2.5 to 3 per cent in recent quarters, 'might be revised to show growth of 3 to 3.5 per cent'. Such uncertainties make it extremely difficult to forecast the economy and to assess how much slack remains following the recession. Doubts about the amount of spare capacity in turn add to the difficulties of assessing how far the UK is threatened by a rebirth of inflation. Even the shortest of short-term forecasts of inflation can go wrong. Twelve days ago, the Bank of England published a projection that the April's annual rate of underlying inflation, excluding mortgage interest payments, would move above 2.5 per cent towards 3 per cent. As figures this week showed, it fell to 2.3 per cent in April from 2.4 per cent in March. The current low level of retail price inflation is good news. But it reflects past events and gives no guarantee of future price stability. It is concern about future inflation that has prompted the Bank of England, the Treasury and the Department of Employment to sound the alarm about rising wages. Wednesday's news of a 4 per cent underlying increase in UK average earnings in the year to March was well above market expectations of a 3.5 per cent rise. Even though the jump largely reflected higher bonus and overtime payments, the general level of wage settlements is also moving upwards. Rising pay may be starting to chip away at Britain's international competitiveness. According to Mr Robbie Gilbert, the Confederation of British Industry's director of employment affairs: 'Earnings are feeding through into unit labour costs, which are also moving upwards, while those of Germany and the US are moving down.' The rise in incomes, together with falling mortgage rates and a run-down of savings, helps explain the continued strength of consumer demand. The recovery of the past two years has been remarkable for having been sustained entirely by growth in consumption. Trade, even allowing for deficient statistics, is thought to have made a negative contribution to UK economic growth last year. On balance, the Treasury's panel of wise men expects that trade will continue to make a small negative contribution to GDP this year and next, as imports grow slightly faster than exports in volume terms. There has been little sign so far of an upturn in investment. However, the trend in investments may be about to turn. The Bank of England has pointed out that the UK corporate sector came through the last recession with greater profitability than in the previous two recessions. Although a minority of companies continues to be burdened by excessive debts, the overall financial position of UK companies is strong. The Treasury panel generally expects investment growth of about 5 per cent this year and a further rise of about 6.5 per cent in 1995. A revival of investment cannot come too soon if the recovery is to gain in breadth and strength. There are signs, however, that the reluctance of companies to spend on plant, machinery and buildings may be part of a bigger problem of adjusting to the changed economic conditions of the 1990s. Recent surveys conducted by the CBI and Bank of England indicate that worries about inadequate rates of return are curbing capital spending. The Bank has suggested that, after 20 years in which inflation has averaged nearly 10 per cent, companies have not yet adjusted their horizons to Britain's new low inflation environment. Similar adjustment problems affect the population at large. In his speech to the CBI this week, Mr Clarke lamented that 'the public appear still to believe we are in a recession' two years into recovery. 'Too many people still hanker after the go-go growth in living standards they enjoyed in the years of boom,' he said. Such news is especially bad for Mr Clarke. While the chancellor underlined this week that he and Mr George 'share the same aim of low inflation and sound money', he is acutely aware of the absence of a 'feel-good factor' in the current recovery when his party is being hammered in the opinion polls and faces defeat in the European elections. The divergence of interests between Mr Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Clarke, the politician, may explain the nuanced differences with Mr George on whether to lower interest rates. These emerged when the minutes of their meeting at the end of March were published this week. But if Mr Clarke is serious in saying that he 'does not want a boom because boom gets followed by bust', he may have to get used to a joyless recovery. And if growth turns out to be faster than recent statistics suggest, he could be discussing an increase rather than a reduction in interest rates with Mr George before the year's end.</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Company News: US thrifts on 'road to recovery' THE long-suffering US savings and loan (S&amp;L) industry is on the road to recovery, with virtually all of the weakest institutions having been disposed of, according to the head of the industry's largest trade association. Mr Don Shackleford, chairman of the US League of Savings Institutions, which represents 1,800 S&amp;Ls across America, said the industry had returned to profitability last year, for the first time since 1986. The industry had earned a net total of Dollars 2bn in 1991, with 86 per cent of private-sector institutions in the black, Mr Shackleford said in a speech in New York yesterday. Mr Shackleford acknowledged that among the reasons for the improving trend, aside from a strengthening of capital ratios to an average of 4.9 per cent, was the altered structure of the industry following many government seizures that form part of the US government bail-out. The bail-out is estimated to carry a long-term cost of as much as Dollars 500bn over the next 20 years, if compound interest expenses are included. Between August 1989 and November 1991 the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC), the federal agency handling S&amp;L seizures, closed 583 institutions, accounting for some Dollars 279.7bn of assets. Mr Shackleford said the total assets of the S&amp;L industry rose from Dollars 1,100bn in 1985 to a peak of Dollars 1,350bn in 1988. Total assets of the thrifts now amount to around Dollars 950bn. He said the number of members of his association had been more than halved since 1985, from 4,000. Since the end of 1991, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), the S&amp;L regulatory agency, had reduced from 65 to 55 the number of institutions that were expected to fail. At the end of last year, the OTS classified some 437 of 2,096 private-sector US S&amp;Ls as either troubled by poor earnings and low capital, or likely to be closed by the RTC. These represented more than 30 per cent of total US S&amp;L industry assets. Mr Shackleford argued that 'decent directors who represent the potential for attracting sound capital' should not be subject to what he called 'indiscriminate intimidation'. He was remarking on the legal legacy of the S&amp;L crisis, which is now resulting in a number of lawsuits. Mr Shackleford argued that while he recognised the need to prosecute former S&amp;L executives, such as Mr Charles Keating, who was recently convicted on charges of defrauding bond investors, 'it is important that we go for the rapists, not the jaywalkers'.</p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> STREET SCENE'S SWEET SOUND OF SUCCESS;  </P> <P> MUSIC: PRESENTATION OF 46 ACTS WENT OFF WITH FEW GLITCHES AND HELPED MAKE THE  DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO POP MUSIC FESTIVAL A NOTABLE SUCCESS.  </P> <P> Promoter Rob Hagey has often said he'd one day like to see San Diego's Michelob  Street Scene become as big, musically diverse, and successful as the celebrated  New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival.  </P> <P> Judging from last weekend's event, the eighth Street Scene in seven years, that  day might come a lot sooner than he'd hoped.  </P> <P> Friday and Saturday night, 46 acts played on eight stages in a 12-block section  of the Gaslamp Quarter. Last year, the music festival lasted only one night,  and included 18 acts on six stages, in an area of eight downtown blocks.  </P> <P> The diversity of this year's acts was so great that walking through the  festival was something like a ride through Disneyland's Small World, with each  street corner taking you to a new and different musical world: rock 'n' roll,  blues, jazz, country, reggae, Cajun, zydeco, Latin, gospel, and worldbeat.  </P> <P> And the crowd last weekend was the largest ever: last year 17,500 attended,  this year 22,000 came on Friday night and nearly 18,000 on Saturday.  </P> <P> The best news of all, however, is that the fast expansion was achieved without  the growing pains you'd expect. In fact, Michelob Street Scene '90 was even  smoother than Street Scenes of recent years. And the credit goes to both good  planning and good luck.  </P> <P> Although there were more stages, they were far enough apart to virtually  eliminate sound overlap, a persistent problem in previous years.  </P> <P> And despite its record size, the crowd was remarkably well behaved. No fights,  no out-of-control mob scenes, few obvious drunks.  </P> <P> Maybe that's because there were more places to buy alcohol -- more 21-and-up  beer gardens, more open bars and nightclubs -- resulting in shorter lines and  fewer frustrating long waits.  </P> <P> The only real problems were minor ones. There weren't enough trash cans, for  example, and organizers had underestimated the popularity of the Bourbon Street  area, with its two Cajun/Zydeco stages: On Saturday night, from about 8 p.m.  on, the line to get in was at least a block long.  </P> <P> However the music, for the most part, couldn't have been better. Friday night's  biggest crowd-pleaser was the British reggae band Steel Pulse, who closed the  Reggae/Worldbeat Stage, at Seventh Avenue and J Street, with a riveting  90-minute set. On Saturday, it was Texas blues guitarist Johnny Winter, whose  trio delivered an equally compelling closing performance on the Blues Stage at  Seventh Avenue and L Street.  </P> <P> Other Friday-night highlights included dynamic performances by the Soviet rock  band Vladimir Kuzmin and Dinamik and San Diego's Beat Farmers on the Seventh  and L Stage; Louisiana's Beausoleil, with their festive Cajun music, on the  East Cajun Stage at Sixth Avenue and Island Street; and ex-Animal singer Eric  Burdon and ex-Doors guitarist Robby Krieger, with their updated recyclings of  classic Animals tunes like "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood," "We Gotta Get Out  of This Place," and "See See Rider," on the Rock Stage at Third Avenue and J  Street.  </P> <P> The Beat Farmers's set was preceded by a wedding ceremony between  singer-guitarist Joey Harris and his longtime sweetheart. Country Dick Montana,  the group's drummer, and a mail-order minister with the universal life church,  married the two. The group then opened with "Girl I Almost Married" but changed  the lyrics to "Girl I Just Got Married."  </P> <P> Among the highlights on Saturday night were performances by Katie Webster, the  two-fisted piano-pounding protege of the late Otis Redding, on the Blues/Jazz  Stage at Fifth Avenue and K Street; gospel group Clarence Fountain and the Five  Blind Boys of Alabama on the Blues Stage; Buckwheat Zydeco on the East Zydeco  Stage at Sixth and Island; salsa king Willie Colon and Legal Alien on the Latin  Stage at Third Avenue and J Street; and the Desert Rose Band, led by former  Byrd Chris Hillman, on the Country Stage at Seventh Avenue and J Street.  </P> <P> Webster, in particular, was a delight. Holding court behind a grand piano her  sensuous swamp boogie made it difficult for anyone to stand still. Toward the  end of her set there was a poignant moment: Webster dedicated a bluesy  rendition of Dire Straits' "So Far Away" to the late Stevie Ray Vaughan.  </P> <P> Still, there were a couple of disappointments. The Strawberry Alarm Clock's  Friday-night set on the Rock Stage at Third Avenue and J Street drew a sparse  crowd, and with good reason: The psychedelic-rock dinosaurs, best known for  their 1967 hit, the flower-power anthem "Incense and Peppermints," sounded  dated. They should not be invited back.  </P> <P> Nor should Stan Ridgway, formerly with the pioneering new wavers Wall of  Voodoo. His musically intriguing hour-long performance Saturday night on the  Rock Stage at Third Avenue and K Street was marred by banal between-song patter  ("I'm a sissy, but I'm a rich sissy") and a particularly silly, cliched closing  diatribe ("We have a lot more to give you, but Michelob won't allow it").  </P> <P> What made this year's Street Scene even more of a culturally enlightening  experience was the fact that the handful of food booths around each stage  mirrored the ethnicity of the music.  </P> <P> Chowing down red beans and spicy Cajun sausage while Beausoleil, the Bad Boys  of Zydeco, Buckwheat Zydeco, and C.J. Chenier and the Red Hot Louisiana took  turns on the two Bourbon Street stages was about as close to the real Bourbon  Street as you can get.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, most of the food was overpriced -- as it always is at these  affairs -- and at least one Gaslamp Quarter restaurant in the enclosed area  that remained open during Michelob Street Scene '90 got a little greedy.  </P> <P> The Blarney Stone was selling corned-beef sandwich halves for $3, both inside  the restaurant and at a booth across the street. The regular price is $4.50 for  a whole sandwich.  </P> <P> The Irish diner-pub was also charging "entertainment" prices for drinks, even  though the entertainment was outside, on the street, the nearest stage two  blocks away.  </P></p>

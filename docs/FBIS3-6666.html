Fifteen political parties and organizations of Peru  including  the Socialist Revolutionary Party, the Communist Party and the  National Association for the Study of the Chuche Idea of Peru  released a joint statement on March 9 supporting the DPRK's just  stand for a solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula.    The statement urged the United States to rescind the  unreasonable preconditions and honestly implement the agreed  steps of simultaneous action and denounced Japan and the South  Korean authorities for stepping up their program of nuclear arms  development, while balking the DPRK-U.S. talks for a solution to  the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.    The Communist Party of Colombia issued a statement on March  8  strongly demanding that the United States fully implement the  just steps of simultaneous action which oblige both the DPRK and  the United States to do what they should.    The Nigeria-DPRK Friendship Association in a statement March  10 said that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula was an  offspring of the Korean policy of the U.S. for isolating and  stifling the DPRK. It stressed that if the issue was to be  solved, the DPRK and the United States must successfully hold  the third round of the talks on the principle of equality,  impartiality and respect for sovereignty.    The Nepalese paper CHALPAL March 6 said that no matter could  be resolved by pressure and threat and that the basic way of  solving the Korean question including the nuclear issue was  dialogue and talks as insisted by the DPRK.    Chairman of the Guyanese National Committee for the Study of  the Chuche Idea of Comrade Kim Il-song Robert Williams and  former Chairman of the Nationalist Socialist Party of Syria in  Lebanon David Baz released statements on March 8 urging the  United States to promptly stop such despicable act as reversing  its promise, setting preconditions again in the solution of the  nuclear issue.</p>

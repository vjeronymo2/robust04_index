			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THIS TIME AROUND, A MUSCOVITE MARCHES BECAUSE HE WANTS TO  </P> <P> Every year since he was 20, Anatoly Zhuravlev was ordered to march in official  parades on Soviet Revolution Day, but on Wednesday the 35-year-old factory  worker demonstrated proudly against the Bolshevik Revolution.  </P> <P> "For the first time, I feel like a human and not a robot," Zhuravlev said as he  walked along the Garden Ring Road with his lanky 15-year-old son, Andrei.  </P> <P> "There is something really wonderful about this alternative demonstration --  people are marching because they believe in something," Zhuravlev said.  </P> <P> He and his son were among 10,000 liberals who demonstrated against the 1917  revolution and the society it created in two alternative demonstrations  authorized by Moscow authorities.  </P> <P> Mournful music played over loudspeakers as people holding homemade signs  bearing slogans such as "73 Years of Lies and Violence" gathered in downtown  Moscow on a square in front of Communist Party headquarters.  </P> <P> The demonstration, called to pay tribute to the victims of decades of  repression under Soviet rule, took place within view of Red Square, where the  traditional military parade and march of party supporters was going on.  </P> <P> The demonstrators called for the resignations of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev  and Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, political and economic independence for  Russia and an end to the Communist Party's control of the government.  </P> <P> The crowd cheered wildly when Russian Federation President Boris N. Yeltsin and  Moscow Mayor Gavriil K. Popov stopped by after participating in the official  celebration at Red Square.  </P> <P> "It is a critical moment in the life of our country," Popov said. "Now the time  has come for each person to rise up and save the country."  </P> <P> Later, the protesters, led by priests and laymen carrying icons, crosses and  other religious symbols, walked three miles to the apartment building where  longtime dissident and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Andrei D. Sakharov lived  until his death last December.  </P> <P> "Gorbachev has had more than enough applause," Mikhail N. Bidosh, 63, a factory  worker who spent 15 years in Siberian political prison camps under the dictator  Josef Stalin, said as he walked along. "We need to get rid of him and all  Communists for good, even if it takes a revolution."  </P> <P> The protesters said they no longer have faith in Gorbachev because he has  failed to disavow the Communist Party, refuses to share power and has done  nothing to slow the economic decline.  </P></p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Emerging Markets: Low prices and timelags fuel Budapest - The Emerging Investor Hungarians, Budapest's brokers among them, call the summer the cucumber season, when nothing much happens. But Hungary's securities houses are far from vegetating. Since April hardly a week has gone by without a new public offering or private placement of shares. Fotex, the private retail group, raised Dollars 70m in April from international institutions in the largest equity issue ever by a Hungarian company. In June there were four significant offerings: Egis and Pharmavit in the pharmaceutical sector, Global TH, the retailer, and Graboplast the artificial leather producer. In total, Hungary has seen new issues worth about Dollars 300m since April. That may not sound a lot in western terms, but it represents more than a quarter of the Budapest market's capitalisation of Ft113.6bn (Dollars 1.1bn) at the end of May. The burst of new issues, also, for the first time, has lifted portfolio investment flows above foreign direct investment. Hungary, more than any of its east European neighbours, had put the focus of privatisation on trade sales of state companies to western multinationals. Foreign direct investment was Dollars 2.3bn in 1993, taking the accumulated stock to more than Dollars 7bn, about half of the total for the region. However that success has, to some extent, crowded out financial investors. The Budapest Stock Exchange, the only bourse in eastern Europe when founded almost four years ago, is now dwarfed by its Warsaw and Prague counterparts. The wave of new share issues offers Budapest the chance to catch up. Mr Andras Simor, managing director of CA Securities, the local Creditanstalt subsidiary and lead manager of the most new issues, said: 'It is high time.' In a sense, it was just a matter of time. 'Four years have passed since companies became aware of the stock market,' said Mr Jozsef Rotyis, managing director of the BSE. 'It is less and less of a problem to have the necessary three years of audited figures.' Western industrial investors have also improved the results of many Hungarian companies to the point that the state can float its remaining stake. A core western owner with management control provides reassurance to passive investors. It does not always work that way. The new issues this spring were to have led up to a flagship public offering this autumn, of a stake in Matav, the telecommunications monopoly. But Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech, the German and US telecoms companies which bought 30 per cent of Matav last December, blocked the transaction. There are, however, several cases of successful public offerings after a trade sale, like the brewery, Soproni Sorgyar, controlled by Brau of Austria and offered this April. And a growing number of private start-up companies like Pharmavit are mature enough to attract equity finance. Hungary, in time, has also come round to the need to win popular support for privatisation by offering more state shareholdings to the public. A particular stimulus to the conservative government was the parliamentary election in May, which it eventually lost to the Socialist party. However, this spring has not been the most propitious to tap equity investors. Falls in bond markets and in the US dollar have dampened equity markets throughout the world. The allure of eastern Europe's markets has faded, too. Warsaw, Prague and Budapest have all plunged from the dizzy heights they reached in February and March, proving that the region's bourses can submerge as well as emerge. The BSE index, which leapt 78 per cent in a month to an all-time high of 2,190 on February 2, has since fallen back by a third. Nor do last month's three point increase in Forint interest rates and rising yields on government bonds augur well for domestic demand for shares. So why the increased activity? One reason is the time it takes for new issues to get to market. The boom at the start of the year powered the burst of new issues but the issues themselves were only able to follow after a timelag. Hungarian transactions have a long lead time and issuers have to wait until the spring so that they can present fresh annual results to investors. In spite of the worsening environment, none of the planned offerings was derailed. 'We were on the wave of the bullish market and technically there is no way of stopping a transaction once you start,' said Mr Lotfi Farbott of the Austrian-owned broker, GiroCredit. 'There is a loss of prestige if you pull out.' Moreover, all the issues were fully subscribed and only one, the placing of Fotex, was scaled back, from a planned Dollars 100m to a eventual Dollars 70m. Underpinning demand for new issues are the emerging markets funds set up at the peak of the equity boom. Foremost among them is CS First Boston's Dollars 200m Central European Growth Fund, launched in February. Quantum, controlled by the Hungarian-American speculator, Mr George Soros, has invested in an expansion of the First Hungary Fund. Other active investors include funds managed by Templeton, John Govett and Fidelity. 'There are huge funds on the market. They have to spend the money and they buy everything,' said a broker with a leading firm. But the institutions say that they can take their time. 'We are not going to pour the money in,' said Mr Janos Bartha, chief executive of CS First Boston Budapest. The CSFB fund plans to be only 60-70 per cent invested after the first year. More clinching is the argument that Budapest, after falling from unsustainable heights, is cheap again. The Budapest market is valued at 14 times prospective earnings and many of the new issues have been made at a substantial discount. Egis, for instance, was sold at a p/e ratio of just 7.3. All of the main new issues, except for Fotex, are trading above issue price. The prospect for further gains is limited in the immediate term, however, precisely because of the new issues. They have siphoned off capital from the secondary market. Turnover in shares fell to a 1994 low last week and the index remains static in the 1400-1500 range.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      Ten best performing stocks  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  17/6/94     Week on week change Stock               Country      Dollars     Dollars        %  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Eczacibasi Ilac     Turkey        0.0784      0.0152    23.99 Turkiye Is Bankasi  Turkey        0.1440      0.0249    20.88 Eletrobras (C)      Brazil        0.2146      0.0320    17.52 Kordosa             Turkey        0.3280      0.0459    16.26 Eelctrobras (Pfd)   Brazil        0.2145      0.0281    15.04 Kordosa             Turkey        0.2167      0.0427    14.98 Aygaz               Turkey        0.3280      0.0263    13.99 Light Servicos De Electricade         Brazil        0.2144      0.0244    12.66 Migros              Turkey        2.7840      0.2762    11.01 Yapi Ve Kredi Bankasi             Turkey        0.0848      0.0080    10.41  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                         NEW EQUITY ISSUES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Company             Date      Dollar       %    Lead               P/E                               amount            manager          ratio  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Danubius          Jan/94   Dollars23.6m   29%   CA Securities     13.8 Pannonplast       Apr/94   Dollars18.3m   51%   CS First Boston    6.9 Fotex             Apr/94   Dollars70.0m   23%   CS First Boston   15.6 Soproni Sorgyar   Apr/94   Dollars18.4m   37%   CA Securities      8.6 Pick Szeged       May/94   Dollars23.5m   13%   Samuel Montagu     9.8 Pharmavit         Jun/94   Dollars35.9m   35%   Samuel Montagu,   12.2 CA Securities Egis              Jun/94   Dollars43.8m   29%   CS First Boston    7.3 Graboplast        Jun/94   Dollars13.5m   58%   GiroCredit         9.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Travel '93: Dracula a distant memory in rural Romania - James Henderson finds peace and tranquillity in the hills and traditional villages of Transylvania IT IS a rare pleasure in Britain now to see the traffic stop to let a file of geese cross the road. In Transylvanian villages it happens more often. Their ungainly, overlong step gives the geese a comic waddle and they take their time. But then life is rather less hurried in Transylvania. I arrived in Romania in the height of summer, over the border from Hungary: walking, hitch-hiking, riding buses, trains and tractors and - once - a horse and cart. The sunflowers were 6ft tall and the harvest was being collected. There is a gratifying timelessness in a scene of men and women pitch-forking hay into rounded stacks. Half a century ago, mention of Romania sent people running for the atlas. All it was known for was its hardy peasant stock, gypsies and Dracula, although it was in fact one of Europe's most successful agricultural economies. If Romania was little known then, it has become notorious since - for the most violent of the eastern European revolutions; for the pitiful faces of orphans living in monstrous circumstances and for its grotesque leader, Nicolai Ceaucescu. It was part of his unhinged vision for Romania to erase traditional village life. In his master-plan he would simply bulldoze centuries-old villages and move the people into agro-industrial collectives, those hideous assemblies of concrete tenements that cluster round cities throughout eastern Europe. In a few years, with luck, the Romanians will remember Ceaucescu and his master-plan only as a bad dream. In the Mara Mures, the Carpathian uplands, the rolling hillsides are covered with orchards and pasture and the rivers are lined with willow. I admired all this from my perch on the wheel arch of a tractor, on which I had hitched a bouncy 10-mile ride. The driver dropped me at the edge of a village where I stumbled on a crowd of women dressed in headscarves and long skirts, standing round an apple tree, all looking up into the branches. A man was clambering about. Periodically there was a drumming noise on the pavement as a shower of small apples bounced on the concrete. They pressed a handful on me. Life is simple, hard and poor. Winter must be another story, but in summer the markets are full with vast cabbages and melons. The Romanians are proud and rich in another sense, as a quick look at their homes reveals. The neat farmhouses of the Mara Mures are made from timber and overlook yards formed by barns. They are roofed with wooden tiles and wrapped with verandas shaded by a screen of vine leaves. The central decoration is the carved entrance gate. Two gateways sit under a miniature tile roof - one for vehicles, one for people - and they are carved with devotional care. A kaleidoscopic explosion of diamonds, hearts, beading and interlocking arrows leads out from the centre, like a rose window. At the edges, some are finished in rustic, saw-toothed simplicity, but others run in an elaborate series of kiss-curls and cresting waves. Elsewhere rope motifs are rolled like thick plaits of hair. These elaborate gates are still being carved. When they are newly glazed they are as attractive as a harvest festival display. I caught a lift with a pair of Hungarian honeymooners. Close to the Ukrainian border, passing little herds of sheep that huddled together, heads down for shade, we came to the town of Sapinta, famed for its mayor who was quick to throw out all the communists after the revolution. It is also known for its graveyard, the Merry Cemetery. The orthodox crosses on the graves are decorated with bright illustrations. Here there is a milkmaid, there a forester and there the sad story of a four-year-old girl run over by a car. The style is naive and schematic. At the end of the day we arrived in the town of Sighetu Marmatiei, as the harvesters plodded heavily into town, their scythes and rakes hung over their shoulders. After a quick meal in which we were joined by the local boozer (unfortunately he spoke enough of every European language to say cheers and be incoherently boring), we made a break and went in search of somewhere to stay. We tried all the hotels and guest houses - nothing. The last two beds in the town turned out to be in a 'mini-hotel', and were both in the same room. Gradually, I realised what I was letting myself in for. It would be the first time I had shared a room with honeymooners, that was for sure. But they had it all arranged and we were installed before I could say: 'Oh, don't worry about me, I'll wander off to the next town in the dead of night.' So I made a couple of comments about being a heavy sleeper, ostentatiously put in some earplugs and turned to face the wall. Next morning they treated me to breakfast. Travelling south, I came to the heartland of Transylvania: whole valleys of vines and fields of maize. The farmhouses changed style and were now made of plastered brick with patterned beams inlaid, painted bright colours. For a while, they affected little turrets, like minarets, but these soon vanished. The vine-screened balconies remained, however, as did the wells: weighted, angled poles with long necks are dipped to collect the water. For the first time I saw Romanian gypsies, or rather I heard them, for an uproar came from around the corner. Two women were screaming at each other and gathering their skirts for a set-to. Gypsy skirts are fuller and more brightly decorated than the ethnic Romanians' and suit their fiery temperament. The menfolk sat dispassionately by, in long boots, breeches and waistcoats, only intervening when the argument developed into an all-out fight. I could not work out the cause of the row, but a moment later the woman who had lost the fight returned with a man carrying a pathetic human shape. He laid the bundle of clothes on the ground and she took care of him as they waited for a bus. She fanned the sick man and then, to my surprise, rifled through his pockets and took a couple of notes. Then I hopped on a horse and cart and learnt no more about the saga. I found myself sitting among a Romanian family on the way back from the fields for lunch. There must have been four generations present, fresh-faced seven-year-olds and their tanned, stubble-chinned uncles. A dog ran like a scout about 30 yards ahead, clearing the ground for them. They stopped and joined a crowd of other farmers who were resting under a tree. The sun was at its highest. They looked at me in mild surprise when I set off between the fields of neatly-trained hops. And well they might have. No doubt they do not see many Englishmen walk off into the midday sun. I chuckled and quietly resolved to keep a close eye on the dog, which was trotting beside me. Through fields of wheat and tobacco overflown by birds of prey, I reached the hilltop town of Sigisoara. Emerging from a spooky covered wooden stairway into medieval streets, I was surprised to be addressed in German. A little crowd of ladies was sitting outside a neat townhouse. We chatted for a while. They were ethnic Germans whose families had lived in Romania for centuries. I ate in a place they recommended, offered with a lugubrious chuckle - the Vlad Dracul. The restaurant is set in the house where Dracula himself was supposed to have been born. I had forgotten about Dracula and Transylvania. I might have expected ghostly shadows at noon and craven peasants scuttling around, but the only sense of foreboding I had on my trip was a large number of single magpies. Dracula seems about as far from Transylvania as the mad Ceaucescu's plans. Instead, my memories are of a crowd of schoolboys illicitly stripping a plum tree and a large crowd of carts and people around the village threshing machine . . . and nearly being thrown out of a tractor trailer as it bounced to a halt to let a file of geese cross the road.</p>

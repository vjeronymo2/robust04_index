			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Arts: Miller's 'Falstaff' - Andrew Clark finds the doctor back on form in Zurich After a string of dud opera productions around Europe over the past year, Jonathan Miller has come up with a fleet-footed, funny and affectionate Falstaff in Zurich. The key to his success lies not so much in the homogeneous cast or the intimate scale of the Zurich Opera House - though each play a part. No, the chief distinction is Miller's faithfulness to the spirit of Verdi. He preserves the period setting, keeps the humour alive and paces each scene with the same sleight of hand that characterises Verdi's musicking of Shakespeare. The result brings to mind Miller's landmark staging of Le nozze di Figaro for the 1991 Vienna Festival. Falstaff may not reach quite that exalted level, but it too is the product of second thoughts (he first staged Falstaff for Kent Opera in the 1970s) and enjoys clear dramatic lines. Without being untrue to Elizabethan England, Miller has turned to the paintings of 16th century Dutch masters for his visual inspiration. Peter Davison's sets - a succession of simple, spacious interiors against a backdrop of oak trees and matchbox townhouses - have the light and depth of a Bruegel landscape, in which the characters are at one with their natural environment. Bardolph and Pistol are Gothic bumpkins straight out of Hieronymus Bosch, and Clare Mitchell's authentic costumes look comfortably lived-in. Miller's view of Falstaff is refreshingly benign. He listens to the music and takes Sir John at face value - an incorrigible optimist, a personification of the life-force, a figure of fun whose ageing girth houses an equally large appetite for wine and women. The boastful interviews at the Garter Inn with a flirtatious Quickly and the disguised Ford are sprinkled with wit, while the hunt in Ford's house develops a farcical momentum of which Brian Rix would be proud - Falstaff's first instinct is to take cover under Alice's dress, and it is only with great effort that he can be squeezed into the laundry basket. Even 'Mondo ladro' has its amusing side, as Falstaff hobbles around barefoot under a moth-eaten blanket. Miller's imagination occasionally gets the better of him - Dr Caius spends much of the evening swotting flies, and one of Ford's retinue turns up with a field-telephone - but never enough to compromise the evening's uncluttered appeal. Falstaff is sung by the Spanish baritone Juan Pons, who is now experienced enough in the part to have the timing and physical mannerisms exactly right. His voice is handsome and reliable. He wears the paunch, the balding ginger wig and outrageous plumed red cloak convincingly. All he needs is the larger-than-life personality that distinguishes the finest interpreters. Alice, sung by Gabriele Lechner with charm and femininity, has a girth almost as big as Falstaff's and a sense of humour to match. Birgit Remmert's Quickly is tall and sexy - no wonder Falstaff welcomes her advances - and the voice has star quality. Rodney Gilfry struggles with Ford; Laszlo Polgar and Volker Vogel make a scene-stealing pair of rogues. Fenton and Nannetta, roles which always find their interpreters in first blossom, are sung by Reinaldo Macias and Isabel Rey. After 35 years in Zurich, it was about time Nello Santi conducted Falstaff there, but his experience proves double-edged. The music is beautifully paced, the dynamics kept admirably low - but the mercurial spirit of late Verdi eludes him, and the reading is inexplicably short on swagger. No matter: this is a worthy addition to Zurich's Verdi repertory, and - with his ENO Rosenkavalier less than three months away - a timely return to form for Miller.</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Peabody raises stake in NSW coal project Peabody Resources, part of the British Hanson group, yesterday announced that it has raised its stake in the Warkworth coal joint venture in New South Wales, from 28.75 per cent to 43.75 per cent. The original Warkworth interest was acquired by Peabody when it purchased the Australian coal mining interests of Costain, the British construction group, last year for about USDollars 200m. The joint venture controls around 234m tonnes of recoverable opencast coal reserves and sizeable underground reserves in New South Wales. It produces 2.8m tonnes a year of metallurgical and steaming coal, mainly for export to Pacific Rim customers. Peabody, which is the manager of the Warkworth operation, bought its additional stake from the Westpac staff superannuation plan, and both sides declined to disclose the price. Other partners in the joint venture include Mitsubishi Development, Mitsubishi Materials, Minproc Energy and Nippon Steel. The increased interest comes hard on the heels of an unfavourable outcome for the coal industry in its annual negotiations with the Japanese steel mills. Under competitive pressure from other suppliers and faced with lower demand from Japan, Australian producers accepted larger-than-expected price cuts and reduced tonnages. A series of 24-hour mine stoppages, called by the United Mine Workers' union in protest at the outcome of the negotiations, is due to start tonight.</p>

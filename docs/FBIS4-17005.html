			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Peter Almond article: "Russia Develops New Fighter </F> Aircraft With Sting in its Tail"]    [Text] Russia is developing a fighter aircraft with the  unique ability to shoot missiles backwards, according to Jane's  Defence Weekly. The sting in the tail is in Sukhoi's latest  ground attack fighter, the Su-34, a development of the Su-27. A  fighter version of the plane, the SU- 35, which is now being  developed, is set to become one of the world's most capable  fighters and is the aircraft the RAF's [Royal Air Force] new  Eurofighter was designed to beat. Neither Eurofighter nor  America's still-developing fighter, the F- 22, has a rear firing  capability. Mr John Taylor, editor of Jane's All the World's  Aircraft, said last night: "It would probably make life more  difficult for Eurofighter. It makes it more difficult to  attack." The missile was stated by the magazine to be a standard  R- 73 air-to-air infra-red missile, a development of the AA-11 "  Archer" . According to the Russian missile design bureau  Vympel, a rear-facing tracking or acquisition radar sensor on a  long aft "tail" picks up an approaching aircraft and warns the  two-man crew to prepare to fire. The missile is on a wing rail  and can be rotated backwards. Mr Taylor said it is then  released and its rocket motor fires away from the aircraft. The  radar guides it automatically to the target up to eight I miles  away. Vympel claims the missile can be fired in supersonic  flight.    Mr Taylor said rear-facing radars have been in place on  Russian. bombers for some time and the idea of firing a missile  backwards has been researched by western air forces.    The main reason British and American air force officials are  not worried for their new aircraft is that both are designed to  fire the medium-range Amraam missile, which can detect the Su-34  long before entering its radar vision. "A rear-facing missile  might give problems if you want to get close but Amraam lets us  fire from 20, miles away or more, long before the other guy  knows we're even there," said a US air force spokesman at the  Pentagon.</p>

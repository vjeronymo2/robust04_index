The visit, it adds, comes within the context of  Egypt's continuous efforts for peace and security in the Arab  region in the eastern Mediterranean and its eagerness to defuse  inter-Arab differences.    In its editorial today, Tuesday, the paper says that Musa's  hope for more open Arab relations in 1994 stems from Egypt's  belief in the unity and harmony of Arab interests. It notes  that Egypt is conducting preventive diplomacy at the Arab level  in general and at the Jordanian-Palestinian level in particular.    The paper explains that Egypt is always open to Arab  cooperation within the context of mutual respect and  nonintervention in internal affairs. It affirms that  negotiations on peace in the eastern Mediterranean requires the  Arabs to maintain unity.    The paper says everyone must realize that Arab  reconciliation  at this time is vital to achieving a just and comprehensive  peace and that this goes beyond the post-peace phase to building  modern Arab economic resources.</p>

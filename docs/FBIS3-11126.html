The Cuban Workers Federation (CTC), which is comprised of  all  the country's unions, said today that this was a record  collection among Cuban workers for this purpose.    The MTT, formed by volunteers from all Cuban neighborhoods,  are comprised of several million people and their main task is  to support the regular troops in repelling and defeating any  enemy aggression.    Cuba's concept of defense is basically based in popular  participation in fighting foreign invaders, and it is called the  war of all the people.    The CTC said, in a report on the donations to finance these  militias, that more than 4 million pesos collected was payment  for voluntary work.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By T.C. Hu] </F>   [Text] Washington, April 14 (CNA) -- The state-run Taiwan  Power Company will begin commercial single-cycle operation of  its Hsinta plant near Tainan in mid-1995, with gas turbines and  other power generation equipment provided by Siemens, a global  electronics-electrical firm.    Siemens' Milwaukee-based Power Generation Group (PWU) said  Thursday [14 April] that at least eight of the 15 gas turbines  ordered by Taipower will be manufactured, assembled, and shipped  to Taiwan soon.    With the equipment, Taipower's Hsinta plant will become the  largest power plant on the island, a facility capable of  producing 2,364 megawatts of electricity, or enough to power a  city of more than two million residents.    When the Hsinta plant begins combined-cycle operation in  1998, it will become the world's largest power plant for  60-hertz cycle generation. Electricity in Taiwan, like in North  America and several other countries in Asia, is generated on a  60-hertz cycle, it added.    The gas turbines to be installed in the Hsinta plant are  worth about US$500 million, and are Taipower's second order from  Siemens. The first gas turbines manufactured at the PWU were  exported to Taipower's Nan Pu Combined-Cycle Power Station in  1992.    In addition to the gas turbines, Siemens will supply five  steam turbines, 15 heat recovery steam generators, plant  instrumentation and controls, and other equipment to Taipower.    Taipower will begin to add the steam turbines to the Hsinta  plant's gas turbine operation in late 1996.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [UK press release from the Public Health Laboratory Service: </F> "Quarterly AIDS and HIV Figures"]    [Text] The Public Health Laboratory Service [PHLS] today  published in the Communicable Disease Report AIDS and HIV  figures for the United Kingdom. These show that in December  there were 105 new reports of AIDS cases bringing the cumulative  total to 8,529 cases.    The cumulative total of recognised HIV infections is now  21,101. New reports of HIV infection may relate to people who  have recently become infected, to people infected some time  before choosing to be tested, or to people first tested when  they develop AIDS.  <H5>  Notes to Editors </H5>   1. Epidemiological surveillance of the Acquired immune  Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) was begun at the PHLS AIDS Centre in  collaboration with the Communicable Diseases and Environmental  Health (Scotland) Unit [CD&amp;EH(S)U] in 1982. Surveillance of  Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection, the cause of AIDS,  commenced in late 1984.    2. PHLS CD&amp;EH(S)U work in collaboration with colleagues  in  the Oxford Haemophilia Centre (coordinating national information  on haemophiliacs) and with colleagues in the Department of  Paediatric Epidemiology, Institute of Child Health.    3. AIDS case reports are compiled from voluntary  confidential  reports by clinicians directly to PHLS and CD&amp;EH(S)U. A  summary  report is released monthly.    4. HIV infection reports are made through a voluntary  confidential reporting by the microbiologists in laboratories  where HIV tests are carried out. They are summarised and  released with the monthly AIDS figures at the end of each  quarter.    5. Due to the length and variability of the period between  infection with HIV and development of AIDS (average of between  8-10 years), reports of AIDS cases do not give a picture of the  current spread of HIV infection.    6. Information on deaths is based on reports to PHLS and  CD&amp;EH(S)U from clinicians, supplemented by information on  death  entries obtained from the Office of Population Censuses and  Surveys and the Registrar General for Scotland.    7. There are many people currently being treated for disease  related to HIV infection who do not yet fulfil the surveillance  case definition for AIDS.    Further data on AIDS is available in the PHLS Communicable  Disease Report, which can be subscribed to by contacting Editor  CDR, PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, 61 Colindale  Avenue, London NW9 5EQ.  <H5>  [Note to Readers: In following AIDS reports from the United </H5> Kingdom only editorial notes that contain new information will  be published.]</p>

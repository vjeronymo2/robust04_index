			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with S. Belyayev, head of the Federal </F> Administration for Insolvency (Bankruptcy) Cases, by NOVOYE  VREMYA commentator Galina Kovalskaya, under the "Special to  NOVOYE VREMYA" rubric; place and date not given: "If You Are  Afraid of Bankruptcy, Do Not Venture Into a Market Economy"]    [Text] That the planned economy is bankrupt is clear  by now to more than just the specialists. "Giants of socialist  industry" have the hardest time fitting into the new environment  of market relations. How are they to survive and, on top of  that, operate to benefit our society and the people? How to  avoid bankruptcy? These are issues not only for "giants," but  also for every labor collective. The state tries to regulate  these processes.    Sergey Belyayev, general director of an administration, has  answered questions put by NOVOYE VREMYA commentator Galina  Kovalskaya.    Sergey Belyayev is well known in St. Petersburg as a deputy  of the Leningrad Soviet, chairman of the Krasnogvardeyskiy Rayon  Soviet, and subsequently deputy mayor of the city. He was in  charge of issues of property management and privatization. He  has things to boast of: approximately 70 percent of all  enterprises in the city have been privatized.    Soon the entire country will start talking about this man.  After all, he heads the recently created Federal Administration  for Insolvency (Bankruptcy) Cases. The administration has  ministerial status; the subject matter it will handle is about  the most vital and painful that there is.    Why is state regulation needed for what would appear to be a  purely market-based institution, for bankruptcy? What does the  bankruptcy of an enterprise mean under current conditions, when  everyone owes money to everyone else, and no one pays anything  to anyone? Will bankruptcy bring about the complete stoppage of  production? Will half the population be left without jobs?    [Kovalskaya] What has the administration been established  for? What tasks do you intend to accomplish in the immediate  future?    [Belyayev] Our main goal is to prevent the complete  liquidation of insolvent enterprises. Under legislation  currently in effect, bankruptcy does not necessarily presuppose  liquidation. It presupposes first of all a recovery  (restructuring) of such production. Its complete closure is an  extreme measure which is, of course, the most painful both for  the owner and the labor collective.    By now, a large proportion of enterprises in Russia are  either covered by bans on privatization or have not yet been  converted to joint-stock operations. Their share comes to about  70 percent. The notion "bankruptcy" is hardly appropriate in the  case of the state sector. It would be strange if the owner-state  were to appeal to some other echelons for an improvement in its  own economic unit. What use would it have for a court of  arbitration that would defend its rights as an owner against its  own self, for its own credit?    The state has enough instruments and opportunities available  to it to rescue its plants, banks, and mines. Privatization is  one of the main instruments. For an enterprise, it may become a  way to attract capital and to motivate, or if need be replace,  the manager in the absence of all pressure from the courts.  Besides, the state has an opportunity to support through grants  and subsidies those of its enterprises which, as it believes,  are necessary to keep and in the absence of which it will not  survive.    There is the mechanism of state credit. Finally, there are  state requisitions, which perhaps should be distributed  primarily among state enterprises so that the state will act as  a guarantor of social protection for its hired employees.    [Kovalskaya] It looks as if the state is doomed to  "nourishing" state enterprises in one way or another, be it  through easy credit, grants, or requisitions. Will the budget  endure this?    [Belyayev] As far as I am concerned, I started with  privatization. Let us draw a distinction. If an enterprise in  its entirety fills state requisitions and receives 100 percent  grants from the state, this is no longer an enterprise, but  rather a state office, even if it produces goods or technologies  in all of this. There are few of those in our country. If  everyone is interested in these offices, and the budget has  money to maintain them, insolvency is out of the question.  Besides, as a rule, it is forbidden to privatize such  enterprises.    However, a much greater number of enterprises are not  covered  by bans on privatization but are in no hurry to do this, because  they hope for various types of support in the form of grants or  easy credit. Well, there is not going to be easy credit any more.    Besides, let us grasp this: as we extend credit to  enterprises through commercial banks, we thus provide credit to  the banks, too. Meanwhile, virtually all of them are no longer  state-owned, because their founders, as a rule, have become  joint-stock companies in which the share of state property is  declining rapidly. It turns out that the state extends easy  credit to commercial banks without rhyme or reason. Therefore,  the state should raise the issue of the need to privatize as  soon as possible before an unprofitable enterprise. We are  talking here about special privatization procedures: through an  investment competition. Our administration is now working on a  relevant statute.    Here it is for you, restructuring before court proceedings.  The enterprise will be helped with funds, but those of private  investors rather than the state. The interests of the labor  collective should be taken into account in the process. That is  to say, the new owner will have to ensure all social guarantees  that were given by the previous owner, i.e., the state. Perhaps  in most cases it is necessary to ensure, for a period of time,  the preservation of jobs and the labor collective itself in  order to prevent a social explosion, not only at enterprises,  but in the territories.    Of course, it may be resolved to entirely liquidate an  unprofitable state enterprise. However, we would like this to  occur only with the consent of a collective if it is meant to  happen.    [Kovalskaya] All of this is about state enterprises. What  about those converted to joint-stock operations?    [Belyayev] In cases in which the state retains the  controlling share or holds the golden share, it may, just as it  has previously initiated the privatization of this enterprise,  force through structural changes at the enterprise now through  the procedure of declaring it bankrupt--of course, in the event  that a continuing drop in production, indebtedness, and so on  are evident.    Who will initiate bankruptcy in this case? Shareholders are  still frequently unable to understand in a timely manner that  they have encountered genuine insolvency. In this instance, our  administration may display initiative by filing documents with a  court of arbitration. Declaring an enterprise bankrupt does not  at all mean that jobs will be liquidated. Apparently, it will  just have to change either the manager or the output mix, or  both, and in addition find an investor. In this situation, our  initiative constitutes sufficient grounds for the consideration  of the case by a court.    [Kovalskaya] What about enterprises that are privately owned  in their entirety?    [Belyayev] In this instance, we are a powerful supervisory  organ. That is to say, we verify to what degree the bankruptcy  procedure conforms to legislation, how precise the decisions  made are, and to what degree they are in line with the  documentation filed. We may act as experts, we may become  guarantors for documentation submitted to courts.    However, perhaps the foremost task of our administration is  that we must write a number of regulatory acts for enterprises  of all forms of ownership from which courts and creditors will  proceed. As of now, there is no proven bankruptcy procedure;  there are not even any criteria by which it would be possible to  judge whether a particular enterprise needs state support by  reason of its having statewide significance, or whether  restructuring is necessary.    We would like to help private enterprises to learn to figure  out for themselves by what criteria they can make a judgment as  to their solvency or insolvency. We count on developing some  sort of test questionnaire and obligating enterprise managers,  at state and private enterprises alike, to fill it out  periodically, so that the sore spots and dynamics of development  will be obvious to managers themselves or shareholders. This may  prepare them for the decision about the need to voluntarily  declare themselves bankrupt or take other measures urgently.    Bankruptcy does not mean punitive actions with regard to the  production potential of the country, but rather steps in the  direction of its recovery. Structural changes in the economy may  and should occur through the institution of bankruptcy.    [Kovalskaya] Still, while regulatory documents are lacking,  can you say even a few words about the criteria from which you  will proceed in developing them?    [Belyayev] I do not want to waste your time. Each sector  will  have its own criteria; virtually each sector has its  peculiarities. Nonpayments are the common, traditional  criterion. However, under our conditions we will have to  consider each specific case: By and large, an enterprise is a  debtor, while other enterprises owe still greater sums to it.    Or else, this example: virtually everyone owes to the energy  industries. Perhaps this has to do with the power industry  personnel, who build literally all outlays into the producer  cost of power, including social security until the year 2050.    In addition to our administration, a few more ministries are  working on the criteria at present, including the Ministry of  the Economy and the Ministry of Finance.    [Kovalskaya] You have mentioned the possible "voluntary"  bankruptcy and even "voluntary liquidation" of an enterprise. Do  you indeed believe that this is realistic?    [Belyayev] If this is a state enterprise, the task comes  down  to the owner (the state) persuading the labor collective not to  oppose such a decision. It is just that it should be explained  to the people that it is better for them to agree to liquidation  themselves, and in this case the state will be obliged to  guarantee certain social welfare to the employees. Otherwise,  the enterprise may die its own death, that is, this time around  without any guarantees: it is just that machine tools will stop  because there will be no raw materials, and wages will no longer  be paid....    If the collective is not at all prepared to go for  liquidation, it might want to try rescuing the enterprise on its  own, given that the state has acknowledged its impotence in the  matter. In this case, the collective may lease its enterprise,  but under a different law. I think that this particular scenario  will be frequently followed at small enterprises.    It may so happen that a creditor will show initiative, and  an  enterprise, without taking things all the way to court, will  agree to a voluntary bankruptcy. Our administration acts as the  owner on behalf of the state and must find an outside manager  for the enterprise.    [Kovalskaya] That is, a new director?    [Belyayev] That is not important. The outside manager may  replace the director or keep the old one, but under his control.  It is important that crucial decisions will now be up to the  manager: for example, changes in the output mix of the  enterprise, the sale of some assets, and so on.    We are planning to hold a series of "exhibition  bankruptcies"  in order to make the experience gained the foundation for  regulatory documents. We are now receiving information from  various regions concerning the state of affairs locally. We will  soon complete the collection of information, select a few  unpromising enterprises, and take them step by step through all  the necessary stages, up to the court ruling.    [Kovalskaya] Why "exhibition"? For the edification of the  obstinate, so to say?    [Belyayev] So that they will not be afraid. Our most  important goal may be to prepare society psychologically. The  people should understand that bankruptcy is an ordinary economic  procedure; they should get used to the word. After all,  bankruptcy does not mean either that the lives of enterprise  employees are shattered or that the career of the entrepreneur  is finished.    The insolvency of an enterprise does not necessarily  indicate  the resourcelessness of the owner or manager. It may be a  consequence of absolutely outside, random things: for example, a  coup d'etat has occurred in the country that was the principal  importer of the products of the enterprise. The same  entrepreneur may be commercially successful another time, in  another place. Of course, the procedure presupposes that each  hired employee who is affected by bankruptcy will enjoy social  protection.    [Kovalskaya] Nonetheless, all kinds of terrifying statistics  of the projected growth of unemployment are being given. How can  one not be scared?    [Belyayev] Actually, unemployment has already become a  reality: while not technically laying off employees, many  enterprises operate two to three days per week, or altogether  suggest that employees take forced leaves. This hidden  unemployment is particularly dangerous because it is precisely  the one to criminalize our society to the greatest degree, to  bring about the outflow of the most flexible and capable people  from enterprises, and to hamper structural changes. So, what  else is there to fear?    The bankruptcy procedure as such will not boost the number  of  the unemployed. Things should not be painted in such a way that,  supposedly, enterprises sustaining cities will be closed by  court rulings tomorrow, and millions of people will be left with  no food or a roof over their heads. No one intends to throw  anyone out onto the street: nobody is suicidal, either in the  government or among the economists.    Be so kind as to tell me: Can you imagine not even a few  thousand, but a few dozen people being just thrown out onto the  pavement in our country? It is not just our society, it is our  entire nation that has social orientation. Besides, we do want,  after all, to adhere to an international convention on the  protection of the rights of the working people, under which each  country must guarantee a certain social status to each employee  affected by a bankruptcy.    However, if we are in no hurry to have bankruptcies and to  allow insolvent enterprises to die a natural death little by  little, the explosive growth of unemployment is unavoidable, and  a social explosion is quite likely.    [Kovalskaya] This is hard to understand: If bankruptcies  presuppose, among other things, liquidations of insolvent  enterprises, how can the state offer guarantees against  unemployment? Where are the people to go?    [Belyayev] Social guarantees may also take the form of  instruction and new skill acquisition free of charge. We lag  badly in the area of cadre retraining. The country is  experiencing an acute shortage of employees in the service  sector: it employs between 20 and 30 percent of the population  in developed countries, but barely 5 percent here. Meanwhile, we  are afraid of unemployment! Labor released in production shall  be siphoned off into the service sector, into small businesses,  instead of frightening the people with talk that they will end  up unemployed and impoverished tomorrow.    When we talk about guarantees, we are not preparing sops for  the population. Our task is to help the people in  psychologically accepting the change in their status and  technically mastering a new business. The experience of  Scandinavian countries and Germany, in which the retraining  system is highly developed, indicates that retraining may be  established even at operating enterprises. Among other things,  our administration must work in this area together with trade  unions, regional employment centers, and the Ministry of Social  Protection.    [Kovalskaya] You will not touch enterprises sustaining  cities  for now, will you?    [Belyayev] We definitely will.    [Kovalskaya] Are you not afraid?    [Belyayev] We are afraid of not touching them and leaving  them to die.    [Kovalskaya] What are you going to do with them?    [Belyayev] We will decide this in each specific case. The  output mix may be changed in some cases, but, for example, the  unprofitable mines of Vorkuta--there is no way to change their  output mix. Obviously, the people will have to be moved from  there.    [Kovalskaya] Incidentally, about mines. This is an industry,  one of the few, in which a genuine influential workers' movement  exists. It is precisely this movement that comes out against  unprofitable mines being converted to joint-stock operations.  Leaders of the Independent Trade Union of Miners are saying: The  industry should be brought to a certain level of profitability  first, and privatization should be carried out next.    [Belyayev] Actually, it is the other way around: the path to  profitability leads through privatization. The state will not be  able to cope with the industry without bringing in investment.  However, a number of mines will, of course, have to be closed.    [Kovalskaya] In which industries do you plan to begin  testing  the bankruptcy procedure?    [Belyayev] Our position in principle--in various industries,  perhaps, at first in those best prepared, in those where we find  understanding at the level of ministries and enterprise managers.    [Kovalskaya] Does this happen?    [Belyayev] Naturally. We have established a good,  businesslike relationship with the Ministry of Transportation  and the Ministry of Machine Building. In the immediate future,  we will certainly establish such relationships with others. It  is completely wrong to believe that some kind of anti-reformist  reactionaries have ensconced themselves there.    Do you recall that initially the community of directors and  ministerial functionaries received privatization poorly? By now,  many have become its supporters, and even champions. The same  will happen with bankruptcy as soon as it becomes obvious that  it furthers the recovery of the industry and the entire economic  mechanism.</p>

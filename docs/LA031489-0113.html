			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GORBACHEV BLAST AT YELTSIN IN '87 DISPUTE IS TOLD  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev joined with Soviet conservatives to crush former  Moscow Communist Party chief Boris N. Yeltsin's challenge to his reform  program, once-secret papers showed Monday.  </P> <P> The papers reveal that leading reformers in the Soviet leadership united with  old-time figures, including Politburo conservative Yegor K. Ligachev, at the  height of a Kremlin dispute 18 months ago.  </P> <P> At the time, Gorbachev hailed Ligachev as a dedicated backer of reform and  attacked Yeltsin, accusing him of putting personal ambition above the party,  according to a report on a stormy meeting of the party's policy-making Central  Committee in October, 1987.  </P> <P> Copies of the report, published in the February edition of Central Committee  News, circulated among Soviet officials and journalists Monday.  </P> <P> Yeltsin, once identified as closely in tune with Gorbachev's reforming spirit  and now campaigning for a political comeback as a candidate in new-style Soviet  elections for a democratized legislature to be held March 26, says reform is  not going ahead fast enough.  </P> <P> The 1987 meeting followed a speech at the session by Yeltsin arguing that  Ligachev was acting dictatorially, that too much praise was being heaped on  Gorbachev and that perestroika -- restructuring -- was lagging.  </P></p>

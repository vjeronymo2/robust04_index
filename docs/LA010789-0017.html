			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SETTING THE STAGE FOR PEACE  </P> <P> Thank you for publishing the article by Salam Al-Marayati and R. Ibrahim, "To  Set the Stage for Peace, Israel Must Agree to Steps U.S. Asked of Palestinians"  (Op-Ed Page, Dec. 28).  </P> <P> I, as a common, concerned American, fully endorse and support their viewpoint.  The article is timely, accurate, relevant and fair. The Israeli government must  be persuaded to overcome its intransigence and accept the reality of Palestine  so that Christians, Muslims, Jewish and other minorities can be spared further  pain, anguish, torment and the sanctity of human life can be restored.  </P> <P> We Americans have always been champions of human rights and it's our moral,  ethical and political duty to help homeless Palestinians have their own  homeland and save Israel from its self-destructive course.  </P> <P> ALI M. KHAJAWALL  </P> <P> Diamond Bar  </P></p>

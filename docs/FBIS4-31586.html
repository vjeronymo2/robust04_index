			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Kragujevac, June 12 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Defence  Minister Pavle Bulatovic said on Sunday that the defensive  capability of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.) was  well maintained despite the big problems and all objective  hardships caused by the two-year-old international sanctions.    Bulatovic, in an interview to Radio Kragujevac, Serbia,  pointed out that the Army of Yugoslavia had a highly developed  system of the country's defences.    "It is common knowledge," said he, "that Yugoslavia does not  have any territorial claims on any of its neighbours, but it is  ready to respond to aggression of any kind." He confirmed that  some of the neighbour states were launching provocations along  the Yugoslav borders, counting on external support. This, as he  said, was nothing new, because they used to do the same whenever  they thought Yugoslavia was weakened by internal troubles and by  pressures exerted by the big powers.    Asked about the danger of Yugoslavia's being involved in  war,  with reference to NATO violations of Yugoslavia's airspace,  Bulatovic said that ``no one in his right mind has any interest  in involving Yugoslavia into a war, as this would widespread the  war conflagration in the Balkans, and it is the big question  whether (the war) would be limited to this area alone.    "Every impartial observer may realize that Serbia and  Montenegro, that is, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, had not  started the war on the soil of the former Yugoslavia, and that  they have no intention of including themselves in it. On the  contrary, they are doing their utmost for paths to be found for  the establishment of just and lasting peace in these areas,"  said Bulatovic.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Travis expands as profits double to Pounds 20.5m Travis Perkins is paying Pounds 41.8m to acquire the builders' merchants division of AAH, the pharmaceuticals and distribution company, writes Andrew Taylor. Mr Tony Travis, chairman, said the purchase would put the company - the UK's fifth largest builders' merchant - on a par with Harcros and Jewsons, the second and third biggest builders' merchants behind market leader Wolseley. The group also announced more than doubled pre-tax profits of Pounds 20.5m (Pounds 10m) for 1993 on a turnover 14.6 per cent ahead at Pounds 347.7m. Earnings jumped to 13p (6.7p) and a maintained final dividend of 5.5p makes an 8p (same) total. Travis Perkins, which operates mainly in southern England and the south Midlands, currently owns 166 branches. It will be acquiring a further 46 outlets, many of which are in northern England and also in Scotland. Wolseley, the world's biggest supplier of heating and plumbing equipment, operates from more than 600 branches. Rival bidders for the AAH business are thought to have included Wolseley, Meyer, CRH and Erith. Mr Travis said the merchants had benefited from cost cutting in previous years as volume sales increased by about 11 per cent last year, of which only 3-4 per cent was due to previous acquisitions. Prices had also risen by about 3-4 per cent. This had enabled the merchants to increase net margins from 3.2 per cent to 5.7 per cent. Travis Perkins sells a broader mix of products than AAH, which concentrates on lower margin heavyside goods such as bricks and blocks. The builders' merchants business of AAH by comparison generated net margins of about 3 per cent on sales of Pounds 78.3m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.1m in the year March 31 1993. Profits are thought to have increased to about Pounds 2.4m in the current year on similar sales. The purchase price could be adjusted by up to Pounds 5m depending on an audited value of net assets. AAH, which is also negotiating the sale of its Yorkshire Brick subsidiary, said the purchase price represented an exit p/e of 29.4 on 1993 profits. It said the sale would increase AAH earnings for the year to March 31 1994 above market expectations. Following the purchase Travis will be left with borrowings of about Pounds 25m compared with cash of Pounds 11.7m at the end of last year. COMMENT The purchase price is not cheap even on an exit p/e of 24 on 1993-94 profits. Nonetheless, there is plenty of potential for margin recovery and cost savings and the management should be supported. The acquisition not only gives critical mass in terms of purchasing power but also improves the regional spread of the business - only five outlets out of 200 are likely to close because of overlap. Profits could reach Pounds 27m-Pounds 28m this year rising to Pounds 36m-Pounds 38m in 1995. Worth having in your portfolio in a sector which looks becoming increasingly aggressive.</p>

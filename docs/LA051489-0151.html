			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME PRICES  </P> <P> To complicate further the problem of measuring home prices, we analyze the  characteristics (including price) of new homes sold in California.  </P> <P> Because we measure new-home prices, our prices differ from resale prices. In  large part this difference is due to new-home prices being more influenced by  the pattern of development. In 1988, the lower-priced, faster-growing areas of  the state increased significantly. This caused the statewide increase in  new-home prices to be more modest (6.8%) than the increase in resale price  (+18.4% for detached, +9.3% for condos).  </P> <P> BEN BARTOLOTTO  </P> <P> Burbank  </P> <P>  Bartolotto is research director for Construction Industry Research Board.  </P> <P> Letters must include the writer's name, address and daytime telephone number  and should be sent to the Real Estate Editor, Los Angeles Times, Times Mirror  Square, Los Angeles 90053.

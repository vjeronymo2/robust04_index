			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> H.F. Ahmanson &amp; Co., parent of Home Savings of America and Bowery Savings  Bank, reported that earnings rose 47% in the fourth quarter but dropped 5% for  the year. The Los Angeles-based holding company earned $67.6 million in the  quarter and $202 million for all of 1988. Chairman and Chief Executive Richard  H. Diehl attributed the quarterly gain to higher interest income and record  mortgage loan volume. He said the decline in annual earnings was largely  because of a 76% reduction in after-tax gains on sales of loans and  mortgage-backed securities.  </P></p>

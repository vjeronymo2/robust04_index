			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BAKER NETS NEW FRIENDS BUT NO FISH IN SIBERIA  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III netted new Siberian friends for America  today with little more than a handshake, but fish from Lake Baikal refused to  take his bait.  </P> <P> Home advantage was apparent as Baker took to Lake Baikal with his Soviet  counterpart, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, in a break from two days of weighty  superpower talks.  </P> <P> The secretary of state came home empty-handed. But Shevardnadze landed two,  restoring Soviet pride lost last year during a similar outing in the United  States.  </P> <P> Baker, an expert fisherman, took Shevardnadze fishing for trout in Jackson  Hole, Wyo. The score on that occasion was three fish for the United States and  none for the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Back on the dock, Baker and Shevardnadze plunged into a crowd of about 200  people who pressed forward to shake hands with Baker and wish him well.  </P> <P> "I love Siberia. I love Siberia," Baker told them.  </P> <P> The crowd responded warmly and urged Baker to come back again, prompting  Shevardnadze to comment that the secretary of state was a better-known  personality in this part of Russia than most Soviet ministers.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze had promised Baker a glimpse of the scenic side of the Soviet  Union after the Jackson Hole meeting last September.  </P> <P> He did not disappoint, escorting his guest for a 90-minute ride up the Angara  River to Lake Baikal.  </P> <P> While the ministers and their wives peered out the front of the boat at wooded  cliffs plunging down to the lake, Shevardnadze's 14-year-old granddaughter  Sophie was making friends with Baker's aides.  </P> <P> She was soon laughing and giggling with Baker's personal secretary and the two  ended the trip testing their strength with a bout of arm wrestling -- another  victory for the Soviet Union.  </P></p>

This Environmental Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Statement will address final disposal of decommissioned, defueled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactor plants from cruisers and OHIO (Trident) and LOS ANGELES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (SSN 688) Class submarines and will analyze the associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonably foreseeable environmental impacts. The disposal of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> future reactor compartments from vessels that have not yet been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commissioned (e.g., SEAWOLF Class of submarines) will be addressed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as appropriate, in future National Environmental Policy Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documents. By participating as a cooperating agency in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental Impact Statement, the Department of Energy expects to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be able to adopt this Environmental Impact Statement, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate, to fulfill its environmental review obligations under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the National Environmental Policy Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental Policy Act regulations, the Department of the Navy is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparing this Environmental Impact Statement to focus on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential for significant environmental impacts and to consider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the common design characteristics of the reactor plants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and their reactor compartments, the method currently being used by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington to dispose of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submarine reactor compartments is the preferred alternative for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposal of the defueled reactor plants from cruisers and OHIO and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LOS ANGELES Class submarines. Briefly, this alternative would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involve draining the piping systems, tanks, vessels, and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components to the maximum extent practical, sealing the radioactive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems, removing the reactor compartment and sealing it to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a high integrity welded steel package. The reactor compartment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> package would be transported by barge out of Puget Sound through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Straits of Juan de Fuca, down the Washington coast, and up the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Columbia River to the Port of Benton where it would be loaded onto  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an overland transporter for the short movement to the Department of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Energy's low level radioactive waste burial grounds at Hanford,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Washington.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reactor plants contain radioactivity due to neutron irradiation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of structural alloys forming the reactor plant components. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reactor compartment packages would comply with the shipping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> container requirements of the Department of Transportation, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Department of Energy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Disposal of the reactor compartments would be in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department of Energy requirements for low level radioactive waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposal. Disposal of the reactor compartments would be regulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the State of Washington due to the lead shielding contained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the reactor compartments and by the U.S. Environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Protection Agency due to the small quantity of polychlorinated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biphenyls in materials within the reactor compartment such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insulation, electrical cables, and rubber parts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Navy also will evaluate in detail a ``no action'' alternative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this alternative, the defueled ships would be maintained in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waterborne protective storage for an indefinite period of time at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the inactive ships facilities at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Norfolk Naval Shipyard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several other alternatives will be examined. These alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include sea disposal, land disposal at other sites, land disposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or reuse of subdivided portions of the reactor plant, and above  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ground storage or disposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

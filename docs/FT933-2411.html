			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: BES to help the homeless - The latest offers under the Business Expansion Scheme IN ITS last few months, the Business Expansion Scheme seems to have been entirely devoted to the welfare of Oxbridge undergraduates. One new issue this week seems to be a more logical use of such a generous tax break from the Government. House the Homeless of London is supported by the charity, the Peabody trust. It will be the last issue backed by the Peabody (the BES will be abolished at the end of this year) and hopes to raise Pounds 21m to buy properties in the boroughs of Haringey, Greenwich, Hackney and Hammersmith &amp; Fulham. The Peabody has agreed to buy back the properties in five years time at a price which will bring investors 126p per share, which it claims is the highest currently available return. The annual return to 40 per cent taxpayers will be 14.9 per cent, and for basic rate taxpayers, 10.5 per cent. Although the deal is not cash-backed and lacks a bank guarantor, Peabody has some Pounds 839m of assets. House the Homeless is sponsored by the London-based Downing Corporate finance. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000. The Netherhall Residences scheme is sponsored by brokers James Capel and is guaranteed by Midland Bank which, like Capel, is owned by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank. The Pounds 5m scheme will buy properties for occupation by students of the Netherhall Educational Association, a registered charity. The principal objects of the NEA are described as 'the advancement of education and the training of character in accordance with Christian principles and ideals'. NEA has agreed either to purchase the shares or repurchase the properties after five years; the issue is designed to return 121p after five years with Midland Bank guaranteeing to make up the shortfall. The return equates to 13.99 per cent per annum for top rate taxpayers, or 9.63 per cent per annum for basic rate taxpayers. Minimum investment Pounds 1,000. Perennial BES sponsors Johnson Fry has launched Pathfinder Recovery, a company which will buy London properties, refurbish them and then let them. Other Pathfinder companies, according to the prospectus, have achived a gross rental yield of 12 per cent across a portfolio of 185 residential properties. Unlike most of the other current BES issue, there is no guaranteed price; on the other hand, there is no upper limit on the growth. The company aims to achieve Pounds 1.40 per share for investors by the target date. Blenheim, which will manage the properties, will receive a fee of 1.95 per cent of the funds raised per company, plus a fee of 1 per cent of the total cost of each property bought, plus 4 per cent of the refurbishment costs. Adminstrative costs will be 1.45 per cent per annum and the sponsor will charge an annual fee of 0.5 per cent. If the share price rises above Pounds 1.40, the managers will receive A shares entitling them to 35 per cent of the rise in the value of the company above that level. The minimum investment is Pounds 2,000 and a maximum of Pounds 10m is on offer. Shares are available at 98p until October 5 and 100p thereafter. Johnson Fry is also launching the Eleventh Johnson Fry Super Growth Scheme to raise money for King's College London. The buy-back price is 125p; those who invest before September 27 will pay 99p per share, equivalent to a return for top rate taxpayers of 14.77 per cent per annum. The offer is not cash backed but the property assets of King's are insured for Pounds 632m.</p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / AEEU launches ballot campaign LEADERS of 1m engineers and electricians yesterday launched a Pounds 250,000 campaign urging their members to vote in favour of affiliating with the Trades Union Congress. Next month's ballot by the AEEU will be the first time a big union has asked its members to vote on the issue. The electricians were expelled in 1988 over an inter-union row. The engineers remained inside the TUC. Mr Jimmy Airlie, AEEU executive council member for Scotland, where the AEEU has about 80,000 members, predicted a yes vote north of the border, where the members, including the electrical section, are already affiliated to the STUC.</p>

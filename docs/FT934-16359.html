			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Eurofighter setback delays first flight until next year THE FIRST flight of the Eurofighter 2000, Europe's Pounds 32bn combat aircraft project, has been postponed for several more months at least because of difficulties with the computerised flight-control system. The first prototype had been expected to fly in Germany this autumn, two years later than originally planned. It is now thought unlikely to make its maiden flight before next March at the earliest. The Munich-based Eurofighter consortium did not give a new target date but indicated it would not be this year. A Bonn defence official predicted that the aircraft would not be cleared for flying before next spring. Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain are jointly funding the Pounds 10bn development programme for the aircraft. Eurofighter said the partners had decided to order a further phase of tests for the flight-control system. The first flight should only take place when the partners had 'absolute confidence in the airworthiness of the software'. The software is the responsibility of the UK's GEC-Marconi Avionics as a subcontractor to Daimler-Benz's Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), which is in overall charge of the control system. The so-called fly-by-wire system controls the flaps, rudder and foreplanes - small movable wings at the front of the aircraft - and the aircraft cannot be flown without it. Sources close to the project said 'tough negotiations' were now under way between the industrial partners. Eurofighter, comprising Dasa, British Aerospace, Alenia of Italy and Construcciones Aeronauticas of Spain, said it would try to limit the impact the delay might have on deliveries of the aircraft, due to begin in 2000. 'A further short delay is not considered likely to have a serious impact on the overall programme,' it said. Britain's Ministry of Defence described the setback as 'a minor disappointment'. It said: 'Software safety is of paramount importance and must have priority over any possible delay to the programme.' A joint industry task force has been working in Munich since the spring to resolve the software problems. GEC-Marconi argued earlier in the project that it needed more processing power than was allowed for by Dasa. The UK company's development contract is believed to be worth about Pounds 20m, following a 60 per cent increase due to programme changes. Requirements for the first flight had already been reduced in an effort to meet a September target date, leaving further work on the system for later. Programme managers said they needed to ensure the fly-by-wire system worked in all conceivable circumstances. Concern has increased since the first production model of Sweden's JAS 39 Gripen jet - a smaller aircraft of similar design to the Eurofighter - crashed in August. An investigation found the electronic flight control system was to blame. The Eurofighter project, relaunched last year after Germany threatened to withdraw, has suffered other technical problems, involving its electrical generator and an auxiliary gearbox.</p>

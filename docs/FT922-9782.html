			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: SSAB sell-off expected to raise SKr1.85bn THE SWEDISH government hopes to raise about SKr1.85bn (Dollars 312.5m) next month by selling off its controlling stake in SSAB, the state steel company. The divestment of the 48 per cent of equity, along with 60 per cent of voting rights, is the first stage in the government's ambitious privatisation programme which will include 35 Swedish companies. The SSAB sell-off, which will run between May 19 and June 4, involves an offer of 126,666 units to buyers. Units will consist of government-guaranteed risk-free bonds priced at SKr14,800, including commission, which will be redeemable in January 1994 at a value of SKr17,000. The units also include warrants entitling the holder to purchase 100 SSAB shares at SKr170 each from January 1993 to February 15 1994. The bond is expected to generate a guaranteed yield of at least 10 per cent, less commission. The Swedish government said that 55,000 of the 126,666 units would be offered to the general public, with a further 12,000 reserved for SSAB's employees. The remaining 60,000 units are intended for institutional investors but foreign interests will only be able to acquire up to a quarter of those units. Mr Per Westerberg, the industry minister, said the offer sought to broaden private ownership in Sweden. 'The offer should be attractive to private individuals,' he argued. 'The state offers a risk-free saving with a good rate of interest with the opportunity of gradually going over from saving in bonds to saving in shares.' However, Mr Westerberg added that the method of selling off the state's stake in SSAB would not necessarily be used in subsequent privatisations. 'Each sale must be assessed according to its own conditions and needs. This means that each privatisation will be unique as its practical implementation is concerned,' he said.</p>

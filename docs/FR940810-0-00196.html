Such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests shall include analysis of 3 bulk samples of each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> homogeneous area of PACM collected in a randomly distributed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manner. The tests, evaluation and sample collection shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted by an accredited inspector or by a CIH. Analysis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> samples shall be performed by persons or laboratories with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proficiency demonstrated by current successful participation in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nationally recognized testing program such as the National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Round Robin for bulk samples administered by the American  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) or an equivalent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nationally-recognized round robin testing program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The employer and/or building owner may demonstrate that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flooring material including associated mastic and backing does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not contain asbestos, by a determination of an industrial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hygienist based upon recognized analytical techniques showing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the material is asbestos free.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k) Housekeeping. (1) All surfaces shall be maintained as free as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practicable of accumulations of dusts and waste containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asbestos.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) All spills and sudden releases of material containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asbestos shall be cleaned up as soon as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Surfaces contaminated with asbestos may not be cleaned by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the use of compressed air.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Vacuuming. HEPA-filtered vacuuming equipment shall be used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for vacuuming. The equipment shall be used and emptied in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manner which minimizes the reentry of asbestos into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workplace.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Shoveling, dry sweeping and dry clean-up of asbestos may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used only where vacuuming and/or wet cleaning are not feasible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Waste disposal. Waste, scrap, debris, bags, containers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment, and clothing contaminated with asbestos consigned for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposal, shall be collected, recycled and disposed of in sealed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impermeable bags, or other closed, impermeable containers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Care of asbestos-containing flooring material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Sanding of asbestos-containing floor material is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Stripping of finishes shall be conducted using low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abrasion pads at speed lower than 300 rpm and wet methods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Burnishing or dry buffing may be performed only on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asbestos-containing flooring which has sufficient finish so that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the pad cannot contact the asbestos-containing material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Dust and debris in an area containing TSI or surfacing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ACM/PACM or visibly deteriorated ACM, shall not be dusted or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> swept dry, or vacuumed without using a HEPA filter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Medical surveillance_(1) General_(i) Employees covered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The employer shall institute a medical surveillance program for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all employees who are or will be exposed to airborne  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations of fibers of asbestos at or above the TWA and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excursion limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Examination by a physician. (A) The employer shall ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that all medical examinations and procedures are performed by or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the supervision of a licensed physician, and shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided without cost to the employee and at a reasonable time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and place.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Persons other than licensed physicians, who administer the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pulmonary function testing required by this section, shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete a training course in spirometry sponsored by an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate academic or professional institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Pre-placement examinations. (i) Before an employee is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assigned to an occupation exposed to airborne concentrations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asbestos fibers at or above the TWA and/or excursion limit, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pre-placement medical examination shall be provided or made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available by the employer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Such examination shall include, as a minimum, a medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and work history; a complete physical examination of all systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with emphasis on the respiratory system, the cardiovascular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system and digestive tract; completion of the respiratory disease  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standardized questionnaire in Appendix D, Part 1; a chest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> roentgenogram (posterior-anterior 14&times;17 inches); pulmonary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> function tests to include forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV(1.0)); and any additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests deemed appropriate by the examining physician.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interpretation and classification of chest roentgenogram shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted in accordance with Appendix E to this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Periodic examinations.

Sensors will be located at the Kursk and either Novovoronezh  or Leningrad nuclear power plants. The final choice of the  plant will be done at a meeting of Russian and German  environmental ministers on March 9-10 in Leipzig.    The monitoring system is expected to be used at all nuclear  power plants of Russia's European part by 1995 under an  agreement reached at a meeting of Russian experts that closed  here today. It provides for location of sensors measuring the  radiation level on the area around radiation-danger facilities  (30 kilometers for nuclear power plants). The sensor  information will be passed over to Moscow's Federal Center of  Radiology Control via satellite.    The first stage of the system has been completed at the  Smolensk nuclear power plant. Its information has been  available since December 1993.    The Russian-German cooperation is done within the framework  of an agreement on collection, transfer, analysis and estimation  of radiology information. The document provides for German  equipment of the federal center, supplies of standard software  and development of applied software. The Russian side is in  charge of basic assets, location of sensors and satellite  communications.    The agreement also includes bilateral exchange of  information  once a day under regular conditions and every ten minutes in  case of the radiation level increase.</p>

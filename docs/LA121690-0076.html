			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZAN THOMPSON: RAISING FUNDS, HOT-AIR BALLOONS  </P> <P> Chuck Bump once landed his hot-air balloon at a McDonald's restaurant in  Sherbrooke, Quebec. The immense pear-shaped craft landed beside the microphone  where drive-through customers give their orders.  </P> <P> Bump is a huge man with a bonfire of red curly hair. He lives in Vancouver,  B.C., and was North American hot-air balloon champion for 1988 and 1989.  </P> <P> The voice over the speaker asked for his order and Bump said, "I'll have two  Egg McMuffins and a Diet Coke."  </P> <P> The speaker voice said, "Just drive around to the window and pick up your  order."  </P> <P> "I can't," said Bump, "I'm in a hot-air balloon." The restaurant emptied of  customers and staff who surrounded the big man from space.  </P> <P> Audrey Ann Marie Boyle, Jean Erck and I went to the Stouffer Esmeralda Balloon  and Polo Festival at the Empire Polo Field in Indio on a recent bright blue  Sunday.  </P> <P> Balloon pilots from 14 states and four countries -- among them the current  champions from England, Canada and Holland -- filled the skies, making  crayon-colored shapes against the dark blue mountains.  </P> <P> We chose a table in the fenced area in front of the Stouffer Esmeralda  hospitality tent and prepared to watch the beautiful polo ponies and the fairy  tale balloons. Two men came up and asked if we were using the spare chairs and  Jean, who has a sunshine friendliness said, "Sit with us if you'd like."  </P> <P> They did and we met Chuck Bump and Bob Burch, a champion balloonist from  Quebec. Burch explained that the ballooning event was to raise money to bring a  planetarium to the Children's Museum of the Desert in Palm Desert. Minolta  Camera wants to teach kids astronomy. (Brian Deis, director of marketing and  sales for the Planetarium Division of Minolta, told us that 28% of adults in  the United States think that the sun goes around the moon.)  </P> <P> Bob Burch flies the Minolta balloon and was one of the pilots who took his  balloon to a Coachella Valley School, delighting the kids. Twenty-five thousand  Coachella Valley elementary schoolchildren have already been studying geography  through a program sponsored by Minolta in which they earn ribbons and awards  for recognizing states and countries from clues the teachers give them.  </P> <P> Bob Burch told us that Minolta's founder, Kazuo Tashima, had loved the stars  since he was a little boy, and during the 1950s, he realized that bright city  lights and pollution were robbing the new generation of the wonder of the  stars. In 1956, he began to build planetariums to bring the wonder of the night  sky to as many people as possible.  </P> <P> Bob Burch said, "Would you like to take a balloon ride?" I said yes before Bob  finished the question.  </P> <P> The crew began to blow up the balloon. Bob had brought his envelope (what the  balloon is called) from Montreal. The envelope carries a basket holding propane  tanks that roar hot air into the envelope with the augmentation of a large  electric fan.  </P> <P> When the envelope was filled, Bob and crewman Bill Porter, a Long Beach  photographer, lifted me into the basket and pilot Bob coaxed the balloon into  the sky by adding and subtracting hot air. In a few seconds, we were floating  above the polo field and over the Coachella Valley. There was silence except  when the propane tanks roared their heat into the envelope.  </P> <P> Bob took us up to more than one quarter of a mile. From that altitude we could  see the entire Coachella Valley from the Salton Sea to the east to the town of  White Water at the west end of the valley.  </P> <P> We floated over a perfect date grove, looking into the hearts of palm trees  that look like giant chrysanthemums from above. We floated over golf courses,  picked out freeways and waved to kids who ran to look up as the blue and silver  Minolta balloon went over in utter silence.  </P> <P> Bill radioed, "Minolta chase. Do you read? Copy."  </P> <P> The chase car answered that they could see us and were following our shadow. We  cleared a drainage canal and landed on a private golf course. In seconds, the  white chase van arrived, carrying Valley View School teacher Jim Jones, whose  students had been winners in the geography competition, and his son, Eric, and  Jo Dee Hunt, a balloonophile from Santa Ana.  </P> <P> When we landed, Bill Porter said there was a traditional ceremony for  first-time balloonists. He opened a chilled bottle of champagne from the van  and poured us all a splash of the bubbly.  </P> <P> Then he recited the balloonists' blessing:  </P> <P>  "The winds have welcomed you with softness. The sun has blessed you with its  warm hands. You have flown so high and so well that God has joined you in your  laughter and He has set you gently back again into the arms of Mother Earth."  </P> <P> </P></p>

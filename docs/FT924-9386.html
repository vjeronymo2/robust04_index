			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Survey of Ireland (6): Concern not to over-react / Profile of Tom Healy, of the Dublin stock exchange WHEN the Irish stock exchange severs its umbilical cord to the London stock exchange in about one year's time, responsibility for the market's regulation will fall largely upon the shoulders of Mr Tom Healy, the Irish exchange's general manager. Under planned legislation, the central bank will become the overall regulator of all financial services, delegating specific tasks, such as overseeing the stock market, to persons such as Mr Healy. A graduate in economics from Trinity College, Dublin, he went into public relations and marketing before entering the financial services sector five and a half years ago, when he was appointed the exchange's general manager. Nine months after settling into the job came the 1987 crash. 'Everything that one had learnt about stock markets up until then had to be relearnt,' he says. Since then he has travelled widely, visiting stock exchanges throughout Europe and in places as far-flung as Sri Lanka. He has watched closely the emerging stock markets in eastern Europe (some promoters of which have come to Dublin to seek advice). Turning Dublin into a stand-alone exchange, made necessary by the rapid development of onscreen and paperless trading in the UK, will now be a relatively simple task, Mr Healy says. Ireland's plan, in moving into electronic dealing and settlements, is to aim for demobilisation of paper - rather than its dematerialisation, as in the UK. This requires fewer legal changes, but a new independent status vis-a-vis the London exchange. Mr Healy is emphatic, though, that Dublin's standards will be maintained. 'We will continue to work closely with the regulators in the UK for technical support and advice, to maintain the standards achieved hitherto.' Have not the well-publicised series of business scandals in Ireland pointed to the need for tightening controls? 'We have laws against murder, but people still commit murder. In the best regulated markets there are still scandals and failures.' Mr Healy adds that new standards now being adopted by the accountancy profession - alongside the 1990 Companies Act, which has outlawed insider trading - will make it harder for unscrupulous directors and companies to abuse shareholders and investors. His concern is to avoid an over-reaction leading to unnecessary restrictions being placed on the market as a whole, holding back its development. 'The important thing is that price-sensitive information is made available and out in the open. We must be seen to hit hard at companies that do not disclose the information that they are obliged to. Directors have to be made more responsible for the information their companies provide. That is starting to happen now.' Mr Healy does not share the scepticism of those who think that business will shift to London and other financial centres once the EC single market is completed next year. 'We have effectively been an open market competing directly with London for the past 20 years. Despite that, 95 per cent of dealings in Irish company shares are done through the Dublin exchange. That is a fact that other smaller exchanges in the EC can take encouragement from.' More worrying, he says is the prospect of foreign takeover bids swallowing up one or more of the bigger companies on the Dublin market. The ten top companies on the exchange account for 75 percent of the market's capitalisation. 'A takeover of one or more or those would take the heart out of the market. And we have no major privatisations or a big queue of private companies waiting to be given a listing,' he says.</p>

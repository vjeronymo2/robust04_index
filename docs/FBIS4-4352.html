			<p>BFN     [Text] Vietnam has rejected Cambodia's request for weapons  parts and ammunition to replace dwindling stocks used in the  Cambodian government's offensive against Khmer Rouge bases at  Anlong Veng and Pailin. A well-placed source said yesterday  Hanoi "took note" of the request but made no commitment because  it does not want to be seen as associating with any one  Cambodian party. The source close to the leadership here said  Vietnam also wished to avoid accusations of interfering in  Cambodia's internal affairs.    The request was put forward by Cambodian co-defence  ministers  Tie Banh and Tea Chamrat in talks here Tuesday.    "Vietnam has to be very cautious," said the source. Hanoi  has enough worries with domestic problems. He said the  Cambodian defence ministers sought spare parts and ammunition  for weapons ranging from machineguns to artillery pieces. The  Cambodian ministers reportedly approached Laos before coming to  Hanoi, but the Laotians did not oblige.    As fellow recipients of military supplies from the former  Soviet Union, Laos and Vietnam are the only possible sources of  resupply for the Cambodian army. But Laos and Vietnam only have  what they describe as "self-sufficient" reserves.    The Cambodian defence ministers yesterday morning left Hanoi  for Ho Chi Minh City where they were to meet with the commander  of Army Region 7 and the region bordering Cambodia.    The disclosure coincided with Hanoi's decision for Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet to go ahead with a planned visit to  Cambodia. Mr Kiet is to arrive in Phnom Penh on Saturday and  return to Ho Chi Minh City the next day. Mr Kiet will be  returning a visit to Hanoi in August last year by Cambodia's  co-premiers Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen. Mr Kiet will be  accompanied to Cambodia by Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen  Manh Cam, who went to Phnom Penh last month to lay the  groundwork for the visit.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE GOOD, THE RAD, THE UGLY;  </P> <P> BIZARRE CONDUCT OVERSHADOWS REBELLIOUS SURFER'S TALENT;  </P> <P> RICHIE COLLINS;  </P> <P> Q&amp;A  </P> <P> Just when you thought that any pro surfer belonged on the list of the world's  luckiest men -- right up there with Ringo Starr and Ed McMahon -- along comes  Richie Collins.  </P> <P> The Newport Beach surfer, ranked No. 13 on the Assn. of Surfing Professionals  tour, defends his Op Pro championship this week at Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> Collins travels to the most exotic beaches in the world, won $43,000 in contest  prize money last year and makes more than six figures a year just for wearing a  certain wet suit and endorsing a particular brand of clothing.  </P> <P> Collins is only 21, but he didn't exactly ride one long, smooth wave to the  crest of the sport. This is a young man both driven and torn by his own violent  instincts, a stormy relationship with his father and his "born-again" beliefs.  He's afraid of heights and closes his eyes during takeoffs on big waves. He's  also claustrophobic, which makes plane trips and wipeouts in big surf personal  nightmares.  </P> <P> His talent for riding waves -- he is credited with having invented the floater,  a now-popular maneuver in which the surfer rides on top of the tubed section of  the wave -- has often been overshadowed by his out-of-the-water antics and  temper tantrums.  </P> <P> After a minor traffic mishap in 1988, he smashed his own car windshield with a  fierce head butt, sending witnesses scurrying. And he's so widely disliked by  his peers that when he was jumped and seriously beaten (his wounds required 73  facial stitches) after a dispute in the water, a lot of surfers figured Collins  got what he deserved.  </P> <P> Over the past few years, Collins has run an electric shaver over his head in  much the same way he carves up the face of a wave, and the results have been  some truly bizarre hairstyles, all designed to "make me look ugly." Now, his  coiffure is more Mr. Rogers than Mr. T. and he is somewhat comforted by his  religion.  </P> <P> But Collins is still tormented by the demons of his past. Maybe most  distressing to all who surf is his confession that he gets no pleasure from  riding waves.  </P> <P> Recently, Collins sat down with Times reporter John Weyler in the office of  Waves Tools, the Costa Mesa surfboard shop pioneered by his father, Lance, and  discussed his past mistakes, his hopes for the future, his dreams and his  fears.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Q. You started surfing professionally at age 14, considerably younger than  most. How did you reach that decision and now, in retrospect, do you think it  was the right move?  </P> <P> A. When I was younger, I was surfing (amateur) contests and winning probably  about 80% of them. The other 20%, I'd just jell out and lose or I wouldn't show  up for the final. I wanted to surf (National Scholastic Surfing Assn.) boys'  division when I was 12, but I was too young, they wouldn't let me. So I shined  it and quit surfing for about a year. I was heavily into windsurfing, so I just  windsurfed.  </P> <P> When I turned 14, I turned pro and surfed a contest and finished 16th. Then I  surfed anything professional I could find. I didn't do that great but I tried.  I just got more and more into it. Everyone told me it was a bad decision, but  by the time I was 17 and rated second in the (Professional Surfing Assn. of  America) and had a string of seven finals in a row, everybody was saying maybe  that it wasn't a bad decision.  </P> <P> Then I turned 18, went to Japan just for the heck of it and took 17th in my  first serious (Assn. of Surfing Professionals) event. Then I said, "Man, I'm  going to go on the ASP."  </P> <P> I have no regrets. I'd do the same thing again, but I'd do it a little  different. I wouldn't have been so stupid on my money. I would've saved more.  </P> <P> Q. What kind of influence has your father had on your life and your career as a  surfer?  </P> <P> A. He's been a very hard influence. When I was a little kid, he didn't care  what I did. He didn't want to have nothing to do with me. When I'd surf all the  time, his friends would say, "Hey, the kid wants to surf. Why don't you take  him surfing?" And he'd say, "Shine the little punk."  </P> <P> When I was like 7 years old, I was riding an Animal Tracks board and my dad  owned Wave Tools. Everyone was like, "Make the kid a board. He's out their  ripping on a six-foot, egg-shaped single fin." And he'd say, "Aw, shine the  punk." So I finally surfed with him once and he saw how good I was and decided  to make me a board. So he made me a five-foot twin fin when I was 8 and I was  really stoked on it.  </P> <P> I started competing at 9 years old. He was taking me to all the contests and  sometimes even when I'd do good, he just wrote me off in my face, like, "Just  get your stuff, man, and let's get out of here. You're such a kook, man, you  can't even surf." Here I'm this little 9-, 10-year-old kid and I just won this  contest, and he's telling me this stuff.  </P> <P> He kept laying that into me all my life.  </P> <P> Q. You sound pretty bitter. How would you describe your relationship with him  now?  </P> <P> A. When I quit surfing for that year and started to sail with him a lot, he was  stoked about that. Then when I came back to surfing competition, I went to a  higher level. But he really wasn't behind me. He was behind everyone else. He  knocked me all the time, calling me a kook. I always thought, "I'll show that  guy, I'll be the best."  </P> <P> In a way, I think he was jealous because I was getting more hype than he ever  did. But in a way, I think he was stoked, but didn't know how to show it, so he  was mad all the time. He was a good dad, but always knocked me on everything I  did. . . . He made me want to be perfect in everything I wanted to do.  </P> <P> Q. You've been quoted as saying surfing isn't fun anymore, that you're only  concerned with winning a world championship. Is this a case of burnout?  </P> <P> A. When you start surfing when you're about 3 years old and get really into it  when you're 6 and start competing when you're 8 or 9 and turn pro at 14, you  say, "Wait a minute, this is my business." Then there's the other end of it,  not even surfing-wise, but making surfboards, designing clothes and stuff. Now,  I'm on the tour and I'm trying to watch this (business) over here too. It can  be a burnout.  </P> <P> You come home from an event and your sponsors want you to go somewhere else and  you just go, "Wait, man. I have to win contests and I can't just keep traveling  when I'm totally burned out on traveling."  </P> <P> It's a 360-day, year-round job.  </P> <P> Q. So, do you find yourself thinking more about life after pro surfing? And how  much longer do you plan on competing?  </P> <P> A. Oh, yeah. But I may do ASP contests until I'm 40. If I'm still up that high  and I feel like competing and hassling all the young kids, I'll do it.  </P> <P> Q. The fits of temper that characterized your youth seem to be on the wane. Do  you think you've matured in the past couple of years?  </P> <P> A. My mouth was totally out of control back then, but I've settled down a bit  now because I've proved my point that I could do things. I'm 21. I did a lot in  three years and I've got a lot to show for it.  </P> <P> I've calmed down a lot. My dreams have calmed down some, too, but I still dream  about wars and blowing people away, but I try to stay away from it. I don't  watch as many violent movies.  </P> <P> I'm a warrior for God now.  </P> <P> Q. You've said that channeling the energy of your aggravated, stressed-out  personality into your surfing is a key to your success. Has your less-intense  approach to life hurt your surfing?  </P> <P> A. I think it has slowed me down a little and lightened me up. But I don't  care. I think making money surfing isn't as important as people's feelings now.  (There was a time when) I didn't care about people's feelings. People write in  to magazines and say I'm a real jerk, but they don't really know me.  </P> <P> You see, Jesus wants you to be really humble, but once you're out on the  playing field, your job is to go out there and kick some butt for the Lord.  I'll play by the rules, but I'm gonna be strong and eager to win for God. My  job is to represent the Lord in the water.  </P> <P> God sets a plan for you, but I didn't exactly take a straight line to get here.  If I had followed His plan from the day I was 1 year old, Richie Collins would  be a different person. I'd be where I am right now, but I'd have gotten here a  better way, a brighter way and a more happy way.  </P> <P> Q. So, has your surfing become any more conservative in the process?  </P> <P> A. Yeah. When I was 17, 18 years old, I'd hit the lip on anything, man. I  didn't care. I can't do a floater on a six-foot wave anymore, I'm too scared. I  used to float The Point (18th Street in Newport) when it was eight feet. Now, I  don't do floaters (except in contests). I've torn ligaments in my knee, hurt my  back, had my fin in my leg, no way. The only way I'll hit the lip that hard is  in a heat. I'll save it for a heat, 'cause that's my job.  </P> <P> I'm only 21, but I've been doing it for so long, my bones are just getting  wailed. When I was 18, I was just radical, I just loved going off. Now, man,  I'm kinda mellower, I'm watching the old guys, saying, "Yeah, I gotta be like  them. I gotta use more wisdom."  </P> <P> Q. You room by yourself on the tour, you don't hang out with the other ASP pros  and you used to shave your head with the intent of looking ugly. Do you feel  you have to alienate yourself to be successful?  </P> <P> A. Yeah, I do. I watch a lot of talent go out there and they just hang out with  the boys and party and stay up late and I can see it in their surfing. When  they don't do it for a week, they surf better.  </P> <P> Every time you get drunk, it kills your brain cells. You screw yourself up and  you don't deserve to win. If they don't go too berserk and give us a bad  reputation, it's fine for them. But they can have it. I've never taken any  drugs. It's not me.  </P> <P> God's blessed me with what I've wanted and I'm doing what I'm supposed to be  doing. I've been going with a girl for about a year now and I'm hoping to get  married next year. I don't need to shave my head anymore.  </P> <P> You've got all these pretty boys on the tour and all these girls going, "Oooh,  he's so cute," and then they'd see me and go, "Ugh, look at that guy." And that  was fine. It was like, "Get away from me, you wenches. I don't need you to  flaunt your bodies in front of me. I don't need the devil to blind my eyes."  </P> <P> Q. There doesn't seem to be much disagreement about your talent, but there is  some division about whether you are sincere or simply cultivating a bizarre  image to intimidate opponents. Which is it?  </P> <P> A. It worked, didn't it? (Laughs.) I'm not stupid. I can't write papers, but  you don't have to go to school to make money. I quit when I was 16. I'm a pro  surfer. I made more than 10 grand this month. What do I need a diploma for?  I've got this business. I could retire right now.  </P> <P> I shaved my head to be different than everyone else. Everyone else on the tour  seemed like they were clones. I took a chunk of surfing from here and took it  over to here. It's a totally different image. A lot of people won't admit it,  but I did it and I'm proud of it.  </P> <P> Now, maybe, some kids shave their heads and they're gonna see me in O'Neill  (wet suits) and they're gonna go out and buy O'Neill suits.  </P> <P> Q. Last year, you defeated top-ranked Tom Curren to win the Op Pro. You later  were quoted as saying Curren "surfs old." What did you mean by that?  </P> <P> A. I never said Curren surfed old. That was all bogus. I said Curren's style is  old because everybody copies him and I was sick of watching that Curren style.  The way he surfs is unreal, but the (magazine writer) turned it around and that  really (angered Collins). I had to confront Curren and say, "Hey, dude, I  didn't say that." He said, "Don't worry about it, man, I know how they twist  things around."  </P> <P> I just try to do some of what everybody does, do it all, more of it, but with  more fullness, more roundness. That's my style.  </P> <P> Q. Since every wave is different, judging surfing is, by its nature, a  subjective endeavor. Do you have problems with the way ASP meets are judged?  </P> <P> A. If (surfing was judged) like ice skating, I'd win a lot more. I video other  people and I video myself, and I mean they're surfing good, but I'm doing about  five moves for every two they're doing. If this was ice skating and they were  judging who did the better maneuvers and who did more of them with more flow,  man, I'd win.  </P> <P> I'll start off by throwing a quick floater, then come down and do a snap (turn)  and then hit the lip and the other guy will just do the snap and hit the lip  and I'll get judged lower. How's that figure?  </P> <P> Q. Do you ever confront the judges with these kinds of questions?  </P> <P> A. All the time, man. They just go, "Well, this guy was surfing faster and with  more power." What's the big deal of surfing faster if you're not doing complete  turns? I can go straight down the line and throw a bunch of spray, it's easy. I  can do it switch-foot. But let's see this other idiot do a full, roundhouse  cutback, come back and hit the lip and come back and hit the lip again, bam.  </P> <P> What's surfing about? They say there's not enough speed in my maneuvers. What  do they want me to do, put jets on the back of my board?  </P> <P> It's just like with my (surfboard) shaping. I get no respect at all from most  surfers. They say, "Your boards only work for you." But if they don't work, how  did I get this far riding them? And I've got these little kids coming up who  are surfing my boards and they're gonna kick these guys' butts some day, just  blow them out of the water.  </P> <P> Wave Tools is backed now by, well, if it wasn't for God we wouldn't be nowhere,  but God put me in the position where I am now, you know, winning the Op and  getting all this publicity all over the world. Otherwise, this board company  wouldn't be around now.  </P> <P> So if this business is still in business because of me, I want it to be part of  me and do what I want it to do. Or I'll just go, "Hey, I don't want anything to  do with the business." And I'll let the thing go out of business if they don't  listen to me.  </P> <P> Q. You admit to being afraid of heights but your father can recall a time at  Black Sand Beach in Hawaii when you were only 13 and taking off on 12-foot  waves that frightened him. What drives you to keep surfing despite your fears?  </P> <P> A. Every time I take off on a big wave, I close my eyes. I just start calling  myself names. I say, "Go, you big (sissy). This is it. You've got to go." If I  looked down, I'd freak and back out. So I close my eyes until I stand up and  then it's too late (to back out).  </P> <P> I do it because I have so much anger inside me. And I want to make all those  people who said I couldn't do it eat their words.  </P></p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Observer: Red in tooth and Klaus Vaclav Klaus, the irascible Czech prime minister, was in fine fettle at the Adam Smith Institute in London yesterday. 'The Czech republic is no longer a post-communist country in transition . . . Now we're a normal country adjusting to the post-transformation realities,' he told his pinstriped audience. 'Our inflation is 10.9 per cent  -but that's annual, not monthly as elsewhere in the post-communist world - and our unemployment, at 3.8 per cent, is at levels which Mr Major can only dream of.' Splendid. Wait a minute. What about the notion that Czech unemployment is relatively low only because the country has yet really to make a start on painful economic restructuring? Steam emerged from Klaus' ears. 'Nonsense,' he barked. High unemployment comes from slow restructuring; low unemployment from rapid restructuring. Ergo, the Czech republic's low unemployment is proof of successful, rapid restructuring. Breathtaking logic. But Klaus was reminded that restoring government wage controls last year seemed to contradict his famed love of laisser faire capitalism. Nonsense again. 'Part of a rational wage policy,' came the huffy reply. And keeping wages artificially low is of course a million miles away from maintaining disguised unemployment, that typical feature of socialist full employment.</p>

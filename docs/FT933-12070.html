			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / EC agrees to links by steelmakers THE European Commission, yesterday gave the go-ahead for Usinor Sacilor, the world's second largest steelmaker, and Arbed, the Luxembourg steel producer, to rationalise their businesses. The merger and swap of activities is the latest deal between Arbed and Usinor of France to have received Commission blessing. The aim is to restructure the depressed European steel market. The announcement comes two days before the Commission debates scaled-back plans for Brussels to vet more cross-border takeovers. Under the Usinor-Arbed agreement, Arbed will specialise in the production and marketing of sheet piling and beams now carried out by both companies. Usinor will take over Arbed's wire road and rails business, except rails for travelling cranes.</p>

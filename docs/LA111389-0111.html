			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> STYRON TELLS PAST SUICIDE LURE  </P> <P> Novelist William Styron says that in 1986 he almost joined the ranks of such  authors as Ernest Hemingway, Virginia Woolf and Jack London who have committed  suicide.  </P> <P> "Like many great American writers," Styron wrote in December's Vanity Fair, "I  used alcohol as the magical conduit to fantasy and euphoria, and to the  enhancement of the imagination."  </P> <P> But in 1985, Styron's body suddenly rejected alcohol, "which for so long had  kept my demons at bay." Deprived of this crutch, depression swooped in.  </P> <P> After months of emotional darkness, he said, he redrafted his will, penned a  suicide note, and threw out a prized personal journal in preparation for  killing himself.  </P> <P> But, he said, "I drew upon some last gleam of sanity," and the next day checked  himself into a hospital for treatment.  </P></p>

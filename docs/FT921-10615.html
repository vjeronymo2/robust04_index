			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Genscher proposes states to join EC POLAND, Czechoslovakia and Hungary should be made full members of the European Community 'as soon as possible,' Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the German foreign minister, said at the close of a one-day visit to Warsaw, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. Mr Genscher explained that the recently signed association agreement between Brussels and the three central European countries for a gradual removal of trade barriers on non-farming goods by the end of the century, meant that the path to full membership 'could be shortened.' However, he added that the moment of full membership would depend on 'economic progress.' Mr Genscher's visit was designed to establish contact with Poland's new government, which met yesterday to give preliminary approval to economic plans for this year. Mr Jerzy Eysymontt, the chief minister responsible for the economy, said afterwards that the Polish budget deficit this year would reach 5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), a slight increase on 1991, when the deficit touched on 4 per cent of GDP.</p>

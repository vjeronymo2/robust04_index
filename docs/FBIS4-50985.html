			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Agatha Ngai] </F>   [Text] Presidents of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao working  on the mainland will have to apply for a work permit and have it  renewed annually as China tightens its control of the labour  market. Residents from the three areas will need valid permits  from early this year.    Labour Ministry spokesman Liu Guanxue said the move was  aimed  at controlling the number of foreign workers. The growth of  foreign workers threatened opportunities for local people he  said. Exact quotas had not been fixed, but Mr Liu said the  application fee for permits would be "minimal".    New regulations make employers responsible for applying for  permits for their staff from labour bureaus. Applications then  go to the Labour Ministry for approval. Failure to comply with  the procedures would result in the disqualification of employees  from working in China.    Applicants for permits should hold travel documents and  would  be required to provide evidence of their qualifications to prove  their calibre and experience. The regulations also stipulate  all employment contracts should follow Chinese law. The Labour  Ministry would resolve contractual disputes by reference to the  local legislation.</p>

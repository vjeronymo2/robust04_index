The level of complexity of the project should be described. Only technical information that supports the technical validity and the likelihood of success of the demonstration project should be provided. Also, a rough description of the technique and methodology to be employed to measure and evaluate the performance of the demonstration should be provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section 5_Project Team Qualifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The qualifications and role of each participating project team member, company or organization should be described. A description of key project personnel (project manager, engineering staff, consultants, etc.) qualifications including relevant skills, work experience, and education should be briefly summarized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section 6_Project Overall Estimated Cost and Resources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The overall project cost should be estimated along with the approximate cost-share breakdown by all parties providing resources to the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section 7_Letter of Intent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Appropriate upper management within the industrial end-user company must provide a letter of intent to support the demonstration project. This letter will show evidence that the company upper management (e.g., Vice President, Engineering Director/Manager, Plant Manager, etc.) is aware, endorses, and is supportive of the project at the proposed facility, and the company will provide some level of resources to the project, if selected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Section 8_MOTOR CHALLENGE Application Forms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each participating proposing Showcase Demonstration team member company or organization must join the MOTOR CHALLENGE program by submitting an appropriately completed application. Applications can be obtained by calling the MOTOR CHALLENGE hotline number at 1&hyph;800&hyph;862&hyph;2086. This section should contain all completed application forms.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Availability of Federal Funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Approximately $2 million in FY 1995 of Federal funds is expected to be available to support the activities, authorized pursuant to Section 2101 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, 42 U.S.C 13451, in support of the Showcase Demonstrations. These Federal funds will be managed through the DOE Office of Industrial Technologies' Electric Motor Systems program. Subject to the availability of appropriated funds, up to 25 proposals may be selected as Showcase Demonstrations in accordance with the evaluation criteria stated below. All selected Showcase Demonstration projects will receive no Federal financial assistance, but will be provided technical assistance by DOE as stipulated above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Technical Evaluation Criteria and Review Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Preliminary-proposals and final proposals will be reviewed and technically evaluated by the Review Panel of DOE-selected experts. The preliminary-proposal evaluation is to preliminarily accept a comprehensive set of projects for which detailed engineering and final proposals will be prepared as Showcase Demonstration projects. As mentioned above, other technically-interesting preliminary-proposals that are not selected as Showcase Demonstrations may be selected as Case Study Briefs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Preliminary-Proposal Technical Evaluation Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All preliminary-proposals submitted in response to this notice will be technically evaluated by four major categories as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Category 1) Overall technical merit. The overall technical merit will consider such factors as:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The technical description of the proposed Showcase Demonstration project that supports the practicality and likelihood that the project will achieve success and the benefits claimed;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The description provided by the proposer as to how the demonstration's performance will be measured. That is, the proposer must illustrate that reliable and defendable performance measurement techniques will be employed to ascertain the project's costs and benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Category 2) Economic significance if the project were to be successfully replicated within the company and throughout the United States. Factors to be evaluated that will influence the ability of the Showcase Demonstration to impact the market are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The estimated benefit/cost of the demonstration and some indication of cost-effectiveness (e.g., life-cycle cost, payback, internal return on investment) of the proposed electric motor and drive system technologies to be employed. That is, the life-cycle cost advantages of the technology to be demonstrated relative to conventional technology or systems that would accomplish the same process output, function, or duty;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

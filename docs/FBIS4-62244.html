			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yuliya Pshenko: "Yaroslav Kendzyor Calls on </F> Ukrainian Patriots To Send All Forces Against Kuchma"]    [Text] Ukrainian People's Deputy Yaroslav Kendzyor, at a  news conference held at the Lvov Mayoralty, divided deputies of  the new parliament into four tentative blocs. Thus, according  to Yaroslav Kendzyor, the first bloc -- purely communist --  comprises 138 deputies. The second one, "left center," which  was named by him, is composed of deputies from the so-called  "party of power," as well as deputies from the Party of  Democratic Revival of Ukraine and the Labor Party, and it  comprises 72 legislators. The right center comprises 53  deputies from Rukh and the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists.  Only five people's deputies comprise the right wing. These are  representative of the Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party  and the Ukrainian National Self-Defense.    Yaroslav Kendzyor believes that if the left and right wings  of the center unite, they will have the same number of deputies  as the communist bloc. Therefore, a battle for so-called  independent deputies will be waged in parliament.    Commenting on the presidential elections, Yaroslav Kendzyor  said that "the candidacy of Leonid Kuchma is the most  dangerous." Moreover, Yaroslav Kendzyor confidently told  journalists that "there have been reports that Kuchma will be  supported in the elections by certain political and business  circles in the United States." He also called on all Ukrainian  patriots to vote for a candidate who will be able to strip  Kuchma of as many votes as possible.</p>

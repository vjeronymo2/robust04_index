After continuous  experiments, the SS removal rate in the pretreatment unit was  found to be more than 80 percent, the reduction rate of the  Volatile Suspended Solid (VSS) in the SS methanization reactor  was 51-79 percent under temperature conditions of 25-35C  and HRT 4.2-10.2 days, and the effluent from the nitrogen  removal unit was stable at BOD of less than 2 mg/l and T-N of  less than 5 mg/l.  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   Since 1988, this test plant experiment has been carried out  as a part of the AQUA RENAISSANCE'90 PROJECT (a national project  of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry of Japan).  The objective of this Project is to develop a new system based  on a combination of bioreactor and separation membrane  technology, which can efficiently treat industrial waste water  or sewage to recover methane gas from organic matters contained  therein. In this study, sewage was treated. Today, in developing  a new sewage treatment system, energy saving, minimization of  sludge production, improvement of treated water quality,  environmental protection, and such like, must all be taken into  account to meet the needs of the times.    The greater part of organic matter contained in sewage is in  the form of suspended solids (SS). In the system used for this  study, SS separated from sewage is treated in a methane  fermentation (SS methanization) reactor combined with a  separation membrane module, while SS-separated sewage is  subjected to removal of nitrogen and organic matter in a reactor  combined with a separation membrane module.    Flow Diagram    Figure 1 shows the flow diagram for this experiment.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-58A>      Figure 1. Flow Diagram </FIG>     The sewage is separated into low SS effluent and  concentrated  SS by the pretreatment unit. Then, the separated SS are treated  in the SS methanization reactor combined with the SS separation  membrane module. The low SS effluent from the pretreatment unit  and the permeate of the membrane are mixed and treated in the  nitrogen removal unit combined with the rotary disk membrane.  This test plant has a capacity of 10 m[.sup]3[/]/day in the  basic design.    Characteristics of the Units    Table 1 shows the characteristics of each unit in this  system.     Raw Water    Raw sewage from the existing sewage treatment plant was used  as the raw water for this experiment. The properties of the raw  water are shown in Table 2.       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2.

The SS  concentration of raw and pretreated water, and the SS removal  rate are shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3. The SS removal rate was  continuously more than 80 percent and the unit was able to  steadily supply concentrated water of a SS concentration higher  than 10,000 mg/l.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-59A>      Figure 2. SS Concentration </FIG>    <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-59B>      Figure 3. SS Removal Rate </FIG>     SS Methanization Reactor    The concentrated SS from the pretreatment unit was  solubilized and methane-fermented in this reactor at long SRT by  combination with the SS separation membrane.    We investigated acid fermentation and methanization in  mesophilic and thermophilic fermentation in two periods using  the organic membrane and inorganic membrane. The reason we  report the results of the methanization in two periods is  because the solubilization rate of SS in the acid fermentation  was lower than that in the methanization. SS concentration and  VSS/SS ratio (percent) in the reactor under the long operation  of mesophilic methanization are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5.  The data in Table 3 shows the results of the representative  mechanization of SS.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-59C>      Figure 4. SS Concentration in the Reactor </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-60A>      Figure 5. VSS/SS Ratio in the Reactor </FIG>     The outline of the results in the methanization are as  follows:    -- The VSS reduction rate under the thermophilic  methanization ranged from 67 to 78 percent, but the difference  between the mesophilic and thermophilic methanization was not  big in view of the heating energy. The mesophilic conditions  were therefore better.    -- In the mesophilic conditions, at 35C, the VSS  reduction rate was 51-79 percent (solubilization rate based on  TOC was 45-56 percent) under the VSS volumetric load of  0.93-1.94 Kg/m[.sup]3[/]-day and the HRT of 4.2-8.4 days.  This efficient treatment compared with the conventional  anaerobic digestion of SS in HRT of 15-30 days was reached by  combination with the membrane module.    -- Decreasing the temperature from 30 to 25C in the  reactor did not greatly influence the VSS reduction rate. It was  possible to maintain a rate from 67 to 70 percent with a VSS  volumetric load of about 1 Kg/m[.sup]3[/]-day.  (Solubilization rate was 52 percent.)    -- The volume of recovered methane from charged VSS was  maintained from 270 to 317 l/Kg-VSS except for one case.    SS Separation Membrane Unit    Separation and returning of SS to the reactor by this  inorganic membrane unit guaranteed a long SRT and the permeate  contained almost no SS (SS &lt; 1 mg/l).    The results of the long time operation are shown in Figure  6.[.sup]1[/] The permeate flux was maintained at 0.6-1.0  m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]-day and the membrane module could  be operated for the liquid containing high concentration SS  (55,000 mg/l). TOC of the permeate was different between the  mesophilic methanization (10-30 mg/l) and thermophilic  methanization (500-1800 mg/l). Figure 7 shows the  characteristics of the permeate flux to the SS concentration and  membrane surface flow rate.[.sup]1[/]   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-61A>      Figure 6. The Results in Long Operation </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-018L-61B>      Figure 7. Characteristics of the Permeate Flux </FIG>     Table 4 shows the optimum conditions and the performance of  this membrane unit. In this case the power consumption for  membrane permeate was 6.92 Kwh/m[.sup]3[/]-permeate  (efficiency 51 percent). That value is not big because the  quantity of the concentrated SS into the SS methanization  reactor was about 1 percent of the raw sewage water.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 4.

For the rotary disk membrane module,  polysulfone membranes having a cut-off molecular weight of  750,000 were mainly used.    When the denitrification tank had the same volume as the  nitrification tank, the total nitrogen (T-N) removal rate was  about 75 percent when methanol was added to the inlet water.  Without the addition of methanol, this rate was about 52  percent. At a volumetric T-N load of 0.24 kg/m[.sup]3[/]-day  in the nitrification tank, and with 40 mg/l of methanol added,  the BOD and T-N of treated water did not exceed 2 mg/l and 5  mg/l, respectively.    After the denitrification tank was transformed to increase  its volume twofold, it was possible to obtain treated water with  a BOD of less than 2 mg/l and T-N of less than 5 mg/l without  addition of methanol at a volumetric T-N load up to 0.14  kg/m[.sup]3[/]-day. In this case, the permeate flux was about  1.2 m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]-day under the operating  pressure of 0.2 kg/cm[.sup]2[/] and MLSS of 14,000-15,000  mg/l.[.sup]2[/]    Water Quality    An example of the water quality in the system is shown in  Table 5.   <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   The pretreatment unit was able to supply the low SS water  (removal rate &gt;  80 percent) and concentrated SS (SS &gt;  10,000  mg/l) steadily and continuously. So the methanization of the  concentrated had a higher efficacy rate in the reactor combined  with the membrane (VSS reduction rate of 51-79 percent  (solubilization rate of 45-56 percent), HRT of 4.2-10.2 days,  temperature at 25-35C, permeate flux of 0.6-1.0  m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]-day). The low SS water was treated  by the nitrogen removal unit and effluent was of high enough  quality to be reused (BOD &lt; 2 mg/l, T-N &lt; 5 mg/l).    On the other hand, this system was able to connect the  simple  aerobic treatment unit for the pretreated water in exchange for  the nitrogen removal unit.  <H5>  Acknowledgement </H5>   As a member of the Aqua Renaissance Research Association  (ARRA), we study this investigation which is consigned by New  Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO)  to the ARRA.

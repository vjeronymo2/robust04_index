Just like the parliamentarians who signed the agreement,  these top military officers are also natives of the four regions  in southern Congo -- Niari, Bouenza, Lekoumou and Pool. In the  past few months, citizens of the four regions of southern Congo  have been locked up in clashes in Brazzaville that led to over  200 deaths in the fight between militias of the presidential  group and the opposition.    The plan was drawn up within closed doors in the presence of  General Emmanuel Eta Onka, chief of general staff of the  Congolese Armed Forces, and has been submitted to the  intraregional parliamentary peace committee. Highlights of the  plan have not yet been made public.    The military officers and committee members are expected to  meet on 8 February to examine the plan, Mr. Goma Tsika, a  parliamentarian serving on the committee, disclosed on the  national television.    The rehabilitation of the Brazzaville-Pointe Noire railroad  installations, sabotaged during the political violence, has been  postponed pending the implementation of the plan. The repair  work, anticipated in the cease-fire agreement, were initially  scheduled to start on 1 February but was postponed to 8 February  after an attack by opposition supporters on railway technicians  leaving four dead.    Aside from the resumption of rail traffic that has been  interrupted for the past two months, the cease-fire agreement  also provides for the deployment of a buffer force and the  dismantling of militia forces in Brazzaville.</p>

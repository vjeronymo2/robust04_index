			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Germany's speaker urges greater role for parliaments in EU integration policy Germany's parliament speaker yesterday urged parliaments to play a stronger role in European Union integration policy, Reuter reports from Bonn. Ms Rita Sussmuth told a meeting of MPs from the Twelve and from prospective EU members that legislatures, especially national ones but also the European parliament, had to join in debate ahead of a 1996 summit conference on strengthening the Union. 'The negotiations by governments must never again take place out of view of the public, as happened with the Maastricht treaty,' she said according to an advance copy of her speech. 'The best understanding of democracy is that public interest is best represented by the participation of parliaments, which are elected for this purpose.' The Maastricht accords on political and monetary union will be reviewed at the 1996 summit of EU leaders, who will have to decide on possible institutional reforms to bolster integration.</p>

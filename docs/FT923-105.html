			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Kenwood warns on trading KENWOOD Appliances, the kitchen equipment company, has warned shareholders that its markets have worsened since it became the first in a line of post-election flotations. Only days before its freedom to comment is restricted by the start of its two month close period, the company told analysts their forecasts were too optimistic. 'Retail trade fell off a cliff for us in July and August,' said Mr Tim Parker, chief executive. 'We are not expecting to make up that shortfall in volume.' On Monday, Kenwood shares fell 42p following analysts' shaving of profits forecasts. The price had drifted from a small premium to its 285p June flotation to 254p before sterling's devaluation gave the stock a fillip. Kenwood closed 7p lower at 238p yesterday. Devaluation will help the company, said Mr Parker, as 'sixty five per cent of our business is overseas'. When the company came to the market the directors were confident the current year would provide further growth. 'But since then the picture is much more difficult in the UK and in the European economy, particularly Germany.' 'But that is not to say we cannot yet achieve growth this year,' said Mr Parker. The group is increasing market share with no unexpected impact on operating margins and introducing new models.</p>

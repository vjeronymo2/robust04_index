			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Japan tyre production suffers sharp fall Tyre production in Japan, the world's second largest market, last year experienced its worst decline since the second world war. The manufacturers' plight was exacerbated by poor demand, falling prices, and a deteriorating product mix as consumers bought cheaper tyres, according to the Japan Automobile Tire Manufacturers' Association (Jatma). The industry is suffering from rapidly falling demand in the domestic car manufacturers' market as well as the replacement market. Production fell from 166m units to 150m units. Tyre shipments to domestic vehicle constructors fell 12.1 per cent to 50m units last year. The fall mirrors a 10.2 per cent drop in Japanese vehicle production last year, according to recent data released by the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association. Japanese vehicle exports collapsed 11.5 per cent last year. Jatma said automotive makers had also been particularly aggressive in driving down tyre prices. The domestic replacement tyre market also plummeted from 67.6m to 60.9m units. The association added that mass merchandisers, which aggressively discount prices, had increased their share to nearly 20 per cent of the replacement market. Imports have also been adding to the Japanese industry's troubles. Although imports fell about 5 per cent to slightly less than 14m units, foreign manufacturers increased their share of the market which dropped 9.8 per cent. The US was the largest importer in 1992 with 5m units, followed by Australia with 1.97m units, Taiwan with 1.2m units and Korea with 1m units. Japanese tyre exports fell only 1.2 per cent from 37.4m to 37m, in spite of the strong yen. Mr Akira Suzuki, Jatma's executive director, said no plants had closed over the last 12 months, but extended maintenance periods had cut operating rates from more than 90 per cent in 1992 to just over 80 per cent last year. He expected Japanese companies to increase manufacturing capacity in south-east Asia where costs are lower and demand is rising sharply.</p>

			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> BAND EVOKES ORWELLIAN WORLD;  </P> <P> NITZER EBB PRODUCES HARSH, INDUSTRIAL-STRENGTH TECHNO-ROCK SOUNDS AT CLUB  POSTNUCLEAR  </P> <P> British techno-rock bands tend to be a Jekyll and Hyde bunch that can be found  vacillating between darkly ironic languor and chirpy, pepped-up pop.  </P> <P> Wednesday night at Club Postnuclear in Laguna Beach, Nitzer Ebb's version of  British techno-rock couldn't have been further from that (Depeche) mode. The  trio with the nonsense name played "industrial" dance music that was bluntly  emphatic rather than ironic. As for chirpy pop -- well, Nitzer Ebb (the "i" is  pronounced long, as in 'night') sounded about as chirpy and pop-ish as a drill  press.  </P> <P> A more appropriate British literary reference here would be H.G. Wells'  futuristic science-fiction novel "The Time Machine." Its villains are a  horrific race of industrial gnomes known as the Morlocks, who dwell  underground, operating sinister machinery and cannibalizing the innocent flower  children who live in the sunlight. With its clanging, synthesized beats and  hypnotically repeated chants full of fear and loathing, Nitzer Ebb played  Morlock rock that frequently suggested totalitarian imagery.  </P> <P> For ears that thrive strictly on melody, the concert might have seemed like an  hour in hell. Singer Douglas McCarthy ranted fragmentary tirades in a rasping,  guttural voice. His songwriting partner, percussionist Bon Harris, and guest  drummer Julian Beeston hammered away on electronic drums to produce crashing,  metallic beats. Pre-programmed backing tracks added little in the way of melody  or softening texture. Musical variety consisted of a choice between fast and  slow, dark and not-quite-so-dark.  </P> <P> Still, this was an interesting show, thanks largely to McCarthy's athletic,  pumped-up performing style and the punk-influenced fervor of his yowling. With  short, tousled hair, angular looks and jerk-to-the-beat movements, he resembled  Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo, minus Mothersbaugh's way of sweetening technological  music with pop hooks. At peak moments, when fast, surging beats took hold and  had some of the dancers in the audience leaping and bobbing, Nitzer Ebb  generated a fascinating turbulence.  </P> <P> The music also posed some interesting paradoxes. This was openly mechanized  sound, with each song locked into the structure and time dictates of the  assembly line. With McCarthy barking what often sounded like commands against  this harsh sonic backdrop, Nitzer Ebb evoked a dehumanized, Orwellian world.  Yet, McCarthy's thrashing, sweaty movements and the desperate energy of his  howling conveyed a sense of rebellion -- perhaps doomed -- against mechanized  musical bonds and totalitarian means of social control.  </P> <P> In its most positive song, "Let Your Body Learn," Nitzer Ebb boasted that its  mechanical sound could offer "freedom from fear, giving release." That's a  strange claim for music that so often conjured up chilling images. But it was  music that also kept the audience moving, responding and singing back phrases.  </P> <P> So Nitzer Ebb's industrial hammering did allow a listener some freedom of  choice: It could paralyze the mind and motivate the body or it could invite  speculation about the paradox of modern technology, which has the potential  both to enslave and to liberate. Not a bad evening's work for a band you  couldn't hum along to.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> HONDURAS GETS 12 U.S. JETS  </P> <P> The United States has delivered the last of 12 supersonic jet fighters to  Honduras -- a move that Nicaragua views as threatening the military balance in  Central America, military sources said. Honduras says the F-5 jets, costing a  total of $75 million, will maintain its traditional air supremacy in the region  and replace a fleet of aging, French-built Mirage fighters. However, Nicaraguan  President Daniel Ortega has said his country would be justified in obtaining  Soviet MIG-21 fighters to counteract the F-5s. Meanwhile, about 600 U.S. troops  from Ft. Bragg, N.C., have begun a four-week exercise with Honduran troops near  the Honduran town of La Paz.  </P></p>

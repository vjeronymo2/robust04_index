			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Idle model city mourns a very Swedish past: A look at a miracle cure that was no help at all for Uddevalla's ailing fortunes There are few more forlorn sights in Sweden than the waterfront at Uddevalla, once a thriving shipbuilding city standing at the head of a deep inlet along the country's rugged west coast. Wharfside cranes stand idle and rusting, their jibs dipped mournfully towards the water. The big dry dock lies half-flooded and deserted. Old brick-built workshops nearby are empty and silent. It is a scene familiar from other former shipyard towns in northern Europe. But just across from the dry dock is a sight that makes the plight of Uddevalla especially poignant. There stands a huge factory built less than 10 years ago by Volvo, the car manufacturer. It was to have revitalised the city just as the old ship building industry collapsed. But now it, too, is an empty shell. Uddevalla, a city of 48,000 people, was supposed to be a shining example of what became known as the 'Swedish model'. In the 1980s, while the rest of western Europe began to struggle with high unemployment caused by the decline of traditional heavy industries, Sweden managed to keep jobless rates enviably low by a mixture of close co-operation between government, employers and trade unions and generous retraining schemes. Faced with the closure of the state-owned shipyard in Uddevalla, the Social Democratic government used its clout - and some well-aimed incentives - to nudge Volvo into opening a car plant in the city. Volvo, at the time extremely profitable and keen to put into practice pioneering car making techniques which did away with tedious assembly line work, was happy to oblige. It seemed like the perfect solution. Unemployment in Uddevalla actually fell after the shipyard laid off the last of its 4,500 workers in 1986 - to less than 2 per cent of the local workforce. Hotels sprang up and small companies moved in, encouraged by the Volvo investment. But those heady days proved to be a false dawn. Crippled by falling car sales, Volvo closed its Uddevalla plant last year. Unemployment in Uddevalla now stands at around 15 per cent - above the national average. The 'Swedish model' has given way to a painful reality that is no different from the experience of other recession-struck European countries. Officials at the Uddevalla Kommune (city council) admit they feel betrayed - and abandoned. 'Now the government says the market must decide,' says a bitter Mr Leif Molander, an elected member of the kommune board. But he and his colleagues are also realistic. 'It seemed like a good solution at the time,' shrugs Mr Lars Bjorneld, the planning director. 'The problem was that Volvo couldn't sell enough cars.' In retrospect it is clear that the substitution of the Volvo plant for the shipyard was never as neat a solution as it appeared. Original plans to include a body and paint factory at the Volvo plant were dropped because of a row over emissions from the paint shop. The assembly plant, which employed 930 people at its peak with an annual output capacity of 40,000 cars, did not start real production until August 1988, two years after the shipyard closed. By then most of the shipyard workers had found other work, leaving Volvo with a recruitment problem. 'In 1986 we had to say No to a number of very good people from the shipyard looking for work because we were not ready for them,' says Mr Bengt Berntsson, a Volvo executive now seeking new tenants for the 100,000 sq metre factory. 'Later, when we needed them, they weren't there any more.' This was especially ironic as much of the motivation behind Volvo's decision to built the Uddevalla plant, with its unique production system of small teams building whole cars, was to reduce the chronic problems of labour turnover and absenteeism it was experiencing at its headquarters in Gothenburg. A keen debate persists within the motor industry over the viability of the team-based system. But the harsh reality was that a crash in Volvo sales left the company with 30 per cent excess capacity and in November 1992 it decided to close two of its three Swedish assembly plants. Uddevalla was abruptly exposed to Sweden's recession. Jobs disappeared at an alarming rate as former stalwarts such as the construction industry slumped. The government, too, had changed. In place of the interventionist Social Democrats was a right-centre coalition under Prime Minister Carl Bildt whose recipe for making Sweden competitive again was a radical dose of market policies. After two years of reform and a big currency devaluation, growth is returning, but domestic investment is lagging and there has been a wave of overseas investment by Swedish companies. Volvo has production plants in Belgium and the Netherlands. SKF, the big ball bearing maker which grew up in Sweden's west, now produces only 10 per cent of its output in Sweden. The biggest employers in Uddevalla are the kommune itself and the local health service. 'Our problem is that we need a large industry that can employ a lot of people as an anchor around which we can build,' says Mr Molander. Uddevalla is currently working with a private group on the possibility of re-opening the shipyard. But it is a project that would require an investment of SKr3bn (Pounds 260m) and Mr Molander admits it is a long shot. An example of the way forward for the city seems more likely to be found in a small corner of the Volvo factory where Mr Bengt Bengtsson and two former colleagues from Volvo have set up a small components-sorting company employing 15 people. 'It is not realistic to go back to shipbuilding,' says Mr Bengtsson. He speaks not just for Uddevalla but for all of Sweden when he says: 'The mentality has to change. There is no tradition of small industry. We still have a high cost base in Sweden. But we have good educated people who are flexible and do not need a lot of management. The future lies in smaller businesses, not big industries.'</p>

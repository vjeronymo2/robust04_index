[Fujimori] I have.    [Amoretti] What is your opinion of him?    [Fujimori] First of all he is a good communicator. He is an  eloquent president who always raises original ideas at  international forums.    [Amoretti] Are you on good terms with him?    [Fujimori] Yes. I would say communication with Lacalle is  good. We talked at several international meetings, and on  several occasions he called me from Montevideo.    [Amoretti] And with Enrique Iglesias?    [Fujimori] We have excellent relations. He was among the  first who supported us, and even today he is one of the few who  has always been on our side. We have a lot for which to thank  him.    [Amoretti] You ran in the 1990 elections as the leader of  Change 90, a political group that no one thought would have good  chances of winning the presidency. The victory of writer Mario  Vargas Llosa, the leader of Fredemo [Democratic Front], was  taken for granted all over the world, and also in Peru. Did you  actually expect to win the elections?    [Fujimori] Right, very few people thought I had good chances  of reaching the presidency. To tell you the truth, only four  people and I were expecting a victory.    [Amoretti] And why do you think you won? Why did people  choose an unknown person instead of a famous writer or the old  APRA [American Popular Revolutionary Alliance]?    [Fujimori] First of all, because of the people being fed up  with the Peruvian political system. People were tired of a  system that offered no solutions. Peru lived in democracy, but  what did people get from that? Second, I believe people realized  that we were proposing a government without any links whatsoever  with the major political and economic interests that were  binding Peru. The other candidates, however, clearly represented  continuism, after 500 years of failure.    [Amoretti] Did Vargas Llosa represent that continuism?    [Fujimori] Perhaps he did; perhaps he didn't. But that is  not  the only reason why Vargas Llosa lost and we won. He represented  the elite of Peruvian society, and this drove him away from the  masses. That is why we won.    [Amoretti] Vargas Llosa recently has criticized you and your  government very harshly. What is your opinion of him?    [Fujimori] I'd rather not give an opinion on Vargas Llosa  because I believe his political opinions do not merit  consideration. Like everyone else, however, I believe he is a  good writer.    [Amoretti] You like him as a writer, but not as a  politician.    [Fujimori] Right. (laughter)    [Amoretti] You won the runoff election in 1990 and replaced  APRA leader Alan Garcia. How was the country when you assumed  power?    [Fujimori] It was a disaster. The worst disaster I saw in  the  history of my country. As an example, I remind you that Peru had  the world's highest inflation rate, it was isolated from all  international financial organizations, it could get no credit,  it was full of debts, and its economy was in true chaos. As if  all that were not enough, terrorists were ruling all corners of  the country. When I took over, there was no solution in sight  for terrorism. Summarizing, I received a country in a state of  disaster and with no solution in sight.    [Amoretti] Do you think Alan Garcia's administration is the  only one to blame for this "state of disaster"?    [Fujimori] No, his administration is not the only one to  blame. Peru's problem has been dragging on 500 years. These 500  years weigh heavily on our shoulders and have plunged us into  this situation.    [Amoretti] What is your evaluation of your predecessor's  administration? While Vargas Llosa has been hard on you, one  should acknowledge that you have not been any easier on Alan  Garcia and his administration.    [Fujimori] Look here, I think that Alan Garcia and his  administration managed the economy to suit their personal  interests and the economic circumstances prevalent at that time.  Peru was isolated; it embarked on projects that were not the  most cost-effective ones. Certain industrial sectors were  strongly protected just to favor them. Governmental and legal  instruments were used to benefit people close to the government.  There was very little serious economic management in which  national interests were not the government's overriding concern.    [Amoretti] The Peruvian Congress currently is studying  charges of bribery made against Alan Garcia and his party. They  had allegedly accepted bribes from the Italian Government to  build an electric train in Peru. According to the latest public  opinion polls, more than 60 percent of Lima residents believe  Garcia is guilty. Do you feel that the charges against the  former president are serious?    [Fujimori] I could not make a categorical statement on an  issue under investigation. But the source that contends that  the former president is implicated in bribery is precisely from  Italy, where the case is already under investigation. This goes  to prove that at least there is no manipulation of the case at  the domestic level.    [Amoretti] Following Alan Garcia's administration, the APRA  was soundly defeated in 1990. At present it comes in last in  all public opinion surveys conducted in Peru. Do you think the  APRA is mortally wounded?    [Fujimori] I think it does not stand a chance of coming to  power with the current leaders it has. Nevertheless, I cannot  overlook the fact that there are many card-carrying APRA members  who still believe in the guidelines and teachings of their party  founder, Victor Raul Haya de la Torre. These people cherish the  hope that their party will change direction and find its course  again. Meanwhile, the majority of its members is supporting the  government. They are supporting my government.    [Amoretti] Is that what the surveys that you handle show?    [Fujimori] No, that is what the people in the Peruvian  mountain range, forest, indeed in all of Peru, say.    [Amoretti] You say that the people who follow Haya de la  Torre's principles currently are aligned with your government.  What do you think of Haya de la Torre?    [Fujimori] I think he is a person who made history. He was  important, a good counterbalance for the politicians who at the  time were not very honest. I think he was a very honest  politician.    [Amoretti] You came to government in 1990 and, according to  your own words, you received the country in a "state of  disaster." When did you begin to think of the possibility of  dissolving Congress? When did you begin to see that that would  be the solution to the crisis?    [Fujimori] I never revealed that, but to be sincere it was a  process, an evolution. I realized the problem was not only  Congress but the whole Peruvian political system. It was the  whole political system that was not working as it should.    [Amoretti] ... and Congress represented that political  system that did not work.    [Fujimori] Of course. I also began to see that the Judicial  Branch did not work as it should and something had to be done so  justice would fulfill its duties. I began understanding that. I  realized that here we either defeat violence and establish  order, or the country would crumble amid the "democracy" we were  living in.    [Amoretti] What was the determining factor that led you to  take that step?    [Fujimori] I had two options. One was to administer the  violence and economic crisis, to carry on as best as possible,  and leave government in 1995 as a democratic president. But the  people did not elect me for that. Politicians must solve  problems. That is why I took the other option.    [Amoretti] Uruguayan President Juan Maria Bordaberry made a  reasoning similar to yours in the 70's. He dissolved Congress  and continued governing with the Armed Forces' support. Did you  know anything about the Uruguayan experience when you decided to  temporarily dissolve the Peruvian Congress?    [Fujimori] I knew something about what happened in Uruguay,  although not in depth. Anyway, I think there has been a great  difference between the two processes since the administrative  act. In Peru the process is being carried out by the people  through the president of the Republic, who is not subject to  military power. From what I know, that was not the case with  Bordaberry. That is the difference. I am in command here.    [Amoretti] Is the president still in charge here?    [Fujimori] Of course; it is notoriously so.    [Amoretti] Aren't there some military officers who demand  old  shares of power they enjoyed in the past?    [Fujimori] There are some military officers who want to  recover the power they once had over the political system. They  are demanding the share they once had and no longer control.  When General Salinas and his group attempted to overthrow me,  they did so because they did not accept the political power over  the military power.    [Amoretti] Do the military officers who think in this manner  represent a considerable group within the Peruvian Armed Forces?    [Fujimori] There are 100,000 men in the Peruvian Armed  Forces. There is place for all kinds of ideas among 100,000 men.  But that is not the main issue. The main issue is that here  there is a hierarchy and a command that are very strong and that  they will have to respect.    [Amoretti] I would like to return to the subject on your  decision to temporarily dissolve Congress. Was it difficult for  you, a president elected by the people, to make a decision of  this kind? What internal conflicts does a president have when he  makes a decision of this kind?    [Fujimori] I did not have any kind of internal conflicts  before making the decision. I was absolutely convinced of what I  was doing.    [Amoretti] Sometimes people wonder with whom the president  consults before making a decision of this kind. In your case,  who did you speak with?    [Fujimori] In my case, I only consulted my conscience. I  have  documents that can prove my internal evolution of what I was  doing until I reached that drastic decision. I made the decision  on my own, and a few hours later I phoned a few people to inform  them of my determination and the contents of the decrees I would  release.    [Amoretti] Didn't you consult the military chiefs?    [Fujimori] A few hours before publicly announcing my  decision  I spoke with all the commanders. I simply gave them clear  instructions.    [Amoretti] Didn't you even consult or discuss the measure  with some of the members of your family?    [Fujimori] No. I did not speak with any member of my family.  Nobody, nobody at all knew about my decision. The irrefutable  evidence is that nobody knew about it and that it did not leak  out. (laughter)    [Amoretti] We just tried to point out similarities between  the Uruguayan and Peruvian processes. Not long ago, Bordaberry  said in an interview with EL OBSERVADOR that at the moment one  decides to dissolve Congress, one is alone. Did you feel this  way?    [Fujimori] I did not feel alone. I felt broad support, and  that was proven afterward in the streets. My decision was backed  by the people.    [Amoretti] Weren't the words "dictator" and "coupist," which  were used afterward in many parts of the world to refer to you,  resounding in your head?    [Fujimori] I know what you mean. But I am not interested in  adjectives. I am only interested in solutions. And the events  speak in my favor. We currently have a much more efficient  democracy; Congress is working; the Peruvian people have work  and can travel happily and calmly anywhere because the threat of  terrorism is being controlled. The country is beginning to rise  up again. Adjectives are not important.    [Amoretti] Some people maintain that "traditional liberal  democracy" lacks enough authority to impose itself over  violence. Do you think the weaknesses of that "traditional  liberal democracy" are the ones that nourished the appearance  and increase of terrorism in Peru?    [Fujimori] But there was no democracy in Peru before 5 April  1992, because if there had been democracy there would have not  been terrorism and the injustices that took place would have not  happened. That is the evidence that democracy did not work.  Simply because that was not a democracy. If a democratic system  leads to terrorism, misery, injustice, and corruption, that  system cannot be called democracy.    [Amoretti] By what I see, a system is "democratic" for you  as  long as some human rights are respected, like the right to work,  to private property, to life, to happiness, etc.    [Fujimori] When I speak of human rights I speak not only of  the human rights of the terrorists, because that was the trend  in the last 12 years. Instead I am speaking of the human rights  of 22 million Peruvians. The principle of respect for the human  being must not make us forget that the social and human rights  of the majority of the population must not be violated.  Therefore, one must not be afraid to place human rights at risk  in order to defeat terrorism. My government has the decisiveness  and will to fight terrorism, but respecting human rights. I  said: "Total respect for human rights," but first come the  human rights of 22 million Peruvians. If someone violated human  rights here it is the Shining Path, and I have done everything  to defend the human rights of all the Peruvian people. You can  tour not only the interior, but the outskirts of Lima and ask  the people: "Where is your right to education, to an honorable  life? Those rights cannot be seen and have not been seen for  many years. We must now try to conquer those human rights for  ourselves."    [Amoretti] When you launched the offensive against the  Shining Path and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement [MRTA],  very few people believed you could win that war. When the Armed  Forces captured [top Shining Path leader] Abimael Guzman and  other members of the Shining Path's leadership, everybody  thought victory already had been won. Do you feel victory  already has been won in this war?    [Fujimori] Much remains to be done. We still must wipe out  the last pockets of terrorism in Peru. You may rest assured  that I am going to mop up or exterminate terrorists. I have set  some goals for myself and I must confess that I have achieved  them. I intended to mop up MRTA during 1993, and it had  practically disappeared by the end of last year. There are only  two leaders at large, but I am quite sure that sooner or later I  am going to capture them. Meanwhile, with regard to the Shining  Path, they have surrendered for all practical purposes, and this  has brought about massive desertion. I hope the Shining Path  will have been routed by 1995.    [Amoretti] What role do you assign to the Peruvian Armed  Forces in that war?    [Fujimori] Well, the Peruvian Army is a victorious force.  When I ascended to the presidency, I found that the Army's  morale had been totally undermined, it lacked motivation, it was  disoriented, on the defensive, and nearly defeated. The  military had retreated to its barracks. Now things are  different -- this is a new Army. People have changed their  opinion about the Army.    [Amoretti] Owing to the fight against guerrillas?    [Fujimori] Not only on account of that, but also because the  Army is driving tractors; it is collaborating with the  population, opening roads and highways, repairing homes and  schools razed by terrorists; it is engaged in community service.  The Peruvian Army not only serves to combat violence, it also  has been raised for times of peace.    [Amoretti] Terrorism has left in its wake thousands of  orphans who lack family values and the basic necessities of  life. This is especially true in some regions of the country.  What do you feel every time a citizen asks you to meet one of  these children during your frequent trips to the interior?    [Fujimori] It makes me feel indignant and sets me pondering  about those children's human rights. Who ever spares a thought  for children's human rights?    [Amoretti] Do you still believe in the death penalty for  terrorists?    [Fujimori] Yes, I do. I think capital punishment ought to be  meted out to those who murder others without a motive.    [Amoretti] Isn't that, in a way, a return to the principle  of  "an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth"?    [Fujimori] No, I do not think so. I am in favor of the death  penalty for top leaders. Were a new Abimael Guzman to emerge as  leader he would have to be eliminated at once.    [Amoretti] Since you dissolved Congress, several  international organizations have criticized you for making that  decision. Much of the criticism has come from the United  States, where economic aid to Peru has been time and again  blocked because it is considered there that there is no  unrestricted respect for human rights in your country. Would  you admit to charges that excesses have been committed in the  war against terrorism?    [Fujimori] Yes, I admit to that. There have been isolated  cases of excesses. Human rights are always violated in a war  against terrorism. The war has been waged here with a great  deal of intelligence and, naturally, with force. There have  been isolated cases because human rights violations had preceded  this war. The Army used to act in a certain way, and we can see  that it continued to mechanically follow the same behavior in  some isolated cases.    [Amoretti] Well, are human rights being respected now?    [Fujimori] There is unrestricted respect for human rights.    [Amoretti] Then how would you justify a statement made by  Alexander Watson -- a U.S. Government representative who came to  Peru to inspect the progress made in human rights -- to the  effect that although some progress has been made, much remains  to be improved?    [Fujimori] Look, Peru has been the target of  disproportionate  criticism. It has not been taken into account that terrorism  has claimed the lives of 25,000 people in Peru. After hearing  this figure, one may wonder: What would have happened in the  United States had anyone killed 250,000 people? Would the U.S.  Government have allowed the death of 250,000 people? [figures as  published] Certainly not. It would have certainly adopted  special measures.    [Amoretti] Do you believe the United States is being unfair  to Peru on the subject of human rights?    [Fujimori] Human rights have been violated everywhere in the  world in the fight against terrorism. These violations have not  been limited to isolated cases, but rather have been systematic.  Human rights also have been violated through the bombing of  entire cities.    [Amoretti] Your latest remark seems to be alluding directly  to the U.S. policy of military intervention in the world.    [Fujimori] What about the bombing of the Russian Parliament?  How could a parliament building have been bombed? What would  they have said had this happened in Peru? What about U.S.  intervention in Vietnam, Iraq, and in many other places,  shouldn't these actions be regarded as human rights violations?  Look how damaging those wars were.    [Amoretti] You are saying that the United States has a  double  standard for judging, for instance, what Washington does and  what Peru does.    [Fujimori] That is undoubtedly correct.    [Amoretti] Today you visited the southern part of the  country, which is the birthplace and stronghold of the Shining  Path. Did you ask the U.S. representative to join you for this  visit?    [Fujimori] I did. I thought it would be useful for him, if  he is going to report on human rights, to speak with many people  whose rights have been violated by terrorists. Unfortunately,  Mr. Watson preferred to stay in Lima and write his report from  behind a desk. My government has a different approach: We deal  with problems where they happen.    [Amoretti] Have you received the support of presidents or  representatives of international organizations?    [Fujimori] I have. I keep receiving expressions of support  out of recognition for what we have achieved here. I am sure  that other peoples recognize our achievements in this area.  What people of Latin America would have accepted a situation  like that existing in Peru? What people of Latin America would  reject a government that has eradicated terrorism in less than a  year and a half? I feel supported. Which government of the  United States, France, or Great Britain has fought terrorism as  effectively as we have done here? Peru was like a Latin  American Cambodia! That situation was overcome in less than one  and a half years without major social costs. This is why I say  that the U.S. criticism is disproportionate.    [Amoretti] Today you emphasized that when you took over,  the Peruvian economy was chaotic. What is the current situation?    [Fujimori] It is recomposed and it is being put on a  healthier footing. We have difficulties. We were at a critical  point last year, but we immediately began to grow. We have not  yet reached the levels of 1990, but from now on there will be  steady growth.    [Amoretti] How is the country doing from a macroeconomic  point of view?    [Fujimori] I think it is doing well. Inflation has been put  under control and we expect it to remain below 25 percent in  1994. Foreign investment is growing, and the public deficit has  become manageable. In this field we are doing well.    [Amoretti] Those who know Peru are aware that there is no  consolidated entrepreneurial spirit in the country. In this  regard, a whole retrofitting process should be implemented in  order to develop a pure liberal model.    [Fujimori] We have drastically implemented industrial  retrofitting, eliminating overprotection of vast sectors of the  economy. Now everyone is compelled to invest more, risk more,  and produce more and better. He who does not understand this has  no future in the new Peru.    [Amoretti] And what about banking and finance?    [Fujimori] I would say this sector has not yet fully adapted  itself to this process. But I am sure that the arrival of the  international banking system in Peru will adjust the whole  process. I hope the international banking system will in the  short term arrive through privatization of various banks that  are now being run by the state.    [Amoretti] You say that the economy, even if gradually, has  improved and the country is well from a macroeconomic point of  view. But how is the current life of the average Peruvian?    [Fujimori] Tight. People do have shortages, which does not  mean that Peru has the type of poverty of some African or Asian  countries. But people do live tightly. There is recession and  growth, but the important thing is that the economy is now on  the right course.    [Amoretti] In recent years, there have been several  successful economic experiences in South America, like that of  Chile and then Bolivia and Argentina. Meanwhile, the Mexican  process is to the north. What are the economic models in the  region in which you are interested?    [Fujimori] Look, I reiterate that the model we are  implementing here is totally Peruvian. This is not a whim  because when we took over we found some major problems that the  economies you are mentioning did not have to confront. Here we  worked and we will continue to work with pragmatism.    [Amoretti] Shortly after you took over, you set in motion a  vast program of deregulation and reduction of the state. Peru  has privatized and continues to privatize many state companies.  Do you know that in a referendum in Uruguay, 72 percent of the  population voted against the privatization program of President  Luis Alberto Lacalle's government?    [Fujimori] I do.    [Amoretti] And why would you tell the 72 percent of  Uruguayans who voted against privatization that the right course  is to privatize public enterprises?    [Fujimori] I would tell them that the state apparatus should  be as efficient as possible. At the present time the state  cannot be a charitable organization that subsidizes jobs. We  made a drastic reduction of the state here in Peru, and today  our state is much more efficient. And to the people who lost  their public jobs, we encouraged them to build their future in  the private sector. And if we talk about public enterprises,  you'll be surprised to know that Peru had an annual deficit of  $2.5 billion. It was difficult to reduce this deficit. Very  difficult.    [Amoretti] At the beginning of your term, you said the  majority of public enterprises could be run by the state. Why  did you change your mind and decide to sell all public  enterprises?    [Fujimori] I changed my mind. I concluded that I had to sell  everything because inefficiencies could not be corrected if they  remained within the state. And I was not wrong because the  enterprises that were privatized have increased their  production, workers have kept their jobs, investment has grown,  and their higher profits have yielded higher taxes.    [Amoretti] What are the economic achievements you would like  to attain in Peru?    [Fujimori] I would like Peru to grow and overcome the  backwardness of 500 years.    [Amoretti] When a person like yourself leads a battle  against terrorism, I would think that you are quite aware that  you, yourself, may be an eventual target. Nevertheless, you  continue to visit towns nationwide and you stop and talk to the  people without much protection. Don't you fear an attempt on  your life?    [Fujimori] I fear for my children. I have and will continue  to fear for their safety. Of course I have adopted some very  specific precautions in this regard. I do not fear for my life.  I am willing to take risks. I specifically go to those places  where the Shining Path is present. I do not fear it.    [Amoretti] What did you feel when TIME magazine named you  "Man of the Year" in Latin America?    [Fujimori] A great satisfaction, naturally. But if anyone  has to take any credit it is the Peruvian people. This prize  belongs to the people. It was the people who endured the burden  of the measures that were implemented to push the country  forward; therefore, it is their award.    [Amoretti] The entire country is talking about the  possibility that you may run for the next presidential term in  1995. Will you seek reelection?    [Fujimori] I have not yet considered the issue. I continue  to work and have no time to think about reelection yet.    [Amoretti] When do you plan to make a decision in this  regard?    [Fujimori] I believe I will be making that decision and  reporting it a few weeks before the registration deadline  expires. Before the end of the year I will be deciding whether I  will seek reelection or not.    [Amoretti] Have you made any preliminary decisions yet?    [Fujimori] (hesitates)... No, I have not.    [Amoretti] Do you want to continue in government or are you  tired?    [Fujimori] I do not feel tired. Every time I talk with the  people I feel more encouraged. I am not an office person.    [Amoretti] If you decide to seek reelection, what political  scenario do you foresee in 1995?    [Fujimori] I believe that all the other political forces  will form a coalition in 1995. Everyone against me. I am sure  about that. (laughter)    [Amoretti] If you run, that is... (laughter)    [Fujimori] If I run... (laughter).    [Amoretti] Today's world is managed on the basis of large  economic blocs. Peru is a member of the Andean Pact, but it is  also opening its economy to be able to join other pacts, such as  NAFTA, comprising the United States, Mexico, and Canada; or  Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. What will be Peru's  short- and long-term position regarding these two blocs?    [Fujimori] Peru is preparing itself to achieve an  integration of this nature. We have eliminated almost all trade  barriers and those still in force are to be eliminated.    [Amoretti] Do you reject the idea of requesting your  country's membership in NAFTA or Mercosur?    [Fujimori] No. This is something we have been considering  and for which we have been preparing ourselves. Peru is betting  on integration.    [Amoretti] Which one, Mercosur or NAFTA?    [Fujimori] Time will tell which one we will join. As a  government leader I will have to assess my country's interests,  and particularly Latin American interests. We will make our  decision on that basis.</p>

			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Letter: Much too costly a saving Sir, Re your story, 'Universities allowed to charge top-up fees for tuition' (June 9), does this government decision herald a slow return to the days when only the eldest child in wealthier families could be educated at university? Surely, if savings in public expenditure must be made it would be far preferable to eliminate tax relief on mortgages once and for all. This subsidy could be removed with relatively little pain during the current period of low interest rates and might even be announced as a prelude to some further lowering. Sadly, it would be all too typical of British political priorities if bricks and mortar were to take precedence over genuinely open access to higher education.

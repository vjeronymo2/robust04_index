			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Nuclear arrests in Romania The Romanian police have arrested three Moldovans, two Romanians and two Jordanians in possession of 7kg of uranium and strontium, Radio Bucharest reported yesterday. The seven were trying to sell the nuclear material for Dollars 400,000 and had been arrested in Vrancea, central Romania, following a tip off from security services. It is the second uranium smuggling incident in Romania in the past 10 days. Police said last week they had arrested six Romanians, including two army officers, who were attempting to sell 4.5kg of uranium 235 and 238 at a villa near Bucharest. Officials said they believed the uranium had come from abroad. The arrests follow a recent spate of cases of uranium smuggling in eastern Europe. Most have involved uranium from nuclear plants in the former Soviet Union. Romania, which borders the former Soviet republics of Ukraine and Moldova, is close to completing its first nuclear plant.</p>

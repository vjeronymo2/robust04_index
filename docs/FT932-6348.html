			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: IRI tumbles to record deficit of L4,809bn IRI, Italy's biggest state holding company, has run up a loss of L4,809bn (Dollars 3.23bn) for 1992. It is believed to be the worst ever result in Italian corporate history. The figure, which compares with a L343bn loss in 1991, stems from losses at the Ilva steel and Iritecna building and engineering units. The results were also depressed by losses at Alitalia, the state airline, and at the Fincantieri shipbuilding group. IRI controls two of Italy's biggest banks and the Stet telecoms concern. Last year Ilva lost more than L2,300bn and Iritecna is expected to report a loss of about L1,600bn. The group also blamed high interest charges: its debt now exceeds L73,000bn. Restructuring plans have been prepared for both Ilva and Iritecna but these have still to be implemented. Ilva itself is forecasting a loss of about L1,700bn this year. IRI also blamed the government's failure to pay L7,200bn in grants allocated in 1991 but not received due to legal changes.</p>

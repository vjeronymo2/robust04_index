			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Phone ruling promises savings on US-UK calls The cost of transatlantic phone calls is set to fall sharply with a ruling by US regulators, expected next week, opening the way to greater competition on the UK-US route. The ruling will allow a new form of competition, called international simple resale. It will have far-reaching implications for the cartel involving international phone companies, which keeps cross-border prices artificially high. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the US regulatory authority, is expected to rule that the UK's telecoms market is sufficiently open to US operators to justify the new form of competition. The UK will make a reciprocal declaration, after which the regime can operate. Telecoms companies will then be able to resell to their customers capacity leased from the main transatlantic carriers at a discount to present tariffs, and connect the calls into the public networks in both countries. Until now, the telecoms companies have not been allowed to utilise the public networks on both sides of the Atlantic, restricting their market mainly to the large corporate sector. The operators will now be able to reach smaller businesses and residential customers. The US and the UK have competitive telecoms regimes, with well-established domestic rivals to British Telecommunications, the former UK monopoly operator, and to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, which had a near monopoly in the US market until its break-up in 1984. Several large US phone companies have gained licences to operate in the UK since the abolition of the BT/Mercury duopoly in 1991, with AT&amp;T itself granted a draft licence in July. UK operators are also active in the US. AT&amp;T fought strongly against the latest ruling by the FCC. Yesterday it claimed that BT was keeping prices artificially high by refusing to agree to its plan for a cut of nearly two-thirds in the rate which BT and AT&amp;T pay each other for connecting international calls. Transatlantic phone prices have already fallen sharply, with BT's UK-US prices down more than a third in three years. However, analysts believe there is large scope for further cuts. Industry estimates suggest that it costs resale operators little more than 7p a minute in direct network charges to deliver a US-UK call, yet the daytime prices charged by BT and AT&amp;T average nearly 45p a minute. The US accounts for about a fifth of BT's international traffic, while the UK is the third-largest destination for outgoing calls from the US. BT conceded yesterday that there was 'some room' for splitting the difference between leased-line rates and existing prices, but said that if, as expected, it gained the necessary regulatory consents, it would join the resale market through its joint venture with MCI, the second-largest US carrier. Mr Thomas Luciano, AT&amp;T's director of international settlements, said: 'The industry is beginning to pull apart from a system of co-operation between carriers, which will open things up in a new way.'

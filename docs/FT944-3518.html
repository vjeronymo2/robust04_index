			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Italian investment in Yorkshire company - In a Nutshell The Italians are coming to Pudsey, West Yorkshire. A new joint venture between two of Italy's oldest families - Benetton and Bonomi - has made its first development capital investment in the glass bottle mould manufacturer, Johnson Radley. The Pounds 13.5m deal, mainly funded by Charterhouse Development Capital, will be the first move for the new venture, called 21 Invest, according to Andrea Bonomi, who will be its managing director. Bonomi says the two families will each invest about Pounds 10m in deals over the next two years through 21 Invest. He says the group will try to differentiate itself from some other private equity investors by helping companies to grow and will not simply make financial investments. In the case of the first deal, Johnson Radley will be able to invest in new capacity to overcome current constraints on production. The company already has about half the UK market and exports half its Pounds 15m turnover. 21 Invest pipped local venture capital houses to the Johnson Radley deal after making contact through the packaging interests of Invest, the Bonomi family investment company.</p>

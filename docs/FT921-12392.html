			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Campaign launched to save Devonport DML, the company that manages Devonport dockyard under contract from the Ministry of Defence, has launched a campaign to save the dockyard from closure under the government's Options for Change policy review. MoD officials say that closure of the dockyard's associated naval base is ruled out, but that reductions are likely. Plymouth city council has estimated that closure of the two would cost the south-west more than Pounds 1bn a year and lead to the loss of some 15,000 jobs in the dockyard, the naval base and the supply industries. At the centre of the matter is the contest for the contract to refit nuclear-powered submarines. Devonport handles some 'conventional' nuclear submarines while refitting work on the Polaris ballistic-missile fleet is undertaken at Rosyth in Scotland by Babcock Thorn. Last year the MoD asked the two companies to present proposals for merging all submarine work at one yard. The decision has not yet been made, and is thought unlikely before the election. There are voices, however, warning the city and company against intensive lobbying. Dr David Owen, a Plymouth MP, has said that defence decisions will be taken with national objectives in mind and that pressure lobbying might be counterproductive.</p>

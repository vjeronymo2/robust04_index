This evening Mr. Peres met Dennis Ross, the head of the U.S.  peace team, and U.S. Ambassador Edward Djerejian. Prior to  entering the meeting Mr. Peres said the discussions by the  Israeli delegation in Cairo are serious, but we should not jump  to conclusions.    Our correspondent Yiftah El'azar reports that Deputy Foreign  Minister Yosi Beilin, who also participated in the meeting this  evening, said that the evacuation of the Jewish settlers from  Hebron is not on the agenda at the present time. Beilin hoped  that the talks with the Palestinians would resume next week.</p>

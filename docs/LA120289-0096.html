			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOB GREENE: DAILY DOUBLE: BEXLEY, OHIO . . . AND ELVIS  </P> <P> So there I was, trying to be as unobtrusive as possible, wandering once again  inside the first library I had ever visited. I was recalling the quiet,  soothing feeling of the place -- the Bexley Public Library, my hometown library  -- and thinking about how much it had done to instill in me a lifelong love of  reading. I was also thinking about how I would probably never be able to write  about it: I asked myself if there could possibly be a subject that readers of  the column were more sick of hearing about than my fond memories of Bexley.  </P> <P> The answer came in the form of an unexpected tap on my shoulder.  </P> <P> "Sir?" the voice said.  </P> <P> I turned around and stood face to face with Bexley's only Elvis impersonator.  </P> <P> "Sir, I just wanted to introduce myself," said Jamie Coyne.  </P> <P> You have to understand: Bexley is a town of 15,000 people. I was not even aware  that there was an Elvis impersonator in Bexley. But here was Jamie Coyne.  </P> <P> "Well, I guess I've hit the daily double," I said.  </P> <P> "Pardon me?" Jamie Coyne said.  </P> <P> "Bexley, Elvis . . . both of you in one column is really going to drive people  crazy."  </P> <P> Jamie Coyne, 17, is a senior at Bexley High School. Not only is he Bexley's  only Elvis impersonator -- he thinks he may be the only student at the high  school who even likes Elvis.  </P> <P> "Mostly the other students like U2 and New Kids on the Block," he said.  </P> <P> I should point out that Jamie Coyne does not look like Elvis. He is a  clean-cut, fresh-faced lad who would be at home whitewashing wooden fences in a  Mark Twain novel. Nevertheless, impersonating Elvis is his chosen avocation.  </P> <P> "It really started the year I was 12 years old, on Halloween," he said. "My  mother made me an Elvis suit for Halloween, and I went out dressed as Elvis."  </P> <P> "Jumpsuit?" I said.  </P> <P> "Yeah," he said. "A blue one."  </P> <P> Then he learned to play the guitar. He estimates the number of Elvis songs he  can perform as 657.  </P> <P> He spent his freshman and sophomore years of high school at St. Charles, a  parochial school, but transferred to Bexley -- a public school -- when he was a  junior. One of his teachers was intrigued when he handed in a term paper on the  topic of "How Elvis Presley Affected American Values." The teacher invited  Jamie to sing in front of the class. He did, and then repeated the act in  several other classes that day.  </P> <P> "After school, I got a message to report to the assistant principal's office,"  he said. "I thought I was in trouble. But he just wanted me to sing 'Don't Be  Cruel' for him."  </P> <P> His fame inside the school began to spread. "I'll walk down the hallways every  day and the other kids will say, 'Hey, Elvis,' or 'How's it goin', Elvis?' " he  said.  </P> <P> He is not exactly playing huge arenas yet. His biggest recent performance was  at the Reynoldsburg Tomato Festival; mostly he does children's birthday  parties. There's not that big an Elvis market in Bexley. His standard fee is  $50. "I'll knock it down to $25 for a nursing home," he said.  </P> <P> Recently, he was invited to sing at half time of Bexley's homecoming football  game. His mother had sewn him a new jumpsuit, and he wanted to make his  entrance to the football field in a pink Cadillac.  </P> <P> "I didn't know where I could get one," he said. "But there was this lady who  won one from Mary Kay Cosmetics, and she agreed to drive me." Thus, backed by  the Bexley High School Marching Band, Jamie Coyne stood on the 50-yard line and  sang "All Shook Up" at homecoming.  </P> <P> He said that even though Bexley is un-Elvislike, he is enjoying himself. "My  dad is a public works inspector for the State of Ohio," he said. "We live on  Chelsea. Over by the Dairy Queen?"  </P> <P> "Sure," I said. "Near the Clark Oil station?"  </P> <P> "Right," he said.  </P> <P> I asked him what he was doing at the Bexley Public Library.  </P> <P> "I work here three or four days a week," he said. "I file books and stamp cards  . . . it's a good part-time job."  </P> <P> "An Elvis impersonator who also works at the Bexley library," I said.  </P> <P> "You know how it is," he said.  </P> <P> "As a matter of fact, I do," I said, wishing him the best of everything.  </P></p>

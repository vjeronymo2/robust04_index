			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 27 (XINHUA) -- President Bill  Clinton said here today that the United States needs a new  policy in dealing with Africa's problems.    "With all the problems and all the terrible things that are  happening and all the economic backsliding which has occurred,  there is a lot of hope in Africa," Clinton said in a speech to a  White House conference on Africa.    The two-day white house conference on Africa, which began on  Sunday [26 June], brought together 150 experts from government  agencies, think tanks and universities to seek new approaches to  dealing with Africa's problems.    Clinton asked all participants "to help us to develop an  American constituency for Africa that creates lasting links  between our people and their people."    The President said Americans' knowledge of Africa "is pretty  low, except when something horrible happens and then it just  cuts through our hearts and it seems so overwhelming that we  can't do anything about it."    "But I do know we need a new policy," Clinton said. "I do  believe Africa matters to America."    Clinton told the participants that the most important thing  he could do in the aftermath of this conference is "to do  whatever the president can do to develop that constituency, to  explain to American people, of whatever race, region or  background, why Africa matters to all of us and to our common  future."    "Let's build a constituency. Let's remind people there are  things to hope about, as well as things to fear," he said.</p>

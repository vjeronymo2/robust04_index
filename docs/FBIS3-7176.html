Kim told a breakfast meeting with Korean journalists  stationed in Japan that China, in principle, does not want to  see a nuclear-armed North Korea but it also does not want to  choose a path that would isolate North Korea from international  society.    Pyongyang's refusal to permit complete inspections of its  nuclear facilities, suspected of being used in a secret nuclear  weapons development program, was referred to the Security  Council by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) earlier  this week.    Beijing, Pyongyang's lone major ally, has repeatedly said it  opposes trade and economic sanctions against North Korea.    Security Council members, however, are reportedly drawing up  a resolution without sanctions that calls upon Pyongyang to  accept complete IAEA inspections but analysts have suggested  that the next step would be a resolution calling for sanctions.    Kim is currently in Tokyo meeting Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa and will travel to China on Saturday calling for  support in demanding North Korea be transparent with its nuclear  program.</p>

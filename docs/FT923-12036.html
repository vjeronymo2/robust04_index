			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Wellcome price likely to be 800p A PRICE of at least 800p looks likely to be set for the sale of 330m shares in Wellcome, the pharmaceutical group, after Robert Fleming, the merchant bank organising the sale, said last night it had received indicative bids for more than 250m shares at prices between 800p and 850p. The tender offer of shares, through which Wellcome Trust, the medical charity, will reduce its stake from 73.5 per cent to 35 per cent, closes on Friday. Fleming said it would make no further announcement about the level of demand. Wellcome's shares fell 25p to 845p yesterday, and an 800p strike price would represent a 5 per cent discount. Bankers involved in the deal said that some progress was made in the book-building process yesterday in spite of the weakness of the UK stock market and Wellcome's shares. Indicative bids for about three-quarters of the stock have been made. The poor stock market background is putting pressure on the sale, but the level of bids indicated should ensure that the offer is not cancelled. The trust can reduce the number of shares it sells if it is not satisfied with the price. The falling market yesterday meant that some investors cancelled bids put in earlier, but others made new ones. Bids are indicative until Friday. Many investors are putting in prices of 800p knowing that they can be increased later if demand seems to improve. In the US, which is expected to account for about a quarter of the shares on offer, institutional investors were yesterday advised to tender for Wellcome shares at a price of 800p. The recommendation came from Mehta and Isaly, the New York analysts. However Mr Sam Isaly said: 'This is not a strong recommendation. This is a tolerance at 800p.' He said the plan to sell 80m shares to US investors could be achieved, but was difficult to sell to some institutions. Some US institutional investors said they liked Wellcome as a company, but would require a reasonable discount to the group's share price if they were to participate. Several investors, who have seen the company's roadshow, say they would be interested in Wellcome shares at prices between 750p and 800p. The UK public offer closes today. By yesterday's close, bids for more than Pounds 100m worth of stock had been made, less than the Pounds 180m set aside for retail investors. Market, Page 34</p>

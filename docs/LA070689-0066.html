			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FREEWAY LANE TO BE CLOSED FOR BRIDGE WORK  </P> <P> At least one northbound lane of the Antelope Valley Freeway in Lancaster will  be closed for the next month while state Department of Transportation workers  repair a bridge hit by a truck that was too tall to pass under it.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, crews planned to close the northbound side of the freeway  overnight between the Avenue F on-ramp and a point half a mile south of Avenue  H to begin the project and put in new striping and traffic markers.  </P> <P> Resident engineer Andrew Ponzi said Caltrans would try to keep at least one  lane open at all times during work on the Avenue G overcrossing, which has been  shut down since it was hit last year by a truck.  </P> <P> But the repairs may require complete shutdowns of the northbound lanes and  detours of traffic to Sierra Highway before the project is completed in early  August, Ponzi said.  </P></p>

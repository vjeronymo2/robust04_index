			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: Northern Telecom gains for 13th consecutive period NORTHERN Telecom, the Canadian telecommunications equipment maker, has posted its 13th consecutive quarter of profit growth, with an 11.2 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings. However, management's cautious outlook and a recent drop in Northern's share price suggest that the long climb in profits may be difficult to sustain much longer. A mainspring of improved performance over the past year has been the USDollars 2.6bn acquisition of STC, the UK telecoms group, which took effect on March 1, 1991. Nortel declines to disclose the precise contribution of STC, which has been integrated into its European operations. Mr Martin Mand, chief financial officer, said yesterday an 'apples-with-apples' comparison would not be possible until the third quarter of this year. Nortel sold three STC businesses shortly after the takeover. Nortel earned Dollars 104.2m, or 41 cents a share, in the first quarter, up from Dollars 93.7m, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues edged up to Dollars 1.9bn from Dollars 1.86bn. Order input rose 18 per cent to Dollars 1.63bn. Much of the growth came from sales of telephone equipment to private customers in the US, where the company said it had been gaining market share. On the other hand, sales of central office switches and transmission products fell slightly. Mr Paul Stern, chairman, expressed satisfaction with the first-quarter performance, but added that 'continuing uncertainty in worldwide economies causes us to maintain a cautious outlook'. Nortel expected its joint cellular phone venture with Motorola to start taking orders within the next month or two. Mr Mand said the process of agreeing on a business plan, setting up an organisation and assigning jobs was 'right on schedule'. Nortel's shares were trading at CDollars 53 on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday morning, below their record of CDollars 58.50 reached earlier this year.</p>

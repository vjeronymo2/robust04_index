			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: The need to be flexible - Your pension / Retirement and after, last of three articles by Eric Short Q. I am retiring this year and will be receiving a pension from my company's scheme. Should I transfer into a personal pension, as has been suggested to me? A. For employees who are not high net worth executives, the answer is NO. For the executives, though, transferring before retirement into a personal pension offers interesting financial possibilities. Q. What are they? A. In a nutshell, flexibility of income, opportunities to continue investing pension cash, and the facility to pass on pension assets to your children should you die early. Q. Can you explain more fully? A. First, consider what happens when you retire from your company. You have to take the benefits from the company scheme at the time you retire. You have the options of a pension based on your salary at retirement and years of service with the company, or a tax-free cash sum together with a reduced pension. You have no choice over deferring the payments or varying the amount of each payment to suit your circumstances. Q. What happens when I die? A. Your spouse would continue to receive a pension at around half the amount of your pension until he or she died, when the payments would cease. Q. So, the value I get out from my company pension scheme depends on how long I and my spouse live. If we both die soon after I have retired, we get comparatively little from the scheme. A. That is correct. But you must remember that a man retiring in good health at the age of 65 can, on average, expect to live 14.5 years. And, of course, the longer a person lives, the more valuable the benefits from the company scheme. In any case, since pension payments usually are guaranteed for five years, your estate would not lose out entirely if you and your spouse died soon after retirement. Q. Can I leave the balance of my pension benefits to my children if I and my spouse die soon after retirement? A. You can take the tax-free cash sum on retirement, with a lower pension, and that sum can be invested and left to your children. But the pension payments die with you, other than those over the five-year guaranteed period. Q. How does this compare with transferring into a personal pension? A. Your transfer value is divided into two parts - the protected rights and the excess, with the excess being by far the greater value. Both parts are put into in a personal pension with complete investment freedom. You can choose to invest in one or more funds from the range offered by the life company - UK and overseas equities, fixed-interest, property and cash - with opportunities to switch funds. Q. What happens to the protected rights portion? A. This represents contracting-out of the Serps (the state earnings-related pension scheme). When you reach state pension age - now 65 for men and 60 for women - you must use the accumulated value to buy an annuity on a unisex, uni-status basis increasing by 3 per cent a year. If you are transferring at state pension age, you will be required to buy the annuity immediately on transfer. Q. What happens to the excess portion? A. This is where the transfer offers the interesting financial possibilities mentioned earlier. With a personal pension, you can take the benefits, wholly or partially, at any time between your 50th and 75th birthdays. Up to 25 per cent of the value of the cashed-in benefits can be taken as tax-free cash; the rest must be used to buy an annuity, with complete freedom as to which one you choose. This flexibility means that you can take the benefits from the personal pension in bits. In other words, you can stagger or phase the cash-in of the benefits until you reach your 75th birthday. This process is known in the industry as staggered vesting or phased annuities. Q. How does one use this flexibility? A. Each year, you decide how much income (after tax) you require for the next 12 months. You assess your existing income from other sources - state pension, protected rights pension and investment income. You then work out what the shortfall is, and plug this gap by taking money out of your personal pension fund. Three-quarters of the money taken from the fund buys an annuity (which provides lifetime income); the final quarter (which can be taken as a tax-free lump sum) is actually earmarked for additional income for the coming year. The calculations need only be approximate. Q. This cash-in process appears complicated. How does it work? A. Suppose you are 65 and need to take around Pounds 10,000 net of tax from the personal pension for the next 12 months. The rate for the required annuity at age-65 is, say, Pounds 1,000 gross for each Pounds 10,000 cash, and your tax rate is 25 per cent. If you cash-in Pounds 32,600 of the personal pension, you can take Pounds 8,150 as tax-free cash. The balance of Pounds 24,450 buys a gross annuity of Pounds 2,445 a year - or Pounds 1,834 after tax. So you have a net income from the personal pension over the next 12 months of Pounds 8,150 plus Pounds 1,834 - a total of Pounds 9,984. The income from the annuity will be paid for the rest of your life. The rest of your personal pension not cashed-in remains invested and continues to grow in value. Q. What happens next? A. This process is repeated each successive year. Remember that each year you buy an annuity which is added to your existing sources of income. Annuity rates increase with your age, so your cash will buy a greater amount of annuity each year, other things being equal (which they never are). Thus, you might not need to cash-in so much of your personal pension Q. What happens to the underlying personal pension fund? A. During the first few years, the fund will diminish as you draw on it. The rate at which it diminishes depends on how much you cash in each year. But, as you build up your annuity, and as annuity rates increase, and if you achieve a good return on the investments, then you could find the value of your personal pension increasing until age-75. Q. What happens at age-75? A. You must use up the remaining value of the personal pension by taking the tax-free cash sum and buying an annuity with the remainder. This final tax-free sum should be regarded as capital rather than income; it will be the last. Q. What happens if I die before then? A. The value in your personal pension is paid over as a cash sum - free of tax if the personal pension is written in trust. This amount can be passed to your children if desired. Q. What about financial provision for my spouse? A. He or she is provided for from the protected rights. You can buy annuities with payments continuing to your spouse after your death. And/or you can pass on the cash sum so that, if you die before 75, your spouse can buy an annuity. You can tailor in the spouse's benefit to complement your spouse's income. But, at 75, you should consider buying an annuity that makes payments to your spouse after your death. Q. This means, then, that if I transfer out of the company scheme, I can manage my own affairs up to age-75 and do not lose the value of my pension benefits if I die early? A Yes, but it does depend very much on how much you take out of the personal pension in the early years and the underlying investment performance. By transferring, you are giving up certainty and security in return for flexibility and the chance to obtain higher benefits. But you would be vulnerable, particularly to a fall in investment values. Q. I am interested in handling my own affairs. How should I proceed? A. You must give yourself several weeks ahead of your retirement to make the transfer, which must be completed before your retirement. The Inland Revenue will not permit transfers to take place on or after retirement. Most important, if you intend to proceed then you need professional advice at all stages. The adviser must be prepared to cover all aspects  - income assessment, investment management, as well as advising on the type of annuity. In addition, you must be prepared to take time and trouble assessing your requirements and understanding the adviser's recommendations. As such, the adviser should operate on a fee basis for work done, not on commission. Q. Any final thoughts? A. Above all, be wary of being offered a staggered vesting package that sets out your income requirements over the next 10-15 years. It is essential that you have complete flexibility of action.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Exchange's proposed policy would prevent unintended results by continuing a pilot program, established in 1992, for stopped market orders in minimum variation markets. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  Specifically, the pilot program would require the execution of stopped market orders in minimum variation markets after a transaction takes place on the primary market at the stopped price or worse (higher for buy orders and lower for sell orders), or after the applicable Exchange share volume is exhausted. In no event would a stopped order be executed at a price inferior to the stopped price. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  In the Exchange's view, the proposed policy would continue to benefit customers because they might receive a better price than the stop price, yet it also protects Exchange specialists by eliminating their exposure to executing potentially large amounts of pre-existing bids or offers when such executions would otherwise not be required under Exchange rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See 1992 Approval Order,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , note 4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Exchange Rule 28 (Article XX) states:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An agreement by a member or member organization to ``stop'' securities at a specified price shall constitute a guarantee of the purchase or sale by him or it of the securities at the price or its equivalent in the amount specified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If an order is executed at a less favorable price than that agreed upon, the member or member organization which agreed to stop the securities shall be liable for an adjustment of the differences between the two prices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

Commission's Findings and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, with section 6(b) (5) <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  and Section 11(b) <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  of the Act. The Commission believes that proposed interpretation and policy .03 to Rule 37 should further the objectives of section 6(b) (5) and section 11(b) through pilot program procedures designed to allow stops, in minimum variation markets, under limited circumstances that offer primary market price protection for customers whose orders are granted stops, while still adhering to traditional auction market rules of priority and precedence. <FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  15 U.S.C. 78f (1998). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  15 U.S.C. 78k (1998). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For a description of CHX procedures for stopping stock in minimum variation markets, and of the Commission's rationale for approving those procedures on a pilot basis,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> see <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  1992 Approval Order,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , note 4.

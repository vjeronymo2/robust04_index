			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, 18 May (XINHUA) -- At the invitation of  Belgium's Royal Institute of International Relations, Li  Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference, today delivered at  the institute a speech entitled "China's Foreign Policy and  Modernization." He expounded on our country's independent and  self-governing peaceful foreign policy, fundamental viewpoints  on the human rights issue, as well as on the issues of reform  and opening up and modernization.    Li Ruihuan pointed out: As in observing any other issues, it  is necessary to attach importance to and study the objective  reality so as to base our observation of international issues on  the objective reality. There are over 180 independent sovereign  states on our planet which are not totally similar in their  social systems, historical and cultural traditions,  nationalities and religious beliefs, and existing stages of  social development but which possess their individual character.  It is exactly these types of character that make our world rich  and varied. As a result, different countries with different  strengths and inadequacies may learn from one another and draw  on the others' strengths to supplement their inadequacies; and  countries with different social systems and ideologies may seek  common ground while reserving differences as well as coexist  peacefully. Different countries in the world also share many  similar things, many common interests, common desires, and  common tasks. There is commonness among them, and it is exactly  this commonness that forms the foundation for international  cooperation and exchanges. And, different countries, on the  basis of mutual respect, may seek to establish an international  code of conduct by which everyone will commonly abide through  consultations on the basis of equality. This is an important  condition for mankind's progress as well as an important symbol  of mankind's further maturity in handling mutual relations.  Mankind should transcend all kinds of outworn concepts left  over by history and should jointly tackle the increasing number  of problems on this planet that can only be solved with  understanding and cooperation.    Li Ruihuan said: During this visit, some state leaders and  friends spoke on the human rights issue from different  approaches and in different ways. I would like to take this  opportunity to give a briefing on China's concept of human  rights.    First, we respect the universal principle of the  international community on human rights. The correct principle  on human rights generally recognized by the international  community has a positive meaning for human development and  progress. As a member nation of the UN Human Rights Commission,  China supports UN efforts in promoting and protecting human  rights as well as man's fundamental freedom, undertaken in  accordance with the purpose and principles of the UN Charter.  In addition, China has actively participated in various UN  activities on human rights. China participated in drafting and  formulating UN human rights documents and also has acceded to  eight international documents on human rights, including the  "Universal Declaration on Human Rights", the "Tehran  Declaration," and the "Declaration on the Right to Development."  China made important contributions through active participation  in discussing, drafting, and formulating the "Vienna Declaration  and action plan" passed at the World Conference on Human Rights  last year.    Second, we stress that the universal principle on human  rights must be combined with the specific situations of  individual countries. Like any other thing, once the human  rights issue is allowed to deviate from the unification of the  ordinary and exceptionalness as well as of a common and specific  character, it is impossible to attain practical results, and the  issue will result in empty talks. Due to different historical  backgrounds, cultural traditions, and levels of socioeconomic  development, each country will be different in the content and  form as well as methods and measures while implementing the  universal principle on human rights. It will not succeed to ask  different countries to indiscriminately use the same  preconceived model, continually use the same method, and adopt  equal measures. The universal principle on human rights can be  implemented practically only when consideration is given to  various different situations. As for many developing countries,  the human rights that should first be realized are the right to  subsistence and the right to development. If the majority of  people in these countries do not possess the minimum conditions  for survival, then what more can we say about other human rights  and freedoms? Currently, the people of many developing  countries are living a poor and difficult life, and they are  shouldering heavy burdens of foreign debt. The international  community, particularly developed countries, should be concerned  about the human rights situation in these countries and give  full and earnest consideration to finding solutions to these  problems.    Third, we believe that the manifestation of human rights is  a historic process. All countries are, without exception,  passing through this historic process. Yet, the human rights  conditions in various countries have been inevitably constrained  by their levels of social progress. Meanwhile, as their  societies progress and they deepen their understanding of human  rights, various countries have been continually improving their  human rights conditions. They cannot stay aloof from the issue  as they all have the obligation to further improve their  peoples' human rights standards. If we divide various countries  in the world into two groups -- one group specializing in  supervising other countries' human rights conditions without the  need to improve those conditions in their own countries, while  another group is under other countries' supervision without the  right to speak up -- this action itself is a rejection of the  universal principle on human rights. In fact, in some developed  countries, quite a number of people live below the poverty line,  and some minority nationalities are being discriminated against.  They also have the problems to further improve their human  rights conditions.    Fourth, China guards against [jing ti 6226 1912] some  countries that interfere with other countries' internal affairs  on the pretext of human rights. We affirm that while pursuing  the universal principle on human rights, various countries  should respect one another, foster mutual understanding, seek  common ground while preserving differences, and make progress  together. However, we are opposed to human rights issues being  used as a means to exert political pressure and to interfere  with another country's internal affairs. This action itself is  an encroachment on the human rights of all the people in that  country. The Chinese people have been invaded and dreadfully  bullied by imperialists for more than a century, and fully  understand that personal human rights and freedom are closely  linked with the state's sovereignty. Once the country loses its  independence, all personal human rights will be lost completely.  Therefore, the Chinese people are very sensitive to, and cannot  stand, any form of interference in China's internal affairs.    Fifth, the Chinese Government is willing to participate in  international dialogues on human rights issues. It is normal  for the international community to have different opinions on  human rights issues. If there are differences, we can hold  consultative dialogue and exchange views, but should not  frequently resort to applying pressure and sanctions. Holding  dialogue is better than waging confrontation. Many facts show  that dialogue can enhance understanding and comprehension,  eliminate misunderstandings, and attain mutual understanding.  China will, as always, fulfill its own obligations as a  permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and make  its due contributions to enhancing cooperation in the  international community on human rights issues.    In his speech, Li Ruihuan also commented on China's reform,  opening up, and modernization drive, and on the relations  between China and West Europe and between China and Belgium. He  said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping has profoundly pointed out: "Two  conditions will decide whether China's modernization drive will  succeed. The first condition is the domestic situation. We  have to uphold the current policies on reform and opening up,  and to maintain a peaceful and united political situation. The  second condition is the international situation which is  characterized by a lasting peaceful environment." The  independent and peaceful foreign policy pursued by China is  required for us to enhance economic and social progress. Only  if the international environment is peaceful and stable for a  long time, can we make concerted efforts to facilitate economic  construction, carry out friendly cooperation with various  countries in the world, and learn from all the advanced  achievements of civilization in other countries.    Diplomats, economists, and businessmen in Belgium who  attended the meeting welcomed Li Ruihuan's speech. After his  speech, Li Ruihuan also answered attendees' questions.

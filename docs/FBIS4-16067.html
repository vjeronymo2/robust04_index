			<p>BFN     [Text] Tajikistan leader Emomali Rakhmonov, at the  forthcoming Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) summit,  plans to propose restoring and strengthening economic ties  between Tajikistan and other CIS countries, above all Russia,  his aide Saidmurod Pattoyev said.    Pattoyev told INTERFAX on Wednesday that, before the summit,  to be held in Moscow, Rakhmonov hopes to meet Russian President  Boris Yeltsin to discuss the possibility of Tajikistan's joining  the ruble zone and of strengthening the Tajik-Afghan border.    The Tajik leadership hopes to receive assistance to restore  and stabilize the Republic's economy, ruined by the civil war,  Pattoyev said.    He said Rakhmonov was very interested in Kazakhstan  President  Nursultan Nazarbayev's proposal for a Eurasian Union, a  community of former Soviet republics closer than the CIS. But  the Tajik leader would make no statements on it before he made a  detailed study of it, Pattoyev said.</p>

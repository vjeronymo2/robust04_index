			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: BSN holds fall in profits to 5.9% BSN, France's largest food manufacturer, yesterday announced net profits of FFr3.42bn (Dollars 570m) for last year, a fall of 5.9 per cent compared with 1992. Sales rose by just under 2 per cent to FFr70.1bn. Mr Antoine Riboud, group chairman, said the results, which were in line with analysts' forecasts, reflected the resilience of the group in the face of recession in some of its principal markets. In a newspaper interview he said the performance demonstrated the strength of the company's brands, which include Danone yogurts, Lea &amp; Perrins sauces and Jacobs crackers. According to Mr Riboud, the group's principal brands had maintained their market share over the past few years, despite the rise of distributors' brands and discount brands during the period. 'It has become fashionable to attack brands, to say that they only exist in advertising and publicity. But the success of our brands shows this is not so,' said Mr Riboud. BSN said the impact of recession had also been offset by its cost-cutting programme. Eleven industrial and commercial sites were closed during the year, while staff numbers were reduced in its beer and packaging divisions. Charges for restructuring had been taken in previous years and did not affect the 1993 results, the company said. During 1993, the group said that it had invested FFr7.5bn in developing its mineral water and fresh produce branches and in expanding its presence in central Europe and Asia. Mr Riboud outlined a strategy of continued expansion, particularly in these geographical areas. 'In the 1970s we became the leader in France, in the 1980s concentrated our efforts on the EC and for the next 10 years we have fixed as our objective to become a world group,' said Mr Riboud. He said that the group already achieved annual sales of FFr6bn in the region spanning from eastern Europe to east Asia and that this figure could be doubled every five years through acquisitions and alliances. In terms of products, the company said that its fresh produce division remained the largest last year, reporting sales of FFr25.9bn, compared with FFr26.1bn in 1992. The groceries and pasta division achieved sales of FFr13.1bn, slightly more than the biscuits division. Beers and mineral waters recorded sales of about FFr6.3bn each, with the packaging division slightly higher at FFr6.6bn. Lex, Page 20</p>

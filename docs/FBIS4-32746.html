			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the 29 June Press Review] </F>   [Excerpt] Sofia, June 29 (BTA) -- The press comments on  the debt reduction agreement with the London Club of creditor  banks amounting to $8,100 million which is to be signed at the  Boyana State Residence today. "When the deal is finalized,  Bulgaria's debt will be 47 percent less," the financial news  paper PARI says. There was a scandal on meeting the foreign  bank officials at the airport yesterday, the paper writes  reporting that journalists were not allowed to speak to the  bankers.    In a year and a half after the government of the Union of  Democratic Forces (SDS) was ousted, another $900 million have  been added to Bulgaria's debt to the creditor banks as a result  of the accrual of unpaid interest on it, the SDS paper  DEMOKRATSIYA notes. According to DEMOKRATSIYA, the cabinet of  SDS leader Filip Dimitrov was likely to achieve much better  conditions for the debt deal.    Several Russian banks abroad have not sent their offers for  the debt deal, opting for a settlement of Bulgaria's  indebtedness to them outside the London Club, OTECHESTVEN  VESTNIK was told by Mr. Peter Tils, Executive Director of  Deutsche Bank AG and chairman of the London Club Bank Advisory  Committee. Deutsche Bank will act as an agent for the deal  until the end of July.    Experts of the Deutsche Bank central office in Frankfurt  have  warned that some years later, when it will have to make debt  settlement payments of over $1,000 million, Bulgaria may find  itself insolvent, ZEMEDELSKO ZNAME says.    The finalization of the ideal is forthcoming and only time  will show if it is good, DUMA writes citing Mr. Mileti Mladenov,  vice governor of the National Bank of Bulgaria (BNB). It is  better to conclude the deal now, because the risk of not signing  it is worse than its disadvantages, BNB Governor Todor Vulchev  is cited as saying yesterday. Prof. Vulchev warned that if  Bulgaria suspends the debt service payments, the creditor banks  can deduct them from its assets abroad.    All the political forces should support the deal, Prof.  Vulchev told the MP's of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights  and Freedoms (DPS) at yesterday's [28 June] meeting which  NOVINAR reports on.    The fact that the electorate is in the dark about the debt  deal should sober up the country's administrators, 24 CHASA  notes commenting on the results of a poll conducted in Sofia.  The debt has been accrued in secret (at the time of the  totalitarian regime), but it cannot be paid off in the dark, the  paper notes. Bulgarians should know they will have to suffer  privation and they should know what for, 24 CHASA goes on to  say. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Asked about the U.S. charge that Thailand has not  made any serious efforts to solve the problem of prostitution,  Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said that he had read the report on  this matter from the Foreign Ministry. In fact, he noted, the  United States has not made any criticism of Thailand. The  government has established clear guidelines to solve this  problem. He said:    [Begin Chuan recording] As a matter of fact, the United  States has not criticized Thailand. The report disseminated by  the news agency was inaccurate. I read the report early this  morning. The government has established clear guidelines to  deal with this problem, including the presence of foreign  prostititutes in Thailand. Last week, the authorities  reportedly arrested British prostitutes here. We do not want  prostitutes from Burma or any neighboring countries coming to  earn their living in Thailand. We are monitoring the problem  closely. I forwarded this matter to the Interior Ministry,  because whenever they bring this issue up they always charge  that our police are profiting from the business. I am asking  our police authorities to do something, because the problem  really tarnishes our country's image. I believe that some  policemen, not all of them, are corrupt. The allegations of  prostitution in Ranong Province and that of hill tribes girls  being lured into prostitution are partly true. After all, the  report is about the human rights issue which happens to cite the  problem of prostitution, not criticism of Thailand. I reaffirm  that it is the policy of this government to make serious efforts  to solve the prostitution problem. Give us some time. [end  recording]</p>

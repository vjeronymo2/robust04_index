			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Survey of Azerbaijan (1): Wealthy, beautiful, and bleeding - Azerbaijan is rich in oil and gas, has a fine climate and fertile soil. But it is being badly hurt by the rebellion of its powerful Armenian minority Azerbaijan is one of the most blessed of the former Soviet states. Offshore, its oil and gas reserves are enough to ensure huge revenues for decades ahead, if properly exploited. The capital, Baku, is one of the world's great ports and has an infrastructure which, though ageing, remains serviceable. The country is a rich producer of fruits and vegetables. It has areas of great beauty. Its people are Moslem (if they are anything), but of a moderate, mind-your-own-business kind. Beneath the coarsened Soviet manners there is courtesy and civility to be found. The national aspiration, it seems, is to emulate secular and booming Turkey, to whose people the Azeris are ethnically and linguistically close. Its present tragedy is a war which has swallowed up more than one fifth of its land surface, rendered some 1m of its people into refugees and now accounts for nearly half of its budget. At the time of writing there is another Russian-brokered effort to achieve peace between Azerbaijan and its closest neighbour and enemy, Armenia. However, the last five years have seen a war becoming steadily more bitter and intractable, with most of the victories falling to the Armenians. Were the war to end, Azerbaijan would have problems enough. It was a poor state even by Soviet standards, and both the capital and the provincial towns, the roads and the farms, show it. But it could embark on modernisation and investments with a much greater hope of rapid success than most of its former fellow Soviet republics. The Azeris are a predominantly Turkic people (though the ethnic composition is a matter of debate) who have lived in the area for many centuries. There are millions of Azeris still living in Iran, a legacy of the time when the Azeris were divided between the Tsarist and the Persian empires. The people became a nation only briefly, when a republic was declared after the collapse of Czarist rule in 1918 - but it lasted only until the entry of the Red Army into Baku when the republic was incorporated into the Caucasian Federation and then later received republican status. This settlement also appeared to favour Azerbaijan in another way - it gave it control of the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh towards the west of the country, a beautiful region then largely (and now wholly) dominated by Armenians. Further, it gave to Azeri control the region of Nakhichevan on the south west of Armenia, a region which has a section of border with Turkey. Nagorno-Karabakh proved to be the deadliest of nationalist landmines. It exploded first in 1988, when the relative liberality of Mikhail Gorbachev's rule stimulated increased nationalist fervour in Armenia, and saw first the Karabakh then the Armenian parliament adopt motions demanding the transfer of Karabakh to Armenian control. Though the radicals of the Karabakh Committee were jailed - they included Mr Levan Ter-Petrosian, the current Armenian president - the Armenian Communist Party was itself split over the issue and functioned more as the moderate wing of the nationalist movement than as a suppressor of it. Fighting within and around Karabakh gave way to fighting in and around the borders of the two states: in 1992, the Armenians drove a corridor between Armenia proper and the enclave through the Azeri town of Lachin. Last year, a failed offensive by the Azeris turned into a sustained advance by the Armenians, to the point where most of the land round Karabakh, stretching deep into Azeri territory, is now in Armenian hands. The instability generated by both the war and the Soviet collapse at the end of 1991 has meant that Azerbaijan has had three presidents in as many years. Mr Ayaz Mutalibov, a Gorbachev-era communist, hung on unsteadily until 1992. He was succeeded by Mr Abolfaz Elchibey, the candidate of the Azeri Popular Front, a nationalist grouping which arose in response to the radical nationalism of the Armenian Karabakh Committee. The APF promised a much more aggressive prosecution of the war than the weak and temporising post-communist regime. But it could neither win the war nor conclude peace. A radical turn towards Turkey and away from Russia, coupled with a rather contemptuous refusal to join the Confederation of Independent States, prompted Russian troops to evacuate all the positions they held in Azerbaijan. There was now no force able to withstand the much more highly motivated and better armed Armenian fighters. After the rout of last year, President Elchibey invited the popular Mr Heydar Aliev, leader of Nakhichevan and the former Communist Party First Secretary of Azerbaijan (and member of the Brezhnev Politburo) to lead the parliament. A few days later, the man Elchibey had fired as commander of the forces fighting the Karabakh Armenians, Mr Surat Huseinov, led a march of his units on Baku with a demand that the president be deposed. Elchibey fled (there was no conflict), Aliev was elected president and Huseinov became prime minister. The policy which Mr Aliev has tried to follow is a blend of geopolitical necessity and economic realism. He has taken a sharp turn back towards Russia. 'What should we do?' he asked in a recent interview with the FT. 'Should we simply continue to annoy her? She is a great power and will continue to be. She has been involved in the fate of Azerbaijan for two centuries. She must be at the centre of our policies.' At the same time, he has sought to keep open his lines to Turkey - he had what was billed as a successful visit there last month - and he has, in visits to France and Britain, opened up lines of contact with Western states to redress what he believes is the dominant position occupied by the Armenian lobby in Western thinking on Nagorno-Karabakh. He claims a firm attachment to democratic values and to a market system  - though warns against 'pseudo democrats indulging in the democracy of the streets' and says it will take some time to build a culture which can sustain democratic institutions. His presidency, solidly supported, remains the pivot of the state. His experience and toughness are unquestioned (he was head of the Azeri KGB as well as first secretary) and he has introduced a so far mildly authoritarian rule which has put some of his opponents in prison, others in exile (though Elchibey still lives in freedom in Nakhichevan), others still in parliament. The press is numerous and relatively free, there are signs of private enterprise and the moment may now be more promising for peace talks than any in the past five years. The oil men, who have sat in Baku for two years waiting for one of the largest deals in the world (estimated at around Dollars 9bn) still sit, but with better expectations of signing a deal than for some months. The consortium, which includes British Petroleum, Statoil, Amoco, Pennzoil, Unical, McDermott and Ramco, have been much more keen to sign a deal in war-torn Azerbaijan than in peaceful Russia - largely because the partners believe that it can be made to stick, since the government and the oil companies are at one and the legislation and tax regime can be friendlier than they have yet been in Russia. This first FT survey of Azerbaijan thus comes at a more hopeful time for the fledgling state than any it has experienced since its independence - an independence it did not actively seek. If it is to grow to full statehood, it needs both peace and economic development very badly. It may get these, if the hopes now visible grow and are fulfilled.</p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> SHUT-DOWN L.A. PORT REOPENS  </P> <P> The port of Los Angeles, one of the nation's busiest, was reopened today after  being closed down Wednesday night by a wildcat longshoreman's work stoppage  that began when authorities tried to serve a warrant at a union hall, an  official said.  </P> <P> Both the harbor at San Pedro and adjoining Long Beach Harbor were operating as  usual this morning as day-shift workers reported for work, a longshoremen's  union spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> The wildcat action, initially involving as many as 300 people, appeared to have  had little effect because few ships are unloaded at night.  </P> <P> The incident began about 5:30 p.m. when two investigators from the district  attorney's office went to a union hall in Wilmington to serve an arrest warrant  on a man wanted for failing to pay child support.  </P></p>

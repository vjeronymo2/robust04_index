			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by China Radio International correspondent Lin </F> Shaowen; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] President Clinton announced the decision [on  renewal of China's most favored nation (MFN) status] on Thursday  [26 May]. He told the White House press conference that his  country should see relations with China within the broader  context of policy in the Pacific-Asian [as heard] region. He  said China has one of the fastest-growing economies in the  world, and U.S. exports to China last year were valued at more  than $8 billion, creating job opportunities for 150,000  Americans. But Clinton also said the U.S. would maintain the  existing sanctions imposed on China since 1989.    China has welcomed the decision on the renewal of the MFN.  The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Friday,  saying that the decision would create favorable conditions for  the further strengthening and expansion of trade and economic  cooperation between the two sides, and the improvement and  development of relations overall. It said the decision serves  the fundamental interests of both countries and peoples. The  Foreign Ministry said MFN, which is granted by both the U.S. and  China, is beneficial to both sides.    The Foreign Ministry said China has consistently opposed  linking MFN with issues not concerned with trade, or attaching  conditions and requirements. The statement expressed regret for  the maintenance of U.S. sanctions against China, stressing that  the U.S. side has made unjustifiable accusations about China's  human rights situation. It said this decision constitutes an  interference in China's internal affairs, which is absolutely  unacceptable to China. It hoped that the U.S. Government would  lift all sanctions against China at the earliest possible date,  and abandon all measures detrimental to the development of  bilateral relations.    The Foreign Ministry statement said China and the United  States share a broad range of interests. The current situation  offers a historic opportunity for the enhancement of  Sino-American relations. The Chinese Government attaches  importance to such relations, and has made and will continue to  make major efforts for their improvement and development. The  statement believes that Sino-American relations will enjoy  smooth and healthy progress so long as both sides strictly abide  by the guidelines and principles outlined in the three  Sino-American joint communiques, develop mutual trust, reduce  trouble, develop cooperation, and refrain from confrontation.</p>

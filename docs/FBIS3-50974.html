The article  explains that Pro Mundo Humano trains peasants and enables them  to adjust to an "agroforest system." Grebe explains that the  Atlantic Coast has 300,000 hectares where coconuts can be grown,  and that with the proper storing and marketing techniques prices  for Atlantic Coast coconuts will rise.

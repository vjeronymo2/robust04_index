			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksey Portanskiy, IZVESTIYA: "The Higher the </F> Import Barriers, the Further Away the Country Is From a Market  Economy"]    [Text] The liberalization of foreign trade is one of  the main components of the economic reform being implemented in  our country. An increase in customs tariffs on imports, which  was confirmed a few days ago by the Russian Federation  Government, runs counter to the principle of free trade.    A fight within the government over the change in import  tariffs has been under way for about half a year. As early as at  the end of last year, all the necessary documents were submitted  to the government, but at that time it did not resolve to  proceed with raising the duties. At that time, other members of  the government--Boris Fedorov, Yegor Gaydar--came out vigorously  against such a step, along with the leadership of the Ministry  of Foreign Economic Relations (whose position remains unchanged  at present). As is known, the array of forces on the government  team is different now. An energetic industrial lobby drawing on  Oleg Soskovets and an agrarian lobby headed by Aleksandr  Zaveryukha have ultimately "ramrodded through" the version of  the document that they needed.    Naturally, the revision of import duties is not being  carried  out for the sake of some abstract principles or established  international rules. The interests of consumers and the  development of competitive production within the country are the  principal points. So, first of all a tariff should not raise the  cost of living for the people. IZVESTIYA wrote in detail  yesterday about the fact that the government decree on new  import duties that was issued on 10 March will bring about a  considerable growth of prices for foodstuffs. Let us note in  addition to what has been said that the effectiveness of this  measure with regard to the protection of our domestic market for  foodstuffs, which to the mind of the authorities it is aimed to  accomplish, is far from certain, too.    Nowhere in the world are duties charged on the raw-material  group of commodities. Meanwhile, the new tariff introduces, for  example, a 25-percent duty on imported wool. However, it is  known that our knitwear factories need wool of a particular  quality--our wool, as a rule, is good only for military  overcoats and felt boots. Therefore, in this case higher prices  for imports will bring about yet another increase in prices for  finished goods and a drop in their competitiveness on the  foreign market. This will be happening at a time when  restrictions on the delivery of our textiles and knitwear abroad  exist to begin with; now we are ourselves hampering our own  business.    An increase in import duties on integrated circuits to 60  percent for certain types is another equally vivid example. It  is clear that we will hardly reach the world level in electronic  equipment in the immediate future; that is to say, we will set  back our own consumers of chips. However, even the Japanese buy  them.    Of course, a reasonable protectionist policy occasionally  benefits the national economy, and many states do resort to it,  but for the most part temporarily. The very changes in the  import tariff are a complex issue. For example, a domestic  producer of powdered milk demands that a duty be levied on a  similar product manufactured abroad, while asking at the same  time that no duties be introduced on foreign equipment for his  plant. The Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of  Railways are interested in the reduction of duties on railway  cars, whereas the producers of the latter demand the opposite.  It is virtually impossible to accommodate all at the same time.    Finally, higher customs barriers to imports are very hard to  combine with our aspiration to occupy a proper place in world  trade and, in particular, to join the GATT (General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade) and to sign a partnership and cooperation  agreement with the European Union. After all, the prevailing  trend in world trade in the recent decades has consisted  precisely of reducing the barriers to trade consistently.</p>

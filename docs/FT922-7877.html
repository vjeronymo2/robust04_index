			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Openness may reign at the FO FOREIGN Office papers, held for more than 30 years but so far unpublished, could be released under a review announced by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary. An internal committee will be set up to look at papers, including documents on Nazi deputy leader Rudolf Hess, but there were no indications that any particular papers would be released. The review is part of the government's promise to increase openness. Mr Hurd said: 'The culture of secrecy went too wide. The presumption should be that information is released unless there are compelling and substantive reasons of national interest to withhold it.' The Foreign Office refused, though, to confirm whether the review had yet been set up or who would chair it. An official would said only that it would be carried out by the Foreign Office's library and record department, headed by Mr Richard Bone. Mr Hurd said the government had made progress in eliminating secrecy. Criticisms of the 1989 Official Secrets Act had been misplaced. 'Fevered imaginations produced predictions of authors restrained, silence imposed and editors jailed. Nothing of the sort has happened. On the contrary, news has spread through Whitehall that secrecy for its own sake is no longer a virtue,' he said. But he dismissed calls for a Freedom of Information Act as 'a mechanistic approach to reform which produces conflict rather than progress'.</p>

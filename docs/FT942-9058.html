			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Top Russian reformer resigns Mr Sergei Shakhrai (left) yesterday resigned as Russian deputy prime minister after losing his post as minister in charge of nationalities on Monday. Mr Shakhrai, 38, was one of the most senior reformers left in government. He appears to have fallen victim to increasingly fractious infighting between the vast presidential staff and the government. Mr Shakhrai left the door open for his return by saying in his resignation letter that he left without having 'taken offence.' He resigned after Mr Nikolai Yegorov, former head of the Krasnodar region, was given his job of nationalities minister without warning or consultation. He will now concentrate on building up his small but influential Party of Unity and Accord in the Duma. John Lloyd, Moscow</p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAST DAYS  </P> <P> The litany about the loss of KFAC as a classical music station has offered  little in the way of a practical stratagem to restore this asset. I believe the  following has merit: Listen to the new KFAC long enough to identify the  sponsors. Write a letter to them (with a copy to KFAC) saying you will not buy  their goods or service as long as they support KFAC as a rock broadcaster. It  is possible that without donations, without foundation grants and with the  voice of those who love classical music, the Philistines may yet be beaten at  their own money game.  </P> <P> LAWRENCE A.

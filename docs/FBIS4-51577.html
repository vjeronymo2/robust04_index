			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Senate finally ratified yesterday a bill  amending the build-operate-transfer (BOT) law to enable greater  participation of the private sector in infrastructure  development.    The ratification, now by both houses of Congress, paves the  way for the bill's formal enactment into law.    Senate bill 1586 is entitled "An act amending certain  sections of Republic Act 6957 entitled An act authorizing the  financing, construction, operation, and maintenance of  infrastructure projects by the private sector."    While the compromise bill retains the 60 percent-40 percent  nationality requirement for BOT contracts, the scheme provides  for several variations in which the private sector may  participate.    Among them are:    -- build-and-transfer, where the private sector undertakes  financing and construction and turns it over to government which  shall pay the contractor its total investment plus reasonable  rate of return;    -- build-own-and-operate, where the private sector  constructs and operates project and is allowed to recover  investment by collecting tolls and other fees;    -- build-lease-and-transfer, where the private sector  finances a project, turns it over to the government on a lease  arrangement for a fixed period of time, after which the project  is automatically owned by the government;    -- build-transfer-and-operate, where government contracts  out project to the private sector which builds the facility,  assumes cost overruns, delays, and other risks;    -- contract-add-and-operate, where the private sector adds  to an existing facility which it is renting from government, and  operates it for a period of time.    Other variations of the BOT as spelled out in the bill of  Senator Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, are the  develop-operate-transfer, rehabilitate-operate-transfer,  rehabilitate-own-operate, and project proponent where the  private sector assumes contractual responsibility for the  project.    The senator said only projects with an estimated cost of  more  than P300 million [Philippine pesos] will require approval by  the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA).    Local projects to cost from P50 million to P200 million will  need the approval of the regional development councils.    Another feature of the bill which is expected to "attract"  foreigners is a provision minimizing congressional inquiries  into an ongoing BOT project, she said. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Observer: Unlucky strike Whoever is invited to take over the chairmanship of the London Metal Exchange at the end of the year may think twice before taking on the job. The two previous incumbents failed to finish the course. Christopher Green left suddenly in August 1990 after an argument with the new owners of Cerro Metals (UK) where he was chairman and managing director. The LME rules insist that when a board member changes companies he must resign, so Green handed over to John Wolff. Now Wolff, marketing director at Rudolf Wolff, has decided to quit the family company which was sold in two tranches (in 1971 and 1981) to Noranda, the big Canadian resources group. He says he doesn't particularly like the big-company style and would rather work for himself. However, if Raj Bagri, the LME's Indian-born vice chairman, gets the chairmanship, he should be able to stay the course. Since he owns his own company he doesn't have to worry about shareholders who think he's spending too much time on LME business. And since he's estimated to be worth Pounds 74m, he can afford the time.</p>

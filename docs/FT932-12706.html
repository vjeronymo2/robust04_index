			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / UK Company News: Jupiter Tyndall surges to Pounds 5.7m ORGANIC growth and the success of the acquisition of the Tyndall group were reflected in an upsurge in pre-tax profits at Jupiter Tyndall, the banking and investment management group, in 1992. After a net exceptional charge of Pounds 790,000, pre-tax profit for the year was Pounds 5.7m, compared with Pounds 1.17m for the previous 10 months. Net turnover rose to Pounds 14.4m (Pounds 5m). The exceptional charge took account of a signing-on fee and associated costs of Pounds 1.81m relating to Mr Leonard Licht joining the group as deputy chairman and chief investment officer last July. Mr John Duffield, chairman, said the Tyndall acquisition involved much work and reorganisation throughout 1991 and into the second half of 1992. He now regarded the company as fully integrated. He warned that it would be impossible to maintain the past high rate of growth 'now that we have reached our present size'. The current year would be one of consolidation and he was not expecting a great increase in pre-tax profits. Also a near-normal level tax charge would affect net profits and earnings per share. In the past year the two banks produced pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.38m, a considerable improvement over the previous period. The two banks were only involved in cash management. They lend customers' deposits only to the leading banks and building societies in the interbank market, so the possibility of a drop in deposits, if there was a prolonged period of low interest rates, remained a concern, Mr Duffield noted. Earnings per share were 13.6p (4.4p). The final dividend is 4.5p for a total of 7.5p (5p). As the majority of profits are earned overseas the group is following the trend of offering scrip dividends in excess of the cash equivalent. Shareholders can take a scrip of 7.2p, and James Capel, the brokers, are underwriting the scrip shares at a value of 6.84p free of expenses to a selling shareholder.</p>

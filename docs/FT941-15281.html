			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Finance and the Family: Pension loophole closes - The Finance Bill contains a nasty surprise for some Furbs holders The Finance Bill, which turns the Budget into law and was released this week, sometimes manages to slip in previously unannounced details. In the case of 'unapproved' pension schemes, the Finance Bill closed a loophole that previously allowed high earners to use these schemes to achieve tax-free roll-up of the fund and a tax-free lump sum benefit. It went a stage further than the Budget, which referred specifically to offshore 'Furbs' (funded unapproved retirement benefit schemes), where the pension trust was sited in Jersey or Guernsey. The new anti-avoidance measures also include insurance-based schemes set up in the UK which channel funds into foreign insurance policies to avoid tax on the growth of the fund. Furbs were designed to top up pensions for employees caught by the 'earnings cap', currently Pounds 75,000 rising to Pounds 76,800 for the 1994 / 95 tax year. The main difference between standard company schemes and Furbs is that contributions to approved schemes benefit from tax relief, the pension fund grows free of income and capital gains tax, while the pension itself is taxed as income, although a proportion of the fund can be taken as a tax free cash lump sum. Under a Furbs, the employee is taxed on the employer's contributions which are treated as a benefit in kind, the fund is subject to income and capital gains tax, but the whole of the benefit can be taken as a tax free lump sum on retirement. However, a loophole in the law allowed employers to establish a Furbs offshore to achieve tax free roll up of the fund in addition to the other advantages. The Budget blocked this tax avoidance route for any scheme set up after 30 November 1993. For new Furbs, the employee's top rate of tax will be charged on the difference between total contributions paid in and the total fund that emerges at retirement. In this way the tax treatment of offshore Furbs will be brought into line with onshore Furbs. Some Furbs based in the UK have sought to avoid income and capital gains tax by moving the fund abroad. This was achieved by redirecting the employer's contributions paid to the UK trust into unit-linked policies of foreign insurance companies. In some cases further tax charges on the employer were avoided by using the premiums to purchase 'deferred annuities' - contracts that guarantee to pay a regular income for life with effect from a specified future date. John Mackay, a senior tax manager with accountant Ernst &amp; Young, said that these arrangements were also caught by the Finance Bill which he described as having a 'cluster bomb' effect on Furbs. 'Moreover,' he warned, 'previously benefits could be taken in the form of insurance policies but now the only way to guarantee tax free status is to take cash.' Investors in gilts through a unit trust will be able to use the capital gains tax indexation allowance to mitigate gains, according to a clause in the finance bill, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. Investors in assets normally exempt from capital gains tax, such as gilts, have had to pay the tax when these assets are held in a unit trust or offshore fund. Wealthier investors who pay CGT, may now find it worthwhile to invest in gilts through a bond fund, despite the charges, in order to use indexation. However, indexation can only be used to reduce gains. In the November Budget, the chancellor abolished the use of indexation to create or increase losses.</p>

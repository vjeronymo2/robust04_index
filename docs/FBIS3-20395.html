Of the applications for trading  permits totalling over $8.6 billion that are being considered by  the UN Iraq Sanctions Commission in New York, Jordan accounts  for $5.4 billion and Baden-Wuerrtemberg for a further $1.3  billion. The land authorities evidently have no knowledge of  this. An application for this unusual billion-dollar deal was  quietly lodged through the Foreign Ministry by a Mannheim-based  jewelry designer in the middle of February without the knowledge  of the Federal Export Agency in Eschborn. The Mannheim citizen  is now suspected by the Iraq Sanctions Commission of wanting to  help Iraq circumvent sanctions.    According to UN information, a Mannheim-based company  applied  for the delivery of goods worth a total of $1.343 billion (2.3  billion German marks [DM]) to Iraq. On 14 February, the Foreign  Ministry passed on the application from the "United Oil Company"  -- according to the Mannheim Registration Court, it does not  appear in the register of companies there and does not have a  phone of its own -- under filename "SA 1402 U 6" to the Iraq  Sanctions Commission in New York through the German  representation there without, it seems, informing itself on the  background of the company. According to its letterhead, the  company is based at Friedrichsplatz in Mannheim. The address and  the name of the applicant are identical with the small firm "Ary  Design Jewelry" located on the first floor of an apartment  block. There is no sign at the entrance to the building or on  the door of the apartment that would indicate anything about the  "United Oil Company."    A. Schweininger, who is listed in the register of companies  as the owner of "Ary Design Jewelry," applied to the Foreign  Ministry on behalf of the "United Oil Company." According to  the Mannheim Registration Court, the jewelry business is  involved in the "the design, buying and selling, import and  export of jewelry, especially under the name Ary Design." Now,  Schweininger is seeking a permit in New York for a  billion-dollar deal with Iraq.    Apparently Schweininger wants to export food, soap, and  other  goods to Iraq. All in all, the deal involves the delivery of  1,927 million tonnes of goods (palm oil, soap, sugar, chickens,  corned beef, beans, and other items) to Iraq through the  Jordanian port of Aqaba. According to UN information, the port  can only be used by ships with a maximum tonnage of 36,000  tonnes, which means that more than 50 freighters would be needed  for the delivery of all the goods. The exceptional size of the  order caused -- in contrast to the reaction of the German  authorities -- raised eyebrows at the United Nations.    That is why the United Nations in New York, which was still  of the opinion that the "United Oil Company" must be a large  German company in the middle of February, checked the identity  of the recipient in Jordan. The Amman post box number that  appeared in the applications (post box 35284) turned out to be  the address of a hotel belonging to a well-known international  chain. Only hotel guests who want to "disguise" the fact that  the recipient is a hotel guest use the post box number, was the  answer from Amman. Both the recipient in Jordan and the final  customer are Iraqi 'Usama 'Abed (post box 55026, Baghdad).    After the German UN representation was told that the  billion-dollar order it supported had an unusual foundation, to  say the least, it did not withdraw the application, but asked  only that Schweininger lodge an application with the Federal  Export Agency in Eschborn. On Monday [28 March], a spokesman  for the agency did not want to say whether the application had  already been lodged. However, on 18 March, a request for a  permit was lodged with the Federal Foodstuffs Agency for part of  the export consignment. Bonn is still supporting the efforts of  the Baden-Wuerttemberg jewelry designer to conclude a  billion-dollar deal.    In New York, UN employees took a closer look at  Schweininger's delivery list and were astonished. Quite a  number of goods on the list are to be obtained for unusual  prices. Thus, Schweininger wants to export 100,000 tonnes of  German made "soap" to Iraq at a price of four dollars (DM6.8) a  tonne. As even the cheapest soap in Germany cannot be bought  for that price, questions are being asked about whether  Schweininger really wants to obtain the goods. On the other  hand, other prices on the delivery applications -- such as palm  oil --seem to be far too high.    The United Nations has in the meantime acquired enough  experience about Iraqi inventiveness to expose at least a few  cases where the only aim of trade applications was evidently to  release Iraqi foreign currency reserves, not to supply aid. In  December, for example, an application from a Finnish company to  export 3 million tonnes of sugar to Iraq was withdrawn. As  annual sugar consumption in Iraq amounts to no more than 500,000  tonnes and sugar cannot be stored for years, it was quickly  realized that the Iraqis sole aim was to release foreign  currency reserves. The United Nations is astonished to say the  least that the unusual billion-dollar application from the  "United Oil Company," which is not registered, at any rate not  in Germany, had not been withdrawn by Monday lunchtime.    Anyone who wants to reach Schweininger under the telephone  number -- it is identical to that of "Ary Design Jewelry" --  given in the "United Oil Company" letterhead, is connected with  a answering machine with the following message: "Good day, you  are connected with our Mannheim bureau. There is no one in our  bureau at the moment. Please leave a message after the signal."  Despite the unusual features of the billion-dollar deal, the  Iraq Sanctions Commission will have to approve it in the next  few days, not least because the German authorities have declined  assistance so far. In addition, the deliveries of foodstuffs  that Schweininger has applied for at the United Nations are only  covered by a "notification requirement." Whether the goods will  actually be later delivered will not be checked. That is why a  first partial permit is "ready for signing" on UN desks.</p>

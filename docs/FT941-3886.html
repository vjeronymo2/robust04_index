			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Emerging Markets: Hong Kong's blueprint for reform - The Emerging Investor The Hong Kong stock exchange is growing up. Last year it doubled its market capitalisation; oiled the wheels of trading with the introduction of automated order matching and execution and a central clearing system; and brought six mainland state-owned enterprises to market. It has faced criticism too: the listing process is clearly less than healthy, with many issues being heavily oversubscribed, and regulators have been accused of over-zealousness when it comes to vetting both these and disclosure statements. The listing of the Chinese companies did not pass without mutterings, mainly over the way in which they were brought to market. Now, however, the stock exchange wants to go further, strengthening its role as the financial centre of one of the most exciting regions of the world by embracing standards and philosophies used on Wall Street. If market practitioners accept the ambitious proposals laid out in the consultative paper distributed last week, China will inherit a world class exchange which has won the full confidence of investors, big and small, across the globe. What Mr Paul Chow, chief executive of the exchange, wants to create is a market which is both efficient and competitive in the international arena. He wants to focus on China, making Hong Kong its international capital market, but his plan includes local listings of multinationals and, possibly, the creation of Hong Kong Global Depositary Receipts. To this end, his blueprint for reform - which is up for discussion over the next five weeks - provides for a greater onus on issuers, directors and substantial shareholders and their advisers, based on higher disclosure and backed by sanctions for abusers; the extension of automation to member offices and perhaps overseas; and a fully fledged derivatives and debt market. Prefacing its options, the paper notes: 'In view of the increasingly competitive international environment in which it operates, the Exchange believes that when considering development issues it must place the emphasis on an 'international' solution. US market practice, or the practice of other developed markets, may provide such international standard.' But while investors broadly endorse the goal, there is more scepticism over the means recommended. Two key issues split market users, and inform the direction they wish to see the exchange take: the maturity of the market and its ability to take on board a radical switch towards greater self-regulation; and, at issue in any discussion, self interest. Many merchant bankers and fund managers welcome the proposed switch in listing philosophy from the existing common law based regulatory system towards the self-vetting US model, which does away with stock exchange vetting on new issues and disclosures and so speeds the process. But there is also a sizeable contingent which feels that Hong Kong is not ready for such a step: its emerging market status can be interpreted in this way and foreign investors, in particular, may feel uncomfortable with a regime more akin to self regulation. Mr Richard Witts, managing director of United Mok Ying Kie, a local brokerage and a member of the stock exchange council, says that the move relies on quality advisers. 'The question is whether we have sufficiently good advisers. Can our advisers be trusted?' Mr Witts's argument is not directed solely at market practitioners in the colony: the model has proved far from flawless in the US itself, where a spate of scandals has plagued regulators. Creating an environment where scandals are more likely to breed - which is the primary concern when wiping out the role of the regulators as final arbiters of listing applications - is far more likely to deter institutional investors rather than entice them in, he says. The recommendation to abolish minimum commissions, now standing at 0.25 per cent, will not pass without a battle, either. Fund management operations and securities houses often sit together in the same group. Some say that the commission issue is a bargaining counter in the dispute over stamp duties: lowering the one could pave the way for a reduction in the other. The exchange has already opened discussions with the government with a view to reducing, and ultimately scrapping the stamp duty levy, which stands at 0.15 per cent on buyer and seller. It argues that the international trend is to eliminate such taxes. Leading the attack on the abolition of minimum commission, Mr Robert Thomas, managing director of Jardine Fleming Investment Management says: 'It is very detrimental to Hong Kong to abolish minimum commission because I think the minute you do that you encourage the market maker role to come in, which affects the whole broker/client relationship. 'It encourages deals to be done off market, and to my mind the most efficient market is if all deals go through one point.' The less contentious recommendations put forward in the consultative paper would serve to underline Hong Kong's role as a window on the biggest emerging market of all - China - and to draw increasing volumes of foreign money into the mainland, while developing a strong capital-raising base in the colony. A key plank to this vision is one of the more nuts-and-bolts proposals: extended automation and increased trading hours. Although Hong Kong is the biggest market in Asia outside Japan, last year it was only fourth in terms of trading volume. With an efficient central clearing system in place, longer trading hours are now perfectly feasible. They are seen as long overdue. Open for just three-and-a-half hours a day, Hong Kong seriously lags behind the rest of the region. They would also be a means of winning back some of the business lost to London. Recently, the London share in the turnover of Hong Kong stocks quoted or listed there has been about 15 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                            Friday   Week on week change Stock                                   Country   close   Dollars      %  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Light Servicos de Electrcade      Brazil   0.3483   0.0680    24.27 Electrobras (pfd)                 Brazil   0.2800   0.0484    20.90 Branco Bradesco (pfd)             Brazil   0.0178   0.0026    16.89 Companhia Suzano (pfd)            Brazil   4.0978   0.5572    15.74 Koc Yatrim                        Turkey   2.0418   0.2746    15.54 Usinimas (pfd)                    Brazil   0.0011   0.0002    15.04 Petrobras (pfd)                   Brazil   0.1892   0.0232    13.99 CSN                               Brazil   0.0350   0.0043    13.96 Bagley                         Argentina   3.9804   0.4797    13.70 Sadia Concordia Industria (pfd)   Brazil   0.0105   0.0012    13.33  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

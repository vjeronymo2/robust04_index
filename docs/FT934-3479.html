			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Survey of Management Buy-Outs (2): A shortage of capital may compel smaller funds to merge / Examining the factors that divide participants British Venture capital institutions have enjoyed the best of times and the worst of times in the management buy-out market over the past year. Not since the boom period in the mid 1980s have so many of their investments provided them with an exit, either through a trade sale or flotation. On the other hand, MBO funds are seeing fewer financeable deals, and a number of funds are struggling to raise fresh capital. Without fresh capital, some of those funds that are not 'captives' - financed by pension fund or bank parents - are likely to have to consider merging, leaving the MBO market served by fewer, possibly stronger, venture funds. So which institutions have fared best in the MBO industry? And which financiers will lead the field over the next few years? Increasingly, MBO financiers are splitting into those groups that are prepared and able to finance large deals, and those that are not. The industry broadly defines 'large' as deals requiring more than about Pounds 10m of equity, for companies capitalised at Pounds 35m or more - although many of these larger funds would also look at smaller deals. Any list of the big hitting deal arrangers in the last three years would include Candover Investments, CINVen, Charterhouse Development Capital, Morgan Grenfell Development Capital, CVC, Electra and Prudential Venture Managers. It was CINVen that led the only really large deal of recent years - the buy-out of Gardner Merchant from Forte, in 1992, for Pounds 400m. A relative newcomer to the big time, Legal &amp; General, led this year's second largest deal, the Pounds 272m purchase of the consumer products division of BP. The second tier - as measured by a preferred deal size around Pounds 10m - is dominated by 3i, the UK's largest investment capital institution, although the institution has been taking a larger share of deals of up to Pounds 50m. 'We have taken more of those deals in the last three years, because we have done a lot more through our regional network, which we think has given us a competitive advantage,' says Mr Ewen Macpherson, 3i chief executive. With 18 offices around the UK, the only competitor who comes anywhere near in terms of regional representation is NatWest Ventures. In fact, like 3i, NatWest Ventures is increasingly interested in the larger deals, and led as many deals as Electra in the past year, according to KPMG. The other big hitters in the second tier include Schroder Ventures, Kleinwort Benson, Midland Private Equity, Murray Johnstone, Phildrew Ventures, Apax, ECI Ventures, and Barclays. In terms of numbers, however, 3i stands way out in front at the smaller end of the market. According to KPMG Peat Marwick Corporate Finance, 3i, since 1981, has led more than twice as many deals as its nearest rival, Candover. The average size of these deals, however, is less than half those led by Candover and a third those led by CINVen. A similar pattern emerges in the growing management buy-in market. The institution maintains a list of 150 managers who are prepared to invest and take executive management positions in companies. From a standing start, 3i did 70 MBIs last year, and has about 40 per cent of the market. Many of these institutions in both tiers of the market, other than captive funds like CINVen, are actively seeking funds. Over the next six months, the funds are likely to reveal the extent to which they have succeeded. Estimates vary, but somewhere between 30 and 40 venture capital groups appear to be trying to raise new funds. Some industry observers say the funds are seeking about Pounds 1bn of new money. Typically, the funds are turning to large US pension funds and insurance companies, which are identified as having an appetite for some exposure to the unquoted UK investment. Not all are going to be successful, and some consolidation is likely within the industry with increasing specialisation, according to Mr Iain Tulloch, of Murray Johnstone. Some of the smaller funds will not have done as well as their larger counterparts, and may have difficulty attracting capital to a new fund. With the fees that arise from running a fund, they may need to seek a merger. TSB Group has already showed that it no longer gives MBOs high priority, by its decision to put Hill Samuel Development Capital up for sale. Then there are the banks which provide the debt, without which few management buy-outs would get off the ground. Mr Chris Beresford, partner at KPMG Peat Marwick Corporate Finance, says National Westminster and the Bank of Scotland lead the field, ahead of Midland and Barclays. 'These four have carried the market through since 1990,' he says. 'The rest have been almost nowhere.' Citibank, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Westpac were among those that appeared to leave the market in 1990, after the last bout of excesses. Some MBO industry observers say the banks are displaying a renewed interest, in particular for the larger deals, and that some are showing signs of returning to the market. The Royal Bank of Scotland has signalled its intentions very clearly by luring Leith Robertson, one of the Bank of Scotland's senior management buy-out specialists, to become its corporate director in charge of MBOs and acquisition finance. If the banks are showing greater interest in lending and new entrants may be about to compete with the big four, the chances are that gearing levels are likely to rise. In the late 1980s flurry of MBO financings, gearing rose sharply with a commensurate increase in risk. With the onset of recession, the amount of available debt and bank willingness to lend shrank markedly. That appears to be changing. 'Equity within deal structures is reducing, with equity now being 40-50 per cent, compared with more than 60 per cent two years ago,' says Mr Barrie Moore, of NatWest Ventures. This is a clear sign of renewed confidence, both in the economy and in the profitability of MBOs. But many voices continue to warn against deal structures which load unacceptable levels of debt on to managements, on the assumption that interest rates will remain low. If history repeats itself, they will not.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               DEAL LEADERS: MAY 1981 - SEPTEMBER 30 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                   Total                Av val   No of                                     No.    Pounds m  Pounds m     Inv  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 3i                                   57       1,612        28     106 Candover Investments                 27       1,874        69      52 NatWest Ventures                     24         892        37      84 Charterhouse DC                      23       2,723       118      62 CVC Capital Partners                 23         752        33      23  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Schroder Ventures                    22         803        37      31 CINVen                               20       1,940        97      94 Montagu Private Equity               18         887        49      59 Phildrew Ventures                    16         456        29      41 Electra                              15       1,286        86      54  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bankers Trust                        14       1,823       130      20 Barclays DC                          13         349        27      47 Granville                            13         204        16      13 Kleinwort Benson DC                  11         553        50      32 Prudential VM                         9         605        67      59  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Legal &amp;

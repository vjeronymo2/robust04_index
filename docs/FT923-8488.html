			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / Tokyo studies ways to stem shares dive MR TSUTOMU HATA, the Japanese finance minister, promised to look into further support measures for the Tokyo stock market yesterday, after shares shed 2.9 per cent of their value in a third consecutive day of selling. Mr Hata was responding to business leaders' disquiet as the Nikkei index fell below the 15,000 level for much of the day. He said he had instructed the ministry's securities bureau to consider what actions it could take. He acknowledged that apart from a poor corporate earnings outlook, one factor dragging the market down was concern over an increase in non-performing loans on the books of the country's banks. However, he insisted the size of these was 'not big enough to shake Japan's overall economy'. Although the Nikkei, which represents Japan's 225 top quoted companies, recovered to 15,066.34 by the close, after touching 14,929.55, it was still down 451.93 on the session. Volume, at 200m shares, was relatively high for the start of a week in which many participants take summer holidays. The market fluctuated in initial trading early today, at first losing ground but soon afterwards showing a gain of more than 80. The market has not closed below 15,000 since March 1986, and some comfort was drawn from the support this psychological threshold provided yesterday. But brokers noted that private investor enthusiasm was absent. 'At a rebound of the market, individual buying becomes active, but that isn't happening,' an analyst said. Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, the influential federation of economic organisations, said the slide reflected investors' fears about the country's economic outlook and lack of trust in the market. Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Nikkeiren employers' federation, called for the government to introduce measures to stimulate the economy on the largest possible scale, warning that neglect of the market's plight would prompt fears of a financial crisis. The government has been pinning its hopes on a package of measures to be drawn up by the end of this month aimed at assisting the economy and the equity market. These would be enacted in a supplementary budget of public works spending and possible tax cuts, due by October, which could inject Y5,000bn (Pounds 20.6bn) to Y8,000bn into the economy. Expectations of the package have, however, so far failed to stem the decline in share values. Another dampener has been a dismal recent performance by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Japan's biggest company and most widely held stock. Its shares dived a further Y42,000 yesterday in active trading, losing their hold on the Y500,000 mark to end at Y467,000. NTT has lost 20.6 per cent of its value since the beginning of the month, at a time when ownership of its shares by foreign investors was permitted. In the face of their lack of appetite for a stock regarded by analysts as still too highly priced, the MoF, which owns nearly two thirds of the utility, has seen the market value of its holding fall by as much as Y1,240bn in just 10 days. The MoF is edging towards an admission that its planned sale of a further tranche of NTT in the current fiscal year to next March will not be possible. It has used the proceeds from such sales to fund soft loans to regional and local government for the development of infrastructure. One local report yesterday said the ministry was considering integrating these projects into its regular public works budget. Mr Hata said only that the ministry would decide on whether the scheduled sale would go ahead after watching the course of the market.</p>

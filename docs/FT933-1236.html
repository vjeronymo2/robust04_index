			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Britain's Olympic hopes end as Sydney tops vote SYDNEY is to host the Olympics in the year 2000, the International Olympic Committee decided last night. The vote dashed the hopes of Beijing to gain much-sought international recognition and of Manchester to bring the Games to Britain for the first time since 1948. Beijing had been favourite to win. The Chinese government had made the Olympics an intense foreign policy objective since 1990. Manchester was eliminated in the third round of voting but was always far behind Beijing and Sydney even though it led Berlin and Istanbul, the other two candidates. China's candidature was favoured by the IOC's higher echelons as a symbol of the Olympic movement's power to effect benevolent change in the world. Voting members, however, were troubled by China's human rights record. In the ballot among 88 IOC members in Monte Carlo, the Australian city beat Beijing by two votes, 45-43, after four rounds of voting. It followed a day of presentations by the five cities and three years of campaigning. Beijing led through every round of voting until the last. Istanbul was the first of the five cities to be eliminated, followed by Berlin. With Manchester still in a three-way hunt, Beijing was within five votes of outright victory. But when the British contender was eliminated, the bulk of its support shifted to Australia; eight votes to Sydney and only three to China. Exuberant Australian representatives attending the announcement danced around the conference hall, drowning out the rest of the speech by Mr Juan Antonio Samaranch, IOC president. Some of the Manchester delegation broke down in tears and hugged each other in consolation. Sydney's victory may boost the drive for ending constitutional ties with Britain being led by Mr Paul Keating, prime minister. In an emotional television interview, Mr Keating alluded to this last night when he said the Games 'will coincide with the centenary of our federation and will show the world Australia as a nation in its own right'. 'Things can be so much better for Australia than many Australians believe. Some very hard-nosed internationalists have just given the affirmative on that.' In Sydney, the result was celebrated by tens of thousands at Circular Quay, which cradles the Opera House. Shares opened buoyantly with the market 26 points up in early trading. A throng estimated at 15,000 in Manchester city centre did not allow the loss to dampen their spirits, breaking into a mass rendition of 'Always look on the bright side of life.'

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Russian President Boris Yeltsin in the </F> Kremlin marking Russia's 12 June Independence Day; Yeltsin's  opening remarks followed by question and answer session with  foreign and domestic correspondents, moderated by Presidential  Press Secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov -- live]    [Text] [Yeltsin] Esteemed journalists, ladies and  gentlemen. We are starting to acquire good traditions. One of  them falls on the eve of Independence Day, which has now become  a state holiday. Since the state holiday falls on a Sunday (12  June), the government decreed today to announce 13 June a  holiday. This is the first bit of good news for you.    First of all, I would like to congratulate you on this  holiday and to wish you success in your work and good health  because I have come to a conclusion that healthy journalists are  much more objective. Now over to business matters. One can say  that yet another political year is coming to an end. That is  why today we have the opportunity to sum up some of the results  and to talk about the future. What, in my opinion, are the most  important points? We have had a complex year. I won't dwell in  detail on the events we have gone through. All of us have  witnessed them. It is more important to define the influence  those events had on the life of the country and the experiences,  both bitter and useful, they brought about.    I do not really bear grudges against last year. One might  say that it was a breakthrough politically. The Constitution,  the dismantling of the system of soviets, the election of the  Federal Assembly, and the creation of the system of  representatives bodies in the regions have become real steps, or  rather strategic steps that have already been made. I would not  exaggerate if I say that a new political reality has taken shape  in the country. The principle of all power to the Soviets has  ceased to exist. The country is now living according to the  principle of the division of powers.    We have succeeded in stopping the growing confrontation  between the state bodies, which means stopping the growing  confrontation in society. We have more cooperation and  interaction. A dialogue between legislative and executive  powers is already in place and is now making progress. There is  a good relationship between the chairmen of the Federation  Council and the State Duma. I am holding meetings with  factions' leaders. I hope that these contacts will develop in  the future. The mood of civic accord, which is gaining momentum  in Russia, has been reflected in the Treaty of Public Accord.    This is not a conspiracy of those in power, as the hard-line  opposition is claiming. This is a new social climate that is  being established in our country. More than 800 parties, public  movements, organizations, and unions have already acceded to the  treaty. Leaders of all regions have signed up. Furthermore,  quite a few of those who did not support the treaty in public  but took an active part in its drafting have also signed. I am  referring, first and foremost, to some of the groups in the  State Duma.    An important result of the outgoing political year is the  fact that the positions of extremist forces have been markedly  weakened. The ranks of the hard-liners are thinning out. The  opposition is increasingly inclined to civilized ways of  political struggle. We now have an opportunity to direct our  main efforts toward constructive work, toward easing the  economic and day-to-day difficulties faced by ordinary people.    Political stability is a most important prerequisite for  successful economic reform. The situation remains complex here.  In January-May of this year industrial output fell by 26  percent compared with the same period last year. At the same  time, we have managed to keep inflation at a relatively moderate  level for several months now. Inflation in May was 8 percent,  compared with 28 percent in January. This is lower than many  forecasts.    Today's tasks are to hold down inflation, to energetically  advance the reform of production by helping it out of the  non-payments crisis. If we succeed in doing this -- and I  believe that we will succeed -- then there is a possibility that  we will halt the fall in production as early as July, and not  just in July but from then on.    Judging from preliminary assessments, in the summer months  the level of inflation will most likely not exceed 10 percent  (per month). There are grounds to think that in July price  increases will fall to six to seven percent.    However, I cannot rule out the possibility that the problem  of regional unemployment -- in certain regions -- could get  somewhat worse. An alarming situation is developing in Ivanovo,  Vladimir, Yaroslavl, Kostroma, Kirov, and Pskov Oblasts, and  also in the Republic of Dagestan. Here the government and local  authorities must take urgent steps.    During the last month the president and government have  adopted a number of decisions on ending the economic crisis and  pushing ahead with reform. I have in mind the well-known  package of six edicts. Today I signed a second package of six,  making a total of 12 edicts aimed, first and foremost, at  expanding and intensifying reform. I can list them if you like  -- you will ask questions anyway.    [Kostikov] Interfax correspondent Terekhov asked whether  there would be any sensations today. So, let us give him a  little present.    [Yeltsin] The first edicts were signed 23 May. They concern  reform of state enterprises, certain aspects of taxation policy,  additional measures to normalize settlements and improve  payments discipline in the national economy, implementation of a  range of measures to ensure prompt and full payment of taxes and  other mandatory payments into the budget, abolition of quotas  and licences for export goods and services, Russia's federal  highways fund, and the sale of state enterprises that are in  debt. That was the first package.    Edicts on the following subjects were signed today. On  housing credit: Henceforth, every young person starting work  will immediately receive a housing loan. Then, as in the rest  of the civilized world, there will be 30 years in which to pay  it back; on the issue and circulation of housing certificates;  on measures to complete the construction of incomplete housing  projects; on improvement of the work of the banking system in  Russia -- this is one of the most complex edicts. Its  implementation will also be difficult; on consumer protection.    So that makes 12 edicts. Three more are being prepared: On  raising the responsibility of directors of state enterprises; on  protecting the rights of investors and citizens in the  securities market; and on customs regulations applying to goods  for investment projects. There may be a number of others too.    There is no need for me to comment on them. Much has been  said about them already. I will say a few words about the ones  that you are not familiar with at present, the ones which, as I  have just said, were signed today. These are major decisions on  economic questions. Their basic aim is to move the reforms  forward on a broad front. This is the second package, which  consists of five edicts, there are 12 of them altogether.    First, there are decisions and edicts on the state's housing  policy. It is impermissible that apartments should be beyond  the means of the majority of citizens. The housing problem, the  problem of having a roof over one's head, affects millions of  Russians. So it is necessary to open up prospects for all of  these in this very important matter. First of all, a system is  being created making it possible to purchase housing by  spreading the payments over a long period. A market is being  organized in incomplete housing projects: Construction that the  state cannot complete will be completed by businessmen. I am  sure that things will then proceed more quickly and more  efficiently. Everyone will gain -- consumers, businessmen, and  the state.    Second, we intend to provide reliable protection for  citizens' rights in the securities' market. Americans know from  childhood how to handle them. For Russians this is a new  matter, which they do not understand and which many consider  risky. We will protect citizens from misappropriation and  fraud. Economic freedom should not be turned into freedom to  cheat people. This will be put in order.    Russian business should understand that the time when it was  possible to line one's pockets very quickly is passing and will  not return. The successful ones now will be those who put all  their energy and dexterity into production. The securities'  market, just like other markets, should finally become civilized  and humane. The time for talking about this matter has passed.  The time has come for specific actions, and this means that  advertising must be put in order, and that the people's right to  trustworthy financial information must be ensured. We now have  too many people promising fantastic dividends in the future or,  say, promising houses in Paris, often without any grounds for  this. This is simply deceiving people. One can promise people  only what actually exists -- the actual dividends paid, say,  over a year.    Third, decisions aimed at improving the banking system. We  intend to consolidate the unity of Russia's monetary system and  strengthen the regulatory role of the Central Bank.    Fourth, crime has become a scourge for Russia. A lot is  being said about it, but so far people have not felt any  improvements. Criminal forces are trying to occupy key positions  in the economy, they are even eager to go into politics. A  barrier has to be put in their way. Scattered and desultory  actions cannot ensure that this barrier is put in place. A  special state program for the fight against crime has been  adopted recently. The most important thing now is how it is  being carried out. I have firmly demanded that professionals at  the Interior Ministry and the Federal Counterintelligence  Service [FCS] should free the country of criminal filth. Viktor  Yerin and Sergey Stepashin, heads of the Interior Ministry and  the FCS, are personally responsible for this.    Fifth, at present about 20 percent of the Russian population  have incomes that do not ensure their subsistence, i.e. they are  below the poverty line. This is real poverty. Another 20 to 30  percent of residents of Russia are on the verge of poverty.  Today it is one of the most pressing problems in the country.  The difficulty lies in the fact that it cannot be solved  through some kind of emergency or one-off measures. Only  political deceivers or adventurers can promise that next week we  will have an earthly paradise. A national program to tackle  poverty under the control of the president is needed. Its' aim  is to take stock of the resources the country has, and to make  effective use of them in order to help millions of people, to  ensure real social protection for them. This program will be  prepared together with the government, and its' implementation  will be effected, as I said, under the president's supervision,  confirmed by a presidential edict.    I have dwelt briefly upon several directions in our work,  proceeding from the premise that the most important thing at a  news conference is a dialogue with you.    I would like to take this opportunity to send my sincere  greetings to all the people of Russia on the forthcoming  Independence Day. For us, it is the day of the revival of the  Russian state, and another opportunity to think about Russia,  about our motherland, about its' past, its' present and its'  future, about what we have to do to strengthen it, to make life  in Russia more prosperous and happy.    Now esteemed journalists, I am ready to answer your  questions.    [Kostikov] Boris Nikolayevich, you have not mentioned  another  important achievement of the past year, the emergence of  independent television. This too is a vital aspect of  democracy. So, the first question is from independent  television, from Aleksandr Shashkov. Microphone, please.    [Shashkov] Boris Nikolayevich, those decision you have just  been telling us about are, in all probability, based on the  experience of the past years. It is three years now since you  became the first president of Russia. Tell us please, what is  the main lesson you as a politician have learned from these  extremely tempestuous years of your presidency? Thank you.    [Yeltsin] This is a complex question, for there have been  too  many lessons, both positive and negative. But if I try to sum  it all up, the main lesson the president should always remember,  day and night, is his responsibility for his country. The  existence of this responsibility, real responsibility, will  bring about appropriate decisions and, of course, there will not  be as many mistakes as we had before. I think that this  responsibility should accompany every step of the president,  whatever he does.    [Kostikov] RIA-Novosti, please.    [Unidentified RIA-Novosti correspondent] Boris Nikolayevich,  do you think the Civic Accord Treaty has achieved its goal?    [Yeltsin] Well, one probably cannot say that it has now  achieved its goal, because it is, as it were, not yet complete  -- to borrow a term used in the construction industry, because I  have just come back from a construction industry  conference.    Nevertheless, 853 signed it, is that not so?  There were 853 signatures to the treaty. This is a powerful  force. And moreover, not just a Moscow-based force, but a  regional force. It has already brought many levels together  that have not closed ranks before or were not able to close  ranks before or which were in confrontation. There are now  accords and contact between them, compromise decisions are being  drawn up, and so on and so forth. So, I think the treaty did  give society an initial start. Society has become calmer. My  recent trip to Tatarstan convinced me that the political  situation in Tatarstan is good. People are in a calm and good  mood. This is very important. The conciliation commission of  this treaty has been approved by decree and will permanently  monitor the implementation this treaty. It must be constantly  encouraged, new life constantly needs to be breathed into it, so  that it remains alive and topical, not obsolete. This needs to  be done. I think we will be able to do it. But I am, of  course, firmly convinced this step is an absolutely correct one.    [Kostikov] Nadzharov, please, Voice [presumably Voice of  America]    [Nadzharov] Boris Nikolayevich, could you repeat today the  point you have made that communism has been finally vanquished  in Russia? Thank you.    [Yeltsin] I believe that in our country -- that is, I repeat  what I have said before -- communism will not come into being in  our country. [Laughter] Of course, a communist faction and party  will remain in our country, within a civilized framework,  including in our parliament. There are several dozen of them in  our country at the moment. We have always encouraged a  multi-party system, and it should exist. There should be an  opposition. It gives a more lively stimulus to the whole of  life and to the whole of society, including to the leadership  and to the president, although this is, perhaps, sometimes an  unpleasant one. Therefore, there will continue to be  communists, but their decisive significance is small and it will  not increase. Their social base is now very, very small.    [Kostikov] INTERFAX, Telekhov.    [Telekhov] Boris Nikolayevich, you said when privatization  began that you dreamed of there being millions of owners in  Russia. Tell us, do you think now that the privatization  campaign is finishing that there are millions of owners and that  they are deciding the fate of Russia in some way? And this  particular question: Where have you -- if it is not a personal  secret -- invested your own privatization voucher?    [Yeltsin] I have indeed used my voucher, but unlike TV's  Lenya Golubkov, I don't want to advertise this, so that everyone  does not rush the same way. But millions of owners have  emerged, there is no doubt about it, there are millions of them.  And just look, when you are travelling by plane, you can see  how many houses are being built in Moscow oblast, and everywhere  else for that matter.    The first stage of privatization is coming to an end.  Floatation of major enterprises is also nearing completion.  Really major ones. Right now we are going through this process  at ZIL [Likhachev Automobile Works in Moscow]. We'll go through  it all right; it will only take a few days, and everything will  be all right there. And after that we will have floated all the  major enterprises. Well, maybe the nickel works in Norilsk will  need a few more days. After all, there are 500,000 people there.    [Kostikov] I can see that the XINHUA agency wants to ask a  question.    [XINHUA correspondent] Esteemed president, it is now one and  a half years since you visited Beijing. How do you assess the  present state of Sino-Russian relations, and what do you think  of their prospects? Thank you.    [Yeltsin] I consider that the documents we have signed are  now working very actively. Although less than a full year has  passed since the visit, our trade turnover has increased by 30  percent. Up until then it had been steadily falling. Each year  it kept on declining. Then suddenly it has increased by 30  percent in the course of one year. This year, I reckon it will  increase by more than 30 percent. Trade is being pursued very  vigorously. We are in constant touch with the leadership of the  republic and maintain contacts and ties. We are now discussing  the dates for the PRC president's visit.    [Kostikov] Vasiliy Konarenko of IZVESTIYA.    [Konarenko] Mr. President, I would like to ask the following  question. Roughly three years after the disintegration of the  USSR, there remain two determining trends. Some regard  sovereignty as the basis for their states' prosperity. Others  feel it must be achieved through a revived union. That is  obvious. What is your view on this, in particular, the idea of  a Eurasian union? Thank you.    [Yeltsin] I don't wish at this moment to offend [Kazakh  President] Nazarbayev by making an assessment of his proposal.  It needs to be studied. Therefore, I cannot of course say that  this path is beyond question. I support the idea that the  commonwealth should gradually evolve into some kind of  confederative society, operating on the same basis as Europe,  the European Union.    [Kostikov] TRUD newspaper, Kishkin.    [Kishkin] Boris Nikolayevich, how do you see the prospects  for establishing social democracy in Russia? In the West it is  very attractive to the electorate but in our country one can  understand when an inclination for social democracy is shown by  the wise Rybkin or by Gorbachev after falling out with the  communists. Even Rutskoy, who recently stormed the mayor's  office and Ostankino television center, declared himself a  social democrat. So in our country will this not become a  screen for something that is its direct opposite? Also, in  general, do you share social democratic views? Thank you.    [Yeltsin] In general, I like the idea when, say, communists  move over to the ideas of social democracy. Many of them have  already spoken about this, that they find these ideas attractive  and that they would be prepared to gradually reorient themselves  toward this social democratic system. Of course, I have seen  social democracy in various countries, in many countries. It is  different in each country. It is very varied even though, of  course, it has its own core, the social democratic core.    Unfortunately, you are right and this also grieves me, that  in our country it has been seized upon by left-wingers,  right-wingers and centrists, and all sorts of people, and people  who simply do not understand politics at all. Therefore, it  seems to me that a base does exist in our country for the  development of social democracy. The foundations do exist in our  country for such a real social democratic movement or party.  But now it needs to be organized and it needs an organizer.    [Kostikov] Tamara Zamyatina of ITAR-TASS. One moment,  Tamara, they are bringing the microphone.    [Zamyatina] Thank you. Esteemed Boris Nikolayevich. Here is  a question for you, if you will allow me, about Russia's  international status, about how you assess it at present and  about the prospects for Russia's entry into the Group of Seven  and the European Union. If you will allow me I will broaden the  question a little: Western analysts at present criticize  Russian leaders and say that we, allegedly, in our efforts to  enter the European Clubs are using the "proof by contradiction"  method. We say that if we are not accepted it will be worse for  you and we will set up a dictatorship. According to them we say  little about the positive and constructive stimuli that our  partners will gain by our entry into their organizations. Could  you comment on this please.    [Yeltsin] First, concerning European structures. In order to  join the Council of Europe one has to go through a long and  complex procedure. This procedure is being followed. What is  quite another matter, that even before we join the European  Council, I mean Union -- and not one of the 12 European states  objects to Russian membership, since Russia is a European  country and a great power -- we want to proceed with the first  stage, that is to sign an economic agreement with the European  Union so that the rules of the game they follow among  themselves, internally, would be extended on us too. Naturally  we should not lose on it, we should profit by it, since we open  up a stable European market. We did not have this stable market  before -- in some areas we succeeded in getting through, but not  in others. Now, on the other hand, we have even reached  agreement with France concerning uranium, as it were. We have  also reached agreement on aluminum, and that with the last  position. [sentence as heard]    In other words, the agreement -- I would not go as far as to  say it is ready -- the wording should be as follows: It is  virtually ready. So if this word "virtually" is no longer  there, then on 23 June I will fly to the island of Corfu -- no,  it is called something else in Greek. What is it?    [Kostikov] Boris Nikolayevich, you have got a better memory  than I, I swear. [laughs] Sorry. [laughter from audience]    [Yeltsin] Kokru or Kok...    [Voices from the audience] Kerkira.    [Yeltsin] Kerker, is it? Kerker then. Well, everyone has  got used to calling it Corfu, right? Leaders of the 12 states  are to convene there. It is there that accession to the  European Council [as heard] or the signing of Europe-wide  agreements of this kind usually takes place. If indeed  everything is ready, and I very much hope it will be, I will go  there for one day and sign the agreement. It is to be signed by  Jacques Delors, by the Greek chairman, who is currently chairing  the European Council [as heard], and by myself. So that will be  the beginning of the process of Russia joining the European  Union, I mean council, I mean European Community.    [Yeltsin] Now, concerning G-7 and Naples, we are having  serious discussions on this. Of course, I also read the foreign  press and I have noticed that Russia is being reproached for  suddenly trying to get into G-8, on what basis. Although I  cannot understand what is meant by what basis. On the basis  that we are a great country. Are there countries there that are  bigger than ours, apart from the United States? No. Even our  economic potential is significant. Well, in brief, of course by  virtue of our economic level alone we cannot join a G-8 as a  member with full rights with regard to economic matters. So we  have decided to divide it up like this. They are to have two  days of discussions in Naples -- a day of economic discussions  and a day of political discussions. In the economic one, they  will consider Russia separately, and that is it. I will not take  part in the general discussion. In the political discussion, I  will take part in the general discussion from beginning to end.  I will also take part in drawing up the general political  declaration of what will already be G-8. So you cannot say that  a G-8 has already been formed with Russian involvement. This is  not so. But with regard to the political section, this is the  case.    [Kostikov] One of our most popular youth newspapers,  MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS will soon be an old lady, it is 75  years-old and is celebrating its anniversary, so I think that we  probably should not offend Mikhail Burevich so we will let him  ask a question.    [Burevich] Thank you Boris Nikolayevich, this may not  perhaps  be a very festive question but what is your attitude toward the  constant criticism directed toward you, including the  caricatures and parodies that have been appearing in great  numbers recently? Thank you.    [Yeltsin] Yes, and your newspaper is keeping up with the  others, of course. What can I say?    There is constructive, reasonable, human criticism, which  does not wound people's dignity or humiliate them. I try to  learn from such criticism and make use of it in some way, for  myself, to draw conclusions. If this criticism is unreasonable,  dirty, or offensive then I pass it by and pay absolutely no  attention to it. Although I am sometimes encouraged to sue, I  will not do this, I just do not pay any attention to it.    [Kostikov] We had a whole series of questions from Italian  newspapers on Naples but Boris Nikolayevich has given an answer,  has anticipated them. I turn to Sadi Amara who is representing  a group of Arab newspapers, the microphone please.    [Amara] Mr. President, many people are saying that the  Russian leadership is devoting more attention to relations with  the West than to relations with countries of the so-called Third  World. How do you see Russia's current relations with the Arab  world and with the Near East, and more precisely, what is  Russia's assessment of what is happening in Yemen today, and is  Moscow prepared to recognize South Yemen as a fully-fledged  member of the international community? Thank you.    [Yeltsin] I took heed of your criticism at last year's news  conference when you asked more or less the same question. We  have broadened our foreign policy to take the East into account  -- both the Far and Near East, and to take Latin America into  account.    [Yeltsin] We have had contacts with Palestine, and with  Israel for the first time. I had meetings with Arafat, Mr.  Arafat, and with Mr. Rabin. We also wish to promote peace there  of course, and are participating in efforts to achieve this.  All the signs are that this long-awaited peace may finally  materialize.    We have always had friendly relations with Yemen. These  tragic occurrences, these tragic events that have taken place  there -- they are of course a tragedy for the entire people.  But we support Yemen and consider that it must be a fully  fledged state within the world community.    [Kostikov] Boris Nikolayevich, Nikolay Svanidze, the  courageous Russian TV journalist who -- it can be said -- has  taken on Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy single-handed, is here  with us today. So it would be absolutely improper not to let  him ask a question. I would merely ask him to confine himself  to one question.    [Svanidze] All right. Boris Nikolayevich, the question is  not about single combat. My question to you is as follows. As  we know, anyone who finds himself wielding great authority, who  is given great authority, changes. The more authority he gets,  the more he changes. How much have you changed during the years  of your presidency, and in what way have you changed? Thank you.    [Yeltsin] That is the question I ask my wife every week --  because she can discern nuances from the way I walk, the way I  hold my head when I am walking, and so on, you see. Well, it is  somehow awkward for me to say that, it might sound immodest, but  she thinks I have not changed much. I am as driven as I have  always been. Sometimes I can be strict and tough, as I have  been. But at the same time I can understand another person, and  every time I travel I would go to the crowds to meet the people,  I push myself in and talk to them, be it in Tatarstan, in  Naberezhnyye Chelny, in Kazan, or in Tverskaya [street in  Moscow], in a bookshop, marking Pushkin's 195th anniversary. I  was talking to people the same as I had been doing three years  ago.    My comrades and friends from my team, who usually always  tell  me the truth -- it is a tradition that has been formed, there  are several people who would not flinch from telling the  president the truth, even if it is an unpleasant one -- they  have not told me that I have changed in any way. So I can sum  up by saying that the only change is that I am aging in terms of  years.    [Kostikov] Well, Boris Nikolayevich, even MOSKOVSKIY  KOMSOMOLETS is aging, so what is the point of telling people  this...[laughs] Mayak radio now, Yuliy Semenov.    [Semenov] Boris Nikolayevich, my question is connected with  the elections in Ukraine and Belarus. There has been all sorts  of talk about this. Does Russia have any real interest in the  possible outcome of these elections, and what might it consist  of?    [Yeltsin] Very great interest. Of course, I cannot tell you  whom we would prefer to see as president.    [Kostikov] Don't you remember that man near the bookshop  with  whom you had a whispered conversation, Boris Nikolayevich?    [Yeltsin] Well, he was a Ukrainian. [laughter] He promised  he would not tell anyone. The Ukrainian people will deliver  their verdict on this on 26 June. We will be guided by that.    [Kostikov] The newspaper KRASNAYA ZVEZDA.    [Yermolin, KRASNAYA ZVEZDA] Boris Nikolayevich, according to  official figures from the Ministry of Defense, 75 percent of  officers' families are currently living off income that is lower  than the poverty line. Specialists reckon that the budget,  which has been adopted by the State Duma, the defense budget,  could push the whole of the Armed Forces beyond the poverty  line. What steps could be taken to resolve this problem? That  is a question to you both as president and as supreme commander  in chief. Thank you.    [Yeltsin] Of course, the budget that has now been adopted  does not satisfy the military, but here the government and the  military themselves must draw conclusions. The military  themselves must carry out cuts more energetically. The lack of  decisiveness here is incomprehensible. Today, as a society, we  cannot maintain a three million-strong army, we just cannot.  Was it three million for the whole Union or was it three  million for Russia? Therefore, cutting the Army is one of the  main questions, one of the main problems the Army itself must  resolve, with help, of course, from the regional authorities,  us, and the government.    Second, there must be some reduction in expenditure on  orders  for military equipment. There are reserves here. Experts have  already confirmed that such reserves exist and that they can be  utilized this year. Nevertheless, this will not fill the hole  that still exists in the budget. So, I held consultations. I  had long talks with Chernomyrdin before his departure. I had  talks with Rybkin. I had talks with Shumeyko. Generally  speaking, we will meet the shortfall from the budget, we will  find the funds that the Army won't get from that source, by  drawing on non-budgetary appropriations. This is a realistic  prospect. The $550 million we are getting from MiG sales to  Malaysia were not included in the budget. They did not figure  in this year's budget. That is what we call non-budgetary  appropriations. What can we do with $550 million? It will be  handed over and this will completely cover the gap. That is  what we will do. Especially as it is not just Malaysia.  Thailand and Australia are also interested in our MiGs -- to  the very great dissatisfaction of the American side.    [Kostikov] Veronika Uscila, KOMMERSANT-DEYLI.    [Uscila] Boris Nikolayevich, does the edict on improvement  of  the banking system have a section on foreign banks? If not,  will this edict be signed, and when? What is your personal  attitude to the possible expansion of foreign banking activity  in Russia? Thank you.    [Kostikov] Boris Nikolayevich, you don't have to answer  every question. The president can leave something in his  pocket, as it were. [laughs]    [Yeltsin] Oh no, if I know the answer I cannot fail to give  it. If I don't know, then I say I don't. But here I do know. I  know that this section is contained in an edict I signed today.  It is there. Yes, the president will be strongly criticized by  our bankers, because real competition is starting. But it is  really mind-boggling, this 185 percent bank discount rate that  we have today. Can this be afforded? Who can afford a loan  with this rate of interest, be it a private business, any  enterprise, or a joint stock company? Very few can. But by  attracting foreign banks to our commercial and financial scene,  doing it gradually, very thoroughly and certainly not rashly, we  can revive our entire banking system and lower the rate. Hence,  better conditions will be in place for enterprises, for  industry, for businessmen and so on.    [Kostikov] I have a question from a representative of the  Russian Television Agency, called Beglov. I think he is the son  of our famous Spartak Beglov, whom we all remember so well.    [Beglov] I want to return to privatization. Of late there  has been a lot of fuss about how Yuriy Mikhaylovich and Anatoliy  Borisovich came to quarrel -- i.e. Luzhkov and Chubays. But  this is not a private quarrel. [words indistinct] How do you  view this and do you intend to reconcile them?    [Yeltsin] Well, I am of course well aware of this episode. I  had hoped that they would sort this out for themselves. But it  did not happen. Government attempts to settle the quarrel and  reconcile the two did not work either. When Luzhkov addressed  that big conference of 5,000 people here in the Kremlin Palace,  he said that Moscow would not carry out privatization a la  Chubays but would act in accordance with commonsense. Well,  that is not fair on Chubays. But the Muscovites have already  gone so far with their own program. This will not affect the  rest of Russia. The others won't rush to follow suit because  they are already pursuing the path set out in our programs, the  programs that have been approved. So, there is no danger of  this. Today -- in view of the fact that Chernomyrdin is on  vacation -- I told Soskovets to bring this issue to a close, to  tell Chubays to leave Moscow alone.    [Kostikov] Boris Nikolayevich, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA wishes  to  ask a question. This worries me because only yesterday they  almost sent Chernomyrdin into retirement. I wonder who they  will sack today! All the same, Zarytov....    [Yeltsin] Just don't go saying that they want to remove the  president in the fall and send him off somewhere.    [Zarytov] Boris Nikolayevich, we won't remove the president!    [Yeltsin] I do not intend to go off anywhere until 1996.    [Zarytov] OK, that is clear. My understanding is that those  edicts that you listed are forward-looking and geared to the  summer and fall. Clearly they will require a frontal assault  from the government, as you put it -- in other words, great  efforts. In this connection, could you take stock of the  government's record during the past year? Are you satisfied  with its activities? How close to the mark is the speculation  in our own press and the Western press that a government  reshuffle is in the offing? It has just been alleged that we at  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA intend to remove Chernomyrdin. Well, Boris  Nikolayevich, would you be kind enough to give us your view?    [Yeltsin] I understand. Of course, it is very difficult for  any government to operate in such circumstances. Life and work  are not easy for the president, for you, for anybody living in  Russia during this period. This also applies to the government.  First of all, let me tell you what I don't like. I don't like  a certain tendency, especially among state enterprises, to veer  back toward planning. Admittedly, it is only a proportion of  them. Naturally, this cannot be tolerated. Second, I don't  like corruption in the middle ranks.    I have already had discussions with Chernomyrdin on the  necessity for a serious purging of the apparatus. You know, so  many people have been taken in, led by Vladimir Kvasov [head of  the administration of the government of Russia], that it will be  a long time till we sort everything out.    Third, what was signed a week ago and today should have been  adopted two years ago. It has been said before, but there has  been one delay after another. So only pressure, really hard  pressure from the president resulted in those documents having  been completed in just two days. Everything was agreed with  lawyers and so on. Everything was completed at 0430 this  morning. So if pressure is put, if there is no other way, then  they finally start moving as they should. Which means that,  generally speaking, they can do their work properly.    With regard to Chernomyrdin, I have never had any questions  about his work in general, although everyone has shortcomings --  I have and he has -- that is understandable. Every week we have  a very long discussion, sometimes one hour, sometimes two,  sometimes six hours. We discuss many problems and issues in  detail. So if there are any mistakes, they can be said to be  joint mistakes, as it were, of the president and the government.  No, I will not give up Chernomyrdin to anybody, not even to  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA.    [Kostikov, laughing] Go ahead, but please introduce  yourself.    [Unidentified correspondent] WPROST weekly, from Poland.  Mr. President, could you please tell us if you have accepted  President Walesa's invitation to visit Warsaw on 1 August on the  50th anniversary of the Warsaw uprising. If you have not, why?  Thank you.    [Yeltsin] Unfortunately the invitation came too late. My  schedule of international meetings until the end of the year had  already been filled in. It is not an easy schedule. Therefore,  there will certainly be quite a high-level Russian  representative there, same as in Bratislava.    [Kostikov] Colleague on the right, please. No, higher up.  Yes, I mean you.    [Unidentified correspondent, in English] Mr. President,  please forgive me if I address you in English. It is a question  from the....    [Kostikov, interrupting] We have no interpreter, so I will  translate, Boris Nikolayevich. But do make it simple.    [Correspondent, in English with simultaneous Kostikov  translation] Mr. President, in a month's time you will be in  Naples for the G-7 meeting. As you know, there are ministers in  the new Italian Government who cite the legacy of the fascist  party. Many European leaders have voiced concern over the  presence of these politicians in the Italian government. Do you  share this concern? Do you believe that fascism is a real threat  in the new Europe?    [Yeltsin] No, of course I do not think it is a real threat  for Europe. As for Italy, as it were, it is after all an  internal affair for Italians.    [Kostikov] Gentlemen, we have to finish presently, a couple  more questions and that is it, so be prepared. Go ahead.    [Yeltsin] The time is up, actually.    [Kostikov] Yes, Boris Nikolayevich, but people are  determined  to carry on.    [Unidentified correspondent] Ekho Moskvy radio. Boris  Nikolayevich, the lower house of the U.S. Congress yesterday  adopted a decision to lift the embargo on arms supplies to  Bosnia, following the lead from the Senate. So now both  chambers have passed this decision. Will there be any reaction  from you to this decision? Thank you.    [Yeltsin] I will soon be meeting Clinton, and we will  discuss  this issue again. We regularly keep in touch on all these  problems. We had a telephone conversation recently, and he  talked to me about it, but we still have slightly different  views on ways of resolving this problem.    [Kostikov] The last question, you know we already have our  traditions, we always try to please the ladies, near the third  microphone please.    [Unidentified correspondent] MELBOURNE AGE newspaper,  Australia. Mr. President, what is your attitude toward NATO's  latest proposal on the Partnership for Peace program? Will  Russia sign this document without any further conditions? Thank  you.    [Yeltsin] If you had not added the last phrase, I would have  said yes, Russia will sign, but with the last phrase...[Yeltsin  pauses] You cannot call them conditions. We would just like to  draw up a protocol with NATO on how we should cooperate within  this complex mechanism, especially with regard to the military.  It is a complex mechanism. It is a huge army, three million.  This cannot be approached in a simplified manner. NATO has  agreed to this, to sign such a protocol. They will sign the  protocol and we will sign the Partnership for Peace document, we  will definitely sign it. In the final analysis, even if this  protocol gets buried in red tape, we will still sign it.    [Kostikov] Dear friends and colleagues, let us thank Boris  Nikolayevich for the news conference, and thank you very much  for your work. Good-bye, I wish you a pleasant, festive mood.    [Yeltsin] Thank you.</p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Banks, deals and dividends For much of the past decade the off-balance sheet liabilities of the commercial banking system have posed a serious headache for central bankers engaged in prudential supervision. Now that bank capital in the English-speaking economies has largely been restored, there may, paradoxically, be an equal and opposite problem in the form of rapid growth in off-balance sheet assets and an accumulation of excess capital. This thought is prompted by the spate of takeovers of mutual fund-based financial groups in the US. This week has seen a Dollars 2.2bn approach from GE Capital for the Chicago-based Kemper Corporation. It follows last year's Dollars 1.7bn takeover of the Dreyfus group by the Mellon Bank. Commercial banks now control mutual fund assets worth not far short of Dollars 200bn, compared with a mere Dollars 30bn five years ago. While GE Capital is not strictly speaking a bank, its reasoning is the same as that of most other financial institutions buying into mutual funds. The lending business is relatively mature and its profit potential is becoming less exciting. In contrast, managing other people's assets is a growth activity with long term potential. Personal pension and annuity products in particular look attractive as private individuals take on more of the burden of pension provision. The volumes of business stand to increase with rising per capita incomes. That is not to say that the game of old-fashioned bank intermediation - the collecting of money from depositors and on-lending it to borrowers - is dead. If anything it has been making a come-back over the past few days with four big money centre banks offering no less than Dollars 5bn worth of finance for the competing offers from Martin Marietta and Northrop for fellow defence contractor Grumman. Turning point The buoyancy of stock markets last year smoothed the way for all-paper bids, such as the Dollars 6bn offer by Merck, the leading pharmaceuticals firm, for Medco. But the recent epic battle for Paramount Communications appears to have marked a turning point. As the bid auction developed the markets fought shy of the paper of both Viacom and QVC, forcing them to offer cash as well as stock for Paramount. Since then it has become clear that banks are falling over each other to finance big corporate deals. Yet syndicated bank loans for big deals no longer necessarily count as conventional bank intermediation, because they are often refinanced in paper and securities markets, thereby removing the assets from the banks' balance sheets and putting them onto the books of mutual funds and other institutions. Shifting risk The risk here is not that the banks will necessarily run up yet more bad debts. Neither Northrop nor Martin Marietta could be described as overborrowed and the concentration of risk will be dispersed in the event of syndication. The big risks are more likely to be taken at a later point in the cycle when the market is palpably overheating. The more interesting question is whether by shifting risk out of the banking system into the securities markets and onto private individuals, the banks incur fewer bad debts, generate more stable fee income and end up with excessive capital. Because it is expensive to service, an excess of capital means commercial banks lose competitive advantage in intermediation vis a vis the markets. Historically, it has also tended to burn a hole in bankers' pockets, leading to injudicious acquisitions and loans. This is, in a sense, a novel dimension to the banks' longstanding problem in shrinking the more mature areas of their businesses. The central banks' reluctance to allow deposit-taking institutions to operate within an open market in corporate control makes contraction a difficult option, even if some, such as Wells Fargo in the US or Lloyds in the UK, have demonstrated a greater ability to retrench than others. The overwhelming priority for the banks, if their balance sheets do indeed become burdened with surplus capital, should be to avoid joining the dealmaking stampede, either as financiers or direct participants, when the party is turning into a riot. The under-explored virtuous alternative is to return capital to shareholders in the form of dividends. But can they bring themselves to do it?</p>

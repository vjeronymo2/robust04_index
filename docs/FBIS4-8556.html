			<p>BFN     [Text] The session of the FRY Assembly Chamber of Citizens  that was interrupted about 20 days ago has resumed. Here is  Mirjana Protic reporting from the Assembly building:    [Begin Protic recording] Fifteen minutes ago, the Federal  Assembly Chamber of Citizens adopted the Federal Assembly  declaration concerning the air strikes on the Serbian positions  in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Yugoslav Assembly  declaration states: The Federal Assembly of the FRY resolutely  condemns the NATO armed attacks under UN auspices that caused  destruction and casualties among the civilian population.  Having carried out these armed attacks, the United Nations has  abandoned its impartial peaceful role and openly sided with the  Muslim side in the civil war in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The Federal Assembly expresses extreme concern about the  (?unselective) consequences these attacks may have on ending the  civil war and on reaching a just political solution in the  former Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is known that the clashes have  escalated because the protected zones, particularly the one in  Gorazde, were used by Muslims for attacking Serbian positions.  The United Nations has not ensured disarmament within the  protected zone which it was obligated to do, nor did it react to  Muslim military actions coming from the protected zones, nor did  it exert influence on the Muslim side to stop armed activities.    Behaving in that way the United Nations has taken on itself  the risk and responsibility for all possible consequences that  cannot be predicted at the moment.    It is regretful that the very United Nations that is  obligated by its Charter to keep peace and international  security is taking a step that causes the war to escalate and  threatens the peace process.    The Federal Assembly warns that the policy of pressure,  ultimatums, and armed attacks against the Serbian side does not  lead to a peaceful solution of the civil war in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The Federal Assembly calls on the United Nations to stop  immediately aggressive actions against the Serbian people, to  abandon double standards toward the participants in the civil  war in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, to resume dialogue on  ceasing all military activities, and to seek a solution  exclusively in a political way, through negotiations, respecting  the interests of all sides.    The FRY will continue its hitherto constructive policy of  active participation in the peace process. However, the FRY  will not and cannot be indifferent toward actions that represent  armed attacks on the Serbian people in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina and will continue to monitor closely the  further development of the situation. Thus concludes the  Federal Assembly declaration that has just been adopted at the  session of the Chamber of Citizens. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> 21 MINERS FEARED DEAD  </P> <P> Rescue workers in southern Chile said 21 coal miners are feared dead after a  wall gave way, filling the mine shaft with floodwaters caused by heavy rains.  Divers entered the mine after pumps working through the night failed to lower  the water level in the shaft in Chile's main coal-mining region, 450 miles  south of the capital, Santiago. Firefighters said that an adjacent, abandoned  mine filled up with water during heavy rainfall in the last week, and the  pressure burst a wall separating the two shafts. Only four miners who were  working near the surface managed to escape the rush of water.  </P></p>

			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Regulatory changes move Misys ahead 23% Regulatory changes in the insurance industry favouring increased computerisation and continuing growth in open systems helped Misys, the acquisitive computing services group, report a 23 per cent increase in annual profits. Profits before tax for the 12 months to May 31 rose to Pounds 18.6m, against Pounds 15.1m last time. Turnover rose 5 per cent to Pounds 93.4m (Pounds 88.8m), although this took in Pounds 7.58m from acquisitions; sales from continuing operations fell to Pounds 85.8m, reflecting the continued decline in lower-margin hardware sales. Mr Kevin Lomax, chairman, said the results represented record levels of sales, profits and earnings per share and that acquisitions had contributed only modestly to the final outcome. The main acquisition during the year was Kapiti, a software house specialising in financial services, bought for Pounds 38m. Kapiti is based in the UK but much of its revenue is derived from overseas, increasing the group's international sales from 3 per cent to 25 per cent. Kapiti now constitutes Misys' banking services division. Mr Lomax said new business had been won in Moscow, Hong Kong and Dubai. Misys' largest operating division is financial services, which serves the insurance industry. It contributed Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 9.4m) to pre-tax profits. Mr Lomax said that a development programme aimed at producing new products based on client/server architectures and open systems technology was drawing to a close. The products would be launched over the next year and would be aimed initially at larger accounts where the company has traditionally been less active. He said there were few signs of an increase in capital investment in the company's main markets; changes in the insurance sector suggested the financial services division would continue to make good progress. Earnings per share were ahead 19 per cent at 31.9p (26.8p); a final dividend of 5.06p is recommended, making 8.06p (7.01p) for the year. COMMENT Continuing competitive and regulatory changes in the insurance industry, which have encouraged intermediaries to improve their efficiency through computerisation, are a significant factor in Misys' profitability despite the effect of recession on its other main markets. It is likely that the company can continue to mine the insurance seam for some time ahead, even if spending has to be pushed up to ensure leading edge technology. Kapiti should prove a sound foundation for growth in international banking. With pre-tax growth approaching 15 per cent expected this year, giving a prospective p/e of about 12, shares are undervalued.</p>

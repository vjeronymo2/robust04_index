			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement by FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at a </F> meeting of the WEU Council of Ministers in Luxembourg on 9 May"]    [Text] The present Council of Ministers is at the end of  its one-year Luxembourg presidency of the WEU [Western European  Union]. I would like to express thanks to [Luxembourg] Foreign  and Defense Minister [Jacques] Poos as well as to Ambassador  Linster and his colleagues.    Since our last ministerial meeting, we have made a  significant degree of progress in the development of the WEU.  This afternoon, we will welcome the Central European and Baltic  states as associate members. I am grateful to all my colleagues  that the proposal that I and [French] Foreign Minister [Alain]  Juppe made in the fall of last year has been taken up in such a  constructive manner.    I believe that we can be very pleased with the result. If we  are serious about admitting these states to the European Union  [EU], then a closer linkage with the WEU should accompany  associate membership with the EU. The creation of associate  membership status should achieve that.    I believe that the incorporation of these states into  European and transatlantic security structures should constitute  an important contribution to the security of all of Europe. The  possibility of participation on the part of these states in our  security and defense policy consultations as well as future  humanitarian and peace missions will create new fields for  cooperation. This cooperation is simultaneously closely linked  to an expansion of the Partnership for Peace with NATO, which is  intended to enhance military cooperation in particular.    Germany is in favor of closer cooperation between the WEU  and  the EU. When we assume the presidency of the EU at the  beginning of July, we want to work consistently to achieve  further progress. At the same time, a close link with NATO will  be increasingly important. This is the background against which  our closer cooperation with the associate members of NATO should  be viewed. In the future, they will be increasingly drawn into  our consultation and decisionmaking process as well as into our  joint operations and will thus play a comprehensive part in the  further development of the WEU.    The NATO summit's clear support for the further development  of Europe's security and defense identity with the goal of a  common defense policy for the EU is an important basis for a  stronger transatlantic partnership. The summit decision that  the Europeans could use the Atlantic alliance's common  structures and capacities for military missions within the WEU  framework is a way of setting the course for our future  cooperation. The implementation of the NATO concept for the  creation of an allied command is of great significance for the  further work of the WEU.    The period of expanding the WEU must now be followed by a  period of enhancement. Our goal, which we set at Petersberg in  1992 -- that is to say, to carry out missions to secure peace  independently -- is still to be achieved. A significant  improvement in cooperation at the level of armed forces  groupings, command structures and logistics, as well as  intelligence and infrastructure planning is necessary. This  could be a key issue over the next few months.    Please allow me to say something about the WEU consultations  about satellite-aided intelligence gathering. It is a very  ambitious idea. We now face having to make a decision about  whether we will cooperate beyond the study phase and go over to  the project phase. I believe that we should essentially accept  that challenge, because without a common European intelligence  capacity, a common crisis-management approach can scarcely be  realized. The projected expense, which is significant, must be  substantiated in a way that involves no objections.    The WEU will soon face the next test when it becomes  involved  in the administration of Mostar. Over the past few months, WEU  planning on policing has advanced considerably. If security and  order is not maintained in Mostar, then all other measures aimed  at reviving the city are built on sand. Should the WEU assume  this task, it can once again demonstrate that after its  successful participation in the implementation of the embargo in  the Adriatic -- together with the Atlantic Alliance -- and on  the Danube -- along with the EU -- it can make an important  contribution to the restoration of peaceful coexistence in  Mostar.    The second half of 1994 and 1995 will be overshadowed by the  EU Government Conference schedule for 1996. That also applies  to the WEU as a integral part of the development of a European  security and defense identity.    The proposal made by the future Dutch presidency regarding  an  examination of the requirements of a European defense policy as  the focus of the second half of the year has the full approval  of Germany. When Germany holds the EU presidency, we will  cooperate closely with the Dutch presidency to smooth the way  with regard to the EU and WEU so that the government conference  can open a new page on the path toward a common European  security and defense policy.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Arts: Thoughts on 'The Sleeping Beauty' - Ballet Music is one thing, movement is another. But put the two together, and the amalgam is something else again. To hear Tchaikovsky's score for The Sleeping Beauty is marvellous, but not half as marvellous as hearing it accompany the vision Tchaikovsky had in mind. And here is the main pleasure of Ninette de Valois's 1977 Royal Ballet production of Beauty, 90 per cent of the time. Simply, it tells its story with near-constant musical detail. To return to this after three years in which London has seen both Bolshoy and Kirov productions is like walking through clover after mining for gold. Looking again at de Valois's staging, I marvel at the near-perfect harmony (until late in Act Two) it weaves between sight and sound. This is at its clearest in the big mime scenes - at the end of the Prologue, for example, when Monica Mason's slighted Carabosse lays her fateful prophecy on the royal court and Genesia Rosato's Lilac Fairy overrules her; or when Rosato returns in Act One, to reassure the court about the lifeless Aurora ('She is not dead, but sleeps'). Every gesture, every opening of an eye, every lighting effect, makes a visual frame that answers the music's tapestry movingly. Yet however good it is to see this Beauty, listening to Mark Ermler's conducting of the score brings no joy. He has flamboyance and panache, yes; but he clots the lucid textures of Tchaikovsky's wonderful orchestration, and - worse - he keeps tugging the music from beneath the dancers' feet by his notions of rubato. Royal Ballet dancers try to be careful timekeepers at all times, but if the company is fully to recover from its 1980s recession, it must recover its old musicality and dance in real phrases. With conducting as egotistical as Ermler's, however, this will not be possible. Darcey Bussell, dancing her first Princess Aurora on Saturday night, coped more than handsomely with the double threat of debut nerves in the supreme 19th-century classical role and a difficult maestro. When Kenneth MacMillan made the ballerina role of his three-act Prince of the Pagodas on her, he was preparing her for this role. (He dedicated his production to Margot Fonteyn, the Royal's greatest Aurora.) And if Bussell now learns to unfold all the role's musical and poetic nuances, she will reward both us and herself for years to come. Already she combines expansiveness, innocence, and technical command in near-ideal measure. There has never been anything wrong with this production that could not be out right by listening to Tchaikovsky more feelingly. The two big Act Three pas de deux - for the Bluebird and his Princess, and for Aurora and her Prince - are conceived too little as musical revelations of character, too much as showstopping arrays of big steps. And the production has already begun to flag - in lighting, musical timing and dramatic sense - as the Prince enters the Lilac Fairy's boat to the sleeping castle. Why do we see Carabosse when the music tells us she is just a memory? Why does the Prince keep looking back? And so on. The Royal is dancing Beauty with more confidence and attack than in the late 1980s. Among the many soloist performances on Saturday, Nicola Roberts and Bruce Sansom stand out. Jonathan Cope, dancing the Prince, is no actor and (unlike Bussell) has no assurance in addressing an audience. But he is noble in the way he stands, in the flowing amplitude of his dancing, and in the self-effacing good manners of his partnering. He and Sansom are almost alone among Royal male dancers in the way they do not try to take their steps by force. As for the women, Bussell is almost the only one under the age of 30 who is truly classical. In current Royal Ballet style, you try to dance firm and brisk beneath the waist, and soft and gentle above the waist; and then, like an afterthought, you try to synchronise the two. (Not everybody succeeds.) Royal dancers are more classical and more vivid when they mime, because then they follow a single impulse. But this mime/dance dichotomy used not to exist here, and it should not now. Dance should simply take mime virtues and make them lyrical and brilliant. And Tchaikovsky's score tell you this too. In occasional repertory at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, until April 3</p>

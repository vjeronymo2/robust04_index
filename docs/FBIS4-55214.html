			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 10 May (MTI) -- "Due to good medical care  and, of course, to the outcome of the Sunday elections, my state  of health has improved a lot," Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP)  Chairman Gyula Horn told Hungarian Television today. In a car  accident last Thursday, Horn suffered a fractured cervical  vertebra, a broken wrist, and concussion. Now he is being  treated in a Miskolc hospital.    Commenting on the Socialist success, Horn said that those  who  offer authentic policies are accepted by the people. He felt  genuine change was badly needed in Hungary and could only occur  if the Socialists won the May 29 second round too.    Horn denied the rumour that the MSZP would nominate Gabor  Kuncze, prime minister candidate of the Alliance of Free  Democrats (SZDSZ), for the prime minister's post. "This idea was  not raised at all in the party. The prime minister will be  chosen by the winner of the elections," Horn said.</p>

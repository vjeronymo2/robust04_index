			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Money Markets: Liquidity tight CONDITIONS IN the London money market were difficult yesterday, with the Bank of England slow to remove a Pounds 1.15bn shortage. The overnight lending rate was stuck between 6 3/4 and 7 per cent in the morning, before falling to just above 6 per cent in the early afternoon after the Bank purchased Pounds 670m of bills. Late assistance of Pounds 455m cleared the shortage. The short sterling futures contract dropped back, partly because the pound was weakening on the foreign exchanges but also because of lingering expectations for a rate cut over the next two weeks. Dealers in the money markets are less convinced of an early rate reduction than their counterparts in the foreign exchange and equity markets, however. 'We are moving back towards the feeling that we had about three weeks ago that interest rates are likely to come down at the time of the Budget on November 30,' said one dealer. 'We do not believe that we are about to see a rate cut for political reasons, either this week during the Labour party conference, or next week when the Conservatives meet.' The December contract dropped as low as 94.34 before closing at around 94.35, down 4 basis points on the day. The three-month interbank rate was quoted yesterday at 6-5 7/8 per cent, reflecting scepticism about an early cut in rates. Dealers are expecting a big shortage today with the close of the month, the end of the quarter and - for some institutions - the end of the half-year coinciding. In addition, yesterday's gilts auction needs to be paid for today, so conditions may well be awkward. A decision by the Bundesbank to drain the German money market of liquidity took dealers by surprise. They had expected a more generous allocation of repo funds in the tender, but in the end the central bank took DM8.5bn from the system. All the funds were allocated at 6.7 per cent, with the Bundesbank choosing not to offer a lower rate. In spite of the withdrawal of funds, call money edged slightly lower, indicating that there are ample reserves in the system before the beginning of next month, when yesterday's repo funds will be credited. Call money was quoted at 6.80-6.90 per cent yesterday afternoon.</p>

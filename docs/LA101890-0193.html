			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: WHITTIER;  </P> <P> 14 BUILDINGS ADDED TO LIST THAT PROTECTS HISTORIC SITES  </P> <P> The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday night to add 14 buildings to its  local register of historic resources. The decision more than quadruples the  size of the local list from four to 18 structures.  </P> <P> A wide variety of buildings was selected. Among them is the Standard Oil  Building on Penn Street, an early 1900s example of a corporate office building.  Also included are the Philadelphia street bank building in which former  President Richard M. Nixon once practiced law, and homes dating back to the  1880s.  </P> <P> The Whittier Cultural Arts Commission and the Planning Commission winnowed down  the final nominees from a list of more than 75 buildings. The designation  provides the structures protection from significant alteration and demolition.  Major architectural changes must be approved by the city. And before a  demolition permit can be issued, there must be a 180-day waiting period. During  that six-month moratorium, the property owner and the city are supposed to  explore options to save the building.  </P> <P> Although the designation limits the property rights of an owner, it also  entitles them to significant property-tax savings under state law, said Elvin  Porter, the city's planning director.  </P></p>

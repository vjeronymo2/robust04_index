			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Observer: Junkie food Some thoughts from Paul Preston, holder of a degree in Hamburgerology, chairman of the Employers' Forum on Disability, and chief executive of the UK arm of McDonald's, which is currently spending an estimated Pounds 1m on suing for libel two unemployed people in London's High Court. Independent, April 30: 'Think of the first Caribbean holiday you ever had. The second one was not so exciting, was it? And the third one even less so. Everything has to be re-packaged and re-marketed.' Sunday Telegraph, January 9 1994: 'We cannot afford unhappy people because we have to have them coming back time after time.' Independent, July 16 1991: 'McDonald's isn't a job. It's a life.' Financial Times, June 28 1985: 'Sometimes I think if you cut a McDonald's employee, he would bleed ketchup.' Make mine a Burger King . . .</p>

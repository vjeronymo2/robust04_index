			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TITANS' MURPHY FINALIST FOR JOB AT SAN JOSE STATE  </P> <P> Gene Murphy, who has been interviewed for a number of jobs during his 10-year  tenure as Cal State Fullerton's football coach, is one of three finalists for  the vacant head coaching position at San Jose State, according to Spartan  assistant Rick Rasnick.  </P> <P> Rasnick, the team's offensive coordinator who also is a finalist, confirmed  that Murphy interviewed at the school last Friday and is a candidate along with  California offensive coordinator Terry Shea.  </P> <P> Murphy, who was a finalist for the Nevada Las Vegas job this past winter,  refused to comment on the San Jose State position and would not confirm that he  had interviewed there.  </P> <P> "I don't want to say a word about it, and that's all I'm going to say," Murphy  said.  </P> <P> Rasnick said Wednesday that he expects the school to make a decision today,  Friday or early next week. Among the other candidates interviewed were former  Detroit Lions coach Darryl Rogers, who coached the Spartans from 1976-78, Rams  assistant Artie Gigantino and Penn State assistant Ron Dickerson.  </P> <P> The four-man screening committee that interviewed candidates includes athletic  director Randy Hoffman, junior defensive back Hesh Colar; Dan Buerger,  executive assistant to the school president, and Dr. Charles Whitcomb, the  school's faculty representative to the NCAA.  </P> <P> "They haven't given me any time frame, but I think it's going to happen  quickly," Rasnick said. "They've interviewed everyone, talked to everyone, and  I think they're close to making a decision."  </P> <P> The San Jose Mercury News quoted Colar this week as saying the three candidates  are "all pretty even with a little more emphasis on Murphy and Shea. . . . The  players like Rasnick. The only concern with the committee is his lack of  experience."  </P> <P> Colar then told the Mercury News Wednesday that the committee had pared its  list to Murphy and Shea, but Rasnick said Wednesday night that he had not been  notified of such a decision.  </P> <P> Rasnick and Shea said they have not been offered the job or been told they  weren't going to receive offers.  </P> <P> One potential stumbling block for Murphy may be that, according to Rasnick, a  new coach wouldn't be able to hire assistants from the outside until next  December. The six current Spartan assistants are on contract through the 1990  season, and the school cannot afford to pay two staffs.  </P> <P> "I would think that would be unappealing to someone coming in from the outside,  but you never know," Rasnick said. "The whole timing of this has been unique  and has created some confusion."  </P> <P> Shea, who was the offensive coordinator at San Jose State from 1984-86, said  the staff situation wouldn't deter him.  </P> <P> "I've coached with about half the guys who are there now, and I would feel  comfortable with the ones I know," Shea said. "I'm prepared to handle that."  </P> <P> The San Jose State job opened up when six-year coach Claude Gilbert was fired  on March 21. The administration listed minor NCAA rules violations, a low  graduation rate among football players and differences in recruiting  philosophies as reasons for dismissing Gilbert, who last week filed a wrongful  termination grievance with the university.  </P> <P> Murphy, who has earned praise for building a competitive program despite the  Titans' meager budget and lack of an on-campus stadium, has a 54-60-1 record  and has won two conference championships, in 1983 and 1984.  </P> <P> He was a finalist for the UNLV position last December, but the job went to  former Notre Dame assistant Jim Strong. Murphy also met with Utah Athletic  Director Chris Hill about the position there, but was not formally interviewed.  </P> <P> Murphy was in demand in 1984, after the Titans went 11-1. He was offered the  vacant job at Utah that year, and withdrew from consideration at Oregon State  at the leading candidate. He chose to pursue the Missouri job, but the job went  to Woody Widenhofer.  </P> <P> Mike Murphy, the coach's son who is a sophomore at Fullerton, said he's not  sure his father would accept the job if it is offered.  </P> <P> "It might be like all the other job offers, when he says, 'Oh, well, I think  I'll just stay here,' " the younger Murphy said. "I know he's talked to them  (San Jose State officials), but he hasn't told me anything else. I have a  feeling he'll be here next season."  </P></p>

The Ecological Situation in  Russia: Another Perspective'']    [Text] On Tuesday, 15 March, at the Russian-American press  center there was a presentation of the book by Viktor  Danilov-Danilyan, Viktor Gorshkov, Yuriy Arskiy, and Kim Losev,  ``The Environment Between the Past and Future: The World and  Russia.'' In the words of the chief of the press service of the  Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources,  Aleksandr Shuvalov, the book marks a kind of stage in the  understanding of ecological problems. One must assume that such  a strong expression was used by no means because the current  leader of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural  Resources was among the authors--a fact that is important in and  of itself,. since it means that we have before us more than  simply the opinion of a group of researchers. The book really  does make a great impression, and this is certainly not achieved  because it contains another round of apocalyptic predictions.  Rather, on the contrary, attention is drawn to the absence of  alarmism and, which is always curious, an attempt to reinterpret  the current stereotypical ideas.    The most persistent of them is the certainty that  ecologically Russia is almost the worst place in the world. Upon  checking, it turns out that this is not altogether true and in  the majority of cases not even true at all.    For example, indicators of degradation of the land in  Russia,  which has 8 percent of the land in the world, are close to  average. The same thing can be said about degradation of  forestry systems. And Russia has almost 45 percent of the  nontropical forests and 27 percent of the world's supply of wood.    The total discharges of atmospheric pollutants amount to  6-12  percent of the average world level. Our contribution to the  production of chlorofluorocarbons which destroy the ozone layer  was about 10 percent. In the meantime, the United States,  Western Europe, and Japan together produce 73 percent of them.  Moreover, Russia has preserved the largest area of land  undisturbed by economic activity--scientists think that it could  play approximately the same role as the entire Brazilian part of  the Amazon region in stabilizing the environment.    Paradoxical as it may sound now, all the credit for the fact  that we have managed to preserve Russian nature to one degree or  another belongs to the centralized controlled economy, which is  usually reproached for chronic neglect of the environment. There  is no contradiction here in the strict sense of the word, since  nobody has yet managed to abolish that notorious unity and  struggle of opposites. Economic ineffectiveness and the  sluggishness of the centralized system plus the difficulty of  access and the harsh climate of the expanses of the northern  part of Siberia and the Far East have forced us to concentrate  our attention on already assimilated territories and make  significant capital investments in so-called national regions.  As a result, the ecosystems of the latter have been practically  completely deformed. As for the industrial revolution on the  ``old land,'' the fact that 70 percent of the gross national  product belongs to the defense complex is not the only result of  this. In terms of the indicator of expenditure of resources and  the quantity of pollutants per unit of gross national product,  Russia has outstripped all developed countries. According to  various estimates, losses because of damage to the environment  in the former Union amounted to from 15 to 20 percent of the GNP  annually. To this one should add the ``deferred'' damage, which  has been caused, is being caused, and will be caused by wastes,  mainly radioactive ones, that have been discharged in mass  quantities into the environment because of the use of  technologies that are imperfect but cheap and therefore  attractive for the moment.    Researchers single out three stages in the offensive against  the environment: virgin land, the age of the Ministry of Water  Management, which caused the Aral crisis, and large-scale  activity for prospecting and extracting oil and gas in the  northern part of Western Siberia. The first and last dealt a  blow to Russia itself, and, while the consequences of plowing  over the virgin land are known, one can only guess at the damage  to the ecosystems of the North.    In the meantime, the authors warn that a market economy,  being a more effective mechanism than a centralized one, in  principle is capable of causing more harm to the environment as  well. Even now, both private and investment capital are being  used for further development of resources and assimilation of  new territories, whether it be in the petroleum and gas fields  of the Barents Sea, on the Sakhalin Shelf, in Khanti-Mansia and  Yamalia, or the felling of forests from Europe to the Far East.    Of course, in such cases one comes to expect formulas, and  the authors try to satisfy this expectation. This might be a  purely subjective impression, but, unfortunately, the  satisfaction is not forthcoming. The declaration of the need to  take others' mistakes into account (they have in mind the  syndrome of plundering nature, which practically all developed  countries have experienced in the past) and the appeal to the  country's leaders to invest capital in science-intensive energy-  and resource-saving technologies--all these are nothing more  than good wishes. And references to the scenario for the  development of Japan and Germany in recent years and even the  ``small dragons'' of Southeast Asia are not very convincing.  Perhaps the social pessimism that has become a complex is to  blame for this.    It seems that the authors of the book invested their  emotions  (to the degree to which they can exist at all in a scientific  study) in destroying this complex. In terms of impact on the  environment, we descendants of a centrally controlled system are  in no way worse (but not better, either) than societies  developing according to the market scenario. Now, while cleaning  up their local territories, they are ``consuming'' or prepared  to ``consume'' the environment of the countries where it still  remains. In essence this is a policy of ``sweeping the dirt  under the rug.'' The mechanism for competition was not conceived  by man but was used by the biota and served as a stabilizing  factor for it. From all appearances, the biota has mechanisms  adequate to crowd out species that threaten its existence.  Mankind has a chance to test this--the life span of a species  averages 10 million years, but Homo sapiens, having prepared  everything for its own destruction, has existed for only several  tens of thousands of years.    As for Russians, they can only think globally and act  locally, and even now try both to acquire capitalism and to  protect the environment. Minister of the Environment Viktor  Danilov-Danilyan will share his opinion on how to do this in  practice in one of the next issues of SEGODNYA.</p>

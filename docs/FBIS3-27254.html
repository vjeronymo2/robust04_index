Sino-foreign jointly-funded companies for foreign trade,  commercial wholesale enterprises and production/retail  enterprises will be set up this year on a trial basis as part of  the efforts to help local products enter international markets.    Shanghai also plans to develop overseas trust companies,  common fund and share-holding companies and invite more foreign  finance institutions and well known transnational group  companies to establish regional headquarters in shanghai.    Large well-run enterprises are encouraged to use foreign  funds and to seek technological cooperation with world-renowned  overseas companies, especially in such fields as auto industry,  communications, electronics industry, computers, petrochemical  industry and metallurgical industry, the mayor said.    Apart from further boosting opening-up, Shanghai municipal  government will also attach much importance to the establishment  of a modernized market system in order to give the city full  play as the country's center of resource allocation.    To be set up are a foreign currency exchange, a gold market,  including gold ornaments, gold bullion and futures, and a  national market for inter-bank lending.    Based on the existing discount business, a market of  discount  and rediscount will be improved. Security market and financial  leasing market will also be opened up, according to Huang Ju.    The mayor encouraged various markets already existing to  enhance the quality of management and operation in order to  adapt to international market standards as soon as possible.</p>

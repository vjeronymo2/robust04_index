			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Solveig Rodsgaard: "The Long Election Period"] </F>   [Excerpts] The politicians and the voters seldom see four  years go by between elections. This is deplored by some, but  majority support for fixed election periods is lacking.    The year 1994 will be a remarkable election year. It looks  as  if the four-year election period will be fully utilized except  for a few months. Neither the voters nor the politicians could  have foreseen this when the last Folketing election was held on  12 December 1990, for Danes are not used to such a long time  elapsing between Folketing elections.    However it gives the politicians ample opportunity to stress  campaign positions and engage in political debate even though  the date of the election is not yet known. In long interelection  periods the last year is used almost exclusively for getting  into position for the coming election. This can be clearly seen  at the moment, and it is amplified by the fact that there is no  major legislation up for discussion in the Folketing.    On the other hand it must be noted that during the long  election period two notable popular referendums on European  Union (EU) policy have been held, so the voters have been to the  polls.    In the past 30 years the election period has been almost  fully utilized only three times. The VKR  [Liberal-Conservative-Radical Liberal] government came to power  as a majority government after the Folketing election on 23  January 1968. Prime Minister Hilmar Baunsgaard called the next  Folketing election on 21 September 1971. The government lost its  majority and the Social Democrats took over.    The next time the election period was almost used up was  under Poul Schluter's leadership. He called a Folketing election  on 10 December 1984 when his four-party coalition government was  voted down on the budget bill, and the next Folketing election  was not called until 8 September 1987. The four government  parties lost seats, but the coalition was reestablished.    When a Folketing election was held on 12 December 1990, the  result was a KV [Conservative-Liberal] government under Poul  Schluter. A little over two years later Schluter and the  government resigned because of the Tamil affair, and Poul Nyrup  Rasmussen stepped into office. Now he is the one who must call  the next Folketing government. Whether it is held in September,  October, or November, the election period will have been almost  entirely used up.  <H5>  Short Election Periods </H5>   Paragraph 32 of the Constitution states that Folketing  members are elected for four years. But the paragraph also  contains the provision concerning the prime minister's right to  dissolve the Folketing: "The king can call a new election at any  time with the effect that the existing Folketing mandates become  invalid when the new election has been held." [passage omitted]  <H5>  Restricting Dissolution Right </H5>   Lars Bille, associate professor of political science at  Copenhagen University, says it would restrict the political  system too much if fixed election periods that cannot be  deviated from are introduced:    "I do not think that would be healthy. Situations can arise  when it may be necessary to dissolve the parliament and call an  election. But restricting the prime minister's opportunities to  call an early election might well have a stabilizing effect on  the political system." [passage omitted]  <H5>  Keep Dissolution Right </H5>   Conservative Party leader Hans Engell does not think fixed  election periods are something to work for:    "If fixed election periods are considered at all, it would  require a major reform of our political system that includes a  higher cutoff limit for parliamentary representation, among  other things. They have fixed election periods in Norway and a  higher cutoff limit, but that has not prevented Norway from  getting into very difficult parliamentary situations in recent  years when the political system has largely ground to a halt for  long periods of time. They cannot call a Storting election, a  minority government cannot get its policies approved, and at the  same time the opposition cannot band together to overturn the  government. In any case there is nothing to suggest that fixed  election periods in Denmark, which has eight parties in the  Folketing and where a minority government is almost always in  power, would create greater parliamentary stability."    Engell says that the optimal situation for politicians,  after  all, is to try to make it through an entire election period:    "We have had some complete election periods too, you know,  for example from 1984 to 1987 under Poul Schluter. We now have a  complete period again, though we had a government change in the  middle. This provides some stability, but it must be admitted  that a government change without a Folketing election leaves a  residue of political frustration among the voters, who would  like a chance to express themselves before the government is  formed. Our experiences from January 1993 until now have shown  that it would have been a big advantage -- also for Poul Nyrup  Rasmussen, I think -- if there had been a real mandate to form a  government."    Engell wants to keep the dissolution right:    "It provides a way to resolve a difficult parliamentary  situation. The best thing is an unbroken election period in  which the four years are utilized in a politically effective way  by the government in combination with the Folketing. The next  best thing -- if this cannot be achieved -- is that the prime  minister has the authority to call an election."    The Conservative leader does not think the fact that no one  knows when the election will come hinders the political debate  in the last part of a long election period:    "The political debate is going full blast. It is one thing  that the government cannot pursue its policy, but that does not  hinder the debate from developing."  <H5>  Radical Liberals </H5>   Radical Liberal leader and Economic Affairs Minister  Marianne  Jelved says the Radical Folketing group will continue to work  for the appointment of a constitutional commission and that the  Radicals want fixed election periods, "in a moderated form." "We  have discussed the German model where the prime minister has the  right to dissolve the parliament, but with restrictions, and  where it is also more difficult to overturn a minority  government because they must assess whether there is a basis for  forming an alternative government."

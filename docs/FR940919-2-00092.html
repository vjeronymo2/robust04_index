			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of Duties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The broad scope of the disability claim manager's duties and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibilities, as outlined above and discussed in more detail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the following sections, presupposes a well-trained, skilled,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and highly motivated workforce that has the program tools and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technological support to issue quality decisions. Although  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability claim managers will work exclusively within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability programs, they will perform multiple tasks instead of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> singular activities, enabling them to experience the direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship between their actions and the final product. Varying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels of job complexity provide the opportunity for personal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development, growth, and learning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In carrying out their duties and responsibilities,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability claim managers will work in a team environment with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> internal medical and nonmedical experts, who provide advice and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance for complex case adjudication, as well as technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and other clerical personnel who may handle more routine aspects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of case development and payment effectuation. Where disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> team members cannot be physically co-located, they can share  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information via the automated claim processing system and remain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in communication using telephones or videoconferencing. Each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disability team member will have at least a basic familiarity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with all the steps in the process and an understanding of how he  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or she complements another's efforts; team members will be able  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to draw upon each other's expertise on complex issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this team environment, and with the proper training,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program tools (a simplified decision methodology and one set of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for decisionmaking) and technological support, one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual should be able to handle the duties and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibilities of the disability claim manager. An individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employee as the disability claim manager is basic to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objective of a single point of Agency contact for claimants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, in the near term, it may be necessary to consider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether the duties of a disability claim manager may be more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriately carried out by more than one individual and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, whether it is necessary to expand the ``disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> team'' described above to include additional employees. Claim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complexity, customer service needs, and service area location may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dictate a need for flexibility in delineating the specific duties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the individuals who comprise the members of the disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> team. In the near term, apprentice positions will be developed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which employees perform one or more duties of the disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claim manager while gaining experience and qualifying for greater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility. As the program tools and technological support,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which are the underpinnings of the new process, are fully  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implemented, it is envisioned that team duties and positions will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be modified and consolidated as necessary to fully realize the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> goal of an individual employee as disability claim manager.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Process Flexibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The disability claim manager will conduct a thorough  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> screening of the claimant's medical and nonmedical eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors. If the claimant appears ineligible for either disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program based on the claimant's allegations and evidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presented or available at the time of the claim intake interview,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the disability claim manager will explain this to the claimant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the decision regarding whether to file an application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be the claimant's alone and the disability claim manager  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not discourage a claimant from filing an application. If the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimant decides not to file a claim, the disability claim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manager will follow existing procedures for closing out an oral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inquiry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the claimant decides to file, the disability claim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manager will complete appropriate application screens from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automated and fully integrated (DI and SSI) claim processing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision support system. Impairment-specific questions will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assist the disability claim manager in obtaining information that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is relevant and necessary to a disability decision. Based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimant's statements and the evidence that is available at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interview, the disability claim manager will determine the most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective way to process the claim. If the evidence is sufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to decide the claim, the disability claim manager will take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary action to issue a decision and, if necessary,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectuate payment. The disability claim manager will determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what additional evidence is required to adjudicate the claim and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will take steps to obtain that evidence. Such steps may include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> asking the claimant to obtain further medical or nonmedical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence if the claimant is able to do so, requesting medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence directly from treating sources, or ordering further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical evaluations. As in the current process, SSA will pay for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the reasonable cost of providing existing medical evidence. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the claimant has a formal representative, the representative will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have the responsibility to develop medical and nonmedical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The disability claim manager will decide whether to defer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonmedical development (e.g., requesting SSI income and resource  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information, or developing DI dependents' claims) or do it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simultaneously with development of the medical aspects of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claim. In making this decision, the disability claim manager will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take into account the type of disability alleged, evidence and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other information presented by the claimant, and other relevant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances, e.g., terminal illness, homelessness or difficulty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in recontacting the claimant. Because the disability claim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manager maintains ownership of the claim throughout the initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision-making process, the disability claim manager will be in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the best position to choose the most efficient and effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manner of providing claimants with timely and accurate decisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> while meeting claimants' individual service needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

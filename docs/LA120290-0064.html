			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL OFTEN DOWN FOR COUNT  </P> <P> It's hard to get a quorum for meetings of the Significant Ecological Areas  Technical Advisory Committee, also known as SEATAC. Keeping a quorum is harder  still, because members sometimes must excuse themselves to avoid conflicts of  interest.  </P> <P> The obscure panel's seven members advise planning officials on development  projects in the county's 61 Significant Ecological Areas and recommend design  features to reduce environmental damage.  </P> <P> SEATAC recommendations are based partly on biota reports submitted by  consultants hired by developers. But in many cases, SEATAC members, four of  whom are full- or part-time environmental consultants, must disqualify  themselves because they have financial ties to the consulting firms submitting  the reports.  </P> <P> Most of the conflicts involve a single SEATAC member: the panel's current  chairman, Dick Friesen.  </P> <P> Friesen, a biologist, works for Michael Brandman Associates, a large  environmental consulting firm based in Santa Ana that is retained on some of  the biggest projects planned for Significant Ecological Areas.  </P> <P> So many developers hire Brandman that Friesen must excuse himself at least once  at almost every meeting. He was particularly silent at a June, 1989, meeting  when six projects were discussed, four involving Brandman.  </P> <P> Friesen is highly regarded by fellow panel members and county planning staff  who serve as liaisons to SEATAC.  </P> <P> SEATAC members are unpaid volunteers and there is no line forming to replace  them, said Pamela Holt, a section head with the county Department of Regional  Planning. Friesen's situation "is something that . . . we're monitoring  closely," Holt said. Planners would "like to keep him a member as long as it  isn't a problem,"  </P> <P> SEATAC member Gary Wallace, a botanist with the Los Angeles County Museum of  Natural History, called Friesen a "crackerjack person" and said conflicts have  "never been a problem at all."  </P> <P> A dissenting view, however, was expressed by Carlyle W. Hall Jr., a Los Angeles  attorney who has sued the county several times in land-use disputes. He  described the Friesen situation as unworkable.  </P> <P> "I'm sure the guy tries to do a good job, but it's a very obvious conflict,"  Hall said. Even when Friesen disqualifies himself, as chairman he has "some  impact on the overall process implicitly, if not explicitly," Hall said.  </P> <P> Hall said it is also possible that some developers retain Brandman "because  they know that the Brandman guy is chairman" of the committee.  </P> <P> "I can't help that perception, if that perception is there, but I don't think  that's why people hire us," Friesen said. He said it is Brandman's size and  prominence that ensures it a steady stream of clients.  </P> <P> Friesen said Brandman's clients do not get favorable treatment. "I think SEATAC  is harder on us than they are on anybody else. . . . They expect more from us,"  he said.  </P> <P> On this point, the evidence is inconclusive.  </P> <P> During the past year, SEATAC drafted memos to county planners recommending  rejection of two projects of Brandman clients that it regarded as highly  destructive of ecological areas: a big housing and golf course project in the  Valley Oaks Savannah area in Valencia and a residential tract in the Palo  Comado area in Agoura.  </P> <P> On the other hand, a report prepared by Friesen on the impact of a project on  an endangered species of ground squirrel in the Lovejoy Butte area in the  Antelope Valley helped a developer win approval for a small subdivision there.  Friesen recommended that the project be approved with the condition that the  developer do a further study on the ground squirrel before getting a grading  permit.  </P> <P> Friesen disqualified himself, SEATAC accepted his recommendation, and the  project was approved last May.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DEVELOPER, ESCONDIDO BATTLE FOR CONTROL OF CATTLE RANCH;  </P> <P> CONSTRUCTION: SLOW-GROWTH INTERESTS WANT TO QUASH PLANS TO PLACE 3,263 HOMES ON  PRISTINE LAND, BUT THE BUILDERS ARE SUING THE CITY AND COUNCIL MEMBERS FOR  TRYING TO DERAIL THE PROJECT.  </P> <P> Daley Ranch, a 4,400-acre cattle ranch that has belonged to the land-rich Daley  family for more than a century, will become Escondido's largest and most  prestigious subdivision if its owners and developers have their way.  </P> <P> The steep and rocky acreage in the northeast corner of the North County city  will become a low-density development compatible with its hilly terrain if the  Escondido City Council's new slow-growth majority has its way.  </P> <P> Which side will prevail? That question will be answered in coming months and  years, after a very expensive war is fought at council meetings, on the  streets, in living rooms, through the mail, at the ballot box and in the  courts.  </P> <P> The way Councilwoman Carla DeDominicis sees it, it is a battle for all the  marbles, a contest to determine who will run Escondido: the developers who, she  says, are concerned with only the bottom line or the council, which, she  claims, is concerned with only the best interests of the city and its  residents.  </P> <P> No one wonders where DeDominicis stands. The newspaper reporter-turned-attorney  won a council seat in 1988 based on her contention that the city needed to get  a grip on growth and plan its future.  </P> <P> DeDominicis and Kris Murphy, another winner in the 1988 election, teamed up  with veteran Councilman Jerry Harmon to form a slow-growth majority on the  five-member council that, for the past 18 months, has pressured impatient  developers by negotiating lower development densities and increased  contributions for city improvements.  </P> <P> But not until Daley Ranch developers notified the city last August that they  were prepared to begin a 3,263-home project did the council trio turn them down  flat and advise them to revamp their plans to conform to new growth-management  ordinances and a revised general plan that cuts in half the city's ultimate  population, from 300,000 to 150,000.  </P> <P> An interim city ordinance, adopted to stem development until the new  growth-management rules are in place, provides building permits only to major  developers who have agreements with the city. Daley Ranch does not have such an  agreement.  </P> <P> "It's simple," DeDominicis said. "Now they have to play by our rules," which,  under the proposed general plan, call for a maximum of 1,700 residences on the  Daley Ranch. That number would not provide sufficient profit to the developer,  said a former Escondido councilman.  </P> <P> To Shea Homes and Daley Corp., two of the largest family-owned corporations in  the nation and joint owners of Daley Ranch, the battle is over property rights.  </P> <P> In a lawsuit filed in October against the city, its attorney and its three  slow-growth council members, attorneys for Daley Ranch Associates ask the court  to order the city to abide by agreements signed as far back as 1982, when Daley  agreed to annex the historic ranch to Escondido.  </P> <P> The present council "has a non-discretionary duty" to negotiate a development  agreement with Daley under earlier agreements that would have allowed  construction of 3,263 homes, the suit claims.  </P> <P> City staff and elected officials have "attempted to extort unreasonable  concessions" from Daley Ranch developers by limiting the number of units that  can be built, according to Daley Ranch attorneys. The suit seeks about $200  million in damages from the city and a minimum of $10 million in damages from  each of the slow-growth council members -- Harmon, DeDominicis and Murphy --  and from City Atty. Lloyd Chapman. By naming Chapman, the developers' suit  forced the city attorney to disqualify himself and the city to hire outside  representation, San Diego attorney Louis Goebel, at an estimated cost of  several hundred thousand dollars.  </P> <P> The four city officials should pay punitive damages "to deter future similar  outrageous and illegal conduct," the lawsuit stated.  </P> <P> DeDominicis labeled the request for individual judgments "malicious and  improper" and predicted that the lawsuit would be thrown out of court. She  described it as a "harassment tactic" that could have a chilling effect on city  officials seeking to follow the dictates of their consciences and constituents.  </P> <P> All three members have vowed to file a countersuit for malicious prosecution  after the lawsuit has run its course.  </P> <P> "If they really were serious about recovering money from me as an individual  citizen and not as an elected official, they could have filed in small-claims  court," where the limit of a claim is $2,000, DeDominicis quipped.  </P> <P> The developers say they are not interested in recovering damages from the city.  Rather, they are interested in building houses under agreements that the city  and previous councils have approved, they say. The slow-growth troika is  "stone-walling" all efforts toward that end, they claim, and their lawsuit is  an attempt to force the city to negotiate in good faith.  </P> <P> Thomas Noon, head of Shea Homes San Diego division, said he has been trying to  negotiate with the city for more than a year to allow the Daley Ranch  development to proceed. City officials have rejected the plan as "not in  substantial conformance" with earlier plans and have told Shea that it must do  a complete environmental impact review on their altered plan before it can be  considered.  </P> <P> To do so would be "extremely expensive and also extremely risky, given the  city's present political makeup," Noon said, referring to the slow-growth  majority.  </P> <P> Looming in the next two months are final hearings on the proposed general plan  that would initiate slow-growth policies and pare development levels by about  half, not only on Daley Ranch but citywide.  </P> <P> Noon believes that Escondido residents back the slow-growth coalition in its  efforts to prevent the problems of rapid urbanization: traffic congestion,  school overcrowding, air pollution, water and sewer problems. But, he stresses,  the Daley Ranch project is different. It is part of the solution, not the  problem, he said.  </P> <P> The Daley Ranch developers have pledged $8 million to $11 million for road  improvements outside the ranch property, Noon said. They also plan to build  schools and to contribute to the community's cultural and recreational  projects.  </P> <P> "We have done several polls over the past months, and I am certain that the  city's rejection of our project is not in keeping with the sentiments of the  general populace of the city," Noon said.  </P> <P> Noon said that he has "personally sat down with probably 500 residents to talk  face to face, in groups of three, four, five or 10 people," and set them  straight on Daley Ranch. He found most people "terribly misinformed," he said.  </P> <P> Councilman Harmon, who plans to run for mayor in June, said he has not  participated in the polls or meetings but has heard from friends that poll  questions were "loaded" and other information was of questionable accuracy.  </P> <P> In light of his landslide victory in the 1988 council election, "I'm convinced  the people are with us in our efforts to bring the city's growth into  reasonable limits," Harmon said. He suspects that Daley Ranch public-relations  efforts are aimed toward a ballot measure that would put the issue to voters,  bypassing the council.  </P> <P> Councilwoman DeDominicis believes the campaign of mailings, informational  talks, community meetings, personal letter appeals and polling might even be a  prelude to a recall effort targeting the slow-growth members.  </P> <P> Noon and representatives of the Lynn Wessell Company, which is overseeing the  pro-Daley Ranch campaign, say there are no plans for either a ballot measure or  a recall of council members.  </P> <P> Noon said that the polls indicate that council members have a higher opinion of  their public support than is warranted. Polls showed that between half and  two-thirds of Escondido voters could not name a single council member, and that  only a slightly higher number recognized the members' names as they were read.  </P> <P> Suzanne Hoehl, Daley Ranch campaign coordinator, said that more community  meetings, mailings and coffee klatsches are scheduled to win Escondido voters  to the side of Daley Ranch.  </P> <P> Lynn Wessell's services are sought by besieged developers statewide because of  his pro-development successes. His most famous coup came in the 1988 Orange  County elections, when Proposition A, which would have set limits on new  construction, was favored by 80% of voters polled just eight weeks before  election day.  </P> <P> In that short time, Wessell, using sophisticated computer programs, targeted  voter lists and deployed hundreds of workers to turn around public opinion. The  growth-control measure lost by a healthy 56% to 44% margin.  </P> <P> Harmon says that his concern over the Daley Ranch campaign does not focus on  Wessell, who "is simply hired to do his job," but on Daley Corp., which in an  earlier annexation election allegedly used "political dirty tricks" in an  attempt to persuade rural Lehner Valley voters to annex to Escondido.  </P> <P> On the eve of the election, Lehner Valley residents received bogus copies of  the Lehner Valley News, a sporadic publication of annexation opponents. The  edition reported that annexation opponents had changed their minds and now  favored joining the city.  </P> <P> The effort was quashed when annexation opponents traced the look-alike to Daley  Corp. through the postage meter number. An eleventh-hour telephone campaign to  alert voters to the ruse resulted in defeat of the annexation issue.  </P> <P> Harmon said of Daley Ranch campaigners: "They may bamboozle an awful lot of  people and they may promise an awful lot of things, but I still believe that  the residents of Escondido are behind our efforts to control growth, and the  momentum is building."  </P></p>

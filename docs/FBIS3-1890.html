			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, March 2 (XINHUA) -- Following is an  extracted version of a speech by Jin Yongjian, head of the  Chinese delegation at the 50th session of the [UN] Commission on  Human Rights, in Geneva today:    The Chinese Government always attaches great importance to  the promotion and protection of human rights, and has endeavored  to guarantee the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all  its citizens through legislative, judicial and other measures.  Chinese Constitution clearly stipulates that all the power of  the People's Republic of China belongs to the people. According  to the Constitution, the Chinese citizens enjoy extensive  political, economic, cultural and social rights. They also  enjoy various kinds of freedoms, such as the freedom of speech,  press, assembly, demonstration and religious believes, etc.    The Constitution provides for the equality of all the 56  nationalities in the country irrespective of their population  sizes and prohibits oppression of and discrimination against any  nationality. In the light of its own specific conditions in the  country, the Chinese Government is stepping up efforts to build  up democracy and legal system with the view to further promoting  social development and upholding the people's rights and  interests.    Like many other countries, in contemporary history China was  subjected to aggression and plundering by foreign powers.  Before 1949, the Chinese people were for a long time victims to  the enslavement and oppression in the hands of imperialists,  feudalists and bureaucratic-capitalists. They lived in dire  misery without any human right or fundamental freedom at all.  Since the founding of New China, the Chinese Government has  been working to uphold national independence, sovereignty and  territorial integrity, and attaches great importance to  safeguarding the rights of the Chinese people to subsistence and  to development. Over the past four decades, China has scored  widely-acknowledged successes in its economic construction.  Particularly since the adoption of the policy of reform and  opening-up to the outside world in the late 1970s, China has  been developing its economy at a fast pace, making a steady  improvement in the people's living standard. Chinese citizens  today enjoy much more human rights and fundamental freedoms than  anytime in the past. This fact has been acknowledged by all  unbiased persons.    China is a developing country with a huge population. In  spite of the significant progress made in all field through  decades of efforts, we are still faced with many problems.  Because of disparities of development level among regions, some  regions in the country are falling far behind others. The  country has a net population growth of about fifteen to sixteen  millions per year. Overpopulation has reduced the ratio of  resources for each person. Bearing in mind those hard facts, the  Chinese Government has always accorded primary importance to the  development of its national economy and the improvement of the  people's living standard.    The development of economy and the improvement of the  people's living conditions is a basic guarantee for greater  enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Political  reform must conform to the country's specific conditions, ensure  social stability and promote smooth economic development. At  present, the Chinese people are focusing their energy on  economic development, meanwhile endeavoring to strengthen  democracy and legal system and carrying out political reform.  In view of different historical and cultural backgrounds and  different stages of development of different countries, we hold  that all people have the right to choose the social systems and  development paths suitable to the conditions of their own  countries. No country should impose on others its own ideology  and development pattern.    In the field of human rights, we believe that in the spirit  of international cooperation and equal consultations as  underlined in the Vienna Declaration and programme of action,  all countries should strive for greater understanding and  broader cooperation by means of dialogue on the basis of equal  footing and mutual respect. We are strongly opposed to any  interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state or the  exertion of political pressures under the pretext of human  rights. Some Western countries, in repeatedly concocting a  draft resolution on the so called human rights situation in  China, are deliberately turning a blind eye and a deaf ear to  China's progress and development and to the fact that the  Chinese people are enjoying a broad range of human rights and  fundamental freedoms. This is a typical example of politicizing  human rights issues and of applying pressures on China under the  pretext of human rights. The Chinese Government is firmly  opposed to such attempt.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Tallinn, Apr 08, BNS -- The Estonian government  on Thursday [7 April] accepted the resignation of Col. Ants  Laaneots, the chief of the country's defense forces' general  staff. The Cabinet expressed hope that the Estonian Defense  Forces "will not be deprived" of Laaneots' services.    Laaneots tendered his resignation March 24 and Defense  Forces  chief, Maj. Gen. Aleksander Einseln accepted it a week later.    President Lennart Meri will make the final decision on  Laaneots' resignation. [passage omitted]    The Tallinn-based EESTI EKSPRESS weekly claims in its latest  issue that many of Laaneots' fellow officers and superiors in  the Soviet Army were not aware that his father in 1944 fought  against Russians in a border guard regiment formed by the  Germans and after the Red Army invaded Estonia joined the  so-called "forest brethren" (partisans) in the southwest  Estonian Parnu region.</p>

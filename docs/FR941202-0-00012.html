			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 35.27&blank;Visiting authorized user.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that this section should be retained. The commenter stated that the paperwork associated with the proposed notification (&sect;35.14) would be unduly burdensome for temporary authorized users who provide coverage during another authorized user's vacation or sickness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission disagrees with the commenter. When allowing a temporary authorized user to work, the licensee does not need to notify the NRC each time that the individual provides coverage during another authorized user's vacation or sickness. Under the notification requirement (&sect;35.14), the licensee needs to notify the NRC no later than 30 days after the date the licensee permits the individual to work as a temporary authorized user. The next notification is when that individual permanently discontinues as a temporary authorized user. A notification is not required during each period of coverage between the beginning and the termination of the service of the temporary authorized user. This notification procedure also applies to a temporary authorized nuclear pharmacist. Thus, this section has been removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 35.50&blank;Possession, Use, Calibration, and Checks of Dose Calibrators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several comments were received related to this section. These comments and NRC's responses are summarized below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The proposed phrase ``over the range of its use between the highest dosage that will be administered to a patient or human research subject and 1.1 megabecquerels (30 microcuries)'' should be clarified. ``Over the range of its use'' could mean between the highest and lowest dosages that will be administered; the lowest dosage may not be 1.1 megabecquerels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission agrees with the comment. The final amendment will be modified to delete the phrase ``over the range of its use.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Linearity tests for a dose calibrator should cover the range from the highest patient dosage to the lowest patient dosage that will be administered by a licensee. The lowest dosage could be in millicurie quantities for many licensees. Thus, it is not necessary to test linearity to 1.1 megabecquerels (30 microcuries).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The intent of changing the lower limit of the linearity tests from 10 microcuries to 30 microcuries is to conform with the requirements of the Quality Management Program (&sect;35.32) and to relieve a minor burden for measuring activities between 10 and 30 microcuries without reducing radiation safety. To go beyond this by changing this limit to the lowest patient dosage would have ramifications on the constancy checks, accuracy tests, and recordkeeping requirements (i.e., &sect;&sect;35.50(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3); and 35.53(a), (b), and (c)(3)). Therefore, deleting this specific lower limit is beyond the scope of this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In expressing the units in both English units and SI units, English units should be first, followed by SI units in parentheses. Also, is there any scientific rationale for the precision implied by 1.1 mBq, instead of using 1 mBq?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission published a policy statement entitled ``Conversion to the Metric System'' (57 FR 46202; October 7, 1992). This policy statement specifies that the first unit will be in the SI unit with the English unit shown in brackets. In terms of significant digits, the implied uncertainty for 30 microcuries is somewhere between 29 and 31 microcuries and for 1.1 mBq is somewhere between 1.0 and 1.2 mBq. If 1 mBq is used, the implied precision would be less. Therefore, 1.1 mBq has been retained in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 35.52&blank;Possession, Use, Calibration, and Checks of instrumentation to measure dosages of alpha- or beta-emitting radionuclides.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There were several comments concerning this section. These comments and the NRC's responses are discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The proposed requirements for linearity and geometry tests are not consistent with methods of assaying alpha or beta emitters, such as liquid scintillation counting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulatory text includes the phrase ``as appropriate for the use of the instrument.'' Therefore, if linearity or geometry tests are not appropriate for an instrument, the tests are not required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Does the term ``unit dosage'' include a vial that contains multiple dosages?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A unit dosage can be either a pre-filled syringe or a vial that contains a prescribed dosage for a patient or a human research subject. Thus, a vial containing multiple dosages is not a unit dosage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In some cases, it may not be practical to order an exact unit dosage before the administration to a patient or human research subject. For example, the size of a brain cyst is determined during surgery and a precise dosage cannot be prescribed before the operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT  </P> <P> A leader in the white supremacist movement hopes to host a two-day "White  Power" rock festival on private land in Northern California next month,  according to United Press International. Flyers that have turned up in some San  Francisco Bay Area communities recently said the festival, billed as an "Aryan  Woodstock," will feature at least four "skinhead" rock groups, with firearms  among the door prizes. "It's simply going to be a gathering of like-minded  people for music, relaxation and fun," said Tom Metzger, a former Ku Klux  Klansman and founder of White Aryan Resistance. A message on the answering  machine at Metzger's Fallbrook, Calif., organization said the festival would be  the "first in a series of concert-rallies that will take place around the  world." "This is a whites-only gathering," the taped message warned. "All you  race mixers, stay home." The event supposedly will be on a private farm near  Vallejo, although details were sketchy. Richard Hirschhaut, director of the  local Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, which studies white supremacists  and other hate groups, said his group and others opposed to the neo-Nazis would  hold a counter-demonstration near the proposed festival.

			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ashanti puts the gold back into the Gold Coast - Paul Adams on next week's flotation of the jewel in the crown of Ghanaian mining When Ashanti Goldmines Corporation is floated on the London Stock Exchange next week the Ghanaian government will have put in place the most important part of its privatisation programme. It already has divested most of the State Gold Mining Corporation's stakes in local mines, usually retaining 10 per cent of these ventures. In the case of Ashanti, the jewel in the crown, it is reducing its shareholding from 55 per cent to 31.3 per cent. Since new mining laws in 1986 opened Ghana's moribund mining industry to foreign capital and expertise, Australian mining companies have been particularly ready to lead the way with investment and management, bringing with them their expertise in open pit mining. For example, the share price of Golden Shamrock in Australia has risen sharply since in late 1992 it began producing gold at the Iduapriem mine, some 100km south of Ashanti. Golden Shamrock is the main shareholder in Ghanaian Australian Goldfields, a Dollars 65m joint venture with the International Finance Corporation and the Ghanaian government. The mine, which in 1992 had more than 1m troy ounces of proven and probable gold reserves, is producing about 110,000 ounces a year. Two junior Australian companies, Ranger Minerals and Associated Goldfields are also investing in the region. Ranger has raised ADollars 27m for Abosso Gold Fields, a mine close to Iduapriem. Kiwi Gold Fields is financing a small property south of Ashanti. Meanwhile, the Southern Cross mine has been acquired by Obenomase Gold Mines, 90 per cent owned by Turnbull Doyle Resources of Australia, which is seeking a stock market listing. Some South African companies have also been attracted to the region by the relative political stability of Ghana and low production costs. Gold Fields of South Africa bought Tarkwa gold mine in western Ghana from the state mining corporation last year and since July has doubled production to 4,000 ounces a month while halving the workforce to 1,400. Johannesburg Consolidated Investments is to manage Prestea, near Tarkwa, at present state-run. Billiton, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group owns the Bogosu mine, one of the assets Gencor of South Africa hopes to acquire from the oil group. Bogosu is producing about 100,000 ounces of gold a year. Cluff Resources of the UK is developing a 30,000-ounces-a-year gold mine at Ayanfuri, west of Dunkwa. Further north, Pioneer Corporation, another Australian company, has taken over the mine at Teberebi and increased the production rate from 160,000 ounces last year to 240,000 ounces. The Canadian group Bonte Gold has bought an alluvial gold mine and begun trial production at about 1,200 ounces a month. Of course none of these can compare with Ashanti, one of the world's richest gold mines. Ashanti's production has increased threefold since 1986 from 242,366 to 770,410 ounces in the financial year ending September 1993. The company's expansion programme is ahead of schedule and it expects output to reach 1m ounces by 1995, which would make it one of the the world's top 10 gold producers. Ashanti's 1993 after tax profits were Dollars 90.5m, up from Dollars 60.6m the previous year. Production costs are in the lowest 20 per cent worldwide. According to Mr Sam Jonah, Ashanti's chief executive, the mine is poised for substantial expansion. 'There is no reason why this mine should not go on producing 1m ounces a year for the next 50 years,' he says, 'particularly now we have an aggressive exploration programme for the first time in our history. 'The aggregate of the company's proven and probable ore reserves has increased to 18.1m ounces from 16.8m. For five years running new delineated gold reserves have exceeded production.' Ashanti has just acquired a 140 sq km concession for exploration, adjoining the existing 256 sq km at the Obuasi site, about 180km north of Accra. Last year cash operating costs were Dollars 173 an ounce, rising to Dollars 253 if depreciation and royalties were included, against an average market price over the year of Dollars 357 an ounce. Industry analysts rate Ashanti as one of the world's finest gold prospects. Its strength lies in the variety of ore deposits extracted from both deep mines and open pits. Material is treated by four separate processing plants. The open pit operations, begun in 1990, cut production costs and funded the investment in the underground infrastructure, which is expensive to develop but opens the way to much bigger deposits. Apart from the volatility of the gold market the investment risks in Ashanti are linked to Ghana's political future. President Jerry Rawlings' government has been the leading exponent of economic liberalisation in black Africa, but the favourable investment in Ghana will depend on a continuation of his policies, backed by the International Monetary Fund. Ashanti's recovery in the 1980s and the current Dollars 305m Ashanti Mine Expansion Project have been funded partly by the IMF's offshoot, the International Finance Corporation and participating lenders. The management believes that the flotation will free Ashanti from the 'shackles' of the IFC, giving it the flexibility to develop mining operations elsewhere in Ghana and abroad. Since the 1970s Lonrho has been the other major shareholder in Ashanti, with 45 per cent, and has managed the operations. The company's first flotation is a complex transaction, with two offers on the Ghanaian stock exchange and one in London. When dealing starts next week the shares will be tradeable simultaneously in both markets. The company is taking the opportunity to raise new money by issuing 3.5m new shares, which will dilute Lonrho's holding to 43.1 per cent. The Ghanaian government and Lonrho have undertaken, subject to certain exceptions, not to increase or decrease their shareholdings for two years. The government will retain a 'golden share' to protect Ghana's national interest. International advisers to the flotation, stockbroker James Capel and merchant bank Morgan Grenfell, have indicated a price range between Dollars 17 and Dollars 20 a share, which values Ashanti at Dollars 1.42bn to Dollars 1.67 bn. The price will be finally be fixed when dealing starts in London on Tuesday. Shares worth at least Dollars 68m are being offered to Ghanaian and other West African investors. This is equivalent to 45 per cent of the previous total capitalisation of companies quoted on the Acra stock exchange, and is over 10 per cent of Ghana's total bank liquidity. Some 10,000 Ashanti employees are to receive five free shares each in the floatation.</p>

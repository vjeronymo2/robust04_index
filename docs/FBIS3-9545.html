Secretary of State at the Defence Ministry Jerzy Milewski,  who is accompanying the defence minister in his American visit,  explained that only assistance within the framework of bilateral  cooperation is concerned because one cannot count on the  American side to grant money to cover Polish part of costs  involved in the implementation of the "Partnership for Peace"  programme.    Kolodziejczyk added that NATO intends to assign between 15  and 40 million dollars for the whole "Partnership for Peace"  programme and costs Poland would have to bear are estimated at  25 million dollars.    Jerzy Milewski said that the Polish delegation tried to  persuade the senators with whom it met that means for assistance  to Poland should be assigned from the U.S. budget. This matter  was supported by Senator Hank Brown, who promised to put forward  a motion to the effect.    Minister Kolodziejczyk said that the modernization of the  Polish Army is the condition of top priority for the development  of military cooperation between Poland and the United States.    Although the present policy pursued by the Pentagon does not  envisage the sale of arms to countries of eastern and central  Europe, minister Kolodziejczyk said that he was striving also  for this. "We have to gain a supplier alternative to the  previous eastern one because such are the attributes of a  sovereign state," the minister added.    He also revealed that joint Polish-American manoeuvres would  be held in Poland this year. He explained that he settled this  issues during the Wednesday meeting with Chairman of the U.S.  Joint Chiefs of Staffs John Shalikashvili, who is to monitor the  exercises.    On Thursday, Kolodziejczyk met with director of the Central  Intelligence Agency James Woolsey with whom he discussed  cooperation in the field of military intelligence.    On Friday Kolodziejczyk is to sign a Polish-American  agreement on military cooperation.</p>

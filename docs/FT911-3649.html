			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Untitled item RECORD numbers of power stations are being built in England and Wales, the seven-year statement issued by the National Grid Company disclosed yesterday. Nine new stations, with a total capacity of 7,400MW, have signed agreements for connection to the national electricity grid, NGC said. New stations planned by National Power and PowerGen, the two large generators, account for about 3,000MW of the new capacity. The rest is being built by independent power projects, notably the ICI and Enron consortium, which is planning an 1,875MW station on Teesside. The new plant would mean about 35 per cent spare capacity on the system, compared with an ideal surplus of about 24 per cent. That high margin would be likely to force old stations to close, NGC said. It had taken into account peak electricity demand expectations, which it predicted would rise from 49,200MW in the year ending March 1992 to 52,000MW in the year ending March 1998. These forecasts were broadly unchanged from those in the last seven-year statement. Mr John Uttley, the NGC's finance director, said the company was spending more on infrastructure and less on refurbishment as a result of the many new stations joining the grid. NGC could afford the capital, he said. He expected capital expenditure to rise from Pounds 300m in the year ending March 1991 to Pounds 400m in the following year. That would accord broadly with expectations at the time of the electricity flotation, Mr Uttley said.</p>

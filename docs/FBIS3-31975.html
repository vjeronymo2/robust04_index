The police deployment, which includes vehicle checks, was  prompted by the National Transportation Commission (CNT), which  said it will stage a huge march with 5,000 vehicles that will  gather in Managua tomorrow to continue the protest against the  government.    Although the government has released more than 200 drivers  who had been arrested in the past operations in Managua, the  CNT, which called the strike, this weekend rejected the way four  transportation organizations made "deals" with the government,  causing them to be labeled "traitors" by the CNT.    The city newspapers published reports on Managua's  militarization, noting there are few cases in which street  corners and crossings are not guarded by policemen who are armed  with Soviet AKA rifles and ammunition, giving the impression  they are going to war.    Many policemen are driving state vehicles, including  Transportation and Construction Ministry vehicles. [passage  omitted]</p>

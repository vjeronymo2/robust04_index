			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Arts: Oslo Philharmonic - Barbican Hall Ten years ago it would have been unthinkable that the Oslo Philharmonic should have featured in a 'Great Orchestras of the World' series and, what is more, promised to be one of the most exciting attractions. So quickly can an orchestra's standing rise under inspired leadership. On its present tour the orchestra is directed, as before, by the Lithuanian-born Mariss Jansons. Like Szell in Cleveland or Dorati in so many cities, Jansons has proved to be a tireless orchestral trainer, set on raising his players to the highest standards of ensemble. The orchestra has become his ship, bound to follow where its Principal Conductor, with all his personal enthusiasms, his strengths and weaknesses, pilots it. At their Barbican concert on Saturday the course was set for the 19th-century German romantics, Brahms and Wagner, not really home waters for this conductor and an area from which he has largely stayed away on record. It is also worth remembering that the Oslo orchestra is not naturally endowed with the glorious sound of great orchestras like Berlin or Vienna. What they have achieved with Jansons is the result of hard grind. Typically there was nothing lazy about their performance of Brahms's Second Symphony, which opened the concert. Accents were weightily despatched; notes were conscientiously held for their full length. Neeme Jarvi, a neighbour in spirit perhaps, as he is Estonian, has given us this kind of Brahms before, with its emphasis on a thick and glutinous texture, as though the music asks for rich paste lyricism, no matter how sticky the going may become. The trouble is that Jansons's nature is the opposite. He always wants to be dynamic, as one could see briefly when the third movement trio flashed past with Tchaikovsky-like brilliance. However, for too much of the time in this symphony he seemed to be doing what he thought was right, rather than letting his inhibitions go, as usual. The Wagner, the Prelude and Liebestod from Tristan, went much better, some overheating at the climaxes apart. Then the programme ended with a showpiece account of the favourite second suite from Ravel's Daphnis et Chloe. No excess of Gallic sensibility here. The sunlight at daybreak glared with the forceand brilliance of the brass. The rhythms of the bacchanal pounded with red-blooded animal excitement. This was Jansons unrestrained and the Oslo players supported him splendidly.</p>

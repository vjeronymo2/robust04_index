			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Business and the Environment: Only time will tell - Clean coal technology can compete successfully with gas, but not in the immediate future The run-down of British Coal is taking place against the background of a huge effort elsewhere in the world to develop efficient 'clean coal' power stations which could compete with natural gas on economic and environmental criteria. The problem in the UK is that the only coal-fired stations capable of competing financially with natural gas plants at today's prices are old ones whose capital costs have been written off. And they produce more pollution - sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and carbon dioxide. But the position may be quite different a decade or two from now, when gas supplies are running short and new generations of clean coal plants are in operation. There is 'a ferment of innovation' in coal burning, says Walter Patterson, an energy analyst specialising in coal technology. 'The world's engineering companies and their enlightened clients are spending large sums in a hectic race to expand the range of advanced coal technologies, improve their efficiency and enhance their environmental performance. What is more, they are succeeding.' Some 38 clean coal plants are operating in the US, where government and industry are jointly funding a Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.9bn) clean coal programme over five years. One demonstration is AES Shady Point, a 320MW cogeneration (producing both electricity and heat) plant in Oklahoma which has low emissions not only of sulphur and nitrogen oxides but even of carbon dioxide. In Europe and Asia, too, scores of advanced coal burning plants are being planned and built. But in the UK, where much of the original research into clean coal technology was carried out, the level of activity is now very low compared with other countries. The clean coal power stations developed so far fall into two broad categories: Fluidised bed combustion (FBC) involves burning powdered coal in a bed of pulverised limestone or dolomite (which acts as a chemical trap for any sulphur emitted from the fuel). An upward flow of air keeps the bed in constant motion like a boiling kettle. One turbine is driven by steam produced in boiler tubes in the fluidised bed and a second by the hot exhaust gases. Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plants have a gasifier in which coal reacts with steam and air or oxygen to produce a raw fuel gas containing carbon monoxide, hydrogen and methane. This gas is cleaned chemically to remove pollutants before firing in a gas turbine to generate electricity. The hot exhaust then produces steam to power another turbine. FBC plants are particularly well suited for burning coal of low or variable quality and for cogeneration. Their net efficiency is around 41 per cent - a distinct improvement on the 38 per cent achieved by the best conventional coal-fired power stations with desulphurisation 'scrubbers' but nowhere near the 52 per cent of a new natural gas combined cycle plant. IGCC plants offer better performance than FBC when good-quality coal is available, though the technology is less well developed. Their net efficiency is about 43 per cent and emissions of sulphur and nitrogen oxides are comparable with a natural gas plant. The next important development will be the opening, scheduled for 1993, of a 285MW IGCC demonstration plant in the Netherlands designed by Shell. Further improvements may be possible through combining the best features of IGCC and FBC. One hybrid is British Coal's proposed topping cycle technology. Stephen Dawes of the Coal Research Establishment predicts that a commercial topping cycle plant would achieve 47 per cent efficiency using current gas turbines and as high as 52 per cent if turbine technology continues to advance as expected. British Coal has formed a consortium with PowerGen, the electricity generator, and GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French generating equipment manufacturer, to develop the topping cycle. Chris Buck of GEC Alsthom says the group is 'enthusiastic' about building a 75MW plant to demonstrate the technology, which would have great export potential. But it cannot go ahead until uncertainties about government support for the project and about the future of British Coal are resolved. Dawes accepts that no clean coal plant built in the UK today can generate electricity as cheaply as a new natural gas plant, because the latter is technically so much simpler that its capital costs and non-fuel operating expenses are inevitably lower. Early in the next century, however, lower fuel costs for coal could tip the balance against gas. One environmental factor on which coal cannot match natural gas is its impact on the greenhouse effect. It is chemically inevitable that burning coal produces more CO than natural gas. Even here, however, there is hope in the very long term. The idea of large-scale removal of CO from power station flue gases was regarded until a couple of years ago as too fantastic to contemplate because of the high costs and the quantities of CO produced by fossil fuel burning. Recent studies under the International Energy Agency's Greenhouse Gas R&amp;D Programme suggest, however, that CO capture and disposal at sea may be technically feasible, environmentally acceptable and economically bearable. Clean coal technology will not save British Coal from contracting further during the 1990s but it could lay the ground for a renaissance some time in the next century.</p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Construction equipment due for a dig-out - Japan's local suppliers look to recovery but imports remain uncertain HARD times at home could soon be over for Japan's construction equipment producers, but foreign suppliers seeking success in one of the world's most difficult markets may still find themselves up against a brick wall. The phenomenal post-war growth of the Japanese construction equipment industry has given rise to some of the sector's most powerful companies worldwide - Komatsu, for example, is second only to Caterpillar of the US. In the process, Japan has fostered a more concentrated domestic market than that of North America or Europe. With fewer suppliers in each product area, producers have had a field day at home, and foreign companies have found it hard to break in. These are some of the findings of a new study of the Japanese market by the London-based Corporate Intelligence Group, working with its Tokyo representative Rayden Research. The 326-page report* claims to be the first to reveal the market and producers in such detail. 'It has always been assumed in the past to be a closed world which could not be revealed,' it says. It comes at a turning point in the fortunes of the Japanese market and its players. The bursting of the 'bubble economy' and the end of the construction boom depressed sales of construction equipment from 169,215 units in 1990 to 128,064 last year, says the study. It sees a further slight decline this year before sales pick up steadily in 1994 and 1995, then reach nearly 150,000 units a year in 1996 and 1997. The need to improve infrastructure is likely to result in a big programme of civil engineering, with beneficial effects for the equipment suppliers from 1995 onwards, according to the report. Whether foreign suppliers can benefit from the forecast recovery of the Japanese market is debatable, however. Overall, imports currently account for only about 2-3 per cent of the market, says Mr Chris Barrow-Williams, author of the study. '(Foreign companies) could make more profits out of selling in Japan, and could price the products competitively,' he says. 'But they have to replicate the established infrastructure to make the products attractive.' There are more than 790,000 units of construction equipment in Japan - an enormous figure, says the study, which reflects a need to use machinery as a substitute for labour at every turn. This requires large service networks. One strategy for importers is to offer a product that the Japanese do not make. This can be hard - Mr Barrow-Williams says some imported products are totally different to Japanese machines, and are difficult for local customers to accept. The study chronicles some of the successes and failures of foreign equipment suppliers. Caterpillar is by far the biggest and benefits hugely from selling its products through Shin Caterpillar Mitsubishi, jointly owned with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. SCM sells both Caterpillar and Mitsubishi products through a unified distribution network with 200 sales points nationwide. Through SCM, Caterpillar is market leader in articulated dumptrucks, which are not made in Japan but became popular in the construction boom partly for their usefulness in golf course construction. Sales surged from 26 units in 1988 to 165 in 1990, but dropped back to 100 last year. Its main competitor is Brussels-based VME, whose Volvo BM machines are sold by a unit of Marubeni, the big Japanese trading house. The third player, Komatsu, sources its articulated dumptrucks from Norway, so all three rival ranges are marketed through strong organisations. According to the study, this illustrates that 'if imported machines and ideas are to make their way in Japan they definitely need high-powered back-up'. No amount of back-up, however, seems likely to retrieve things for importers of backhoe loaders, one of the leading products in the European market. In the 1960s Japan used to import 600-700 units a year, but since then sales have plummeted in favour of Japanese-built mini-excavators - much more suitable for roadworks in Japan's narrow streets. According to the study, just 18 backhoe loaders were sold in Japan last year - 15 by Hitachi which imports machines from John Deere in the US, and three by JCB. Perhaps the most intriguing thing for importers is the market for 'all-terrain cranes'. Developed in Europe to enable fast travel between sites and better handling on-site, these are an alien concept in the Japanese market, although Kato, Tadano and Sumitomo make them mainly for export. The biggest European supplier, Liebherr, has its own small sales operation in Japan. 'It has a product which is different, which will bring out the classic reactions - curiosity and then worry about not supporting Japanese companies, not having enough service back-up and so on,' comments the study. The German company will face a big challenge if Tadano broadens its range of all-terrain cranes and enters the local market, it says. On the other hand, by endorsing the concept, Tadano could make Liebherr's job easier. *Corporate Intelligence Group, 51 Doughty Street, London WC1N 2LS. Tel (71) 696 9006.</p>

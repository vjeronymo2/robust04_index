			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Lucas For Lucas to lose one potential chief executive may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose two looks like carelessness. There may well be good reasons why the Lucas board decided not to appoint David Hankinson chief executive and why it subsequently changed its mind about appointing Tony Edwards; both may equally have good reasons for leaving the company. But given that Lucas has troubles enough already - paying an uncovered dividend and operating in very difficult markets - news of boardroom problems is the last thing it needs. The generous gloss on events might be that the directors, having made a mistake, had the courage to admit it. Less generously, it is difficult to have confidence in the judgment of a board which cannot even decide correctly on its own composition. Lucas has been criticised for reacting to the recession too late. The company's best response to the latest trauma must be to implement its restructuring plans quickly. It would also help if its optimistic view of future earnings proved well founded.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Merck chief resignation leaves top job open Mr Martin Wygod has resigned from Merck, the US's biggest drugs group, just four months after being given responsibility for running two-thirds of the group's operations. His departure, apparently after he failed to secure the support of the company's board to succeed Mr Roy Vagelos as chairman, threw further doubts on the senior management of the group. Mr Wygod had appeared set for the top job after selling his Medco Containment Services, a drug distributor, to Merck for Dollars 6bn last year. In January, the company named him as head of its North American prescription drug businesses, as well as the Medco operations. A month ago, however, Merck disclosed that Mr Wygod would not become chairman when Mr Vagelos retires at the beginning of November. The departure of Mr Wygod was seen on Wall Street as the result of a clash of styles in the pharmaceuticals giant. A successful entrepreneur who had built Medco from scratch into one of a small handful of big pharmacy benefit managers, Mr Wygod did not fit the normal style of Merck, whose top executives have generally been appointed from within. Mr Wygod is leaving to head Synetic, a manufacturer of plastics for healthcare products. He will also take a 49 per cent interest in the company, which is being sold by Merck for Dollars 45m. As the race to succeed Mr Vagelos was throw wider open yesterday, Mr Lawrence Bossidy, chief executive of Allied Signal and a Merck non-executive director, was forced to issue a statement that he planned to remain at the defence contractor. Earlier, speculation that he was about to be named Mr Vagelos' successor had sent Merck's shares sharply higher. Merck said it was continuing the search for a new chairman both inside and outside the company, and that it was well advanced in its deliberations.</p>

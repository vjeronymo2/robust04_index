			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 15 (YONHAP) -- Prime Minister Yi  Yong-tok said on Wednesday he is positive North Korea will not  dare to provoke a war against the South.    "Preparedness and morale on the part of our Armed Forces are  higher than any other time in the past, who have the ability to  crush any North Korean provocation," Yi said.    In an interview with the three major televisions in Seoul,  the premier said that at the moment there is no sign of  provocation or any unusual military movement in North Korea.  The prime minister said the fire power of the South Korean and  U.S. Forces are enormous and the two countries maintain a close  cooperative system.    "Today's civil defense drill was to check our security  preparedness but the drill was not due to any growing danger of  war," he said. The premier observed that North Korea seems  trying to apply some shock therapies like the withdrawal from  the International Atomic Energy Agency. "But, the strategy does  not go the way they wish," he added.</p>

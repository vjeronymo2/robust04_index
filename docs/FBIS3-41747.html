			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lidya Ivchenko of RIzvestiyaS, under the title: </F> RHow to Filter Out Our Unpalatable StuffS]    [Text] The article RA Dangerous Russian Product -Water  (Izvestiya, No. 136, 1993) has generated a real explosion of all  sorts of information concerning water, its capacities, treatment  technologies, and water purification devices.    It turns out that, in addition to household installations,  collective purification installations are being set up for  hospitals, cafes, or organizations wishing to provide their  staff with good water. The Polimersintez Scientific Production  Association [NPO], in particular, is manufacturing such devices.  The developers have given one of their products as a gift to  Vladimir Lying-in Hospital No. 2. By the way, the Rucheek-1S and  the Rucheek-2S household water purifiers, which we had mentioned  in a previous publication, already have certificates of  compliance, so that now only the price can be a cause for  reflection for a purchaser.  `` Most of the inhabitants of our planet are aware of the  necessity of purifying water'', says Corresponding Member of the  Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Yu. Rakhmanin, Chief of the  Laboratory of Drinking Water Supply of the Sysyn Scientific  Research Institute of Ecology and Environmental Hygiene.    Yuriy Antonevich, chief of the water country, as his  instrument developers jokingly call him, as he is the chief  expert of the WHO on water supply questions, knows everything  there is to know about water purifiers, all the more so since  domestic water purifiers undergo testing in his laboratory. He  divides these devices into two generations.    Devices based on the principle of filtration or absorption  purification belong to the first. These instruments have one  essential deficiency: they only partially reduce the bacterial  and chemical contamination of the water. The best-known  representative of filters of this type is the Rodnichok. They  also include the TRosaU of both modifications, the TMechtaU, and  the TKolokolchikU.    A whole collection of water purifying devices has been  gathered in Professor Rakhmanin's laboratory, from individual  devices, in the form of a small tube, through which one can  drink water from any source on a hike, to stationary devices,  installed in kindergartens, hospitals, and cafes. The individual  filters have proven to be better than foreign ones in  effectiveness, although more poorly designed: the service life  is three times longer, and in addition they kill viruses. The  individual filter, RodnikS, of the All-Union Scientific Research  Institute of Medical Polymers [VNIIMEDPOLIMER] was in its time  even awarded a prize of the Council of Ministers of the former  Soviet Union. All of these are water purifiers of the second  generation, in which complete decontamination of the water of  both viruses and bacteria and agents of the parasitic diseases  is ensured through iodine-containing reagents.    But there are no analogs of this device in the world, says  the professor, pointing to a light plastic cylinder with an  intake tube attached to the valve, and an output tube delivering  prepared water.    The device is called the Izumrud. And it purifies water on  the basis of an entirely different principle, through  electrolysis. In it water passes through three stages of  purification. First it is subjected to anodic oxidation;  micro-organisms and organic and other contaminants are  decomposed in the process. Then compounds of active chloride are  destroyed, and finally neutralization of heavy metal ions takes  place in the anodic chamber; these become nontoxic, harmless for  man. Electrochemical activation does not simply purify water, it  makes it, in the words of the development engineers of the  Russian-American Emerald company, active; this is living water,  close in quality to spring water or to the melt water of  glaciers. And such water is especially useful.</p>

The Bakkers' ministry, which has  been conducting Sunday church services and occasional television gospel shows  out of the makeshift church-studio for about four months, owed at least $73,000  in rent, said Shoppers World mall owner Stewart Gilman, who ordered the  financially strapped ministry to leave almost two weeks ago.  </P></p>

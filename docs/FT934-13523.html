			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Observer: Sage advice The CBI's Andrew Sentance will now definitely be off by the end of the year to join fellow UK Treasury economic adviser David Currie at the London Business School. So the Treasury is hoping that Sentance will do the decent thing and stand down from its panel of wise men - two people from the same stable would make things a trifle unbalanced. If Alan Budd, the Treasury's chief economic adviser, is stuck for inspiration in his search for a replacement, he might care to consider the distaff side of the profession. With economists from the consultancy world unrepresented on the panel, Penelope Rowlatt of National Economic Research Associates and Bridget Rosewell of Business Strategies should be on any shortlist, as should Marion Bell of the Royal Bank of Scotland. The latter, who spent two years recently on secondment to Great George Street, even has some insight into how the whole shop works. Ruth Lea of Mitsubishi Bank could be another candidate - though she might, unjustly, be ruled out for being too argumentative. Selecting a woman would certainly mesh with the Treasury's campaign to stop the panel being referred to as the seven wise men.</p>

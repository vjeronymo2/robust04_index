			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> POLAND;  </P> <P> BILL TO CONFISCATE PARTY PROPERTY DIES  </P> <P> The Polish Parliament rejected a bill to confiscate property worth tens of  millions of dollars from the Communist Party after the Solidarity-led  government refused to back the measure.  </P> <P> The Sejm (lower house) voted 246-20 with 45 abstentions to drop the bill. The  Sejm did approve setting up a government commission to investigate the wealth  of the Communist Party and its former allies and said it should find ways to  ensure the return of property taken illegally from the state and other owners.  The Communists, who plan to disband and form a new, non-Marxist party, have  said the party has property worth $73 million.  </P></p>

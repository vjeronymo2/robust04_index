			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Chilean Air Force [FACh] Commander General Ramon  Vega has confirmed that the replacement of the old Hawker  Hunters with newer combat planes has become a real "necessity"  for the FACh. In an interview with EL MERCURIO, Vega said he is  not concerned by the recent purchase of 36 combat planes by  Argentina because "they should modernize their air materiel just  as I have the duty to keep the Chilean Air Force completely  operational."    Last week, following long negotiations, the U.S. Government  authorized the sale of the A-4M Skyhawk bombers to Argentina.  They will be equipped with more modern radar systems than those  originally installed.    Vega said: "On the orders of their respective authorities,  they are replenishing their inventory."    According to British sources during the Falklands war  (1982),  Argentina lost 103 airplanes, among them 26 Mirages, 31  Skyhawks, 23 Pucaras, and 18 helicopters.    Vega said the FACh is concerned about current technological  demands. It believes the expeditious replacement of the old  Hawker Hunter fleet, which is still in use, is a necessity.    He said: "This in no way means an arms race. It is the  result of real operational need."    Vega added: "Moreover, we have very good ties with air  forces  of other Latin American countries, as shown by the participation  of Argentine, Peruvian, and Brazilian planes in the upcoming  Fidae [International Aerospace Fair] 94, which is a good sign of  the understanding and rapprochement, and of the projects we  share, with bordering countries."    Vega said vast new ties have been established, which can be  expanded even further through the implementation of projects in  areas of common interest.    He said: "It is good for us to talk with our peers because  the main challenge that faces us is the acquisition of  scientific and space knowledge, which demands joint training."    Asked about the choice of planes to replace the 10 Hawker  Hunters which have been in operation since 1967, General Vega  said there are advanced studies on a definitive model.    Without disclosing any names, he said this change does not  mean the FACh budget will not be met or that new expenses will  be generated because previous studies took into consideration  these expenses and national defense costs.    Chile purchased 53 Hawker Hunter planes. Despite excellent  combat performance they are not equipped to carry missiles or  modern bombs.    Their basic characteristics (speed, height and flight  autonomy) are comparable to the A-4 which Argentina has in its  inventory since 1970, but they lack the electronics and radar  systems of the Argentine Skyhawks.    Vega said: "The FACh cannot lose the two groups of Hawker  Hunter jets that are out of service. We know that -- for  reasons of the budget -- it is almost impossible to replace this  number of planes, but we are negotiating to recover at least one  of these squadrons."    The FACh commander said there are several interesting  choices  on the international market and the issue has already been  discussed with the defense minister "with positive results."    Asked about the possibility of purchasing Russian-made  planes, which are currently very cheap, Vega implied that the  idea is very remote. He said such a purchase would cause a  drastic technological change and, consequently, high expenses in  personnel training and the purchase of new equipment.    He added that the FACh has always opted for the most  economic  solutions for the country, prioritizing -- for example --  modernization programs over purchasing new material.    Vega stated: "It is a good solution because, like computer  systems, airplane systems evolve very fast but the shell does  not. In this way we modernized the entire electronic equipment  of the Mirage 50 and the F-5E planes, thus increasing their  operational life for several years."    One solution apparently being studied for the replacement of  the Hawker Hunters is to buy more F-5E planes, which can be  refurbished at a low cost.    Regarding his trip to the United States, which is scheduled  for 20 to 26 February, Gen. Vega said he will visit the U.S. Air  Force Aerospace Command.    He said: "We want to expand our knowledge in this field and  to promote some kind of support so as to start our own programs."    Vega said the future of all nations lies in space and that  it  is necessary to promptly undertake studies in this area.    He said: "We must acquire this technology immediately  because  this is where the future lies." He did not deny the possibility  of contacting Russian experts.    Vega added: "We are not planning to train an astronaut or a  cosmonaut. This would be a very big step and we must first  overcome many stages. The first is to establish a training  program for our people in new terminology and systems. We want  an experimental program to enable us to become better acquainted  with this new technology, and we want to establish a specialized  FACh department."    Vega said that a "political decision" is needed prior to the  implementation of this long-term project.    He said: "With this support, we can fulfill the dream of  building an experimental satellite within 10 years."</p>

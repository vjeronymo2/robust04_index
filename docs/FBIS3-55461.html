			<p>Language: <F P=105>Armenian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today, the Azerbaijani Army units again disrupted  the peace on Armenia's border. Armenian Defense Ministry press  service reported that there was intense enemy howitzer fire at  the defensive positions around Vahan in Krasnoselskiy Rayon at  about 1000. The Armenian side did not retaliate. There were no  casualties on our side. No other incidents have taken place  along the rest of the border since last night.    Fierce battles are continuing along almost the entire  Karabakh confrontation line. Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense  Army press service reported that though the Azerbaijanis have  made certain insignificant advances, the Karabakh troops are  managing to halt enemy attacks in some sectors of the front.  The enemy is trying at all costs to break through the Armenian  defensive lines at some point, and is therefore launching  attacks and sustaining heavy losses. Nearly 3,000 Azerbaijani  troops and officers have been killed during the incessant  battles since 18 December. More than 70 fighters were killed on  the Karabakh side during that same period.    The Azerbaijanis launched attacks in the eastern and  southern  sectors of the front this morning, but Armenian forces are  repulsing them.</p>

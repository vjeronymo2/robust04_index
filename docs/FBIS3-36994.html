Yavlinskiy Did Not Sleep  an Entire Night"]    [Excerpts] Last night a telephone conversation between the  presidents of the United States and Russia finally took place.  Earlier, according to REUTER, Bill Clinton tried to reach Boris  Yeltsin to discuss NATO's decision on an ultimatum to the  Bosnian Serbs, but to no avail. [passage omitted]    Anatoliy Krasikov, chief of the Russian president's press  service, said to your SEGODNYA correspondent that all  communications services were in 100 percent working condition,  and that Boris Yeltsin was waiting for the call at the agreed  time. So, interference, if any, must have been outside Russia.    Viktor Ilyushin, first aide of the Russian president,  expressed his view to INTERFAX's correspondent: "This is the  first such incident in our practice. What remains is to express  regret that the two sides did not manage to organize the  dialogue."    Mr. Ilyushin noted, however, that in order for a telephone  conversation to take place both interlocutors should be on the  phone. For instance, on Thursday, President Yeltsin was ready  to talk for an hour and a half. He had been waiting for a  conversation with the White House "for as long as the rules of  propriety allow," the presidential aide said.    The reaction from politicians, particularly democratic  leaders close to the president, was fairly balanced: "Boris  Yeltsin has disappeared from the horizon -- so what? This is  not the first time." Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, however, complained  to your SEGODNYA correspondent that he did not sleep on the  night of Thursday and Friday, because his Western acquaintances  besieged him with the question of where the Russian president  had gone.</p>

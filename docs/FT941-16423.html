			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / (CORRECTED) Toy industry reports 15% market growth Correction (published 11th January 1994) appended to this article. The UK toy market grew last year by at least 15 per cent to Pounds 1.87bn, say industry estimates released yesterday at the Harrogate International Toy Fair. Video games are now put at 40 per cent of the total, with sales growth more than trebled in two years and contributing the main driving force in the total toy market's 78 per cent expansion since 1991. However, industry leaders now believe sales of video games are slowing as the market for the hardware they are played on matures - and as parents turn against the solitary or two-players-only nature of the games. Video games sales for 1993 are nevertheless expected to top Pounds 750m, compared with less than Pounds 240m in 1991 but about Pounds 650m in 1992. 'Activity' toys, such as snooker or darts, are second in popularity, with likely sales of Pounds 244m last year, or 13 per cent of the market. Games and puzzles came third at Pounds 174m, or 9.3 per cent. 'Board games have come back very rapidly in 1993,' Mr Graham Scott, who organises the Harrogate fair, said yesterday. 'They lost out for a while, but video games cannot be played by whole families. Board games can, and appear to have done well this Christmas.' Dolls and their accessories continue to hold a strong fourth place with a near-50 per cent rise in sales over two years. A rapidly developing segment, however, is 'plush', a cheap synthetic fur which is enabling the market for teddy bears and other cuddly toys to expand rapidly. Plush product sales are growing thanks to cheap labour in China, where high-quality, mass-produced plush from Taiwan or South Korea is being turned into teddies by the million. Retail prices of plush bears range from Pounds 1.99 to Pounds 60. 'It means you can now have ranges of bears, with limited editions and a wide choice of options on size to make them more collectible,' said Mr Les Vargerson, managing director of Agenta Marketing of Market Harborough, in Leicestershire. He is the UK agent for Althans, which although based near Coburg, Germany, has more than 500 people employed in Hong Kong and China. It is now one of Europe's leading specialists in Asian-made Pluschtierfabrik bears. The Harrogate fair, which ends on Wednesday, kicks off 1994's worldwide toy-industry round of trade shows. It usually attracts about 8,000 potential buyers, importers and exporters from throughout the world. Mr Con Conrad of Benjamin Toys, who is chairman of this year's Harrogate fair, believed Mr Blobby, the UK's 1993 Christmas craze, had peaked because the uncuddly latex figure could drive few spin-offs. The ranks of Harrogate's dolls, teddy bears, Tom and Jerry lookalikes - as well as the scores of company representatives trying to sell educational toys to retail chain buyers - looked as though they hoped so. CORRECTION Sales figures for toys quoted in thousands of pounds in one edition of yesterday's Financial Times should have been expressed in millions of pounds. The figures quoted in the accompanying graph as unit sales were sales by value expressed in billions of pounds.</p>

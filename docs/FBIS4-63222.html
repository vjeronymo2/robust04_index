			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: By correspondents </F> Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] Russia and the People's Democratic Republic of Korea  are interested in overcoming the current lull in bilateral  relations and broadening contacts in the political, economic and  other spheres, which is clear from the visit of North Korean  diplomats led by the deputy foreign minister, Director of the  Russian Foreign Ministry's Information and Press Department  Grigoriy Karasin said during a briefing on Thursday.    He announced that the North Korean delegation had held talks  with deputy foreign ministers Igor Ivanov, Aleksandr Panov and  Georgiy Mamedov.    To quote Karasin, the talks dealt with the establishment of  inter-parliamentary contacts, with the resumption of the work of  the inter-governmental consultative commission for economic,  scientific and technical problems, with the creation of joint  ventures, with broadening direct contacts between Siberian and  Far Eastern regions, and with the drafting of a new agreement on  joint lumbering in the Khabarovsk Territory and Amursk Region.    Karasin stated that nuclear problems had been discussed in  great detail. "Russia favors tougher observance of the  nonproliferation regime in Korea in accordance with the  nonproliferation treaty and with the agreement on guarantees  between North Korea and the IAEA," he said. Moscow also  welcomes North Korea's latest steps to facilitate the IAEA  inspection of the north Korean nuclear facilities which began  last March.    The possibility of replacing the armistice agreement with a  peace agreement which North Korea would like to sign with the  U.S. was also discussed. "Russia believes that at the current  stage, armistice is the only way of safeguarding peace in Korea.  It can be replaced, though, on the basis of mutual agreement of  all the parties concerned," he said.    He said that the North Korean delegation had expressed a  positive attitude to the Russian proposal on convening an  international conference on the settlement of the situation in  the Korean peninsula. "Both parties are convinced that the  problems facing the Korean Peninsula must be settled peacefully,  through talks, without pressure and with due account taken of  the interests of all states," said Karasin.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Professor Michal Kulesza, former government </F> official, by correspondent Tomasz Zajac; place and date not  given]    [Text] We keep hearing comments about the growing role of  local self-government in the political life of the country.  However, is it not that we entertain happy illusions about it,  while the central authorities are determined not to give away  their power to the so-called lower reaches--that is, local  self-government bodies?    [Kulesza] It is precisely as you suggest. The central  authorities are very attached to their positions, and this is  not a phenomenon that suddenly developed after 19 September  [1993--parliamentary election]. The conservative nature of  political structures is a general feature in world politics.  Centralism is a common disease of politicians, although, in the  West, for example, a decentralization campaign was launched as a  conscious and deliberate decision many years ago.    [Zajac] Do you not believe that the handing down of power is  impeded by the fear and traditionalist mentality of the  politicians at the top, whereas, if we consider it objectively,  they would actually be able to get rid of the responsibility for  many problems?    [Kulesza] Handing over a certain proportion of their  responsibilities would be more advantageous to them in objective  terms, but it would not be as simple as all that. When you try  to jump onto a moving streetcar, there is a moment at which you  are no longer running but are not yet riding the streetcar. This  situation is something we can quite realistically fear. All of  the noncommunist governments we had since 19 September were  doing something--well or less well, wisely or not very--to  promote the cause of a reform of the central administration  system, which aimed, among other things, at a decentralization  of power. We even arrived at a stage, during the Suchocka  government, where everything was already prepared for a reform,  and the only thing needed was to simply launch it. It so  happened that I was at that time responsible for the  administrative reform, and I remember clearly that there was  also a very obvious public need and desire for such a change.  The following may be an extreme example, but people really did  offer church services for the success of the new districts  scheme. So what happened instead? We now have the very first  government that commands an unquestionable majority in  parliament but has absolutely no political willpower to reform  the administration system. The conditions and opportunities are  there, but there is no will to carry out the reform.    [Zajac] The price of the reform is another subject of public  debate. Critics claim that the new districts will simply be too  expensive.    [Kulesza] I disagree. The cost of the administrative reform  will come to approximately half a trillion zlotys [Z]. An  election costs as much, to reach for a topical example. The  costs of relinquishing the plans for the reform will be much  higher.    [Zajac] How would you answer the argument that, in fact, a  reform that reinforces self-government structures and hands over  power to "lower," local structures is needed by politically  bankrupt politicians rather than by our society?    [Kulesza] Such an objection is simply stupid. I will answer  it with a simple example: If you are buying a car of a  particular make, you are not interested in its finer  construction details because that is a job for the engineering  designer. Similarly, the design and implementation of local  self-government reforms are jobs for politicians. You simply  want to drive your new car in comfort, while society wants to  see efficient and effective administration, competent police,  and good hospitals and schools--that is, everything that can be  designed and executed by the "political engineers."    [Zajac] Does this mean that politicians know better what  the public wants?    [Kulesza] Politicians must know better because that is what  they are elected for. They are responsible for setting up all  of the mechanisms in the state so that these work well and are  of benefit to the public.    [Zajac] How should this local self-government "automobile"  look?    [Kulesza] Local communities should assume control of  everything that is required to meet the collective needs of the  local population--for example, education (primary as well as  secondary), health care and social services, the police, the  fire-fighting forces, culture and the arts, and so on. At the  same time, we must remember that we cannot hand over power and  responsibility without money.    [Zajac] Let us move from theory to practical considerations.  Our own backyard in the tri-city [Gdansk, Gdynia, Sopot]  conurbation surely provides an interesting example of local  self-government run actively by the local community, with all of  the advantages and drawbacks that this entails.    [Kulesza] The tri-city is in a rather fortunate situation.  The conurbation, whose size equals other major cities in Poland,  is divided into three sectors, each with its own self-government  bodies. This is all working well, even as the decentralization  reform in Warsaw, which is devised along the same lines, is  encountering very considerable resistance.    [Zajac] To conclude, let us attempt a recapitulation of the  situation. Although, admittedly, the administrative reform and  the associated "handing down" of power to local structures has  been halted, the last word in the reform process has not been  said yet. Are you an optimist or a pessimist when it comes to  assessing the future of that process?    [Kulesza] That depends on how the three parties  involved--that is, the Democratic Left Alliance, the Polish  Peasant Party, and the Union of Freedom--act now. However, it  is difficult to ward off pessimistic reflections about the  future of the reform.    [Zajac] Thank you for talking with us.</p>

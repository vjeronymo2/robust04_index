			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners also suggest that bank transaction charges discovered during ZLIP's verification require the Department to draw adverse inferences. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondents contend that the omissions are minor and insignificant, and are consistent in nature with minor errors found in virtually every verification conducted by the Department. Therefore, respondents conclude that there is no reasonable basis to warrant the use of ``adverse inferences'' in the final determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> DOC Position <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners are correct that unreported information discovered at verification must be evaluated in terms of the relative seriousness of the omission itself and to what extent its discovery calls into question the integrity of the entire response. However, we agree with respondents. The omissions are minor and do not significantly erode our confidence in the integrity of ZLIP's or ZMEC's response. Accordingly, the verified information related to these omissions has been used for the final determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 9: Use of Semi-Skilled Labor Rates for PRC Production of Subject Merchandise <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners assert that the Department should use the Indian value for semi-skilled labor, rather than that of unskilled labor, in determining the value of labor used to produce paper clips in the PRC. Furthermore, according to petitioners, respondents have failed to support their claim that all labor used in the process was unskilled is not supported by any evidence on the record. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondents counter that verification of all three respondent manufacturers revealed no discrepancies regarding labor in the forming or electroplating workshops. Therefore, respondents conclude that the record does not support petitioners' assertion that the Department should use semi-skilled labor rates in the final determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> DOC Position <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with respondents. Verification revealed no reason to infer that respondents' used semi-skilled labor in the production of paper clips. Further, even if we were to determine the use of semi-skilled labor rates to be appropriate, petitioners provided no basis for calculating a value for semi-skilled labor in the petition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 10: Use of Verified Packing Data <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Respondents request that the Department use the packing amounts verified at the manufacturers when calculating the manufacturers' packing material expenses in the final determination. While packing material and packing labor were verified at Jiaxing and Wuyi, only packing labor was verified at Fengbin. Respondents request that the Department use an average of packing materials data (from the other two manufacturers), rather than punitive data, for the final determination with respect to Fengbin's packing materials. Respondents assert that the Department should grant this request since Fengbin provided complete responses to the Department's questionnaires which were substantially verified. Furthermore, according to respondents, the use of an average of the verified packing material amounts would more accurately reflect the experiences of the PRC manufacturers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners request that the Department base its calculation of packing expenses on surrogate value information or on information set forth in the petition. In addition, since Fengbin failed to provide verified packing material data during this investigation, petitioners request that the Department use as BIA the information contained in the petition for Fengbin's packing materials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> DOC Position <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For Jiaxing and Wuyi, we have used the verified packing material data. It is the Department's practice to use partial BIA to correct minor data deficiencies. Fengbin's omission from its response of packing material data constitutes such a deficiency. Therefore, we continue to use the petition's packing material value as BIA for Fengbin's packing expenses in the final margin calculations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN PEAK SUPPLY CURRENTLY;  </P> <P> NOW'S THE TIME TO ENJOY AVOCADOS  </P> <P> Although avocados are available year round, the peak supply is found during  spring and summer.  </P> <P> California avocados make up nearly 90% of the nation's avocado production, a  spokesman for the California Avocado Commission, a nonprofit organization,  explained recently.  </P> <P> Over 80% of the California avocado crop is made up of the Hass variety, which  has a thick, pebbly skin and a rich, nutty taste. The Hass variety is available  from January through October, with peak supply from May through August.  </P> <P> The other 20% of the California crop consists of the Greenskin varieties, which  have thin, smooth green skin. Greenskin varieties generally are available from  November through May.  </P> <P> Avocados have 17 vitamins and minerals, more potassium ounce-for-ounce than 26  fruits and juices and 19 vegetables -- and no cholesterol. Half an avocado  contains 9.7 grams of mono-unsaturated fats.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Select Carefully  </P> <P> When buying avocados, select fruit that is free of bruises or gouges. A ripe  avocado yields to pressure when it is gently squeezed. The Hass avocado also  shows its ripeness by changing color from green to purple-black.  </P> <P> Firm avocados will ripen in a fruit bowl at room temperature. You can speed the  ripening process by storing them for a few days in a paper bag at room  temperature.  </P> <P> Many grocery stores now stock ripe avocados. Look for fruit that is marked with  stickers that identify them as ripe. They should be refrigerated until they are  eaten, but not for longer than 5 days.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Easy Preparation  </P> <P> To prepare an avocado, follow these steps:  </P> <P>  -- Cut the avocado in half, lengthwise around the seed.  </P> <P>  -- Rotate the two halves to separate.  </P> <P>  -- To remove the seed, either slide the tip of a spoon gently underneath and  lift it out, or place the avocado half on a cutting board; carefully and gently  strike the seed with a medium-size knife. Rotate the knife and lift the seed  out.  </P> <P>  -- To peel the avocado half, place the cut side down on a cutting board and  remove the skin with your fingers or a knife.  </P> <P>  -- To prevent discoloration, sprinkle all cut surfaces with lemon or lime  juice.  </P></p>

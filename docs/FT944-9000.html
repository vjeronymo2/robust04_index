			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Book Review: A tax that was pole-axed FAILURE IN BRITISH GOVERNMENT: THE POLITICS OF THE POLL TAX By David Butler, Andrew Adonis and Tony Travers Oxford University Press, Pounds 25 hbk, Pounds 7.99 pbk, 352 pages This book, which chronicles the birth, life and death of the UK's poll tax, is important, interesting and thorough. The authors have interviewed most of the main people involved - including myself - and conclude that the policy reveals shortcomings in the workings of the British government that ultimately led to the toppling of Mrs Thatcher. The book addresses three basic questions. First, why was it necessary to devise a new form of local government tax? Second, why was the poll tax selected? And third, why did it go so badly wrong? The pledge to abolish domestic rates was made in the summer of 1974 by Edward Heath, the then Conservative leader. But nothing was done about it. A review of the rating system in 1979 when Margaret Thatcher became prime minister led only to a reduction in the government grant to local authorities. By 1984 the position had become intolerable. It was difficult for the government to get orders on grants to local authorities through the Commons since the Treasury controls, of byzantine complexity, bore heavily on Conservative councils. At the same time, certain Labour inner-city councils were flouting the system by spending at record levels. The review that led to the poll tax was put in hand, conducted by William Waldegrave and me as environment ministers. The central question was how much freedom a local authority should have. We were looking for a robust and substantial tax base for local authorities that would allow them to raise and spend their own money, and to answer for it to their electorates. The solution we came up with was a charge for local services, the community charge - soon dubbed the 'poll tax'. It was based upon the principle that a wider tax base was necessary because out of the 35m taxpayers only about 14m paid rates; since many of these received rate rebates, only about 8m paid rates in full. The idea of a community charge was first mooted at Chequers, the prime minister's country residence, in March 1985. It was envisaged that the charge would be between Pounds 50 and Pounds 100 a head. If the people who attended that crucial meeting had realised the poll tax would be levied at nearly Pounds 300 a head in its first year, I am sure the proposal would have been dropped. The book is wrong, incidentally, to say those involved wanted 'to please Margaret'. She had no clear views on what should replace rates, and her enthusiasm for the poll tax flowered late. Three things could have made the poll tax more bearable. First, a lower level in the initial years, which would have meant introducing it in tandem with rates. Such 'dual running' was abandoned after a debate at the Conservative party conference in 1987. One should never allow the Tory party conference to make policy - that is not its function. Second, the exclusion from the tax of everybody below the age of 21 would have taken the sting out of student protests. Unfortunately the purist interpretation - that everyone over 18 had to pay - won the day. And third, the central government grant to local authorities for 1990, the first year of the poll tax, was utterly inadequate, and put further upward pressure on its level. The Treasury was not helpful: Nigel Lawson, then chancellor, opposed the poll tax but was not prepared to block it. He was already at loggerheads with the prime minister over the entry of sterling into the European exchange rate mechanism and could not take on another issue. That left Chris Patten, environment secretary in 1990, and me as Conservative party chairman with the enormous problem of having to justify a high and unpopular tax. Did ministers fail? The poll tax was chosen after careful examination and full discussion, which this book acknowledges. One of the reasons it went so badly off the rails was that ministers collectively were not looking at the political consequences. Cabinet committees and the full cabinet examined the poll tax but in a fragmentary way. There was no real political discussion. Nor was parliament effective in scrutinising the impact of the tax. Attempts to modify the legislation were viewed as destructive of the whole concept and this made it even more difficult to get modest, but sensible, changes accepted. What, then, were the political consequences of this episode? I do not believe it was the critical factor in Margaret Thatcher's fall. The 1990 local government elections showed councils such as Wandsworth and Westminster could win majorities if the poll tax was low as a result of lower expenditure. It was a good stick to beat Margaret Thatcher with, but it did not match Sir Geoffrey Howe's resignation speech. Where do we go from here? The present system of funding local government based upon the council tax and tough central government controls is unlikely to survive. It does not give local authorities the freedom they should have and this will increase friction and hostility between local and central government in future. There is no easy answer by, for example, allocating a slice of income tax to local government and calling it local income tax. If money is raised centrally and simply allocated to local authorities, what is the purpose of those authorities? Lessons have certainly been learnt from the failure of the poll tax. But the issue at the heart remains what it was - the powers of a centralised state as opposed to the powers of a decentralised state. The issues raised by this episode are not simply fiscal, they are also constitutional. The reviewer is Conservative MP for Mole Valley.</p>

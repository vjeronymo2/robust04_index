			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Li Ruihuan at a meeting commemorating the 70th </F> founding anniversary of the Huangpu (Whampoa) Military Academy  and the 10th founding anniversary of the Huangpu Alumni  Association on 16 June 1994]    [Text] Beijing, 16 Jun (XINHUA) -- Friends and comrades:    Today alumni of the Huangpu Military Academy at home and  from  abroad happily gather here to commemorate the academy's 70th  founding anniversary and the Huangpu Alumni Association's 10th  founding anniversary. On behalf of the CPC Central Committee, I  extend warm congratulations and sincere greetings to all Huangpu  alumni who are present today and through you, to all the  academy's teachers and cadets at home and abroad.    Seven decades ago, Dr. Sun Yat-sen -- the great patriot and  pioneer of the democratic revolution in China -- summarized  bitter the experience of repeated setbacks in the pursuit of  national independence, freedom and democracy, and the people's  happiness; resolutely reshuffled the Kuomintang [KMT]; and, with  the support and assistance of the Comintern and the CPC, put  forward the three major policies on "alliance with Russia and  the Communists, and assistance to peasants and workers," thereby  effecting the first cooperation between the KMT and the CPC. In  order to set up a revolutionary army and use armed revolutionary  forces to fight against armed counterrevolutionary forces, Dr.  Sun Yat-sen, together with the Chinese Communists, represented  by Zhou Enlai, jointly founded the Huangpu Military Academy.  Imbued with the aspiration of serving the country, ardent young  people from various parts of the country congregated at  "revolutionary Huangpu," and one after another groups of  revolutionary soldiers grew to maturity at the academy, becoming  the backbone of the Northern Expedition. Noble-minded Huangpu  cadets from both KMT and CPC waged a bloodbath battle side by  side to "topple imperialist powers and eliminate warlords,"  thereby defeating the northern reactionary warlords. After the  Japanese imperialists launched an all-out war of aggression  against China, which put the Chinese nation at a critical  juncture between life or death, the KMT and the CPC -- under the  CPC-sponsored great banner of national united front against  Japan -- cooperated once again and fought against Japan, thereby  winning the great victory over foreign aggression. We shall  forever cherish the memory of those Huangpu martyrs who made  important contributions to repelling aggressors and safeguarding  national independence.    Seventy years have passed. The CPC and Comrade Mao Zedong  led the Chinese people in accomplishing the democratic  revolution, which Dr. Sun Yat-sen did not accomplish; and  developed it into a socialist revolution. Earthshaking changes  have taken place on the great earth of the motherland. The  Chinese nation now stands erect in the east of the world and  enjoys high esteem in the international community. Today China  sees vigorous development in all fields of endeavor, and enjoys  economic prosperity, political stability, national unity, and  social progress. Guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and led by the  CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, the  Chinese people are seizing the opportunity, deepening reform,  and opening up wider; and the magnificent ideal of building a  prosperous, democratic, civilized modern socialist power is  being gradually transformed into a reality through the great  efforts of the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation working  hard in a pioneering spirit.    Achieving the motherland's peaceful reunification accords  with the aspirations of the people and the demand of the nation;  and it is the sacred mission of the Chinese people of all  nationalities, including the compatriots in Taiwan. We shall  continue to promote the cause of peaceful reunification under  the concept of "one country, two systems." We have time and  again stated our view that endorsing reunification means loving  the country; and that differences existing between the two sides  of the strait can be gradually resolved through increasing  contacts and consultations under the principle of one China.  Our stand has been praised and endorsed by farsighted people  everywhere. We hope that the Taiwan authorities will weigh  national interests above anything else and take practical  measures to join us in accomplishing the great cause of  motherland reunification.    Dr. Sun Yat-sen once said: "In reunification lies the hope  of all countrymen who will enjoy happiness when reunification is  realized. Failure to accomplish reunification will bring us  suffering." The late Marshals Xu Xiangqign and Nie Rongzhen  said in January 1990: "As the motherland has yet to be  reunified, the alumni need to continue to exert themselves."  The Huangpu Alumni Association has done tremendous work in  promoting exchanges and contacts between the two sides of the  strait in the last 10 years since its founding. We hope that  you will redouble efforts to score even greater successes in the  work. May Huangpu alumni on both sides of the strait unite and  contribute more to the reunification of the motherland and the  rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.</p>

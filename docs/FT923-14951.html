			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: FED tax rule changes - Expatriates and that includes the Inland Revenue - seems to understand exactly how the foreign earnings deduction (FED) is supposed to work. The latest set of changes to the rule means yet more administrative hassle, but also offers the prospect of substantial refunds for some. Under the rule, enacted 18 years ago, employees who do their job wholly or partly abroad but are not absent long enough to achieve non-residence may be entitled to a deduction of 100 per cent for tax purposes from their foreign earnings. This is Revenue-speak for saying these earnings will be free of all UK tax. This could happen, for example, if your employer seconded you overseas from May 5 1990 to January 5 1992. This absence does not exceed a complete tax year, so you would remain UK resident and ordinarily resident throughout. To qualify for a FED, you must spend 365 days or more working full-time wholly outside the UK, during which you would have to ensure that your UK visits did not exceed either 62 consecutive days nor one sixth of the days in the period during which you are overseas. Greater limits apply to seafarers. The process is quite simple if you have spent an entire tax year (from April 6 one year to April 5 the next) out of the country, but gets very complicated when used to calculate tax liability for long stays out of the country which straddle two tax years. The FED applies to people, such as company directors or airline pilots, who become resident because they perform duties of substance (in other words, not just duties incidental to those which they perform overseas) in the UK, and have maintained a home there. The Inland Revenue intimated last November that it had been applying the rules incorrectly in certain respects. The changes, effective from April 6 this year, will have adverse results on the taxability of terminal leave pay received by those who had previously been UK non-residents. And earlier this month, the Revenue made clear that yet more changes are in hand. These relate to the level of overseas earnings to which the FED applies. Should it be the gross earnings or the net earnings after deducting items such as capital allowances, contributions to employers' superannuation schemes, travelling and other expenses? The answer, we are told, is that the law intended it to apply to the net figure and, indeed, the Inland Revenue has consistently applied it on this basis. Unfortunately, it now accepts that following an unintended change in the law in 1984, this treatment has been incorrect. If your pay is excluded from liability for a complete tax year, it makes no difference which basis is applied. So, if your salary is Pounds 60,000 a year and you pay employers' pension contributions of Pounds 9,000 a year, the result is the same whether you receive FED on Pounds 60,000 or relief for your pension contributions of Pounds 9,000 and FED on Pounds 51,000. But it matters a great deal for the broken tax years of departure and return. So, if the same figures apply to the May 1990-January 1992 absence mentioned earlier, the first 10 months of your salary for 1991-92 would be fully covered by the FED, leaving the full Pounds 9,000 annual pension contributions to be set off against the taxable Pounds 10,000 salary for the last two months. The position for 1990-91 would be similar. By contrast, if a net basis is applied, the calculation for the first 10 months will be: salary Pounds 50,000 minus pension contributions Pounds 7,500 = Pounds 42,500 minus Fed Pounds 42,500. No pension contributions could be carried forward from this period, so the two months salary which was taxable would attract relief only for the contributions in those months, that is, Pounds 10,000 minus Pounds 1,500 = Pounds 8,500. To correct the situation, a new clause has been tabled to the summer Finance Bill. This makes it quite clear that from April 6 1992, the net basis applies. You can only be certain of a right to re-open assessment for the years 1990-91 and 1991-92 although it may, in some circumstances, be possible to go back further. So if in the recent past you have benefited from the FED for part of a tax year, you would do well to get out your old papers to see if you are affected. If you are, you could be entitled to a substantial refund of the tax you have already paid. Donald Elkin is a director of Wilfred T. Fry Limited of Worthing, West Sussex.</p>

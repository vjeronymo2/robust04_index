			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Patten backs more sixth forms Mr John Patten, the education secretary, yesterday signalled a significant shift in funding for post-16 education in England and Wales by announcing plans to allow more schools to open sixth forms. Over the past few decades the trend has been to create separate sixth form colleges, and these now account for more than half of all full-time students in England between the ages of 16 and 18. He told the Girls' Schools Association, which represents independent schools, that more than 100 schools for pupils from the ages of 11 to 16 had applied to open sixth forms. He said there would always be students who prefered to continue sixth form studies in a school setting, with which they were familiar and which might be much closer to home. 'A school with a thriving sixth form, underpinned by specialist staffing, may be more able to offer attractive sub-specialisms to the younger pupils, for example in technology or modern languages.' A framework for deciding whether schools could open a sixth form would be published soon. Mr Patten received a hostile reception from headmistresses on the issue of league tables of school performance. He said their publication was 'one of the most important post-war innovations in levering up standards'. But Miss Joan Jefferson, the association's president, said the way the league tables were compiled was 'nonsense'. She said that if candidates took exams a year early and then moved school, the new school was credited with their results. Delegates also attacked Mr Patten's decision to introduce an A-starred grade at A-level. One headmistress told Mr Patten to loud and prolonged applause that the new grade would be 'totally counter-productive' and would deter girls from broadening the range of subjects they took at A-Level.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "President Clinton's Disclosures </F> on Bosnia"]    [Text] In an address at the graduation ceremony held at the  U.S. Naval Academy on 25 May, President Bill Clinton said that  he was opposed to lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia's Islamic  people. Describing any move to lift the arms embargo as a blow  to peace, Clinton stressed that the United States has to work in  harmony with its allies to end the war in that country.    According to political observers, President Clinton's views  have brought to light the conflicting approaches of U.S.  officials on the fighting in Bosnia. The political observers  are convinced that the reason for their conflicting approaches  is that they care more about their country's vital interests in  the Balkans than the fate of Bosnia's Islamic people.    The U.S. Administration has disclosed in the past that the  United States does not wish to intervene in the Balkan region  because it does not have vital interests in that part of the  world. However, it moved to support the Islamic people in  Bosnia to create vital interests for itself when the fighting  spread in that country. Obviously, Washington was aware that the  Serbs are Russia's traditional allies. It was also aware that  the Croat people sided with Germany. Therefore,  Bosnia-Herzegovina was the most appropriate door to the Balkan  region. However, the United States was unable to effectively  support the Bosnian people. Consequently, it tried to support  them only through propaganda statements, without moving to  seriously intervene in the war.    Clinton's disclosures indicate that the White House  officials  do not wish to help Bosnia's people regain their country.  Instead, they prefer to deceive them to create the conditions  they need to strengthen Washington's position in that country.  They also prefer to maintain their special relations with  Britain, Russia, and France.    Understanding why Clinton has ignored the U.S. Senate's  ostentatious wish to have the arms embargo on Bosnia's Islamic  people lifted will be easier when all that is considered.  Furthermore, it has become obvious that Washington does not want  Bosnia's Islamic people to defend themselves against the  merciless Serbian attacks.</p>

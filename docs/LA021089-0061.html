			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'MORE LIGHT' IS LOST IN THE DARK AT THE LEX  </P> <P> "So this is heaven!" A line that strikes dread into a theater reviewer's heart.  It comes in the second act of British playwright Snoo Wilson's "More Light,"  presented by A Directors' Theatre at the Lex Theatre.  </P> <P> Actually, the scene of the play isn't heaven, but the head of Pope Clement  VIII, circa 1600. Clement keeps having this nightmare that a Dominican friar  named Giordano Bruno wasn't burned at the stake for heresy after all, but  escaped to. . . .  </P> <P> Heaven? Well, you know how confusing nightmares can be. This one also features  Queen Elizabeth and William Shakespeare, who has turned himself into a woman in  order to avoid Elizabeth's advances. However, she keeps advancing.  </P> <P> We also meet an alchemist named Dr. Dee, a sharper named Kelly and a barmaid.  Does any of this make any sense?  </P> <P> Director Anne Drecktrah's production slightly suggests the kind of  small-theater extravaganza that the Company Theatre used to do, except that  nothing blends. The light changes are jerky, the set is static, the costumes  hamper the actors' movements without being visually impressive and only three  of the company have voices -- Julian Barnes as Bruno, William Utay as Pope  Clement and Howard Malpas as Dr. Dee.  </P> <P> Drecktrah's program-note about commedia dell' arte is bewildering. Her  production has one actor with physical skills -- Albie Selznick, of the  juggling group the Mums, in the role of Kelly. Everybody else moves like a  civilian.  </P> <P> Shows like this may be a "stretch" for the artists involved, but are a pain for  the average viewer -- or even the viewer who knows something about the plays of  Snoo Wilson. I saw "More Light" twice, for my sins, and wasn't surprised that  half of the second audience left at intermission. If you don't grab them these  days, they go home.  </P> <P> Plays at 8 p.m. Thursdays-Saturdays and at 7:30 p.m. Sundays, with Sunday  matinees at 2:30. Tickets $10-$15. 6760 Lexington Ave. (213) 466-1767.  </P> <P> DAN SULLIVAN  </P></p>

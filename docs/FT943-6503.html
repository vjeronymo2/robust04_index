			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Observer: Rum Cuban Expensive things, these mass exoduses. The Pentagon has done some sums and calculates that the US taxpayer will need to stump up an extra Dollars 240m a year to run an expanded refugee camp at Guantanamo Bay Naval Station. The base sits on 32 acres of Cuban land, leased by the US since 1903 for the equivalent of fractionally more than Dollars 4,000 annually. The extra lolly will go towards doubling the capacity of the camp - where 14,500 Haitian refugees are already squatting alongside Cubans - to 40,000. Heaven only knows what might be the further cost of hosting the hardy thousands who have actually stepped ashore in Florida; more than 20,000 have been picked up by the US coastguard in August. Of course, with Cuba's annual per capita income most recently estimated by the World Bank at between Dollars 500 and Dollars 1,500, Bill Clinton might think cash better spent by dropping it over Havana from a low-flying aircraft. Better still, why not put Guantanamo's Dollars 4,000 towards cutting the federal deficit?</p>

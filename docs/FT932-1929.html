			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / World Trade News: EC dumping of farm produce upsets Hungary EUROPEAN Community leaders are to decide at their Copenhagen summit this week to speed the common market's opening to central-east European farm produce. But the more pressing issue is unfair dumping of western grain and meat in Russia and the Ukraine which is crowding out exports from Hungary, Poland, Romania and Bulgaria, according to a Budapest official. 'For east European agriculture the real problem is here, the real problem is not the EC,' said Mr Gyorgy Rasko, state secretary at the Agriculture Ministry of Hungary, eastern Europe's largest food exporter. Budapest welcomed the EC's 'very fair offer' to modify its association agreements with the central-east European countries and shorten the five-year timetable for lowering farm trade barriers. Hungary claims, however, that French wheat is sold at the Baltic ports at Dollars 90 (Pounds 60) a tonne which could not even cover half the costs. Germany has also increased subsidised exports of beef to the former Soviet Union while Hungarian deliveries of beef have fallen to a tenth of their 1980s level. 'We cannot compete at dumping prices,' said Mr Rasko, citing Hungary's budget problems and low agricultural subsidies. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates a 'producer subsidy equivalent' for the EC of 45 per cent, while Hungary's has fallen from more than 30 per cent in the 1980s to 8 per cent in 1992 and a forecast 6 per cent this year. The former Soviet satellites have suffered drops in production of 25-40 per cent from the 1980s level as domestic demand has fallen with their economies and subsidised western producers have muscled in to markets in Russia and Ukraine. Concessions envisaged on access to the EC market cannot immediately compensate for lost market share in Russia and Ukraine because central-east European farmers cannot shift deliveries smoothly. Producers are strong in the mass commodities which they sold in the former Soviet Union, and processed food is generally of too low a quality to make much headway in western Europe.</p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DE KLERK PUTS JOB OF WHITE PRESIDENT AT RISK IN REFORMS  </P> <P> President Frederik W. de Klerk put his job on the line today, telling  Parliament that domination of South Africa's black majority could not end while  a white president holds office.  </P> <P> "As long as so much power is concentrated in the hands of one person, if he is  white, then no matter what the rest of the system is, there is white  domination," he said.  </P> <P> He told legislators that his job will be up for discussion in proposed  negotiations about a new constitution.  </P> <P> With the present power of the job, a black presidency would inevitably mean  black domination and a Conservative Party presidency would mean conservative  white domination, he said.  </P> <P> "Along with constitutional reform, the state president's post must be  fundamentally reformed," he said.  </P></p>

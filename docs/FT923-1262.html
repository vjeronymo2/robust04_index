			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Lamont shifts cabinet goalposts: Manoeuvrings that may spark a ministerial battle ON Monday evening civil servants inserted an identical note into each of the bulky red boxes that ministers take home at night to keep up with the flood of paperwork generated by the Whitehall bureaucracy. The heading on the briefing note was straightforward enough - 'ERM: new line to take'. It was not remarkable that the Treasury was keen to ensure in such sensitive times that cabinet ministers spoke with one voice about sterling's ignominious departure from the European exchange rate mechanism. But a significant shift in policy was concealed by the seemingly innocuous, prepared responses to questions ministers might face. Between the lines, the note confirmed that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, had unilaterally changed the emergency policy the cabinet had agreed four days earlier in the immediate aftermath of the ERM debacle. The tone reflected a substantial hardening in the Treasury's conditions for the pound's eventual re-entry into the ERM; and a softening in the priority that would be given to the defeat, as opposed to the control, of inflation. Those changes foreshadowed the cut of 1 percentage point in interest rates announced the next morning. They explain why the common front established by the cabinet threatens to disintegrate into another full-scale battle over Europe. Colleagues say Mr Lamont has departed significantly from the spirit if not the letter of the carefully worded deal struck at the end of last Thursday's cabinet meeting. The chancellor's about-turn is the more remarkable because he was most prominent in framing the statement issued after that meeting. That statement, which reaffirmed government resolve in the fight against inflation, said the pound would be put back into the ERM 'as soon as conditions allow'. It followed a long debate in which Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, put the case for semi-permanent suspension. Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, argued forcefully for quick re-entry. There was a general discussion of the need for the turmoil on the markets to subside and for some structural reform of the ERM. But by the end, a clear majority agreed that sterling's departure should be strictly temporary and the government's commitment to Europe undiminished. The only real backing for Mr Howard came from Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, and, to a lesser extent, from Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, lined up with Mr Clarke. Mr Lamont was the most forceful in demanding that the 'as-soon-as' phrase be released publicly to underpin confidence in the markets. He repeatedly emphasised the need not to let up in the fight against inflation. The timescale was not defined. But pro-European ministers such as Mr Heseltine and Mr Clarke left Downing Street content that the phrase meant weeks or at most two or three months. Everyone agreed that they should not reveal the content of the debate but, as one put it: 'We were sure that Norman (Lamont) was on our (the pro-ERM) side.' Mr Heseltine and Mr Clarke have stuck to the cabinet line, modifying it only to accommodate Mr John Major's decision that the workings of the ERM should be central to the agenda of the emergency summit of EC leaders next month. But Mr Lamont has rejoiced in his new-found freedom, lengthening the list of conditions for re-entry to the ERM and announcing a quick cut in interest rates in spite of a 10 per cent devaluation of the pound. He has reminded colleagues that he has always been on the Eure-sceptic wing of the party. He has talked publicly of the new 'British' economic policy the government will pursue. His anti-inflation rhetoric has been subtly modified to put the aim of economic growth alongside that of low, rather than zero, inflation. Other ministers are beginning to suspect that the chancellor may now want to stay outside the ERM indefinitely. They are determined to fight that policy. Mr Major has so far remained neutral. A Euro-sceptic edge has crept into his rhetoric and he sanctioned the reduction in interest rates - but he has consulted closely with Mr Clarke and Mr Heseltine. He may be playing a tactical game - aiming to win back the 'soft' Tory Euro-sceptics by securing an end to recession before rebuilding his economic and European policies. Pro-European ministers are giving him the benefit of the doubt. The same cannot be said of Mr Lamont. Some colleagues believe that the chancellor has decided to buttress his own position by emerging as the most prominent spokesman in the government for the Tory Euro-sceptic wing. When the chancellor joins his colleagues for this morning's cabinet meeting he will be able to point to the intense strains on the ERM this week as justification for his caution on re-entry. But if he confirms the suspicion that he intends to embark on an economic policy that detaches Britain from the European mainstream he will be setting the stage for a bitter cabinet struggle.</p>

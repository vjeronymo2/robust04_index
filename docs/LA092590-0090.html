			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Lockheed Rebuffs Simmons: Lockheed Corp. said its board rejected a proposal  from Texas investor Harold C. Simmons to eliminate Lockheed's "poison pill"  anti-takeover defense provision. The defense gives Lockheed the right to sell  stock to other shareholders at a discount if a hostile buyer acquires 20% or  more of the company's stock, a provision that would dilute the stake of an  unfriendly suitor.  </P> <P> NL Industries, a Houston-based chemical company controlled by Simmons, owns  19.8% and last month said it was willing to buy another 10 million shares from  a Lockheed employee stock ownership plan if the aerospace firm removed its  poison pill. Lockheed said Simmons, who made an unsuccessful bid for control of  Lockheed Corp. last spring, will not be exempted from the poison pill  provision.  </P></p>

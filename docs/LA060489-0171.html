			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THEATER NOTEBOOK: GIVING INTIMATE VOICE TO 'OTHER' LIVES AFFECTED BY AIDS  </P> <P> Michael Kearns and AIDS-related theater -- the two are rapidly becoming  synonymous. And for now, at least, that's OK with Kearns. "I feel a tremendous  peace and serenity doing this work -- because I'm doing something," said the  Los Angeles actor-director. "Also, there's a certain joy in taking  responsibility for your life -- as an artist and a gay person and someone who's  been heartbroken."  </P> <P> In the past few years, Kearns (whose touring repertoire includes "Dream Man"  and "The Truth is Bad Enough" -- which has played locally and across Europe)  figures he's done "probably ten AIDS pieces, mostly through the experience of a  gay white man, because that's what I am, and most of the people I've lost. But  finally I got tired, not of the subject, but telling that tale. I felt it was  my responsibility to look at the others."  </P> <P> Those others -- the disenfranchised and outcast of our society -- come to life  in "Intimacies," a collection of character portraits opening this weekend and  playing through June at the Highways performance space in Santa Monica.  </P> <P> The one-man show (directed by Kelly Hill, with original music by Darien Martus)  presents six very different characters, all suffering from AIDS: deranged  Denny, a black street hooker named Big Red, "Perfect Patrick" from West  Hollywood, a heterosexual junkie/street kid named Rusty, Mary (who believes  AIDS is God's punishment) and Phoenix, now blind and living under the Hollywood  Freeway -- "full of sweetness and hope."  </P> <P> It was the Denny character that first sparked Kearns' imagination. "I was in  New York a year ago, down in the subway, and there was a guy in a hospital  gown, with blood splattered all over it. He appeared to be gay -- and he  appeared to be demented. But he also seemed to be having the time of his life."  A few months later, touring in San Francisco, Kearns was drawn to the sight of  the city's prostitutes, wondering "how they survived this whole AIDS thing.  </P> <P> "When you hear something's about AIDS, people think it's going to be  depressing," Kearns said. "But most of these characters have a lot of humor.  They're surviving by their wits. This piece is open and light. It's also a  reaction not only to gay theater's response to AIDS, but the media's response.  It's easy for a good-looking white male to be heard. But these people are not  going be in 'People' or on 'Nightline.' Their voices are not taken seriously."  </P> <P> Perhaps, the actor hopes, audiences will listen to him. But he makes it clear  he's only speaking for himself -- not the gay world. "If I thought about my  responsibility to the community, I'd go crazy," he said. "I always thought of  this as a responsibility to myself, my instincts, my feelings. I also believe  an actor needs to address social issues. The fact that I'm a gay white male and  AIDS is here has just accelerated that belief."  </P> <P> But don't look for a role model beyond that.  </P> <P> "I'm flattered by the idea," he admitted. "But the truth is that a lot of  material in this piece -- if you broke it apart -- would not be considered  politically correct by some gay activists. At this point, I don't think art can  be politically correct. We've proven we can be the good boys," preaching  monogamy and safe sex. "I don't want to do that anymore. Anyway," Kearns said  with a laugh, "I don't think I personally have to worry about being perceived  as a good boy."  </P> <P> Also this month: "Orphee, Oedipus and the Lady With the Red Glove" a  dance/drama taken from the themes of Jean Cocteau's works, has a final  performance this afternoon at the Barnsdall Gallery Theatre in Los Angeles. . .  . A stripper sees Jesus in a mirror ball and becomes a stripper-evangelist in  Rebecca Wells' offbeat comedy, "Gloria Duplex," opening today at the Back Alley  in Van Nuys.  </P> <P> Joseph Megel and Phil Ward's adaptation of Richard Brautigan's "Sombrero  Fallout: A Japanese Novel," about a writer's obsessive love and a mysterious  black sombrero, premieres Wednesday at Hollywood's Friends and Artists  Ensemble. . . . Meredith Cofren's "Growing Gracefully: The Middle Ages of  Women," a group of monologues on being female, opens Thursday at the Tiffany  Theatre in West Hollywood. Linda Carlson, Mary Pat Gleason, Ann Guilbert,  Elaine Joyce and Joanna Miles are featured.  </P> <P> Los Angeles playwright Jean Van Tuyle's "Summer Wind," about a troubled  Illinois farm family, has its premiere Friday at Burbank's Alliance Theatre. .  . . "Growing Pains," the Joan Desberg/Julius Wechter/Cissy Wechter/Faye  Greenberg musical comedy about marital mid-life crisis, also opens Friday, at  Van Nuys' Actors Alley.  </P> <P> "Time Flies When You're Alive," a moving reminiscence by actor Paul Linke on  his late wife's bout with cancer, has a single performance Friday at the Santa  Monica Playhouse. . . . Shakespeare's "Pericles, Prince of Tyre" and "Americana  -- Saints and Sinners," a celebration of American heritage told through the  words of the country's poets, playwrights and statesmen (and put to music) open  next Sunday at the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum in Topanga.  </P> <P> Christopher Marlowe's rarely seen "Edward II" opens June 15 at the Globe  Playhouse in West Hollywood. Michael Benedict directs. . . . Playwright Jude  Narita returns with her gallery of Asian women, "Coming Into Passion/Song For a  Sansei," opening June 16 at the New Playwright's Foundation Theatre in the  Fairfax area.  </P> <P> A newly formed group, Strike Theatre Inc., opens a summer season June 16 at the  Callboard in West Hollywood with Cyril Tourneur's Jacobean thriller "The  Revengers". . . . Sundance Institute artistic director David Krane's one-acts  "Audience" and "Montana" premiere June 16 at Friends and Artists Ensemble. . .  .

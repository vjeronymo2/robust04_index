			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, April 13 (AFP) -- Ukraine has received from  Russia a first shipment of nuclear fuel from its dismantled  warheads in line with a U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian agreement reached  in January, Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk told AFP  Wednesday [13 April].    Tarasyuk said that Russia sent the first convoy of fuel to  be  used to run power plants to the southern city of Zaparozhnye  Monday after Ukraine threatened to suspend dismantling of its  nuclear warheads.    Defence Minister Vitaliy Radetsky told a news conference  during a visit to Germany earlier this week that Ukraine would  stop dismantling the weapons because of Russia's failure to  provide the fuel.    Tarasyuk, who returned from talks in Moscow, said he had  received assurances from Russian officials that they would  fulfill their obligations under the agreement signed by U.S.  President Bill Clinton, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk.    "Ukraine will not raise any obstacles in the implementation  of this trilateral agreement if all parties involved fulfill  their commitments," Tarasyuk said.    Ukraine was the last of the four nuclear states of the  former  Soviet Union to agree to dismantle its nuclear weapons under the  agreement that provided Ukraine with at least one billion  dollars in financial compensation and nuclear fuel shipments to  run the country's power stations.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / World Trade News: Gatt acts on duties row The subsidies committee of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has agreed to an EC request for conciliation in its row over anti-subsidy duties imposed by the US on some EC steel imports. The committee has 30 days from April 28, when the decision was made, to resolve the dispute after which the EC can ask for an independent panel to rule on the issue. The EC and US have already held unsuccessful bilateral consultations over the duties. The EC argues that the US has used a 'flawed methodology' for calculating subsidies which breaches Gatt's subsidies code. This is denied by the US, which has stressed the duties remain preliminary. Seven EC members are among 19 countries hit by US anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on their steel exports.</p>

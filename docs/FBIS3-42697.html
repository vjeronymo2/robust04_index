			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Volkov: "Oleg Soskovets Will </F> `Abalkinize' the Economy"]    [Text] At the beginning of next week scientists from 10  scientific institutes will present an analytic report with  proposals for the correction of the economic course to Russia's  president and prime minister. Leonid Abalkin, one of the  drafters of this report, informed Interfax of this.    For some time the report has been under the consideration of  First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, who, judging by  everything, intends to support it as an alternative to the  government program approved in the summer of last year. It is  quite probable that precisely this document will become the  basis for the government program, which an expanded government  meeting may adopt during the first 10-day period in February.    In contrast to the strategic guidelines approved by the big  Council of Ministers in August 1993, the document worked out by  Leonid Abalkin, Nikolay Petrakov, and other academicians, in  fact, provides for a departure from the anti-inflationary policy  and proposes that state regulation in the economy be restored in  quite a large volume. It asserts that the "negative tendencies  in large measure are rooted in the failures of the policy of  financial stabilization." The authors of this report state that  it is impossible to wage a fight against inflation by "purely  monetaristic methods," while a restriction of the money supply  and a reduction of the budget deficit "deprive the national  economy of the possibility of making efficient structural  changes." "Gaydar's and Fedorov's course has failed," Leonid  Abalkin declared yesterday.    However, the measures proposed in the report, essentially,  do  not represent anything new. They were realized in practice  through the pressure of enterprise directors during the  pre-reform period and, to a somewhat lesser extent, under  Messrs. Gaydar and Fedorov. The authors of this report again, as  during the 1980's, put forward the thesis about the need "to  restore the production volume" through the "conversion of the  defense industry."    As a top-priority measure the report proposes the  establishment of "price ratios and sectorial profitability  levels efficient for our conditions." In practice, this can mean  a departure from price liberalization and the application of  methods of administrative regulation in production.    "In a number of cases financial adaptation--preferential  taxation and the extension of special credit for consumers of  products--can help industries, which at present are  noncompetitive owing to high prices," the report states. In  other words, Messrs. academicians propose that credit  injections, which take place anyway, be expanded in order to  stabilize the financial position of large Soviet enterprises in  the hope that they would consciously make their production more  efficient, or without this hope, automatically identifying  competitiveness with the absence of competitors and preferential  conditions of existence.    As it seems, such an approach exhausts the methods of  "nonmonetary" effect on the economy and of fighting against  inflation by "increasing effective demand." In order to expand  the latter, the repeatedly expressed idea of indexing the  population's savings to compensate for the price increase is  proposed. This measure was actively lobbied in the former  Supreme Soviet and was the main argument of Vladimir  Ispravnikov, who appeared there in the role of Yegor Gaydar's  opponent and after the dissolution of the Supreme Soviet  switched over to the government apparatus. Its populist nature  is all the more obvious, because the authors of this report  propose that indexed funds be "pulled away" from the consumer  market, evidently, by freezing deposits in banks. Thus, it is  proposed that, in fact, credit emission be carried out, not  granting additional real capital to the population, but, on the  other hand, increasing the inflationary tax.    The authors of this report made an interesting statement on  its first page: "Economies of different countries are  different." Obviously, this banality would not deserve a place  in the academic development of the strategy of the economic  course for Russia if not for the subtext, which is an antonym of  the famous Russian proverb, "What is good for the German is  death for the Russian." Undoubtedly, the approach to the  "correction of reforms" developed by Messrs. Abalkin, Petrakov,  and so forth, has all the chances to be supported by "commodity  producers," whose interests, apparently, will be observed by the  government of Viktor Chernomyrdin and Oleg Soskovets. Such an  approach makes it possible to refrain for some time from the  production of the very commodity that consumers would like to  purchase owing to its consumer properties, not in view of the  lack of other goods. The promised "selective" credits issued on  the expectation of the "consciousness" of Soviet managers can  save time for "commodity producers." At the same time, this  approach flatters the sense of national exclusiveness, rejecting  well-known world experience and referring to world practice not  known outside the narrow academic circle.    It can be assumed that, if this strategic document is  accepted for execution and practical elaboration, real economic  reforms will have a chance for continuation only to the extent  that the government is incapable of pursuing its course in  practice. However, if it seriously begins to act according to an  academic scenario, the consequences will not be slow in making  themselves felt and will force the political leadership to  replace theoreticians with excessive initiative.</p>

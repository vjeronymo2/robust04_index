			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Pact With Inter-American Bank: The Bush Administration has ended a  two-year-long impasse with Latin American governments over the Inter-American  Development Bank and has agreed to a major expansion of the 44-country  institution's lending resources. The accord, which climaxes three years of  negotiations, will virtually double the available lending resources of the IDB  -- to $22.5 billion over the next four years. It also will allow the bank to  make broad-scale loans designed to help debtor countries overhaul their own  economic policies. Under the compromise, a loan can be delayed for up to two  months at the request of any one board member; two members could delay it for  an additional five months.  </P></p>

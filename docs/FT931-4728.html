			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: The white paper for Scotland The Scottish grand committee, which comprises all 72 Scottish MPs, would debate the principle of bills relating solely to Scotland before they received their second reading, so there would be no second reading debate in the Commons. Second and third reading votes would still be taken in the House. The committee would stage extra sessions of Scottish question time, currently held monthly, and could question Scottish ministers and law officers from the House of Lords. Scottish Office ministers might make statements to the committee instead of to the whole house, and short adjournment debates might be held at the end of committee sessions. The Scottish Office will take control of training from the Department of Employment, while the Department of Trade and Industry will hand over responsibility for some industrial assistance schemes. The Civil Aviation Authority will cede control of Highlands and Islands Airports, which operates eight Highland airports, to the Scottish Office. Within Scotland, Scottish Office departments based in Edinburgh and Glasgow might be moved.</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Mideast border accord lifts hopes for peace Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation appear to have struck a compromise on security at border crossings, paving the way for the long-delayed implementation of Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho. Egyptian, Israeli and PLO officials yesterday said there had been a breakthrough after two months of bitter dispute about who should control the Gaza-Egypt and Jericho-Jordan borders. A final agreement could be possible this weekend when Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, meets Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, in Switzerland. Mr Amr Moussa, the Egyptian foreign minister, who visited Israel yesterday to help consolidate the progress made between the two sides, said: 'All of us know that a lot of progress has already been made. . . so the remaining points are indeed few.' Mr Peres said after meeting Mr Moussa: 'We've created the basis for an agreement with the PLO. . . We don't have an agreement yet but we have the basis of such an agreement.' Officials stressed that further work was needed on two other issues: the size of the Jericho area and the size of an Israeli military security zone around Jewish settlements which will remain in Gaza. But they said resolution of the border issue made agreement on other issues much easier. Israeli and Palestinian negotiators meeting at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba briefly discussed less sensitive matters such as telecommunications, then decided to suspend talks until after the Arafat-Peres meeting. Officials said the turning point in the stalled talks had come after Israel agreed to accede to a PLO demand that Israeli security checks of Palestinians at the border would be conducted by 'invisible' electronic technology rather than physical contact. The PLO, in return, had agreed to withdraw a demand for a Palestinian police presence on the crossings. Israel had also offered free passage of Palestinians from the Jordan border into Jericho after the PLO gave up its demand for control of roads leading to the border. Mr Yoel Singer, legal adviser to Israel's Foreign Ministry, and Mr Ahmed Qurie (Abu Ala'a) of the PLO are expected to meet in Paris tomorrow to draft an agreement before Sunday's Peres-Arafat meeting in Davos, Switzerland. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, signalled he had agreed to the compromise and said there had been 'improvement' in the talks, but warned that obstacles still remained. The apparent breakthrough came as Israeli delegations prepared to meet separately and in secret with Syria, Jordan, Lebanon and Palestinians in Washington to resume the search for a comprehensive Middle East peace. Mr Arafat yesterday met King Fahd of Saudi Arabia for the first time since 1990 to try to settle differences and win back Saudi financial and political support suspended after the PLO backed Iraq in the Gulf war. Saudi Radio said Mr Arafat and the king met in the capital Riyadh. Boycott reconsidered, Page 6</p>

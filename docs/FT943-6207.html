			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Milk Marque offers price deal Milk Marque, the farmers' co-operative which is to succeed the Milk Marketing Board, yesterday offered dairy manufacturers an option which it said could save 0.4p on the price of a litre until October next year. Mr Andrew Dare, Milk Marque chief executive, said this 'should remove any need to increase the price of a pinta in real terms during the next year'. The move was seen as an attempt to limit the row over prices which dairy manufacturers say will rise following deregulation of the market in November. However, the Dairy Trade Federation said the price change was a cosmetic exercise which merely emphasised the power of a monopoly.</p>

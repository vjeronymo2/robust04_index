			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: GIO flotation set at ADollars 2.40 GIO Australia, the insurer being privatised by the New South Wales state government, will be offered to the public at ADollars 2.40 a share, according to Mr Nick Greiner, the state's premier, Reuter reports from Sydney. Institutions have been invited to tender at prices between ADollars 2.10 and ADollars 2.40 a share. A total of 500m shares will be issued, Mr Greiner said in launching the prospectus for the flotation. The government hopes to raise ADollars 1.2bn (USDollars 799m) from the sale of 100 per cent of GIO, which had net assets at end-1991 of ADollars 1.06bn. GIO was formerly the Government Insurance Office, a general insurance company owned by the state government. The final price will be set on the basis of public and institutional demand. 'All investors, both institutional and private, will pay the same price for shares,' the state government said. Directors have forecast an operating profit after tax for the year to June 30 1992 of ADollars 105m, or 21 cents a share, compared with ADollars 95m in the year to June 1991. GIO intends to pay a 14 cents a share dividend in November 1992. 'Directors expect to maintain the dividend in respect of 1992/93 and it will be payable in May and November of each year,' the state government said. Institutions have to apply for 50,000 shares or more. The offer, underwritten by County NatWest, Bain and Co and Potter Warburg, opens on June 29 and closes on July 24. GIO shares are due to be listed on the Australian Stock Exchange on August 20. At ADollars 2.40, a share GIO will be capitalised within the top 50 companies in Australia. Foreign investors will be allowed to take part in the flotation. All investors will be limited to a 10 per cent stake on application and an on-going shareholding of 15 per cent. GIO was established in 1927 to provide workers' compensation and general insurance for the New South Wales government and now manages about ADollars 8bn in assets. It is ranked A for long-term debt and A-1 for short-term debt by credit rating agency S&amp;P Australian Ratings. 'The privatisation is a key plank of my government's micro-economic reforms,' Mr Greiner said, adding that it was the country's first ever 100 per cent privatisation by flotation. The federal government last year floated 30 per cent of Commonwealth Bank of Australia.</p>

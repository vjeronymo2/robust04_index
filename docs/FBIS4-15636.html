This number of deputies is sufficient to ensure  that the country's Supreme Council opens and works fruitfully,  since it comprises a constitutional majority.    Deputies elected in the second round of voting include  Ukraine's Acting Prime Minister Yefim Zvyahilskyy, Deputy Prime  Ministers Mykola Zhulynskyy and Valentyn Landyk, and well-known  politicians Borys Oliynik and Volodymyr Yavorivskyy.</p>

Fighting is continuing in the  region, and the reports coming from there are very  contradictory. Thus, Abkhaz sources reported yesterday evening  a victory in the Kodori gorge; Georgian sources refute this  report. In our bulletin tonight, we have reportage from both  sides of the trenches:    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Medeya Akhalkatsi] Since  nightfall, Abkhaz formations have been carrying out very  intensive shelling against the Georgian mountain village of  Zemo-Lada using heavy equipment, mortars, and large-caliber  artillery. The Gudauta side has begun using banned phosphorous  shells and Grad systems. Several helicopters are periodically  bringing in additional personnel and military equipment from the  direction of Sukhumi. Despite this, Georgian border troops and  volunteer units are managing to contain the attack and to hold  their positions. There are dozens of dead and wounded on both  sides as a result of the constant battles. There are also  casualties among the civilian population. Thousands of people  are leaving their homes and swelling the already large list of  displaced persons. Women and children are being evacuated first.    [Correspondent Ruslan Khashig] The situation in the Kodori  gorge in Abkhazia is fully under the control of the republic's  armed forces today. The government of Abkhazia is taking urgent  measures these days to normalize life in the villages of  Nizhnyaya and Verkhnyaya Lata. Local authorities are being  restored, and foodstuffs are being delivered there. As a result  of the operation, units of Georgian troops who had been dug in  at Lata since last autumn have now been driven out. These units  are currently blockaded in the mountain village of Azhara. [end  recording]</p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A 1986 Isuzu Trooper believed to have been driven by Roger Sing Ip when he  allegedly shot and killed a Mission Bay High School student is being studied  for evidence, officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Investigators are awaiting results of tests that could show microscopic amounts  of metal filings or gunpowder residue on the car, Detective Bill Nulton said.  </P> <P> The car was recovered Friday from a garage in Alhambra, east of Los Angeles,  and returned to San Diego on Saturday, investigators said.  </P> <P> Police had been searching for Ip, a 32-year-old Pacific Beach restaurateur, and  his car since the July 10 shooting of Kurt Von Yokes, a 15-year-old La Jollan.  Ip, co-owner of the China Inn restaurant, fled to Los Angeles after the death  but surrendered to authorities July 27 after his home and business were  searched and a warrant was issued for his arrest.  </P> <P> Last Thursday, Ip pleaded innocent to murder charges. He is being held in  County Jail in lieu of $1-million bail.  </P> <P> On the night of the shooting, Yokes and two friends riding in a car almost  collided with Ip's Isuzu Trooper at Bayard Street and Grand Avenue in Pacific  Beach, police said. After a brief exchange of words, Ip followed the car to a  house on Christopher Street and shot Yokes as he and another passenger got out,  they said.  </P></p>

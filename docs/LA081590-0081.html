			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> RECYCLING FIRM GETS 1-MONTH CONTRACT  </P> <P> In an effort to reduce waste by 25%, Oxnard has joined in a short-term  agreement to send an average of 50 tons of solid waste a day to a Ventura  recycling company.  </P> <P> The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to approve a 30-day contract with  Gold Coast Recycling Co.  </P> <P> Public Works analyst Stan Hakes said the 30-day contract will give the city a  chance to evaluate the processing center and consider a long-term contract with  the firm.  </P> <P> A state law requires all cities to reduce residential and commercial waste by  25% by 1995.  </P> <P> Oxnard collects about 400 tons of commercial and industrial waste a day. A  recent study indicates that much of the waste is made up of 80% to 99%  recyclable material.  </P> <P> The recycling center charges $39.50 a ton -- the same amount it costs to  dispose of waste at a regional landfill. Hakes said that if the city joins Gold  Coast in a revenue-sharing program, the sale of the recyclable material could  reduce the cost to about $20 a ton. HUGO MARTIN  </P></p>

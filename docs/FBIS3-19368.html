			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said:  Greece's basic position is the survival and development of the  state of Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM]. But Gligorov's government must first give  specific practical proof. Venizelos made this statement when he  was asked to comment on yesterday's remarks by Skopjean Assembly  President Stojan Andov, who claimed that problems exist between  Macedonia [as heard] and Greece but that he [Andov] does not  think there are problems between the two peoples.    Venizelos noted that Andov wanted to use the term FYROM [as  heard] by which the United Nations has recognized their state  and stressed that when the issue is resolved through the  two-stage process [addressing the issues of the symbol,  Constitution, and propaganda followed by that of the name],  Greece will help the neighboring state in a positive way. Andov  is right. The problem lies with the government, not between the  peoples. But the problem does not lie with the Greek  Government; it lies with the Skopjean Government, Venizelos said  and concluded: Only when Skopje gives the three specific  proofs--relating to the symbol, Constitution, and propaganda--in  a dialogue with Greece, which has a known position on the name,  will we also discuss bilateral economic relations.</p>

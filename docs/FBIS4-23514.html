			<p>BFN     [Text] The Mozambican Government has denied statements by  UN Special Representative Aldo Ajello that it withdrew  complaints made last week against a memorandum sent to the  Supervision and Control Commission by Colonel Segala, chairman  of the Cease-Fire Commission [CCF]. The memorandum concerns  differences of figures for government military personnel to be  confined in 29 areas recommended by the United Nations. The  NOTICIAS newspaper quotes Lieutenant Colonel Osorio Mateus,  assistant of the government's representative in the CCF, as  saying that our complaints are still in force. He questioned if  there wasn't another intention behind Aldo Ajello's statements  on 3 June, that the government withdrew its complaints.</p>

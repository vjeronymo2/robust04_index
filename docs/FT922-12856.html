			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Monaco (4): Gambling on the gamblers - Profile: Societe des Bains de Mers IF you ask the chairman of one of Europe's larger leisure groups about his company's prospects for the coming year, you don't really expect him to say that it depends on how many high stakes gamblers, or grands joueurs, come to his casinos and whether they win or lose. But that is exactly how Mr Raoul Biancheri, executive chairman of Societe des Bains de Mers (SBM), by far the biggest single business in Monaco, responds to such a question. 'In a business like our's, the grands (itals) joueurs (itals) can make an enormous difference,' he says. 'Everything depends on whether they come to Monte Carlo and on how well they play.' The fluctuating fortunes of the grands joueurs have dominated SBM's development ever since its formation in 1863. SBM, then known as the Societe Anonyme des Bains de Mer et du Cercle des Etrangers, was founded by princely decree when Prince Charles III of Monaco gave Mr Francois Blanc, the man who had turned the obscure town of Bad Homburg in Bavaria into the glitzy gambling centre of Europe, a 50-year licence to run a casino in Monte Carlo. Before the casino, Monaco had been a small, poverty-stricken village clinging to its cliff on the coastline along from the flourishing Riviera towns of Nice and Cannes. Prince Charles III had seen how gambling had transformed the Bavarian economy. Gambling was then illegal in France, but that law did not apply to the independent state of Monaco. The prince dispatched his private secretary to Bad Homburg to investigate and founded the SBM - euphemistically called a 'Sea Bathing Company' so as not to arouse the suspicions of the French authorities - to own and operate a casino in Monte Carlo, together with hotels to house its wealthy patrons. Monaco's first attempts at casino management were not a success. For starters, even the most enthusiastic of would-be gamblers must have baulked at the journey to Monaco which involved risking life and limb on a four-hour ride from Nice in a rickety vehicle or an equally unpleasant journey in the Palmaria, a sea tub stuffed with flour and olive oil. In its first week, the casino attracted just one player and he walked out having won FFr2. Mr Francois Blanc had more ambitious plans. His first project, the Hotel de Paris, opened its doors in 1864 on a scrap of wasteland on the rock opposite the royal palace which was rechristened, in deference to its princely patron, Mount Charles, or Monte Carlo. By the time Mr Blanc died in 1877, there were 35 hotels in Monte Carlo and his casino was taking FFr10m a year. Four years later, his widow, Marie, commissioned Charles Garnier, architect of the opulent Opera in Paris, to build a brand new casino. Hotels and gambling have been the base of SBM's business ever since. The SBM of today owns four hotels - the Hermitage, Mirabeau and Monte Carlo Beach, as well as the Hotel de Paris - with interests in gambling, sports facilities and discotheques. It is an institution in Monaco, being 67 per cent owned by the state, the biggest single employer with a workforce of more than 2,000, and owning one twelfth of the principality's land. The SBM's financial fortunes have waxed and waned over the years. Its profits declined in the mid-1980s because of losses at the main casino and low occupancy rates in its big hotels, which have historically been seen as loss-leaders to attract clients to its casinos. Its performance improved in the late 1980s when the casino returned to profit. By the 1988-89 financial year, the SBM was able to swallow an accelerated write-off on sports facilities, increased provisions for gambling risks and even an ill-fated investment in Badouin, the failed Paris stockbroker - to make net profits of FFr198m on sales of FFr1.5bn. By the following year its profits had risen to FFr290m and sales to FFr1.7bn despite a decline in its hotel interests where operating profits slipped from FFr30m to FFr22m because of the disruption to tourism caused by the Gulf war. By contrast its gambling receipts rose from FFr215 to FFr284m during the year. Mr Biancheri said that, so far, 1991-92 had shown a marked recovery. One indication of the improved climate is the occupancy rates at the hotels, all of which are back to above 60 per cent for 1991-92. Meanwhile, the SBM is locked into a long-term investment programme to protect its position in an increasingly competitive market. The SBM is building a 400-room luxury hotel and casino next to the Sporting Club, scheduled to open in three years' time. But the Hotel de Paris and the Hermitage recently acquired a new rival in the Metropole, complete with four stars, Christofle cutlery, Limoges china and a baby jacuzzi in every bathtub. The SBM is responding by renovating the rooms at the Hermitage and a series of improvements at the Hotel de Paris. Its FFr2m investment in the Louis XV restaurant at the Hotel de Paris has already paid off in terms of three Michelin stars and higher receipts for the Louis XV and its superstar chef, Mr Alain Ducasse. As for gambling, the new hotel development will include a casino for American games, following the success of the Cafe de Paris scheme. Earlier this year, the SBM introduced two new American games - Punto Banco, a derivative of baccarat, and Pago Poker, a form of stud poker - to the main casino. The SBM's critics claim it should be more adventurous and plough its hefty cash pile into new areas of activity inside and outside Monaco. But Mr Biancheri, possibly still bruised by the memory of the Badouin debacle, brushes aside such comments. 'Our business is in hotels and casinos,' he says. 'Those are the areas that we know and that we are good at. So we will stick to them.'</p>

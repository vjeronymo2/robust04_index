The corporation was established in accordance with the  Russian president's decree and on the basis of three former  foreign trade associations. The task of the newly established  corporation is to ensure state monopoly over exports and imports  of weapons and defence hardware for the development of military  and technical cooperation with foreign countries.    Kozyrev pointed out that the development of military  cooperation with foreign countries promotes the growth of  Russian industry, creation of work places and higher industrial  output. At the same time, the development of such cooperation  is a tangible contribution to strengthening peace and stability  both in the world and in separate regions.    Any country which supports and develops such cooperation  with  Russia, can count on Russia's diplomatic support. At the same  time, by developing such cooperation, we expect an adequate  attitude from our foreign partners and honest attitude in trade,  the Russian minister said.    Weapons as an item for exports cannot be regarded as a  conventional commodity, and therefore, Russia seeks to give  weapons trade a civilized character. "We shall see to it that  weapons do not spread over the world, and primarily, its most  destabilizing specimen and weapons of mass destruction," the  Russian foreign minister said.</p>

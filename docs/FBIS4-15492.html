			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 4/4/1994 -- Moldovan Parliament  has approved today the structure and nominal composition of the  government proposed by the Premier Andrei Sangheli. The new  government will encompass 18 ministers, including the minister  of state and minister of relations with the Parliament, instead  of the 20 working now. According to Sangheli, the  restructuration of the government will lead to the reduction in  the state apparatus by 30-40 percent; it has now 5,000-6,000  people for whose maintenance 3.2 percent of the budget means are  used. Of four vice-premiers, three were entitled: Valentin  Cunev, Ion Gutu, and Valeriu Bulgaru. As ministers were  elected: Valeriu Bobutac (minister of economics); Valeriu Chitan  (minister of finance); Ceslav Ciobanu (minister of  privatization); Grigore Trifoi (minister of industry), Vitalie  Gorincioi, (minister of agriculture); Ion Casian (minister of  information and telecommunication); Dumitru Nedelcu (minister  of social protection); Timofei Mosneaga (minister of health  protection); Pavel Gaugas (minister of education); Vasile  Sturza (minister of justice); Pavel Creanga (minister of  defence); Constantin Antoci (minister of interior); Vasile  Calmoi (minister of national security); Mihai Popov (minister  of foreign affairs); Vasile Iov (minister of transport and  road-works); Mihai Severovan (minister of utilities); Mihail  Cibotaru (minister of culture); Gheorghe Gusac (minister of  state); Victor Puscas (minister of relations with Parliament).  During the debates the Christian-Democratic Popular Front of  Moldova Alliance (FPCD) faction proposed to transform the  minister of national security in a Department of Border Guards  and an Information Service. This proposal was not supported by  the parliamentary majority. The deputies decided that the  premier will present the program of restructuring the Ministries  of Security and Interior. The new composition of the government  was passed with 83 votes for, eight against and one abstained.  The faction of the Block of Peasants and Intellectuals (BTI)  declared that they will not vote.</p>

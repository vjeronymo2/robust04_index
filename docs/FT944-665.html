			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: BAT up after US go-ahead International tobacco and insurance group BAT Industries rose 3 to 445p against the trend after the group finally reached agreement with the US Federal Commission over its proposed acquisition of American Tobacco. There was also believed to be at least one upbeat recommendation for the group in circulation, and BAT was the most actively traded stock in a quiet market following the clearance of the Pounds 600m deal. The trade-off is that BAT will sell off a range of cigarette brands and a cigarette manufacturing facility to an independent competitor to preserve competition in the US industry.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Red faces over Irish shares Ireland's coalition government has been embarrassed by the revelation that a cabinet minister with responsibility for the mining industry was an investor until last week in a mining company seeking a licence for a IPounds 50m (Pounds 49.4m) lead and zinc mine in County Kilkenny. Mr Brian Cowen, Fianna Fail minister for transport, energy and communications, has been forced to sell his shares in the company, Arcon, after his interest was disclosed by Irish newspapers. He sold the shares for less than half the IPounds 960 he paid for them four years ago. An ethics bill sponsored by Labour, junior partner in the coalition government with Fianna Fail, is presently making its way through parliament. It requires MPs and government ministers to disclose their interests. Arcon's largest shareholder is Mr Tony O'Reilly, the Heinz chief executive and Irish newspaper proprietor, who owns 22.6 per cent of the company.</p>

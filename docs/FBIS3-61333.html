			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed Article: "They Go to the Trade Union for Help. </F> They Bring Their Vouchers Here Too..."]    [Text] At the end of last year RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA (see the  issue for 28 December) reported to its readers on the check  investment fund of workers of Profsolidarnost. Most frequently  such funds advertise themselves in loud and intriguing ways: "We  will turn your voucher into gold!" etc. And the "details" that  interest the voucher holders are simply left out. The calling  card of Profsolidarnost, which was founded by the largest branch  trade unions of Russia, was drawn up, it seemed, quite  carefully. Nonetheless the Moscow staff headquarters of the  fund, which is located in the building of the Council of the  FITUR [Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia] on  Lenin Avenue, and its representative offices, which are in  republic, kray, oblast, city, and rayon trade union committees,  and also RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA are receiving phone calls and letters  from people requesting that various details be clarified, that  they discuss in greater detail why Profsolidarnost can so  confidently guarantee them high dividends. The floor is turned  over to the vice president for public relations of the  joint-stock company of managers of AKOM, Andrey Stolyarov:    "I will not deny that the growing interest of RABOCHAYA  TRIBUNA readers in our fund is gratifying. We are gaining more  and more stockholders. But it is also quite natural for the  people to want to learn more about the people to whom they have  decided to entrust their vouchers. Noisy scandals over funds  that promised mountains of gold yesterday and today have  suddenly taken a dive or have disappeared completely are a  lesson to many: be careful...we must never disappoint the  expectations of the people or even promise more than we can give  them. You will agree that this would be a terrible blow to the  largest and most respected associations of workers--the trade  unions."    And so we have the trade unions behind us. They are the ones  whose direct duty it is to defend the interests of the  workers--our first guarantors. Where does almost any investment  fund begin? With the creation of a network of its representative  offices and points for receiving vouchers and selling shares.  And on this they spend millions and millions of rubles that have  been taken out of the pockets of the shareholders. But we  essentially already have such a network. It is the trade union  structures of the most diverse levels, which are capable of  simultaneously both monitoring the activity of the fund and  appreciably influencing it. If the "rank-and-file" shareholder  has certain doubts or questions he is welcome to come to his  home trade union committee where he knows everyone and they know  him.    The authorized capital of Profsolidarnost is more than 50  billion rubles. Obviously a large fund. And in this connection  the misgivings expressed by certain people are justified: Will  the founders not start investing the multitude of vouchers they  have gathered "just any old where"? As long as they dispose of  them?...no, nothing like that happens here nor will it happen.  Some are better and some are worse, and the trade unions know  precisely which is which, in which branches and in which  enterprises things are proceeding well today and where they are  having nothing but trouble. Because the controller of the fund  of the joint-stock company of managers AKOM has already  managed--with real support from the trade unions--to set up an  effective system of investments. In particular, we have arranged  business contacts with a number of profitable and promising  enterprises of the extraction and processing  branches--petroleum, timber, chemical, gold-ore, diamond...and,  believe me, these enterprises will survive in any "weather."</p>

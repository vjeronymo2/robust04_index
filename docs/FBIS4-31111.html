			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "ip": "Consultations on the Import Surcharge"] </F>   [Text] Bratislava--Yesterday's consultative meeting of  economic ministers, which was held in the presence of IMF  Executive Director Willi Kiekens, discussed the "Memorandum on  Economic Policies."    At a news conference convened during the course of the  meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova announced  that matters have been closed 98 percent and that, apparently,  they would not be reopened at today's government meeting.    In the social sphere, social payments will be targeted more  specifically. The IMF mission demands that the government  expeditiously discuss the import surcharge with GATT. The  method of its introduction in March had not been consulted and  was rather unusual. Moreover, there have been several changes  compared with the version approved last summer.    In the memorandum, the government takes upon itself certain  obligations concerning the economic development in 1995. The  rate of inflation should be kept at 8 percent, but it could be  slightly higher following price increases for electricity, heat,  and gas. The government's intention is to keep a single-digit  rate of inflation. The state budget deficit should be under 3  percent of the gross domestic product [GDP], which is 1 percent  less than anticipated this year. Following the zero growth of  the GDP projected for this year, the GDP should grow 2 percent  next year. Brigita Schmognerova said that the 1995 targets  should serve as an important signal for domestic and foreign  investors.    The continued provision of tax relief and tax holidays is  being reconsidered. They will most likely be kept this year but  should be abolished next year in the interest of the creation of  a consistent environment. The need is also becoming apparent to  abolish tax relief for purchases of State Treasury bills and  other securities because these types of securities enjoy a  preferred standing on the capital market. The effects of wage  regulation, which should apply to loss-making companies and  designated sectors, will be analyzed at the end of the year and,  on the basis of this analysis, the continuation of wage  regulation in 1995 will be considered. The intentions in the  sphere of privatization are formulated quite specifically. The  basic intention is to speed up the process, a fact that the IMF  and the World Bank assess very positively. The government  undertakes to deal more vigorously with the financial situation  in the company sector and in commercial banks. This will  involve mutually harmonized measures aimed at reducing  interenterprise indebtedness and tackling bad loans and parallel  activities by the European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development and PHARE [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland  and Hungary].    Jozef Trojak, state secretary at the Ministry of Finance,  provided information on debt servicing. This year, the state  budget will have to spend 23 billion Slovak korunas [Sk] on the  repayment of the principal and interest (of which the Slovak  National Bank [NBS] will pay Sk12 billion); next year, debt  servicing will increase to Sk40 billion (of which Sk9.6 billion  will come from the NBS). This growth forces us to mobilize the  generation of resources. A burden from the past is the debt of  Sk54 billion resulting from the division of the debts of the  federal budget. It is expected that, as in the Czech Republic,  resources from the National Property Fund will be used to cover  this debt.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Bozidar Andrejic Belgrade dispatch: "Yugoslavia Will </F> Introduce Visas for Citizens of Slovakia"]    [Excerpt] The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] will  introduce a visa requirement for citizens of the Slovak Republic  with effect from 17 May 1994. As we learned from the FRY  Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this is a reciprocal measure of the  Yugoslav side, which comes in response to the recent  cancellation by the Slovak Government of the bilateral treaty on  the abolition of visas.    The decision by the government in Bratislava, made about 20  days ago, did not specify when the new visa regime would be  introduced. However, it transpires from information we obtained  at the FRY Ministry of Foreign Affairs that Yugoslavs who travel  to Slovakia after 17 May will have to furnish their travel  documents with a Slovak visa. The explanation granted to the  PRAVDA correspondent at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in  Belgrade states that the Slovak Government's decision "is an  expression of its assessment and needs, the causes and motives  of which we do not wish to analyze. However, for objective  reasons, this act of the Slovak side definitely does not  contribute to the bilateral wish to further expand relations  between the two countries' citizens."

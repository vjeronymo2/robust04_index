			<p>BFN     [Text] Flight Control Center, 26 Apr -- The flight of the  orbiting Mir station, manned by cosmonauts Viktor Afanasyev,  Yuriy Usachev, and Valeriy Polyakov, is continuing.    During the last two days the scientific section of the  crew's  program has included astrophysical and technical experiments, as  well as medical check-ups.    X-rays and gamma-radiation of extraterrestrial origin was  measured by means of instruments mounted on the outside of the  space station. Experiments to evaluate the condition of  radioelectronic equipment, which has been exposed to the  conditions of open space for a long time, were also carried out.    The cosmonauts underwent routine medical checks, including  clinical analysis of blood samples.

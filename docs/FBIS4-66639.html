			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Mr. Chavan Talks Tough"] </F>   [Text] Mr. S.B. Chavan's broadside against the United  States in the Lok Sabha, which paid little heed to diplomatic  niceties, marks a new assertiveness in India's Kashmir policy.  But it also points to the lamentable gulf that seems to separate  India from America these days. By charging the U.S. with seeking  gains for itself in Kashmir, the home minister seems to have  virtually accused it of harbouring covetous designs on Indian  territory. Even otherwise, the tone of his utterances and the  fact that they follow the parliamentary resolution, reaffirming  India's determination to maintain its sovereignty over the  state, ought to send an unequivocal message to whoever has been  taking an interest in the matter. The opposition, of course,  cannot be faulted for criticising the government's handling of  the state's affairs, given the prevailing lawlessness there and  a feeling that other countries were being too casual about  India's concerns. Indeed, given the peculiar circumstances in  Kashmir at present, Parliament is, in a sense, its custodian.  Fortunately, after a shaky beginning, the official policy seems  to have been fleshed out with the governor, Gen. K.V. Krishna  Rao, in command in Srinagar and the home minister spelling out  the government's position with uncommon vigour in New Delhi. In  advance of the outcome of the UNHRC [United Nations Human Rights  Commission] in Geneva, the combative home minister has also  given short shrift to charges of human rights violations by  India in Kashmir. There is little doubt, therefore, that the  situation is far clearer than it used to be not long ago.    While the home minister's remarks were not always taken all  that seriously in the past, his latest observations on the U.S.  and Pakistan undoubtedly represent a new and  carefully-structured position of the government. The latter  apparently wants to make it quite clear, in the light of various  suggestions emanating from Washington, that New Delhi will take  serious exception to measures that seek to question India's  sovereign rights over Kashmir. Perhaps the forthcoming visit of  the top American official dealing with South Asia, Ms. Robin  Raphel, lent an edge to Mr. Chavan's comments. Unlike some  people, Mr. Chavan has not shied away from charging that Ms.  Raphel's statement, questioning the accession of Kashmir to the  Indian Union, had the sanction of the U.S. President, Mr. Bill  Clinton. The Indian officials dealing with the U.S., who have  been trying to keep the relations between the two countries on  an even keel despite the severe buffeting they have received,  may detect a positive element in Mr. Chavan's observation that  India must "find out what exactly are the intentions of the U.S.  government". But, as home minister, Mr. Chavan has also to deal  with the seamier side of international politics, namely,  espionage, cross-border sabotage and proxy wars. So it is not  surprising, especially in the context of Kashmir, that his  remarks were sharp, without any mitigating element one normally  expects in any reference to a country with which there is no  direct confrontation.</p>

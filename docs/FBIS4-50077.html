			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Beijing, 12 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- At the  press conference held this afternoon, Chinese Foreign Ministry  spokesman Wu Jianmin said that China welcomes Mr. Appleyard as  the new British ambassador to China.    Wu said that Ambassador McLaren has been in China for nearly  three years and will retire soon. We wish him good luck and  good health after his retirement.    Wu continued that despite the breakdown of the Sino-British  talks on arrangements for Hong Kong's 1994-95 elections, the  Chinese side, proceeding from the livelihood and economy of Hong  Kong, is still willing to cooperate with the British side. Of  course, whether cooperation between the two sides is smooth  depends on the British side. [passage omitted]</p>

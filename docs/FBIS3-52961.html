First, the House reviewed the minutes of its last session,  and approved them after correcting some paragraphs. Then, it  listened to a letter addressed to the brother speaker from the  brother prime minister. The letter contains an apology for the  government's failure to report to the House this morning,  Monday, 10 January 1994, corresponding to 28 Rajab 1414 Hegira,  as it should have done according to a House decision approved in  a session held on Wednesday, 5 January 1994. According to the  letter, the brother prime minister is currently indisposed.    Following a detailed discussion of the letter sent by Prime  Minister brother Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the House  accepted this excuse, with the understanding that the House can  still summon the government and that a new date will be set by  the House to hold a general debate on the government's policy  statement and the House's statement on it in an attempt to learn  the extent and level of implementation of what was mentioned in  the policy statement.    The House also issued the following decisions:    1. The brother prime minister, deputy prime ministers, and  all cabinet members can dedicate their time to their missions,  powers, and specialities which are constitutionally and legally  determined. However, they should not engage in the political  forces' dialogue committee at the expense of their  responsibilities and executive work. This is because such  engagement will obstruct the interests of both the public and  the state's official institutions.    2. The House endorsed the government's order to all the  officials and employees of the state's administrative bodies,  institutions, and organs to proceed with their own tasks,  according to one's field of specialization and work. It also  endorsed the principle of awards and punishments in this regard  without leniency or favoritism.    3. The government needs to subsidize the following basic  food commodities: Wheat, rice, flour, and oils, including  edible fat, as well as sugar, children's milk, and medicines.  The official prices should be shown on these commodities  through Yemen. Moreover, there should be supervision of prices  to know the extent of abidance by the official prices which are  set by the state, represented by the Ministry of Supply and  Trade. Legal measures have to be taken against those who  violate the official price list for these commodities which are  necessary for the living of the public.    The House will resume work tomorrow, Tuesday, morning, God  willing.</p>

			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / OECD warning on interest rates: Paris body says rate adjustments must track the speed of economic growth Interest rates will need to rise in most countries in the industrialised world over the next few years, as economic growth spreads, the OECD said yesterday. However, rates are unlikely to rise as high as they have in previous economic upturns, and inflation across most of the OECD area is likely to remain subdued, the OECD said in its latest half yearly outlook. But the Paris-based body issued a note of warning about the US economy. In spite of the recent rise in US interest rates it remained unclear whether this monetary tightening so far was sufficient to prevent inflationary pressures from souring the recovery, the OECD said. With growth now spreading to all regions of the industrialised world, the OECD revised upwards its forecast for the expansion in gross domestic product for the second time this year. The 25 OECD economies are now expected to grow on average by 2.8 per cent this year, and by 3 per cent next year. The OECD's last half-yearly report forecast growth of only 2.6 per cent this year. The US remains at the forefront of this surge, though expansion should slow sharply in the next two years. However, Canada and the UK are forecast to see the second highest rate of growth of the seven largest OECD countries next year, with GDP expected to expand by 4.2 and 3.4 per cent respectively. Continental Europe is also expected to see accelerating rates of growth next year, although the growth rate in Germany is not expected to rise above 3 per cent until 1996. Meanwhile, Ireland is expected to see the fastest growth of any OECD country, with 5 per cent growth forecast this year and next. Inflation is expected to remain well below the growth rate in most regions. Excluding Turkey, which has an unusually high inflation rate, average annual inflation in the OECD countries is expected to be only 2.3 per cent next year. But in spite of this optimistic outlook, the OECD warns that accelerating growth means that governments must soon raise interest rates in most countries. The most challenging situation currently exists in the US, where strong growth over the last four years is estimated to have eroded all the spare capacity. Although the US government has already raised interest rates, the report notes that it 'remains unclear' whether they have been sufficient to prevent the economy from overheating in the coming years and sliding back into recession. The OECD forecasts that short-term interest rates in the US will rise to 6.7 per cent by the start of 1996, and 6.9 per cent in 1996. Although this implies that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy quite rapidly next year, Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, chief economist at the OECD, yesterday pointed out that this rise was still likely to leave rates well below their peaks in previous upturns. In the UK, Australia and New Zealand, the OECD argues that steady recent growth has created a 'case for continuing with gradual monetary tightening'. In continental Europe, German interest rates are expected to remain unchanged in the near future, although the OECD forecasts that short-term interest rates will rise to 5.6 per cent in 1996. In Ireland, the Nordic countries and some other European countries interest rates may also need to be raised soon if conditions deteriorate, the report says. The only exception to this upward trend in interest rates is Japan. Although the OECD predicts that domestic demand will grow faster in Japan than most other regions in the next year, the 'appropriate time for moving rates to an upward path appears to be some way off', it says. One country where short-term interest rates are expected to remain particularly high over the next two years, however, is Italy. As a result of the country's soaring budget deficit, rates are expected to rise to 11.8 per cent next year. 'In the absence of further measures to cut the deficit, the process of further interest rate convergence with partner countries in Europe is likely to remain slow,' the OECD said.

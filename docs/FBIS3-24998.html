The  CNID was represented in the government by three ministers:  Yoro Diakite, in charge of mines, energy and water resources;  Amidou Diabate, minister of justice and keeper of the seals; and  Abdoulaye Diop, in charge of construction, town planning and  housing.    The Rally for Democracy and Progress, represented in the  government by Mr. Ousmane Oumarou Sidibe, minister of  employment, civil service, and labor, also resigned yesterday.    However, the two parties reaffirmed their readiness to help  solve the country's problems. But for the time being, it is not  known if the resignation of the two parties has been accepted by  new Prime Minister Ibrahim Boubacar Keita.</p>

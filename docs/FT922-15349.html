			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Jenkins named to new post of Fox chairman MR Michael Jenkins, chief executive of the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) since its inception in 1981, is to take up a new position as non-executive chairman of the London Futures and Options Exchange (Fox), the troubled commodity futures exchange. Mr Jenkins was one of the driving forces behind Liffe's long-awaited merger with the London Traded Options Market recently. With the completion of the merger, which had been dogged by disagreements, and Liffe's move to new premises, Mr Jenkins felt he 'needed a change'. Although it is not a full-time job, his new post is unlikely to prove more tranquil. The London Fox was thrown into disarray last autumn by revelations that the exchange had artificially boosted trading volume in some contracts. Mr Andrew Large, who temporarily took over as chairman in the wake of the scandal, is taking up the chairmanship of the Securities and Investments Board on June 1. Mr Jenkins is to join the Fox board immediately and will become chairman shortly before Mr Large's departure. However, Mr Jenkins will remain chief executive of Liffe until his 60th birthday in October. A small group of Liffe board members has been given the task of finding a successor, whose most difficult challenge will be to revive the UK equity options market following the merger with LTOM. The Fox board will now focus on the search for a new chief executive, a position held on a temporary basis by Mr Phillip Thorpe. An internal review of the exchange's business is currently in progress. The exchange lost some ground to New York following the scandal. Since then, the exchange's policy has been to concentrate on core products in soft commodities such as cocoa and sugar contracts. This emphasis on soft commodities is expected to continue under the new leadership. 'There is room for a soft commodities exchange in Europe, and Fox is the only candidate,' said Mr Jenkins. The property futures contract at the centre of the rigging scandal may yet be revived by Liffe. Liffe is currently in discussions with a group of property market participants to decide whether the contract is viable. However, speculation that Mr Jenkins' appointment suggested that Liffe and Fox would ultimately link was rejected by both exchanges. Liffe has announced a further rights issue designed to increase the number of trading permits available for dealing in the exchange's futures contracts. The shortage of trading permits has been exacerbated by growing activity this year, and Liffe's move to its new Cannon Bridge headquarters at the start of the year has provided more room for new traders. The exchange is to issue 466 E shares, which will authorise trading in mainly non-sterling interest rate products. The aim is to free up existing A shares for use in trading sterling products. The new permits are expected to be available before the launch in May of the exchange's three-month Eurolira contract, for which a designated broker system has now been put in place.</p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> BOND SET AT $1 MILLION FOR AIDE OF NORIEGA, MONEY LAUNDRY PILOT  </P> <P> A federal magistrate set $1-million bond for a co-defendant of deposed  Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega today and attorneys huddled for discussions  about Noriega's detention in the courthouse basement.  </P> <P> U.S. Magistrate Peter Palermo set the $1 million bail for Daniel Miranda, who  is charged with flying from Ft.  </P> <P> Lauderdale to Panama with $800,000 in laundered drug money. But prosecutors  appealed the bail, meaning that Miranda, 36, could not immediately be released.  </P> <P> Miranda's attorney, Michael O'Kane was late to court because he was attacked  near his home by a masked man with a foot-long crowbar. Police have a suspected  assailant under arrest.  </P> <P> O'Kane, his head bandaged but still bleeding when he arrived in court, said his  attacker offered to tell who sent him only if assault charges were dropped, but  the attorney said he does not plan to drop the charges.  </P> <P> O'Kane's report of the attack prompted federal marshals to increase security  for Palermo.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Ion Iliescu by LE FIGARO reporter </F> Jean Mirot; place and date not given]    [Text] [Mirot] Thank you, Mr. President, for granting me  some moments of your precious time. It was very important for  LE FIGARO to interview you before you arrived in Paris, to  discuss a number of topical issues with you. I am very  impressed that you have accepted -- which to my mind is a sign  of confidence -- that this interview should take place in the  form of a conversation, which will be more interesting for our  readers than mere answers often formulated in formal and dull  words. So, once more, I feel very honored and, at the same  time, also much indebted to you. Of course, I would like to ask  you some questions. I think that they have already sent you a  list of them.    My first question refers to a question that crops up in the  heads of the French people, who saw the Romanian revolution from  a great distance and got a tragic impression, and who today  wonder whether it was actually a real revolution and not merely  a case of certain people changing offices.    I will entrust you with a personal experience: I have not  been to Romania since 1986; yesterday I had the occasion to meet  with some fellow journalists and I have to tell you that the  image that I gained about the freedom of press here, to my mind,  represents the sign of a genuine democracy; that is what it all  boils down to. However, it is also true that, in the eyes of the  French, Romania to a certain extent continues to be an enigma.  Has a revolution taken place? Could the former communist  leaders really become today's democrats?    [Iliescu] What is revolution? It means a radical change in  social life. Here we should not advance subjective judgments,  but rather look at the facts as they are and make an objective  analysis of the real facts.    I believe that there are two fundamental elements that  determine whether or not a movement is a revolution. First, the  participation of the population in bringing about the change.  In Romania, it was a genuine popular movement, it was a popular  explosion. Of course, one can discuss the violent nature of the  Romanian revolution as compared with all the changes that  occurred in the other countries in Eastern Europe. What was the  origin of its violent nature? This was determined by the very  nature of the regime, of the old system, which made it  impossible to discuss even a few possible changes, as was the  case in the Soviet Union under Gorbachev and his "perestroyka."  To what extent "perestroyka" really led to changes is a  different matter. But many changes occurred all over Europe and  even in the Soviet Union. However, those were changes confined  to the system.    In Hungary they begin to prepare the changes while still  under the Soviet occupation. During the Kadar regime there was  an opening toward a market economy. In Czechoslovakia there was  an inner process for a generally more balanced society, because  that was one of the most developed countries in that part of  Europe and, before the war, anywhere in Europe. This was so  because Czechia used to be the industrial center of the former  Austro-Hungarian Empire and between the two world wars in terms  of its general economic and industrial level Czechoslovakia was  ahead of France, Belgium, and Germany. This conferred a certain  kind of balance to its development even under the communist  regime, and it also led to the Czechoslovak revolution, defined  as the "velvet revolution."    In Romania such a thing was not possible. There used to be  an extremely rigid system, which made any changes from the  inside impossible, and which accumulated very grave tensions in  the economy, social life, and in one's ability to express  oneself. You said that you last visited Romania in 1986. You  know very well that the people used to be suffocated. There was  no way in which they could freely express themselves. What a  pity, because in the 1960's Romania had been among the vanguard.  The first step came in 1958 with the pullout of the Soviet  troops. I believe that it was a success of the then political  leadership of Romania, which in subsequent years created the  alteration in the political orientation of the country.    In the years of 1963-1964 the well known dispute took place  between Romania and the Soviet Union in connection with  Khrushchev's plan to integrate the economies of the satellite  countries within the economy of the USSR. In 1964 an official  declaration was issued against such dominating tendencies of the  USSR. Thus, all these things contributed to certain alterations  in the political thinking and, generally speaking, in the  political climate in our country. During this period the release  of all political prisoners took place, as well as an  intellectual and cultural opening up, an opening up toward  Western Europe, and an opening up in technology, achieved  through numerous accords and acts of scientific, technological,  and industrial cooperation. They began with Renault, then with  Citroen, and then the helicopters. There was a certain kind of  penetration of modern technology and numerous attempts were made  to modernize the economy.    In 1967 a discussion even took place related to the need  for our orientation toward the market economy within the  framework of a "socialist-type" economy, as they used to term it  in those days. But a fundamental discussion did take place in  connection with this issue. At that time it was solely the  Romanians and the Czechs who were openly discussing the  objective need for changing the way in which the national  economy was being run. There were discussions on issues  connected with modern management. In economics and social life  a special school was set up to train management. Informatics  was being promoted, Romania being among the vanguard in that  trend. Cooperation was initiated with the French for the  production of Romanian-made Felix-type computers, the first of  this type of computer, and for the assimilation, in general  terms, of this kind of technology. All this means that there  was an opening up in the 1960's, which Ceausescu managed to  crush after 1971 and especially in the 1980's. Thus, it was the  harsh nature of this regime that determined the change in  Romania, with its violent popular explosion as a consequence of  the very grave internal tensions within society, to which one  can add the influence of the movements that had already begun in  neighboring countries. This is one of the distinctive features.    Here is the second: A popular movement could have taken  place, it is true, without bringing about any changes  whatsoever, as you said. A few individuals could have taken  over the leadership of the country and everything would have  stayed the same. But is this the case here? An objective  analysis, rather than a subjective one, has to be done of what  has happened in Romania over the past four years. One can also  assess these things by relating to the manifesto of the Romanian  revolution, to the 10 points of the Proclamation that I read out  on television in front of the entire society, and which found  unanimous support. One would find that all those points have  been put into practice and have been included in the new  Constitution of the country. In everyday life, as you said,  there is total liberation, freedom of expression, organization,  and assembly, new parties have emerged, and there is the idea of  the multi-party system, in which our political life, generally,  has been conceived. We even have 200 registered parties. Over  90 parties... [punctuation as published]    [Mirot] This is an aspect pertaining to the Latin character:  Like France, politics is also considered a sport and an art.    [Iliescu] But it is also an objective aspect. After quite a  long period of suffocation, people wanted to manifest their  diversity. I consider this an objective phenomenon. It is a  natural reaction. Human society is an entity consisting of  diversity, even personal ones; there are about 6 billion of us  living on this planet, that is, about 6 billion different  personalities. To suffocate them is stupidity. Therefore, the  normal reaction of the people was to express this diversity of  theirs -- hence the explosion in the number of parties and  newspapers.    [Mirot] Exactly as in France after its liberation.    [Iliescu] It is a general phenomenon. After this, I believe  we took very great steps toward structuring a law-governed  state. Immediately after the revolution, within the first month,  there were already 30 parties. We set up a kind of a  provisional parliament, the Provisional National Unity Council  [CPUN]. We discussed and passed an electoral law, which also  included certain constitutional principles, because we had  abolished the old constitution. Then, in May 1990, the first  elections took place for Parliament, which also had the role of  a constituent assembly.    Our first task was the drafting of a constitution. A modern  and democratic constitution was devised. This was a democratic  process in itself, as it was done on the basis of general  consultations -- we organized a commission of deputies,  senators, and experts in constitutional law; three months' work  was spent just on research on our national experience, studying  all the constitutions that we ever had, contemporary  legislation, and the most characteristic, the most significant  constitutions existing in the world; a great number of  discussions and consultations with experts took place; in  Bucharest they organized an international seminar on current  tendencies in the domain of constitutional rights. On this  basis the first draft of the constitution was drawn up. It was  then published and discussed for two months; following this,  over four months, Parliament discussed it point by point,  article by article, and about 1,000 amendments were made. A new  draft was then drawn up, which incorporated all these  amendments. This again was followed by two and a half months of  debates, discussing even details of the way in which it was  formulated. This was followed by a vote and a nation- wide  referendum for the adoption of the Constitution. All this means  that we have a Constitution that is the expression of a  democratic process and that expresses, by its contents, our  lining up with the most modern tendencies in the life of  democratic states. On the basis of this Constitution local and  national elections were held in 1992.    This means that we have gone through a number of radical  changes in the last four years and have restructured the state  in all its components, proceeding from the principle of the  separation of powers in the state. In this respect, we set up  new institutions on the basis of the new Constitution. This has  been done on the political plane.    On the economic plane, an instinctive tendency to destroy  the  centralized state system that coordinated the entire national  economy has been manifest. The first months were characterized  by a general dismantling of these centralized structures,  something that obviously had negative consequences as well,  since major disruptions occurred everywhere, which cost us quit  a lot. However, that was a reaction to the very centralized  system of our national economy. A decisive turn was taken  toward promoting a profound economic reform and the transition  from a supercentralized economy, with its own structures,  mechanisms, legislation, and institutional forms, to a market  economy. However, the economy and economic system contain  greater inertia than the political system and this is the most  difficult sphere for all of us. We have made many changes and  have created a new economic framework. We worked out new  legislation; I believe that we have more than 150 laws on the  economic changes. Nevertheless, there are still many things  still to be done.    We took steps to liberalize prices, foreign trade, and trade  in general. We took steps to promote privatization and  encouraged investment from abroad. We took steps to liberalize  the national currency -- total liberalization will follow  shortly -- but it all takes time. On the other hand, all these  abrupt changes have led to some very serious internal  disruptions, to which one should add foreign international  factors, such as the dismantling of CEMA [Council for mutual  Economic Assistance] and the disappearance of our traditional  markets, partners, and sources of energy and raw materials.    It is obvious that this has had a directly negative effect,  particularly on industrial production. We are currently working  at half capacity in industry. Then there followed the Gulf  crisis, the embargo against Yugoslavia, and the world and  European recession, all of which are influencing this process.  Hence, this decrease in production, to which one should add  that we were confronted with a very tough drought for three  years and with the dismantlement of the agricultural cooperative  farms -- that was another reaction to an objective situation,  namely the state's brutal interference in the life of the  cooperative farms, which led to a reaction against them. But  these structures have nothing to do with communist structures,  despite the fact that there are even some primitive slogans  claiming that they are communist structures.    Cooperatives have existed for thousands of years in all  countries with agricultural traditions. The cooperative  movement is very strong in France, Italy, and other European  countries. On the other hand, you have the people's normal  reaction against the cooperatives, which were looked upon as  state structures. On the other hand, there were political  forces which made a lot of hullabaloo about this problem of the  "old structures." However, this cost us, since the cooperatives  were dismantled. We worked out a Land Law, but we could have  preserved the extant organizational and management structures.  You see, there is this confusion between the ownership  structure and management, that is, the administration of  agricultural fields. We have abolished all this, with the end  result that we now have more than 5 million owners of 9 million  hectares, which means an exaggerated fragmentation of the land,  with all its implications for the activity in agriculture and  the possibility of using mechanization, chemicalization, and  technologies.    [Mirot] Please tell us something about the belated process  of privatization, where it seems that you have made rather slow  progress.    [Iliescu] First of all, let us wind up the first question.  From a popular point of view, all this was a characteristic  feature of the Romanian movement and the Romanian revolution.  As far as changes are concerned, profound modifications took  place, which transformed the physiognomy of Romanian society.  Therefore, I believe that the two basic requirements for  determining the nature of a revolution have been met; any other  arguments are but slogans, politicking, and political struggle.  Regarding political maneuvers, Iliescu is a "nobody," since for  20 years I have been removed from any political decision-taking  process. I came into conflict with Nicolae Ceausescu in 1971,  after his visit to Asian countries, particularly Korea. So,  anything else is nothing but concoction and slogans.    When one examines social phenomena, one should look at  things  from an objective angle, without hidden political and  ideological motives and without ideological prejudices in this  respect.    [Mirot] What about the slow pace of privatization, since I  do not want to call it a failure...    [Iliescu] I do not think one can speak of a slow pace.  There are two aspects involved here: the private sector and  the privatization of large state-owned companies.    I believe a great deal has been done with respect to  privatization and the sustaining of the private sector.  Immediately after the revolution, the CPUN passed a law, a  law-decree, on the sustaining of the private sector of our  economy. Currently there are half a million various private  companies, which consist of one individual or one family, or  they are small or medium-size companies. The opening was made  especially in commerce. They are criticizing the somewhat  oriental aspect of the small boutiques, the small booths in  which things are sold. An explosion is taking place in this  field. One could also regard it as a historic phenomenon, in  the sense that capitalism is being rebuilt, and capital is being  accumulated in the commercial sector; a small-scale initiative  has manifested itself especially in the domain of commerce and  services, but at the same time small and even medium-size  companies have begun to emerge in industry, especially in the  processing of agricultural products and food. Thus, there are  currently about 500,000 such enterprises, with over 2 million  employees, which represents a third of the labor force in our  economy. So it is a sector that has become quite active and  important. Currently these enterprises are also very active in  the domain of exports.    But there is a second aspect as well: the privatization of  the state-owned companies. At the end of the first year after  the revolution a law was passed on the reorganization of the  former state-owned companies and two different sectors were  established: public corporations and commercial companies -- we  used the French model. The public corporations relate to the  domain of infrastructure, and I think they will persist there  for a long time -- in energy, the mining sector, railroads, and  telecommunications. Then there is the industrial sector, with  over 6,000 state-owned companies, among which are the great  enterprises in the iron and steel industry, the oil processing  industry, and so on. They are organized in the form of  autonomous commercial companies. They are not led by ministries  or other central bodies as they used to be; they will be  subjected to the "great privatization." A law was passed on the  privatization of those 6,000 companies and on the method that  should be used to do it. The most difficult problem in the  selling of those companies is the lack of capital. On the other  hand, we thought of a kind of a social compensation, as all  those enterprises have been built over the past 40 years by the  efforts of the entire nation, of the people. Then Parliament  included a stipulation in the law that says that 30 percent of  social capital is to be distributed free among adult citizens  who are over 18, and so ownership certificates have been  distributed among all the citizens. Now we are all holders of  such ownership certificates, which will have to be turned into  shares as the privatization process goes ahead.    Two institutions have been set up: One is the State Property  Fund, controlled by Parliament, which is managing the remaining  70 percent of the social capital of those enterprises, and which  also has to supervise the way in which those enterprises are  being managed; the second is the Private Property Fund, which is  managing the ownership certificates and the process of turning  them into shares. These are the principal institutions dealing  with the process of privatization. In addition to these, a  government National Privatization Agency has also been set up,  which in the beginning took care of the issue of these ownership  certificates and their distribution among the citizens, and  organized the first privatization, as a test, in the case of 30  enterprises, until the State Property Fund was set up, which  took over from it, and so far it has privatized 450 companies.  This means that out of those 6,000 enterprises 450 have already  been privatized. However, as I have already said, the principal  difficulty is the lack of capital.    We are hoping for two things. First, a solution is currently  being sought to boost the process of turning the ownership  certificates into shares in the privatization of 2,000  enterprises. Second, we have the private sector that I already  mentioned and to a certain extent capital has already  accumulated there, so people might use it for that purpose.    The banking sector has been reorganized. In the old system  we merely had four commercial banks; under the circumstances of  a state-planned system, the banking system plays quite a limited  role. But now, after the explosion of the number of commercial  and economic companies, banking operations have also expanded;  currently there are 25 commercial banks and they still cannot  cope with the demand for banking operations. And there is  another difficulty, too, namely: the lack of capital of the  banks on the one hand, and, on the other, the lack of capital of  the enterprises. The enterprises have to resort to bank loans.  The banks do not have the necessary resources, which results in  a hindering, to a certain extent, of the whole process. Our  case is different from that of Germany, where the eastern  laender are being economically integrated...    [Mirot] With the help of West Germany...    [Iliescu] Yes, annually they inject $120 billion into that  region. We requested a mere $1-billion loan from the Group of  24; they discussed it for over two years, and finally we were  granted just half of this. Now we are again holding talks with  the IMF and the Group of 24. We are holding talks related to  certain preconditions; over the whole past year there was  nothing but negotiations. We lack support from abroad. Our  domestic resources have dropped together with a drop in  production. Under the all these negative international  circumstances, our foreign trade has also dropped. Our foreign  trade has still not managed to become a source of hard currency;  on the contrary, until now, over the past four years, our  foreign trade balance has been continuously in the red. This  means that we lack the necessary hard currency to sustain our  national currency. The drop in production, the drop in the  value of our national currency, all of this has acted to fuel  inflation, and inflation and unemployment are two of the most  serious social phenomena.    [Mirot] Do you have a feeling that Western Europe has tended  more toward Central Europe while setting you somewhat aside? Do  you believe that you have really been invited to join the  European Economic Community, or rather that you are being  handled a little...    [Iliescu] In this connection I believe that everyone is  dissatisfied, and not just us; even the Czechs are, although  their situation is the best among all the other countries in the  transition period -- they have a favorable economic situation, a  hard currency surplus of $5 billion in their national bank,  their foreign trade earns about $2 billion to $2.5 billion each  year, which has created the conditions to have a stable national  currency and keep inflation under control and unemployment low,  at about 2-3 percent -- and yet even they are dissatisfied with  the circumstances under which they have to cooperate with the  West.    The Hungarians and the Poles have no major reasons to be  dissatisfied, since four years ago their national debt was  already very large. Meanwhile they have doubled their debt,  which means that they had access to already open financial  sources, credits at commercial banks, and so they could double  their foreign debt. You must remember that two years ago Mr.  Walesa went on a marathon tour to obtain the rescheduling of  their debt, and he managed to obtain $8 billion and a certain  reduction of the debt.    Romania has obtained nothing of this kind. So we have  reasons not to be satisfied. We cannot reproach anyone with  anything, because in the field of economics there is no such  thing as human generosity; those are merely phrases used by  politicians. In economics there is no criteria other than that  of interest. We do not want disinterested assistance; however,  we wish a stance of normal partnership, lacking all ideological  bias, because all the countries of Central and Eastern Europe  are going through the same process, which is a normal process of  contemporary society and of our continent. It lies in the  interest of all European countries that this general integration  process should be facilitated within the framework of a joint  process; because now there is not just a crisis among these  countries. This is a period of general crisis in the European  economy and the world economy, and owing to this, only  integration achieved on the basis of a partnership among equals  can lead to us jointly solving the problems facing all the  countries. Even the developed countries have their own problems  -- unemployment, with all its very serious social consequences  -- but also entirely positive phenomena, that is, technological  progress. However, technological progress that has very much  penetrated the service sector has eliminated a great deal of the  labor force from commerce and services of all kinds. Services  represented the best alternative and chance for the Western  European economies after the war. Under the circumstances of  technological progress, which made many people superfluous in  agriculture and industry, the third sector [services]  represented the sole chance; now the third sector has been  affected. This why even in the case of the developed countries,  the sole chance is represented by integration, I mean normal  integration without protectionism, without the arrogant stance  adopted by the rich with respect to the poor, of the strong with  respect to the weak, and without ideological bias, but rather by  establishing the framework for a normal partnership.    [Mirot] Before approaching foreign policy, let us exchange a  few words about domestic policy. According to an IRSOP  [Romanian Institute for Public Opinion Polling] poll, the  opposition is rated as having 43 percent support, I believe.  However, one should not rely too much on opinion polls as they  are nothing but a snapshot. We could ask ourselves the following  question: Does this mean that early elections will take place?  Is this a fact that could persuade you to try and set up a  coalition government -- recently you had contacts with certain  parties -- or would you rather continue with the current formula  until the end of your mandate in 1996?    [Iliescu] To my mind both alternatives are acceptable.  Regardless of the circumstances and the evolution of the balance  of forces in our society, all governments, regardless of whom  they consist of, will have to solve the same problems. They are  problems related to Romania's transition, the continuation of  the process of strengthening democracy, state structures, the  efficiency of the state, and, especially, to solve the economic  problems that currently represent the key issue: the  restructuring of the economy on the basis of the laws of the  market and the restructuring of industry in connection with the  process of privatization. All these are mandatory elements for  any government.    Of course, nuances do exist, and there are differences  between ways in which these problems can be solved. However, at  the same time I believe that everything also depends on the  status of each, of each party and of each person.    One has one perspective when one belongs to the opposition  --  it is always easier to criticize and one can always reveal new  problems, concrete problems. However, the view of the people  undergoes a fundamental change whenever they change this  position. From this point of view I would prefer it if a change  took place. Even after the last elections, in which we did not  manage to have any party gain a majority in Parliament, I  addressed an appeal to all the party leaders to find a solution  or to set up a government of national unity. This was my first  proposal and it was not advanced for any demagogic purposes.    In the current difficult period, because we have lived  through the harshest years over the past three years, I believe  in the need for the unity of all political forces and for them  to assume responsibility. However, my proposal was rejected by  the leaders of a number of parties. Some of them even said, in  a cynical way, that during very difficult times it would be  extremely dangerous for them to assume the responsibility of  governing. In that case they would be better advised to let  others assume the responsibility, and, as far as they are  concerned, perhaps they should wait, criticize, and accumulate  political capital for the future. I proposed a safe coalition  in order to have a stable majority. However, owing to the  circumstances of the period, such a thing proved impossible.    I then proposed a political pact, regardless of the  government's structure, as that may change, in order to achieve  an agreement on behalf of all the parties, following the example  of Spain. I even appealed to the party leaders and distributed  among them the text of the Moncloa Pact, which was a political  pact concluded among all the political parties represented in  Spain's Parliament, comprising a rather large array, ranging  from Fraga Iribarne of the Falangists, to Santiago Carillo, the  communist leader. It had never even crossed anyone's mind that  a coalition could be established between the Falangists and the  Communists. However, they all signed the joint document, which  was an expression of a national platform and the political  pledge of all of them to ensure normal development and a normal  solution to the grave political, economic, and social problems  that the country was facing. The pact had precisely three  chapters: a political, an economic, and a social one.    I expressed that idea of mine about having to try to  establish a joint platform. We even began work on a draft for  such a platform. However, when we began approaching the concrete  problems, such as the organization of the government, of  Parliament, and so on, it became impossible to reach an  agreement. Now we are discussing those issues all over again.  In December we resumed our negotiations with all the parties  and also took up that idea again. Currently negotiations are  taking place among the parties. We will see what happens.  Anything is possible. They are even talking about early  elections, although I do not believe that there is much  enthusiasm in that direction. Everyone is talking about  elections, but, at the same time, everyone considers that no  essential changes would occur compared with the current  situation.    [Mirot] For one part of your electorate this would represent  a risk.    [Iliescu] Yes, it would be a risk. But above all, it would  not be beneficial for the country. The electoral campaign would  cause time to be wasted and it would generate general social  tension. From this point of view I believe that our politicians  are sufficiently realistic; they are talking about early  elections, but, at the same time, they also express certain  reserves.    The current government is a minority government. This  represents a difficulty. Thus, the government is compelled to  negotiate continuously with everyone on each draft law. This  process also causes tension in Parliament. Discussions are  taking place without anyone knowing what the final conclusion  will be. Probably solutions will be found that will be  extremely difficult to put into practice, but I do not think  that early elections will be held; not this year, anyway.</p>

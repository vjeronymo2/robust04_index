			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Morgan Stanley to stay in NY MORGAN STANLEY, one of New York's leading investment banks, has scrapped its plans to leave Manhattan after being offered incentives that will save it about Dollars 39.6m (Pounds 23m) in the next decade. The move underlines the growing efforts of the administration of Mr David Dinkins, New York's mayor, to persuade big companies to remain in the city. There were growing fears that a wave of departures was threatening the city's economic and employment base; the city's onerous corporate tax structure, along with high crime rates and high rental costs, have driven several big investment houses to move their back-office operations. Mr Dinkins said Morgan Stanley, which had announced plans to relocated to Connecticut, was expected to contribute nearly Dollars 911m in direct taxes to New York city and state in the next 10 years. It has been offered real estate-related tax incentives and sales tax exemptions to remain in New York.</p>

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Zimbabwe tobacco growers face crisis ZIMBABWE'S TOBACCO growers meet in Harare today at a time of deepening crisis in their industry. With a quarter of the 1993 crop having been sold on the Harare auction floors, the tobacco price is averaging 94 US cents a kilogram, down 43 per cent on last year's average and more than 70 per cent below the record USDollars 3.25 a kilogram, achieved in 1991. Last week, Mr Ian Alcock, President of the Zimbabwe Tobacco Association, which represents growers, told farmers to cut production by between 30 and 35 per cent. He said the industry should produce a 1994 crop no larger than 150m kg, compared with the 230m kg estimated for this year. The ZTA is likely to come in for sharp criticism from some growers for its failure to keep them better informed on world market trends. But the association will argue - with some justification - that the swing from a sellers market to one of overproduction and oversupply was very sudden and all other producing nations were caught out in the same way. So far this year, 55m kg of flue-cured tobacco have been sold on the auctions - 24 per cent of the forecast crop of some 225m kg. In the past prices have tended to harden markedly in July and August, when the high quality leaf comes on to the floors, but growers and merchants say this is not going to happen to anything like the same extent this year. Price forecasts for the season range between a high of USDollars 1.20 and a low of Dollars 1 a kilogram. The tobacco crisis has far-reaching implications for the economy. It means there will be negligible growth in the country's economy and exports will grow only marginally, if at all. The build-up of a tobacco stockpile of about 160m kg this year will impose new strains on the banks, which will not only have to carry tobacco growers through a second difficult season after last year's drought, but will be called upon to finance a stockpile worth more than USDollars 1.5bn. This is likely to mean that interest rates will remain high for the rest of the year, thereby exacerbating the squeeze on farm cash flows and making it difficult for tobacco growers to diversify. One forecast suggests that the tobacco sector will lose some USDollars 50m in 1993. There are no obvious diversification opportunities. Many tobacco growers will probably switch into maize, raising the spectre of a re-run of the 1980s crisis when Zimbabwe built up a massive stockpile of maize, which it could not afford to maintain and was unable to export. Maize industry experts are warning growers against this, pointing out that the maximum export market for the industry is probably in the region of 300,000 tonnes. The beef industry is in serious trouble with weak demand at home and abroad and farmers continuing to destock with serious implications for long-term production. Horticulture is constrained by high transport costs, while profitability in cotton is uninspiring. With industry leaders warning that the crisis will last for another two or three seasons, the locomotive that has driven the Zimbabwe economy for much of the past 40 years seems to have run out of steam. Perhaps even more disturbing are the signs that agriculture, as a whole, faces a difficult period over the next few years, highlighting the urgent need - from Zimbabwe's viewpoint - for an upturn in metal prices.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpt] A poll by Javier Otaegui &amp; Associates revealed  that nearly 80 percent of Buenos Aires Radical Party members  disapprove of the Olivos pact.    Meanwhile, the spokesman for the Alfonsin movement, Simon  Lazara, remarked yesterday that a meeting between the chairman  of the UCR national committee, Raul Alfonsin, and the senator  and Radical leader in the capital, Fernando de la Rua, "would be  good" for resolving the conflict among the capital's UCR  internal factions.    The poll, taken last Friday, showed that 78.9 percent of the  citizens affiliated with the UCR reject the agreement between  the PJ [Justicialist Party] and the UCR favoring amendment of  the Constitution. On the other hand, 21.1 percent support it.    Otaegui's survey consists of a sampling of 790 telephone  calls selected on the basis of social strata and districts.    The poll may possibly prove to be an encouraging precedent  for De la Rua, a staunch opponent of the pact, whose supporters  in the district promoted a referendum on that subject.  <H5>  Doors Open for Dialogue </H5>   Lazara explained that no talks have yet been held regarding  the possibility of an Alfonsin-De la Rua summmit. The spokesman  stressed: "The doors are always open for a dialogue between the  two leaders."    The presumption of a possible conclave began to be discussed  after De la Rua met with the Alfonsinist critic, Jesus Rodriguez  (of the Centennial Studies Center). That meeting came to an  abrupt end, when the possibilities of no confrontation in the  district were exhausted.    Meanwhile, next Thursday, the various metropolitan UCR  forces  will decide at the district committee meeting whether or not to  hold the referendum on the Olivos pact favoring constitutional  amendment jointly with the internal elections to determine the  Buenos Aires convention slates. The De la Rua faction has a wide  majority on the board of directors, but the question lies in  whether it will obtain the two thirds majority required to  impose its will.    The De la Rua deputy, Jorge Enrique Benedetti, told LA  NACION  yesterday: "It would be best if the Centennial group abstained  from voting against the referendum next Thursday, and, as a  democratic gesture, let the affiliate decide, as stipulated in  Articles 112 and 114 of the party's organic charter."    Deputy Federico Storani (UCR-Buenos Aires), in statements  made to the Cordoba newspaper LA VOZ DEL INTERIOR, lashed out  severely against his main internal adversary, expressing the  view that, "If the Radical Party fails in the 10 April  elections, Raul Alfonsin will pay the political price."

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- The Justice Ministry has  started an investigation into discriminatory actions against  Korean residents in Japan that have reportedly increased with  the recent focus on North Korea's suspected nuclear arms  development, ministry officials said Wednesday [8 Jun].    The actions include verbal abuse and physical harassment  such  as knifing of clothes against students of Korean schools.  Female students of schools run by the pro-Pyongyang General  Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryun) wear  traditional Korean clothing for uniforms, which could make them  a target.    At a meeting Tuesday night of the House of Representatives  Justice Committee, Yasuo Kakehi, head of the ministry's Civil  Liberties Bureau, said the ministry thinks such acts violate  human rights and is investigating them.    Justice Minister Hiroshi Nakai told the meeting that Korean  residents in Japan should have the same human rights as Japanese  nationals.</p>

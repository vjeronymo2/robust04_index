			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The price difference between block and barrel cheese may be due to packaging and other nonmilk factors. However, the protein price must be established at a level that best meets the needs of all concerned. The block cheese price should be more effective than the barrel price in establishing a sufficiently high protein price to accomplish the goal of encouraging producers to produce protein without having a detrimental impact on handlers, and does result in a narrower range of manufacturing margins for cheese.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Over the period January 1992 through September 1993, a protein price computed by multiplying the block price by 1.32 would have resulted in an average protein price of $1.6851 per pound. The CMPC and NCI proposals, using the barrel cheese price, would have resulted in an average protein price of $1.6337 per pound of protein over the same time period. A comparison of the net margins resulting from the recommended protein price versus the CMPC and NCI proposals shows that the slightly higher protein price and correspondingly lower other solids price recommended herein have a negligible affect on net margins. In fact, the spread between the highest and lowest cheese manufacturing margin declines slightly while the margin per pound of cheese remains virtually unchanged. At the same time, the producer is paid a higher protein price and thereby has a greater incentive to increase protein production.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B. Other Nonfat Solids <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The balance of the M-W price, after the values of protein and butterfat are removed, should be priced on the basis of ``other nonfat solids.'' The other nonfat solids price per pound will be computed by subtracting from the Class III price the sum of the butterfat price times 3.5 and the protein price times the test of the Minnesota-Wisconsin price survey milk. The result will be divided by the other nonfat solids test of the Minnesota-Wisconsin price survey milk. Because the computation of the other solids price is based on a residual value, the other solids price could be negative without further adjustments. Therefore, if computation of the other solids price results in a negative price, the protein price will be adjusted (downward) to result in a zero value for the other solids price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a residual, a NAJ witness stated, the other nonfat solids price would represent the value of lactose and ash, which are the primary constituents of the other nonfat solids, and the difference in value between a competitively set price for milk, the Minnesota-Wisconsin price, and the value of that milk based strictly on product prices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An expert witness for NAJ testified that a higher price for other solids than would be computed by using a protein price lower than that proposed by NAJ was not justified because a higher other nonfat solids price would defeat the purpose of multiple component pricing: To give producers an economic incentive to increase the protein content of their milk. The witness also explained that since the ``other nonfat solids'' consist primarily of lactose, for which there is a limited market and cheaper substitutes, there is no reason to have a high other nonfat solids price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A witness for CMPC explained that the CMPC proposal would result in a higher price for other nonfat solids than the NAJ proposal. The witness testified that reduced emphasis on the protein price and increased emphasis on the other solids price would reduce the impact of multiple component pricing on handlers and producers. The witness observed that the average difference in handlers' cost of milk between the current skim-butterfat pricing system and the CMPC proposal was less than one cent per hundredweight, while the NAJ proposal would result in a difference of slightly over three cents per hundredweight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CMPC witness pointed out that the same relationship was applicable to returns to producers. In fact, the witness stated, when comparing the effect of the current skim-butterfat pricing system on handlers' obligations with both the NAJ proposal and the CMPC proposal, there is a narrower spread from the highest difference to the lowest difference and a smaller standard deviation with the CMPC proposal than the equivalent comparisons with the NAJ proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An alternative residual price was proposed by NCI and supported by Kraft. A witness for NCI testified that instead of placing the residual value on the other nonfat solids, the residual value should be placed on the remaining pounds of fluid milk. The witness explained that this residual fluid price would be calculated by subtracting the value of 3.5 pounds of butterfat and the value of the protein based on the protein test of the milk in the Minnesota-Wisconsin price survey from the Minnesota-Wisconsin price. The resulting value would be divided by 100 minus 3.5 minus the protein test of the milk in the Minnesota-Wisconsin price survey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NCI witness testified that placing the residual value on other nonfat solids would yield an ``other nonfat solids'' price that could not be recovered in the marketplace. In addition, he stated, although the butterfat price is based on the butter market and the protein price would be based on the return to cheese manufacture, the other nonfat solids price would have no relationship to any particular established market or component. The witness also testified that since an other nonfat solids test would not be needed for the NCI proposal, administration of the pricing plan would be easier and less expensive than the other pricing proposals.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

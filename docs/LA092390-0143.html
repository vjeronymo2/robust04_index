			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HARTMAN MEETS NEW CHALLENGE IN ROYAL INVITATIONAL VICTORY;  </P> <P> CROSS-COUNTRY: CANYON SENIOR RISES TO THE OCCASION IN TRAVERSING MOORPARK  COLLEGE'S HILLY COURSE IN 15 MINUTES 11 SECONDS.  </P> <P> Dave Hartman of Canyon High recorded speedy times on relatively flat  cross-country courses the past two weeks, but Moorpark College's hilly,  three-mile course presented a tougher challenge.  </P> <P> With two sub-15 minute efforts under his belt already this season, Hartman  timed 15 minutes 11 seconds to win the large-schools race at the Royal  Invitational on Saturday.  </P> <P> The time is exceptional considering the difficulty of the course, but a lengthy  training regimen is wearing on the Cowboy senior.  </P> <P> "These hills took it out of me," Hartman said. "I've been putting in so much  mileage that I've just been real tired. I've been popping vitamin C like  crazy."  </P> <P> Hartman's fatigue became evident when he slowed to a 10-minute 8-second split  at two miles after a 4:38 first mile. But Hartman proved Sept. 8 that he can  handle a fast, early pace. At the Seaside Invitational in Ventura, he ran a  4:29 first mile en route to a 14:33 clocking.  </P> <P> Jeff Wilson of Newbury Park was second in 15:26 and Channel Islands teammates  Stewart Ellington (15:27) and Fernando Mendoza (15:54) were third and fourth.  </P> <P> Hart, which placed three runners among the top 10, defeated archrival Canyon,  66-72, for the team title despite running without Billy Dixon, who is  ineligible.  </P> <P> "We group real well. We always have," Hart Coach Gene Blankenship said. "(Gavin  Klinger) saved our butts."  </P> <P> Klinger, a freshman, finished sixth in 16:11 to lead the Indians. Keith  Grossman (16:14) and Hector Chavez (16:15) placed eighth and ninth.  </P> <P> In the girls' race, Channel Islands' Veronica Barajas challenged Jeannie  Rothman of Westlake but the Warrior senior took over with about 1 1/2 miles  remaining to win in 17:55. Barajas placed second in 18:14.  </P> <P> Rothman was trying to break the course record of 17:26 held by Agoura's Deena  Drossin but the pace dawdled early.  </P> <P> "I think if Deena had been here, I would have been closer because she really  pushes me," Rothman said.  </P> <P> Behind Barajas' second-place finish, Channel Islands won its first invitational  title, 65-67, over favored Buena. However, the Bulldogs competed without Fanya  Bryant, who is injured.  </P> <P> Fillmore placed four runners among the top seven to handily win the  small-schools boys' title with 32 points. Nordhoff (89) and Moorpark (91) were  second and third. George Barajas paced the Flashes with a 16:10 win.  </P> <P> Maribella Aparicio of Fillmore won the girls' small-schools race in 18:44 and  Nordhoff claimed the title with 39 points.  </P></p>

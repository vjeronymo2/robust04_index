			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 14 Apr (TANJUG)--The Information Service  of the Serb Republic Army's [VRS] main headquarters has said in  a statement that UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] units deployed  on Mt. Igman and Mt. Bjelasnica, after they had taken over VRS  positions on the basis of the agreement of 30 July 1993, today  withdrew to the area of Hrasnica and to Sarajevo airport as  agreed upon between the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and  the UNPROFOR command in Sarajevo.    The statement says that by withdrawing their units from  these  positions, UNPROFOR is enabling the Muslim forces that come from  Sarajevo through a tunnel under the airport to attack VRS  positions and Serb territory in Trnovo and on Rogoj, with the  objective to link Gorazde and Sarajevo.    These offensive actions--as well as those already taken from  various locations against the plateau of Nisici--are aiding the  Muslim offensive aimed at breaking up and conquering the  territory of Serb Sarajevo.    The actions coordinated between UNPROFOR and the so-called  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army are aimed at forcing an energetic  response from the VRS in the Sarajevo area, which would then be  used as a pretext for the use of NATO air force against the Serb  artillery positions around Sarajevo, which have been grouped and  placed under UNPROFOR control, the statement says.</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / International Company News: Credit Suisse says profits were lower in third period Credit Suisse, the flagship bank of the CS Holding financial services group, said its pretax profits in the third quarter were hurt by unfavourable financial market conditions and 'did not match the extremely good results' in the same period of last year. No figures were given, but the comments in a statement indicated a continuation of the trend experienced in the first half, when the bank's consolidated profits before taxes and provisions were down 27 per cent to SFr1.76bn. Moreover, there was a significant worsening of the bank's commissions business due to sluggish securities turnover. At the halfway stage, commission income was up 10 per cent, but in the third quarter there was a 'slight downturn'. Net interest income was hurt by narrower margins, especially in Switzerland, while trading income was 'lower than expected'. Credit Suisse Financial Products, the derivatives subsidiary, maintained its earnings at last year's 'healthy' level. Loan loss provisions were lower, but remained 'relatively high'. At September 30, total assets stood at SFr231.9bn, SFr317m less than at the end of 1993.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kazuhisa Ogawa, military analyst, from the </F> "Sunday Debate" column: "Theater Missile Defense Ineffective  Against North Korea"]    [Text] Reports on the Nodong-1 missile of the DPRK (North  Korea) in Japan all give the impression that this missile may  hit Japan directly any time. This is precisely a case of  "looking at the tree but losing sight of the forest," a uniquely  Japanese way of perception.    If we look at the position of North Korea in the world; that  is, the "forest" as a whole, a different vision opens before us.    Around North Korea, there is the towering presence of the  United States with its enormous military power. Russia and  China, with their impressive military power, and Japan, with its  enormous economic power, are all keeping a close watch over  North Korea.    Cruisers and frigates of the U.S. Seventh Fleet based in  Yokosuka carry a total of more than 200 Tomahawk cruise missiles  (with conventional warheads), which have 450-kg warheads with a  range of 1,300 km. They can reach the entire North Korean  territory any time.    If North Korea succeeds in attaching nuclear or chemical  warheads to Nodong-1, and decides to use them, it must be ready  to sustain total destruction.    North Korea has its reasons for developing missiles under  such circumstances. Karl Von Clausewitz, in his book "On War,"  said: "War is merely a continuation of policy implemented by  other means." North Korea follows his teaching to the letter. A  political objective is always present behind any military action.    North Korea's objective is "soft landing"; that is, the  continuation of the Kim Il-song regime. It wants the world to  guarantee democratization and economic development for North  Korea at its own pace. Thus, it is reasonable to think that  North Korea actually wants the world to stop it from developing  nuclear missiles. It calculates that economic aid will be  offered to discourage it from missile development. This  tug-of-war is expected to continue.    It is true that the Nodong-1 and the development of nuclear  weapons pose a serious threat to Japan. However, TMD [theater  missile defense] will not help at all to stop this.    How far has North Korea gone in its efforts to develop  missiles and warheads? The Nodong-1 is an improved version of  the very old short range ballistic missile "Scud," which the  former USSR started to manufacture in the 1950s. If North Korea  had no other choice but to improve on this outdated model, that  means it does not have the capability to develop modern missiles.  <H5>  Nuclear Warheads Not Probable </H5>   Since the Nodong-1 is an improved version of the Scud, its  performance is bound by the limitations of the Scud. Inferring  from Iraq's "Al Abbas," warheads of Nodong-1, with a range of  1,000 km, are probably around 150 kg in weight. Since the  amount of fuel Nodong-1 carries is also increased, at the point  liquid fuel undergoes explosive combustion, the fuel tank  becomes empty, resulting in the missile losing its balance. It  is very difficult to control this. Such is the limitation of  Nodong-1's performance.    As to warheads, even assuming that North Korea has succeeded  in developing a nuclear device, this is probably neither a bomb  nor a warhead, but something in the vicinity of a "nuclear  explosion device" about three to five tons in weight. Two to  four years is required to downsize this. North Korea hopes that  it will be stopped during this period. A similar amount of time  is necessary to acquire the technology to control chemical  warheads or to spread poisonous gas. Thus, both nuclear and  chemical warheads are quite improbable.    When a conventional warhead weighing 150 kg hits the target,  its shrapnel scatters over an area of 120 square meters at most.  In terms of cost and effect, the whole exercise is quite  meaningless.    The U.S. economic system is termed a war economic system.  The mainstays of this system, the oil and arms industries, all  rely on defense appropriations. The fatal weakness of this  economic system is that for the system to function normally, a  strategic weapons system, which has limitless possibilities for  development, has to be introduced. Since the TMD involves high  technology, it embodies limitless potentials for research and  development.    The U.S. defense research budget is around 5 trillion yen,  which is even larger than the entire Japanese defense budget.  The TMD has to be viewed in such a context. This is more an  economic issue between Japan and the United States than a  military question. Japan has to deal with the United States  with such a understanding.  <H5>  Japan Lacks a Strategic Viewpoint </H5>   It is important to stop North Korea from developing nuclear  weapons and missiles. The United States and the ROK declare  that they will always keep the door open while they apply  pressure on North Korea with economic sanctions and military  options.    The United States also professes that if North Korea  compromises it is ready any time to send in big business to work  on improving the DPRK infrastructure, and help in economic  development. It is also preparing to help North Korea convert  its nuclear power plants to light-water reactors. Japan does  not possess such a strategic viewpoint.    I believe Japan's involvement with the TMD should not go  beyond the limits of the Japan-U.S. security setup. This should  be the natural conclusion considering the TMD is an economic  issue by its very nature.</p>

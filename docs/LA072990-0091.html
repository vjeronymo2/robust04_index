			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUJIMORI TAKES OFFICE IN PERU, VOWS A REBIRTH  </P> <P> Political newcomer Alberto Fujimori took office Saturday as the 107th president  of beleaguered Peru, pledging to rebuild an economy ravaged by inflation, drugs  and guerrilla war.  </P> <P> The new president also attacked corruption in government, offered dialogue with  Marxist rebels and promised fairer treatment for the South American nation's  poor.  </P> <P> The bespectacled former college president -- an independent whose Change 90  party won an upset victory in June elections -- accepted the red-and-white sash  of office and said, "I swear by God" to try to solve the nation's problems.  </P> <P> Fujimori was celebrating his 52nd birthday on Saturday, which is also Peru's  Independence Day.  </P> <P> His comments at the ceremony in the red-carpeted, cedar-paneled House of  Representatives chamber brought cheers from lawmakers.  </P> <P> But the inauguration was marred when outgoing President Alan Garcia's farewell  speech was interrupted by hoots and insults.  </P> <P> While five visiting Latin American presidents looked on stoically, rightist  congress members stopped Garcia from beginning his speech three times by  banging their desks and jeering him.  </P> <P> Garcia has been accused of ruining the country's economy and letting corruption  run rampant.  </P> <P> Fujimori did not mention Garcia by name in his speech. But he said: "We  inherited a disaster."  </P> <P> The new leader faces daunting problems. While the illegal drug trade prospered  during the previous government, Peru's economy shrank 3%, agricultural  production fell by almost one-fifth, and inflation soared out of control, he  said.  </P> <P> Fujimori said he will actively promote exports and encourage foreign investment  in Peru by establishing a free-market economy, although he ruled out the sale  of all state enterprises, most of which he said are near collapse.  </P> <P> He announced the creation of an anti-corruption committee to investigate cases  of fraud and graft, saying: "The people of Peru elected us to . . . restore  honesty in the public administration."  </P> <P> Regarding drugs, Fujimori took a stand similar to that of President Virgilio  Barco Vargas of Colombia. Barco was on hand for the inauguration, along with  the presidents of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Venezuela.  </P> <P> Fujimori said cocaine-consuming countries are just as responsible for stopping  drug use as are South American nations that grow coca leaf and turn it into  cocaine.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 26 KYODO -- A group of Chinese  dissidents led by former student activist Wang Dan, has called  on the Chinese Government to reappraise the 1989 democracy  movement and compensate the families of the victims.    In an open letter to China's National People's Congress  [NPC]  seen by KYODO NEWS SERVICE Thursday [26 May], seven dissidents  said the movement cannot be forgotten because "we firmly believe  that the movement had an inestimable effect on pushing history  forward."    Wang was seen leaving Beijing on Tuesday with what is  believed to have been an official or police escort, a friend of  his said.    The letter openly calls on the National People's Congress,  "the nation's most powerful organ," to act on three demands  concerning the government's evaluation of the 1989 political  protests.    The first demand called for reevaluation of the protests as  a  predominantly student-led, mass patriotic movement and asks that  the movement's principles of "peace, reason and nonviolence" be  recognized by the government.    "We believe that the government's determination of the event  as `turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion' is unfair and  should be reappraised at an early date," it said.    The second demand calls for the freeing of "all those  arrested in connection with the `June 4' incident."    Finally the letter calls for "comfort and compensation to  the  bereaved families who lost family members because of `June 4"'  and the promise to aid those released from jail who have  problems reentering society.    Five years ago on June 3-4, 1989, the People's Liberation  Army, under government orders, marched on the citizens of  Beijing who had come out in support of student protests calling  for greater democracy and an end to official corruption.    The government has yet to officially release the numbers of  soldiers and citizens killed, or their names, during the period  of military intervention.    Estimates range from the hundreds to tens of thousands as  tanks, supported by ground troops, rolled over and shot at  unarmed citizens as they moved towards Tiananmen Square in the  city center.    The letter was signed by four former student leaders who  were  once on the list of "21 most-wanted students" and three others,  including Li Hai, a signatory of the "peace charter" group of  labor dissidents.    "Like the government, we hope for a stable social  environment. To solve the `June 4' problem and untie the `knot'  in the hearts of the people is not only beneficial to appeasing  social contradictions...but will also encourage social  stability," it said.</p>

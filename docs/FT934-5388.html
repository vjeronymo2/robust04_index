			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Dalgety buys petfood arm of BP for Pounds 42m Dalgety, the food and agricultural supplies group, yesterday took its plans to become a leader in European petfood a stage further by buying Paragon Petcare from British Petroleum for Pounds 42m cash. Paragon, which earned a Pounds 3m operating profit on sales of Pounds 103m last year, is among the last remaining businesses sold by BP's nutrition division, which the oil company put on the market last year. Dalgety says the deal will give it continental sales of more than Pounds 100m annually and 12 per cent of the European petfood market by volume. That would be ahead of Nestle of Switzerland and close to Quaker Oats of the US, which holds second position to Mars, also of the US. Dalgety's petfood sales have grown rapidly since the mid-1980s to about Pounds 225m annually. About 80 per cent are in the UK, where Dalgety's Spillers subsidiary is the second largest producer after Mars, with about 20 per cent by value of the Pounds 1.2bn market. As well as raising Dalgety's UK market share to about 24 per cent, the deal will give the group manufacturing capacity, a bigger customer base and new distribution channels on the Continent, where Paragon had sales of Pounds 61m last year. Mr John Martyn, Dalgety's finance director, said: 'We see petfood as a European business, and this is a very significant step in our expansion.' Though recession has recently dampened European markets, he expected growth on the Continent to outstrip the UK in the medium term. Paragon, which employs 850 people, has plants in France, Germany and the Netherlands, as well as in Britain, and is particularly strong in sales to petshops. Its main brands are Beta in the UK and Doko and Dokat on the Continent. About half of its business is private-label production. Most of Dalgety's continental sales are to supermarkets and are supplied by exports from the UK. The group's main continental petfood operation is Hopermann, a German distribution company acquired four years ago. However, Hopermann's efforts to launch Dalgety brands, such as Prime and Bonio, on the Continent have made little headway, and the group has less than 1 per cent of the German market. Paragon's financial performance this year is expected to be similar to last year's. Mr Martyn said Dalgety's aim was to quickly increase the business's margins much closer to the 8-9 per cent return on sales earned by Spillers. Dalgety would be looking closely at ways to eliminate duplication between the two businesses. Paragon's four British plants are believed to be much less efficient than Dalgety's four UK factories, in which the group has invested heavily in recent years. Dalgety is thought to be interested in making further continental acquisitions and is believed recently to have held talks with Nestle, which holds small shares of six European petfood markets.  -------------------------------------------------           EUROPEAN PETFOOD MARKET  ------------------------------------------------- Shares of sales in grocery stores, 1992 by value  ------------------------------------------------- Company                 %  ------------------------------------------------- Mars                   55 Quaker Oats            13 Nestle                  8 Dalgety                 8 Royal Canin             1 Others                 16  -------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------- 1993 market sales (Pounds m)  ------------------------------------------------- UK                  1,200 France                994 Germany               832 Italy                 479 Netherlands           232 Belgium               223 Spain                 174  ------------------------------------------------- Source: Dalgety/Nielsen  -------------------------------------------------</p>

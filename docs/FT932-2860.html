			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / US renews attack on Aideed in Mogadishu US aircraft early today bombed the centre of Mogadishu, the Somali capital, in the fourth air strike against warlord General Mohamed Farah Aideed, witnesses said, Reuter report from Mogadishu. It was the first attack since Monday when Pakistani troops shot dead at least 20 Somalis protesting against punitive military action by the United Nations in retaliation for the killing of 23 of its peacekeepers on June 5. Heavy aircraft and helicopter gunships flew over the sector of the city controlled by Gen Aideed. Foreign aid workers, seeking refuge near Gen Aideed's house, said that the attack was accompanied by loudspeaker appeals to the people in the area to lay down their arms. Gen Aideed's house was said to be surrounded by ground troops from the United Nations Operation in Somalia (Unosom) which holds him responsible for the killing of the Pakistani troops. In Washington, a US defence official said: 'The objective of the strike is to deny Aideed's capacity to disrupt UN operations.' A US Navy flotilla carrying 2,200 Marines and helicopters was steaming southwards in the Indian Ocean but no order had been given to send it to Somalia, defence officials said.</p>

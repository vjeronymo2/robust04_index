Mr Masari, who arrived in Britain in April on a Yemeni passport, said he learned last week his application had been turned down. The British government, which values its links with Saudi Arabia, has come under pressure from Riyadh not to allow Mr Masari to remain. A founder-member of the Committee for the Defence of Legitimate Rights, Mr Masari was imprisoned for six months in Saudi Arabia last year. On his release from prison, Mr Masari travelled to Yemen, then on to London, where he has made repeated accusations against Saudi Arabia's ruling family.</p>

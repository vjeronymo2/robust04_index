			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: NatWest's capital risk National Westminster claims plenty of reasons for feeling comfortable with a tier one capital ratio of only 5.2 per cent. The list is so elaborate that the bank must have given considerable thought to the question of whether it was comfortable in the first place. All the more so since the ratio would be closer to 5 per cent if, unlike Lloyds, it had fully adjusted its capital for lower property values. NatWest could just about get away even with that lower number. But it is close enough to the Bank of England's effective minimum for tier one to raise doubts about its ability to finance higher lending in a recovery. If necessary, the bank could convert some of last year's sterling bond issue into preference shares. It could issue more such bonds. Or it could switch some of its surplus money market deposits to customer lending. But these adjustments would help only at the margin. NatWest's real gamble is that loan growth will not take off before a reduction in provisions has enabled it to rebuild its capital through retained earnings. That looks a tall order when someone somewhere will have to put money into the property market to reflate the depressed prices which caused the provisions in the first place. If property prices stabilise, NatWest will at least no longer have to top up old provisions. That will help, but one has to make some optimistic assumptions to pencil in retentions much over Pounds 200m for 1993. NatWest is thus walking a tightrope on capital. Having set an uncovered dividend for each of the past four years, it will only have itself to blame if it eventually falls off.</p>

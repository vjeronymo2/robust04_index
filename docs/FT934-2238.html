			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / High-street recovery slows Retailers are experiencing a patchy recovery with few signs of a rapid lift in sales before Christmas, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday. Although retail volumes were up last month on a year previously, the year-on-year rise was less than in September and October and optimism about short-term business prospects has fallen back. But companies running shops and supermarkets are planning to increase capital spending over the next 12 months by more than at any time since 1987. Staff numbers in retailing are also up on 12 months ago, the first year-on-year increase since late 1990, mainly on account of retailers hiring more part-time workers. The findings, from the CBI's latest survey of the distributive trades, underline how consumers are increasing spending only slowly after the recession. The survey took soundings from 494 distribution companies - taking in wholesalers and car showrooms as well as shops - between November 9 and December 1. It may have been affected by uncertainty before the Budget on November 30. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel and a director of the Kingfisher retail group, said growth in the sector 'remained uneven'. There had been little sign of a pre-Christmas boost, with many people following the pattern of previous years and delaying shopping for as long as possible in the hope of finding bargains. The weak level of retail price inflation is underlined by shops having raised prices in the past year by the smallest amount since the CBI began the surveys 10 years ago. Among specific sectors of retailing, grocers and chemists shops turned in relatively good sales growth last month, while furniture, carpets, general household durables and alcoholic drinks did badly. In the wholesaling industry, companies reported overall year-on-year sales growth last month, although business was weaker than in October. The general slowdown among wholesalers is expected to continue up to Christmas. Motor traders reported modest year-on-year sales growth in November, but expect a fall in the year to December. Of retailers in the survey, 51 per cent said volumes rose in November compared with a year previously, while 28 per cent said sales were down. That gave a balance reporting higher sales of 23 percentage points, compared with the balances of 26 and 25 points in October and September and 3 points in August. For all retailers, the balance of 11 percentage points of shops saying sales were poor for the time of year was the least encouraging result since May last year.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Retail sales: better than last year but patchy  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Annual growth in volumes (reported) 1992-93           Nov  Dec  Jan  Feb  Mar  Apr  May  Jun  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- All distribution             -18  -10  +12   -1  +33  +35  +28  +32 Grocers                       +2  +34  +44  +30  +42  +24  +21  +43 Specialist food              +24  +67  -11  -13   -3  -31  +49  +18 Off-licences                 -47  -40  -49  -11  -24  -26  -35  -35 Clothing                     -18   +2  +19  +10  +27  +24   -1  +40 Footwear &amp; leather           +11  -11  +28  +74  +37  +43  -55  +43 Durable household goods      -10  -18   -4   +5   +1  +23  +37  +10 Furniture and carpets        +15   -3  -35  +48  +40  +27  +34  +54 Hardware, china &amp; DIY        -38  -33   +6   +6  +46  +29   +3   -5 Confectionery                  0  +21  -31  +12  +36  +10  +20   +3 Booksellers &amp; stationers     -53  -39  -18  -12   +4  +47  +46  +37 Chemists                     +79   +6  +66  +48  -12  +44  +27  +44 Other retail                 -44  +20   +5   +4  +30   -6  +11   +8 Motor trades                 -31   +3  +20  +30  +29   +2   -2   -6  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Annual growth in volumes (reported) 1992-93           Jul  Aug  Sep  Oct  Nov  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- All distribution             +31  +21  +36  +38  +26 Grocers                      +38  +37  +59  +25  +62 Specialist food              +13   +5  -14  -15  -10 Off-licences                 -23   -3  +23  -41  -61 Clothing                     +55  +59  +14  +51  +32 Footwear &amp; leather           +55  +37  +84  +59  +12 Durable household goods      +12   +3  -16  +13  -21 Furniture and carpets        +31  +53  +17  +69  -29 Hardware, china &amp; DIY        +10  +14  +23   +5  +10 Confectionery                +13  +30    0   -8  +36 Booksellers &amp; stationers     +49  +22  +20  +50  +18 Chemists                     +44  +37  +61  +16  +74 Other retail                 +14   -3  +14  +19  +13 Motor trades                  +8  +27  +15  +16  +14  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: CBI Balance = % reporting an increase minus % reporting a decrease in sales compared with a year before  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

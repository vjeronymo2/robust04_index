			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: Slow sneaker sales cut Reebok returns REEBOK International, the athletic footwear group, suffered a 14 per cent drop in third-quarter profits, citing losses from the sale of two divisions and a slowdown in the sneaker market, AP-DJ reports. The US group earned Dollars 63.9m, or 74 cents a share, for the three-month period, compared with Dollars 74.3m, or 80 cents, in the same period last year. This year's figure included after-tax losses of Dollars 7m stemming from the recently-completed sales of its Boston Whaler and Ellesse subsidiaries. Revenue for the quarter dropped to Dollars 808.5m from Dollars 863.2m in last year. Last year's sales figures included revenue from Boston Whaler and Ellesse. But even excluding those numbers, sales would have fallen by 3.6 per cent this year. The decline was brought on largely by a drop in the Reebok footwear business. In the US market, the company said quarterly sales of Reebok footwear fell by around 20 per cent, reflecting the sluggish economy and a change in footwear styles away from sneakers as casual shoes. For the first nine months of 1993, Reebok reported profits of Dollars 172.7m, or Dollars 1.94, down from Dollars 182.4m, or Dollars 1.96 a year earlier. Nine-month sales were Dollars 2.29n, compared with Dollars 2.36bn.</p>

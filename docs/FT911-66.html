			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Plea for white collar jobless - Unemployment AS speculation about the date of the general election continued in the Commons last night Sir Robert McCrindle, a senior Conservative backbencher, called on the government to pay closer attention to the growth in 'white collar' unemployment. He stressed that it was a 'phenomenon' of the current recession which was affecting voters in his Brentwood and Ongar constituency and others within commuting distance who looked to the City of London for employment . Labour MPs predicted that their party was poised to win the Monmouth by-election on Thursday and that, as a result, Mr John Major, the prime minister, would avoid calling a general election before October at the earliest. Mr John MacGregor, leader of the Commons, declined to comment on the timing of the general election but reaffirmed the government's determination to make Labour's spending commitments - and the implications for increased taxation - a key feature of the campaign. Sir Robert McCrindle accepted that priority had to be accorded to getting inflation down but urged the government to spread the coverage of its advertising campaign on unemployment to cover the services sector as well as manufacturing industry. While the 1980s had been characterised as the period of the 'yuppies' and, perhaps, 'the unacceptable face of the City of London' the latest downturn in the economy had changed the situation. Sir Robert estimated that about 40 per cent of the current rise in unemployment, and about half the company liquidations, were in the 'services dominated' south east of England. MPs approved a motion authoring the House to adjourn from May 23 to June 3 for the spring recess.</p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Investing in a route through recession - The progress of two West Midlands engineering groups WAGON Industrial Holdings and Triplex Lloyd, two West Midlands engineering groups, have been trying to invest their way out of recession. Their experience, based on the policy of becoming strong companies in often quite narrow sectors, indicates the manner in which medium-sized groups have been re-positioning in international markets. Yesterday, Wagon demonstrated the execution of that policy with the announcement of the purchase of Polypal. Despite declines in turnover in the year to the end of last March, to Pounds 229.5m for Wagon and to Pounds 167.2m for Triplex Lloyd, and falls in pre-tax profits to Pounds 14.1m for Wagon and Pounds 7.06m for Triplex Lloyd, the expansion of both groups has not passed unnoticed. Wagon's shares have been trading recently in the middle of the 1992 range and those of Triplex Lloyd have been at the bottom of their range, but the two have won the approbation of stockbroking analysts. Albert E Sharp has recommended its clients to buy Triplex Lloyd. 'Focus on castings increasing and prospects encouraging; property could provide cash for future expansion.' It suggested clients should hold Wagon. 'Good management in recession means a much reduced cost base and strong balance sheet.' The two groups have in common the manufacture of automotive components and precision products but thereafter their interests diverge. Wagon has its materials handling business, Triplex Lloyd is active in the power and building products sectors. Since April 1990, Triplex Lloyd has bought six companies, five for cash totalling Pounds 11.6m and one for shares, the issue of which generated Pounds 5.6m cash. Wagon, before yesterday's purchase, the largest of the present series, had spent Pounds 6.7m in 1990-91 on four companies, Pounds 1m on three companies in 1991-92, and, during the present financial year, Pounds 4.73m on six companies. None of the acquisitions represented a departure from existing lines of business. Rather, Wagon and Triplex Lloyd were able to exploit the poor business climate by, in some instances, buying companies at knock-down prices from the receiver, in order to fill gaps or to expand their product ranges. The series of isolated purchases sprang out of plans made during the early part of the recession, which has lasted longer than either anticipated. Mr John Hudson, Wagon's chief executive, said that in 1989 the company thought it was heading for recession with Pounds 24m of debt. It was decided to sell the office furniture and steel operations. 'That wiped out the debt. It generated Pounds 12.5m of cash. We took the view we would run through recession with a strong balance sheet.' Triplex Lloyd's key decisions were taken in 1990, said Mr John Foley, the finance director. At that time the group had four divisions, automotive and engineering, power, building products and electrical engineering. 'We began to look at our capital requirements in some detail. We decided that notwithstanding gloom in building products and engineering, we saw growth in power and automotive if we became more efficient.' The first result was the sale of the electrical engineering business for Pounds 13.2m. Both groups, then, began the recession with a disposal which, in their different ways, provided a financial springboard for expansion of, and concentration of resources on, the remaining businesses. But there was one caveat. Triplex Lloyd has not sought to expand its building products group. It has tended to nurse it along, stripping out overheads and keeping it profitable, the better to concentrate on investment in its power and automotive businesses. Although both companies approached the recession along broadly the same lines, emphasising a simultaneous approach of cost-cutting and development, their financial approach has been different. Wagon has stuck with the policy of remaining cash positive. At the end of last March it had net cash balances of Pounds 14.5m. Financing the acquisition of Polypal through an equity issue is consistent with this policy. The fact that Polypal has cash balances of Pounds 6m increases Wagon's ability to expand without resort to debt. Triplex Lloyd on the other hand has had a more relaxed approach to debt. This is partly because it has extensive property holdings of surplus industrial land that, even in the present depressed markets, provide an asset backing for borrowing. Gearing increased during 1991-92 to 45 per cent and remains high, Mr Foley said, 'because we are continuing to invest. The only way to get it down is in lumps, disposing of land or of businesses.' These financial approaches point to differences in management style. Triplex Lloyd changed after July 1991, following the death of Mr James Doel, the chairman, and the appointment of Mr Colin Cooke as his successor. The group became more outward looking, according to Mr Foley, with an attempt to achieve greater understanding of the market. 'Effective and creative marketing must become the driving force,' Mr Cooke told employees last March. For its part, Wagon has announced a series of management changes, with the appointment of Mr Kevin Wilson as group managing director, reporting to Mr Hudson, and a series of internal changes. These reflect, Mr Hudson said, 'the emerging realisation that the 1990s will be very different' and that there is a need for more hands-on management of the group's subsidiaries. Wagon is reconciled to slow economic growth. 'I'm clear you have to do well whatever you do,' said Mr Hudson of his diversified group of companies. 'If they're not strong players in their niches you've got problems. You've got to be international. You've got to have common sense in your earnings profile.' Mr Foley, looking into the future and considering the technological advances Triplex Lloyd has been making in its casting operations, takes a similar view. 'We want to re-position so as to serve the growth markets and to beef up the size of those operations which serve the growth markets.'</p>

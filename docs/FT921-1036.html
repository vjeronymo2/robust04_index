			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Exceptionals lift Bridport-Gundry Bridport-Gundry, the Dorset-based netting and woven products manufacturer, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 172,000 for the six months to January 31. This marked a modest improvement on the Pounds 163,000 achieved last time, but was struck after a further reduction in interest charges - from Pounds 376,000 to Pounds 255,000 - and an exceptional gain of Pounds 140,000 arising from compensation for a cancelled US defence contract offset by a provision for property development costs. Operating profits declined 21 per cent to Pounds 427,000 (Pounds 539,000). After a reduced tax charge, earnings per share emerged at 1.66p (1.12p); the interim dividend is held at 1.5p.</p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Mitsubishi in SE Asia chemicals project Mitsubishi Petrochemicals, Japan's largest plastics manufacturer, yesterday announced its first investment in south-east Asia. The company is forming a joint venture with Royal Dutch Shell to build a Y51bn (Pounds 324.8m) petrochemicals plant in Singapore. The complex, located at the Seraya island petrochemicals complex, will have an annual capacity of 310,000 tonnes of styrene monomer and 140,000 tonnes of propylene oxide. It will be Asia's largest styrene monomer plant. The move is the latest in a rush of foreign investments by Japanese chemicals companies. They hope to reduce their dependency on the domestic market. Mitsubishi said the rapid growth of the south-east Asian market and the recent appreciation of the yen had made it imperative to secure an overseas production base. Shell will control 70 per cent of the joint venture, to be called Seraya Chemicals Singapore. Mitsubishi will control the remaining 30 per cent. The plant, which should be operational during the second half of 1997, will take its ethylene feedstock from the Singapore Petrochemical Complex operated by Shell and Sumitomo Chemical of Japan. East Asian styrene demand is expected to grow on average 7.8 per cent a year between 1992 and the end of the decade, according to Chem Systems, the specialist market research company. Japan's petrochemicals industry is struggling with a collapse in domestic demand, massive over-capacity and falling prices. The industry's 12 largest manufacturers of ethylene, the basic building block of petrochemicals, are expected to report combined losses during 1993 of Y51.6bn, according to analysts. A collapse in the demand for plastics from the automotive, construction and electronics industry has hit the industry hard. The ministry of international trade and industry estimates domestic demand for ethylene fell 8 per cent last year to 2.7m tonnes.</p>

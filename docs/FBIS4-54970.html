			<p>BFN     [Text] During the general parliamentary debate about the  state budget, Janez Kopac, a deputy of the Liberal Democracy who  is otherwise the chairman of the parliamentary Finance  Commission, also pointed out that the adoption of some laws will  additionally burden the state treasury. Here he, among others,  singled out the Law on Compensation of Injustices, whose  financial consequences will amount to several tens of millions  of German marks. This law has been put into parliamentary  procedure by the Slovene Peoples' Party [SLS]. For this reason  our reporter Marjan Rogelj asked Janez Podobnik from the SLS for  an explanation, while he asked Janez Kopac how the funds would  be secured if the law, which has already been passed in the  first reading, will also be implemented:    [Begin recording] [Podobnik] The Law on Compensation of  Injustices should have been passed already. It is incredible  that Slovenia is finally getting this law after four years of  diplomacy. As regards the procedure, I think that if the law is  passed before the parliamentary summer recess, a special  government working commission will be formed on the basis of the  law and by the time it is activated and receives its first  claims, I am convinced that even if the law is passed this year,  it will in no way burden the 1994 budget. I would like to  stress once again that we have already compiled a thorough  calculation. Namely, during the first reading the State Chamber  ordered us that we must specify the exact total amount of the  funds and the sources of these funds by the second hearing.    [Kopac] Well, the options are either to cut all other  budgetary obligations for this amount, increase the budget  deficit, or impose new taxes. There simply is no other way. I  would add here that I find the reduction of other budgetary  obligations for this amount unrealistic, as we suffer an acute  budget crisis anyway. Any increase in debts would be bad for all  of us and introduction of new taxes is not terribly popular  either. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Textile makers warn on Asian exports to US ASIA'S textile exports to the US will grow twice as fast over the coming decade as the US textiles market itself, US textile manufacturers argue in their latest volley against proposed reforms of the multi-fibre arrangement (MFA) regulating world trade in textiles. According to a survey commissioned by the American Textile Manufacturers Institute (ATMI), Asian quotas will grow by 5.77bn sq metres over 10 years from 7.9bn sq m in 1993 to 13.7bn in 2002. This would account for 74.1 per cent of all quotas entering the US market, if proposals in the draft agreement on the Uruguay Round of world trade talks are put into effect. 'The Uruguay Round shuts the door on the developing countries of the world that the US is committed to help so that the Far East manufacturers can add to their wealth,' said Mr Carlos Moore, ATMI executive vice-president. 'India and Pakistan will get some benefits from abolition of the MFA, but China is going to be the dominant supplier.' Mr Moore's first concern is closer to home: protection of US textile industry jobs. In a report published two months ago, the ATMI warned the phased dismantling of the MFA quota system under Uruguay Round proposals would cut US domestic output of textiles and apparel from 18bn sq m to 3bn sq m by the year 2001. US jobs in the industry would be cut from 1.76m now, to 300,000 in 2001, the report claimed. In a draft agreement for the long-delayed Uruguay Round, it is proposed that textiles come for the first time under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). Over a 10-year period, quota arrangements that have for 40 years controlled world trade in textiles will be dismantled. US textile lobbyists want the transition period to be extended to 15 years to give US manufacturers time to adjust. The ATMI study argues that Asia's quotas, principally held by China, Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong, will grow at about twice the rate of the US market. Against Asia's quota growth of 5.77bn sq m, the US market is expected to grow at 1.5 per cent a year, increasing demand by 2.92bn sq m to just under 33bn sq m. It shows Asia providing 14 of the top 20 textile exporters to the US market. Only Turkey and Mexico squeeze into the top 10. 'Just three Far East countries, China, India and Pakistan, will have greater quota for access to the US textile and apparel market than Eastern Europe, Africa, South America, Central America, the Caribbean, Mexico, Central and Eastern Europe, and Russia combined,' Mr Moore said. This latest study reflects an attempt to widen the appeal of ATMI lobbying against the draft Uruguay Round text by targeting the concerns of non-Asian exporters to the US.</p>

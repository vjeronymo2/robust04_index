			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / International Company News: Dyno hurt by weak demand DYNO INDUSTRIER, the Norwegian chemical, explosives and plastics group, yesterday reported a decline in 1991 net profits, to NKr52m (Dollars 8.3m) from NKr247m in 1990, writes Karen Fossli. The setback was attributed to week demand in core international markets, plus restructuring charges and write-downs. Dyno took a NKr118m restructuring charge; a NKr16m write-down on share portfolios; a NKr15m goodwill write-down; and a NKr17m write-down on equity shareholdings in other companies. It is cutting its 1991 dividend to NKr2 a share from NKr3.50.</p>

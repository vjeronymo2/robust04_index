			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: GLENDORA;  </P> <P> PHYSICIANS BUY AMI-GLENDORA HOSPITAL  </P> <P> A group of doctors signed an agreement to purchase AMI-Glendora Community  Hospital from Beverly Hills-based American Medical International Inc. on  Tuesday night, saving the hospital from imminent closure.  </P> <P> The hospital's 350 employees had been notified in September that the facility  would close Nov. 6 if AMI could not find a buyer. When a deal seemed likely,  the deadline was extended.  </P> <P> "We're grateful that the hospital is staying open," said Bill Raymond, chairman  of the board. "It's an excellent thing for the community." Glencom, a group  representing at least 50 doctors, mostly on the hospital's staff, expects to  close escrow Jan. 7, Raymond said.  </P> <P> Glencom had agreed to take over the 165-bed facility in the spring but was  unable to finance the purchase then, AMI spokeswoman Suzanne Hovdey said. She  would not disclose the selling price.  </P> <P> AMI then agreed to sell the hospital to staff physician Dr. Jesse Umali, but  when that deal fell through last week, AMI resumed negotiations with Glencom,  she said.  </P> <P> Umali, who made a down payment of $100,000, said he expected staff doctors to  support his bid but could not finance the deal when they did not. He would have  paid $8.5 million, he said.  </P></p>

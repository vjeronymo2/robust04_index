			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / The City Bombing: Business almost usual at EBRD - Peter Norman, who was at a seminar in the bank when the bomb exploded, says staff hardly flinched as the building trembled A BRIEF flickering of lights on the fifth floor of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development gave the first hint of an explosion. A moment later, at about 10.25am on Saturday, the 12-storey steel and concrete structure lifted and trembled as the blast, a few hundred yards to the south along Bishopsgate, rolled and roared around Liverpool Street station and the Broadgate office complex for what seemed several seconds. While the EBRD has achieved notoriety for the un-British opulence of its headquarters, it reacted on Saturday with a very British stiff upper lip, business-as-usual approach to the IRA bomb. While most of the City was enjoying a day off, the bank was almost as busy as on a normal day. About 1,000 businessmen, bankers, journalists and officials were in the EBRD headquarters for a day of seminars and round-table discussions ahead of the formal opening today of the bank's annual meeting. In the fifth-floor room where I was, Mr Mario Sarcinelli, the vice-president responsible for development banking, gamely continued a press briefing on fiscal problems in eastern Europe. As wire service reporters rushed from the room, Mr Sarcinelli brushed aside a recorded announcement of a fire in the building as 'something that always happens'. He doggedly kept up his expose of east Europe's need for tax reforms as announcements urged all to stay at their work stations and away from windows. The voice in the loudspeaker need not have worried. The bank and its celebrated marble fittings survived virtually unscathed. Although the building had heaved, breaking a few windows in a ground-floor wine bar, there was a notable absence of panic. 'We put the blinds down and carried on,' an official explained. The emergency may have gone some way to fostering camaraderie among delegates and easing tensions created by recent disclosures of the bank's alleged high spending. Yesterday the Dunkirk spirit was again on show as bands of hob-nobbing and networking delegates wove around cordoned-off streets on their way to the EBRD headquarters at One Exchange Square. For some veteran staffers, it was a matter of deja vu. Last year's big April bomb had gone off much closer to the previous EBRD headquarters and caused far more damage to the bank's building.</p>

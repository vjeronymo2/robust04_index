The subject amendment seeks authorization to construct and operate a 1.48 mile, 16-inch residue line from the non-jurisdictional Blacks Fork Processing Plant to Questar's mainline transmission system in Uinta County, Wyoming. By order issued July 21, 1994, in Docket Nos. CP93&hyph;431&hyph;000 and CP93&hyph;431&hyph;001, the Commission, among other things, authorized Questar to construct and operate a 1.48 mile, 10-inch residue line. Questar states that it is necessary to increase the size of the residue line to accommodate anticipated increases in the plant's processing capacity. Questar's application in all other respects remains unchanged from the original request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest to said application should, on or before September 6, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing herein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to jurisdiction conferred on the Commission by sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this amendment to the application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, or if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, Questar need not appear or be represented at the hearing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 9 Jun (MENA)--The newspaper AL-AKHBAR has  stated that the United States' objection to the Security  Council's doing its duty in condemning the latest bestial  Israeli aggression against south Lebanon, which constitutes a  serious violation of the sovereignty of an independent state,  makes Washington lose a great deal of credibility, at least in  the Arab world and in most countries of the third world. In an  editorial published today, the paper stressed that what is even  more serious is that U.S. attempts to save Israel from the  consequences of its aggressive actions will encourage Tel Aviv  rulers to continue their blatant behavior with impunity. This  attitude threatens the peace process in which the U.S.  Administration states it plays the role of partner.    AL-AKHBAR noted the surprise caused by U.S. President  Clinton's attempts to bar the Security Council from passing a  resolution condemning the Israeli aggression, which left  approximately 130 people dead or injured. The paper also noted  the denunciation of the Israeli behavior by many Western nations  at a time when peace negotiations are supposed to be taking  place with the participation of Israel, Syria, and Lebanon.  Voicing hope that Washington will reconsider its stance, the  paper stated that if Washington does not want to condemn its  ally or at least advise it to exercise self-restraint, it should  allow the international organization responsible for deterring  the aggression the opportunity to do its duty.</p>

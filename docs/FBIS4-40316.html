			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Fomin] </F>   [Text] Chita, 16 Jun -- This morning the broadcast on Chita  radio was interrupted for an emergency report. The oblast  administration appealed to the residents of the Trans-Baykal  settlement of Yasnogorsk to maintain law and order. An  explosive situation has taken shape in the settlement where the  largest power station in Russia, the Kharanor state regional  electric power station [GRES] is being constructed. The  construction workers for the "Chitaenergostroy" [Chita power  construction] joint-stock society have not received their wages  for several months. In spite of this, on the decision of the  federal bodies of authority, the Kharanor GRES is scheduled to  go on stream this year, nevertheless the financing of this  facility has practically been stopped. The residents of  Yasnogorsk have repeatedly addressed a demand to the government  of the Russian Federation and to the management of the  joint-stock society of Russia's unified power system that  overdue wages should be paid, but their voice has not been  heard. The construction workers' hunger strike which was held  in the run up to this did not help either.    In this connection, it has been decided to stage a mass  action of protest at the Kharanor GRES. A strike committee has  been set up here. The power construction workers intend to  start an indefinite strike, starting 25 June. And today the  strike committee is planning to hold a rally in the settlement,  permission for which has been obtained from the local bodies of  authority. But at the same time it would appear from the  information coming in from the construction site of the GRES  that it is not to be ruled out that part of the workforce will  stage unlawful actions. In particular, the residents of  Yasnogorsk have repeatedly stated that they will block traffic  on the railway connecting the Trans-Siberian railway with China,  using bulldozers, and other heavy equipment.    In the radio appeal to the power construction workers, the  oblast administation which has fully supported the demands of  the residents of Yasnogorsk regarding the payment of overdue  wages, has at the same time asked the residents of the  settlement to refrain from hasty actions. In their turn the  bodies of authority of the Trans-Baykal region, as was stated in  the appeal, are taking every measure not to allow a social  explosion at the Kharanor GRES, to get the power station  commissioned on time. In particular, the administration has  sent detailed information about the situation in Yasnogorsk and  its proposals for extricating the construction site from crisis  to the president and government of the Russian Federation.</p>

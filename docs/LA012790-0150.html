			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE NARROW SEARCH FOR 10-YEAR-OLD'S ASSAILANT  </P> <P> An appeal for information in the sexual assault of a 10-year-old boy at a high  school basketball game last week has yielded the names of several suspects, a  Cypress police investigator said Friday.  </P> <P> Detective William McCullers declined to say whether an arrest is imminent but  said investigators have solid leads on the assailant's identity.  </P> <P> "We have received numerous phone calls from people who believe they have seen  the guy, and as a result have several names of people we will be talking to,"  McCullers said.  </P> <P> The incident occurred about 9:10 p.m. Jan. 17 near the end of a basketball game  that pitted the varsities of Cypress High School and Anaheim's Loara High  School.  </P> <P> The boy had been attending the game with his parents. When it appeared that the  Loara team would lose, he left his parents and strolled into a hallway near a  restroom, police said.  </P> <P> Someone approached the boy, led him into the restroom and sexually assaulted  him, McCullers said. The boy described the assailant as a male Latino, 35 to 40  years old, about 5 feet, 5 inches tall, 160 to 170 pounds, with short,  straight, dark hair and pimples or freckles. He was wearing a red sweat shirt  and blue or gray jeans.  </P> <P> McCullers said a ticket taker noticed a man matching the description who had  been watching the game from outside the gym just moments before the assault.  </P> <P> There are also believed to be witnesses who saw the man and the boy in the  hallway just before the assault, but they have not come forward, McCullers  said.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, investigators gathered some of the 600 fans from both schools who  attended the game. But none of the 40 or so people who showed up could remember  seeing the suspect.  </P> <P> Police also distributed at the two high schools an account of the incident and  a composite drawing of the suspect.  </P> <P> Cypress High Principal Jack Weber said several students have come forward with  information.  </P> <P> Weber said that the incident has "heightened awareness of the high school staff  and the entire community" but that no extra precautions are planned at future  games. Administrators from both schools were on duty at the game as well as two  male ticket takers.  </P></p>

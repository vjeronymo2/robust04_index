			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Sanyo Securities unveils Y80bn write-off Sanyo Securities, the troubled Japanese broker, yesterday announced a restructuring plan under which it will write off Y80bn (Dollars 756.5m) of bad loans at its finance subsidiaries over the next nine years. It is also raising Y20bn in capital through a rights issue to its three leading creditor banks and to Nomura Securities, its largest shareholder. Mr Takashi Kaminami, Sanyo director, said the broker would suffer a pre-tax loss of Y8bn for the year to March 31 due to losses from non-performing loans at its three non-bank finance affiliates. Sanyo, one of Japan's 10 second-tier brokers, reported a pre-tax loss of Y33.4bn the previous year, and had hoped for a profit of Y200m this year. The decision comes after months of negotiations among the three creditors - Bank of Tokyo, Daiwa Bank and Nippon Credit Bank - and Nomura Securities. The banks have agreed to lower interest rates on the loans to the Sanyo subsidiaries to 1.25 per cent. Sanyo said of the Y114.3bn in outstanding loans at Sanyo Sogo Capital, its largest finance affiliate, Y70bn were non-performing. The broker plans to sell Y40bn of its securities over the next few years to raise capital to cover part of the losses. The announcement comes a week after a rescue plan for Kankaku Securities, another second-tier broker which is to write off Y50bn in losses stemming from illicit client deals. Daiwa Bank, a commercial bank, last year bailed out Cosmo Securities, which was also suffering from heavy losses. Japan's medium-sized brokers have been the hardest hit by the Tokyo stock market slump. Sanyo said it still had to conclude some negotiations and hoped to announce a detailed plan by the end of this month. Meanwhile, other Japanese brokers announced revisions in earnings forecasts for the current year to March 31. They blamed lower-than-expected turnover on the Tokyo stock market. Nomura Securities, the industry leader, scaled down its earlier pre-tax estimate of Y70bn to Y50bn, against a pre-tax profit of Y2.4bn the previous year. Second-tier brokers expecting to fall into the red in spite of earlier profit expectations include Cosmo Securities, forecasting a loss of Y5.4bn, Dai-Ichi Securities, at Y7.2bn, and Yamatane Securities with a Y3.3bn deficit.</p>

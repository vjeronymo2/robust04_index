			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Leading Article: Opportunities after the storm YESTERDAY'S agreement by EC finance ministers to recast the exchange rate mechanism was one of the more dramatic and desperate tactical retreats in the community's history. In delivering such a painful blow to French political amour propre, it may yet unleash deadly recriminations. Certainly it would have been better if the community had faced up earlier to the fact that an inflexible ERM was likely to shatter on the rock of the Bundesbank's legitimate determination to preserve its reputation for controlling inflation during the testing post-unification period. It would have been more logical and should have been possible for the community to agree to reorientate the ERM, rather than waiting for the markets to blow it out of the water. Had Germany been willing to depart temporarily from the system, its remaining members would have been free to bring down their own interest rates in a co-ordinated fashion and the weekend's embarrassments might have been avoided. But the most important point about the Brussels decision to move to broader fluctuation bands is that it is a lot better than the available alternatives: persisting with a policy which has driven Europe into a recession of quite unnecessary depth, or abandoning the system entirely. Indeed, the progressive re-shaping of the ERM in the last year can be seen alongside the grudging public support for the Maastricht treaty as delivering an unforgettable message: that the community must not allow its dreams to run too far ahead of economic and political realities. If it does, then its core achievement of having constructed from the chaos of post-war Europe an effective single market and a base for more ambitious joint political projects will be placed in jeopardy. These are the stakes as the community adjusts to its new realities. The good news is that monetary conditions can now be eased in Europe, even though it appears likely that significant interest rate cuts in Germany may still be some months away. Unemployment rising Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, has stated his determination to use his new freedom cautiously, but he will surely recognise the case for using it. With unemployment at 11.6 per cent and rising, and his colleagues on the French right positioning themselves for a presidential election race, he should take an early opportunity to lop a couple of points off interest rates, although he will seek to achieve this with as little damage to the franc as possible. Given the fundamentals of the French economy, this ought to be achievable. As rates fall across most of Europe, economic prospects will brighten, although a full return of confidence will not be possible without the return of fiscal discipline and economic momentum in Germany. The more debatable question is how the EC should proceed from here. Finance ministers have set a target of January 1994 to return to narrow bands, at which point the Maastricht treaty says the second stage of Economic and Monetary Union should start. Realistic objective It is too early to judge whether this is a realistic objective. Rather than spending too much time considering the Maastricht timetable for Emu, member states should set about making a bigger success of their managed system of floating exchange rates than they have, in recent times, of running the ERM. Prior to the formal creation in January of the European Monetary Institute, a committee of EC central bankers, this will not be a simple task. With the Maastricht criteria for economic convergence a less rigidly fixed lodestar than hitherto, member states now face squarely their own responsibilities, desirable in their own right, to pursue credible, low-inflation economic strategies. If this easing of European monetary policy can be accomplished without an outbreak of ill-tempered beggar-my-neighbour devaluations, it may indeed be possible for the community to consider an early return to narrow bands. But whether or not this target is met, the community cannot avoid the search for effective mechanisms for monetary co-ordination. Rather than placing all its bets on simply being able to restore narrow bands next year, it should consider more far-reaching ERM reforms. Those who yesterday pronounced Maastricht and the Emu process inoperable ignore the fact that the single market remains incomplete, and sufficiently fragile for it not to be able to withstand sustained volatility in exchange rates between member countries. In Britain, the weekend's events have occasioned some misplaced schadenfreude. More appropriate would be a sense of regret that Mr John Major is so politically damaged that he cannot even consider rejoining a more relaxed ERM, so resuming his position at the centre of the difficult negotiations still to come about the community's monetary arrangements.</p>

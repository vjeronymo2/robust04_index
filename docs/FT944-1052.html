			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Personal View: Real target behind Bundesbank ritual Twenty years ago, on December 5 1974, the Bundesbank was the first central bank in the world to announce a monetary target. Many central banks followed this example, but sooner or later they have all learned that, while the money supply is an important indicator, it is not suitable as the guiding star of monetary policy. Germany, however, continues to think otherwise. Indeed this year, the members of the Bundesbank's Central Bank Council have used any opportunity to defend monetary targets as a cornerstone of German 'stability culture'. So it is almost certain that at its meeting today the council will announce its 21st monetary target. This lasting devotion to monetarism is difficult to reconcile with the German experience of monetary targeting over the last two decades: Of the 20 targets set between 1975 and 1994, the Bundesbank achieved only 10. The deviations from the targets were not random. In all cases where the target was missed the money supply exceeded the target. The Bundesbank has never attempted to compensate for over-expansion in one year by setting a correspondingly lower target for the next year. The relationship between M3 (the intermediate target for money supply) and short-term interest rates (the instrument at the disposal of the Bundesbank) has become quite unclear. For example, the Bundesbank increased short-term rates to dampen monetary growth in 1992; it did just the opposite in 1994. The target aggregate, the money supply M3, less and less reflects the actual money holdings of German companies and households. It not only excludes the strongly growing money market funds but also D-Mark Euro-deposits which amount to almost 50 per cent of traditional short-term time deposits. In fact, it is only because of shifts in new financial instruments that the monetary target for 1994 could formally be met. With this 'pragmatic' use of its monetary targeting, it seems hardly possible that the Bundesbank should have acquired such a high degree of credibility. Obviously, the Bundesbank's approach must contain something more important than its monetary target. This decisive factor is not difficult to identify. It is the bank's clear commitment to a low inflation rate. In other words, the Bundesbank's policy is a typical - and also successful - example of a strategy that is now called 'inflation targeting': Together with its monetary target, the Bundesbank has for many years also announced a target inflation rate of 2 per cent a year. Short-term interest rates, the Bundesbank's monetary policy instrument, have mainly been geared towards expected trends in consumer price inflation. For instance, since autumn 1992, the main justification for lowering key interest rates was the better prospects for price stability. The famous 'long and variable lag' between the implementation of monetary policy and its impact entails the risk of setting rates too high or too low. It is at this point that credibility comes in. If a central bank's commitment to price stability is credible, trade unions will incorporate the inflation target in their wage setting. Under such conditions, it is not too difficult for the central bank to achieve its target. If credibility is in danger, the problem of lags forces a central bank to be overly restrictive to ensure the inflation target can be met. This use of interest rates under a regime of 'inflation targeting' explains the very restrictive policy stance of the Bundesbank until the autumn of 1992. Thus, in reality there is only a small conceptual difference between monetary policy in Germany and in the US and UK, two countries that openly practise 'inflation targeting'. The recent interest rate reactions of the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve to early signs of inflationary pressures show that these two central banks are now also trying to maintain and enhance their credibility by copying the Bundesbank's approach. So what about the monetary target? Advent is a period with many old rituals. If the Bundesbank likes the little annual ceremony of announcing a monetary target, one should not criticise it. But behind the rituals the real world should not be forgotten - especially in 1995, when the conceptual design of the European Central Bank's monetary policy has to be developed.

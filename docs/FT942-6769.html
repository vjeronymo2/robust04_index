			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Formula for auditors Sir, Your leader 'The liabilities of auditors' (May 23) is to be welcomed for its support for the principle that reform of the law seems sound. It is, as you state, unreasonable that auditors should be held wholly responsible for corporate disasters when they have not been the direct cause of problems. It is much less easy to agree that amendment of Section 310 of the Companies Act in order to allow auditors to limit their liability in contract is a flawed alternative to more fundamental, and therefore less readily realisable, change. The monetary limitation of liability that would flow from this amendment should not be pitched at so low a level that the sense of professional responsibility felt by auditors would be put at risk. It is surely possible to arrive at levels which are reasonable and appropriate to the size of individual companies audited. We hope the Department of Trade and Industry can be persuaded to engage in a public consultation so as to ascertain how some such formula should be devised. I believe that there is a measure of sympathy within the business community to this general approach. Michael Chamberlain, president, The Institute of Chartered Accountants, Chartered Accountants' Hall, Moorgate Place, London EC2P 2BJ</p>

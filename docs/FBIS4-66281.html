			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lin Ye (2651 0673), China Chemical Industrial </F> Import and Export Corporation: "Trends Of Sino-Japanese Trade  and Investment"]    [Text] 1. Macro-Trends    1) The State of Sino-Japanese Trade    Sino-Japanese trade has been growing steadily in the last  few  years. In 1992, at a time when Japan was mired in recession,  when its trade with the United States and Europe barely held  steady in the first half of the year and its exports to South  Korea actually fell, Sino-Japanese trade shot up to almost $30  billion, after breaking the $20 billion barrier in 1991.  According to a trade statistical bulletin issued by the Japanese  Ministry of Finance, Sino-Japanese trade amounted to a historic  high of $28,903,000,000 in 1992, a gain of 26.7 percent from  1991. Specifically, Japan exported $11,957,000,000 worth of  goods to China, up 39.2 percent compared to a year ago, and  imported $16,946,000,000 worth of products from China, up 19.2  percent, with Japan running a deficit of $4,989,000,000, off  11.4 percent from the deficit of $5,627,000,000 in 1991. In the  first half of 1993, China became Japan's second largest trading  partner.    Sino-Japanese trade has continued its solid growth since the  opening of 1993, totaling $7,628,000,000 in the first quarter,  up 23.5 percent compared to the same period a year ago. Japanese  exports to and imports from China amounted to $3,396,000,000 and  $4,232,000,000, up 36 percent, up 36.3 percent and 14.9 percent,  respectively, from the corresponding period a year ago, giving  Japan a trade deficit of $836 million. If this trend holds up,  Sino-Japanese trade may top $30 billion for all of 1993 and  Japan's trade deficit will continue to narrow, possibly dipping  below $3 billion for the entire year. Looking at the monthly  data for the first quarter of 1993, Japan ran a deficit of $750  million in January, $50 million in February, and $40 million in  March, down 29.7 percent from the same period in 1992. If China  continues to import steel and electrical machinery from Japan at  the current rates, it may run up a trade deficit with Japan in  some months but will still end the year with a small surplus. At  a time when China's monetary policy is being tightened and  structural adjustment is under way, in particular, the momentum  in steel and electrical machinery importation by China may be  stalled, making a trade deficit less likely.    2) Sino-Japanese Trade: Commodity Mix    Japan's imports from China in 1992 essentially consisted of  the following: a) apparel, $4.85 billion, up 50.1 percent, 43.5  percent of total Japanese apparel imports by value and over 60  percent by volume; b) electronic products, $1.11 billion, up  34.9 percent. The growth in sound equipment exports such as  radios and recorders was particularly striking, up 65.8 percent  compared to the preceding year; 3) miscellaneous exports, also  up sharply. In such categories as footwear, toys, and furniture,  China has replaced South Korea as the top supplier to Japan. It  is now the largest exporter to Japan of a lengthening list of  products, accounting for 44 percent and 64.8 percent of total  Japanese toy and umbrella imports, respectively. d) grain, oil,  and foodstuff, up 20.6 percent. e) mineral-type fuels, down 3.4  percent from a year ago. Petroleum products imports plunged 37.5  percent, crude oil imports rose 1.2 percent to reach  $1,791,000,000, and coal imports climbed 4.9 percent to hit $296  million. f) Raw materials imports fell 6.4 percent to $1.07  billion. Timber was the only gainer , up 20.2 percent. Otherwise  steel imports fell 40.1 percent; cotton, down 46.7 percent; raw  silk, down 55.1 percent between January and November; and  silico-manganese, down 2.81 percent also between January and  November. Chinese manganese exports to Japan will be badly hurt  because of a decision by the Japanese Government to impose an  anti-dumping tax on such exports.    Japan's exports to China in 1992 consisted mainly of the  following: a) Electronic exports rose 61.7 percent, 55.4 percent  of total Japanese exports to China; b) transportation machinery,  including automobiles, $1,163,000,000, up 111.7 percent from a  year ago; c) steel, $1,474,000,000 in value, up 8 percent from a  year ago, and 2.4 million tons in volume; d) textile products,  $1,223,000,000, up 32 percent from 1991; e) plastics, up 17.4  percent; paper and paper products, up 35.3 percent; and records  and tapes, up 144.4 percent.    Judging from the state of Sino-Japanese trade, China has  become a major market for Japanese exports. In 1992 Japanese  exports to China amounted to $12.8 billion, 3.7 percent of total  Japanese exports, making China Japan's seventh largest export  market. Automobile and machinery exports practically doubled.  Japanese imports from China continue to be dominated by grain,  raw materials, coal, and petroleum, but machinery imports did  show a gain. In the long haul, Japan would continue to see China  as a market for its high-added-value products such as  automobiles and electronic goods.    3) The Trends Of Japanese Investment in China    a) Pattern of Japanese overseas investment    Investment in China is a key component of direct overseas  Japanese investment as a whole. The latter, in turn, is a  product of the shift in Japan's trade orientation strategy  prompted by trade conflicts between that country and the United  States and Europe.    Since recording its first trade surplus with the United  States in 1965, Japan has waged an unbroken stretch of trade  wars with the latter in such areas as textile products, iron and  steel, automobile, and semi-conductor chips. Since 1980, the  United States has been running a trade deficit with Japan in the  tens of billions of dollars each year, accounting for between 40  and 60 percent of America's total foreign trade deficit,  including a gap of $43.67 billion in 1992. Japan's trade surplus  with West Europe zoomed past $20 billion barrier in 1987 and hit  $31.1 billion in 1992, 60 percent of the foreign trade deficit  of the European Community. Japan's overseas trade surplus rose  20 percent in the first half of 1993 compared to the same period  a year ago. For Japan, the direct consequence of a massive trade  surplus is the appreciation of the yen against the dollar, which  has made Japanese products less competitive on the international  market, which, in turn, has forced the manufacturing industry at  home to shift operations overseas in a big way in favor of local  production. Japan's overseas investment totalled $170 billion  between 1986 and 1990 and reached $35 billion in 1992 alone. The  lion share of direct Japanese overseas investment has gone to  the United States. The resurgence of the U.S. manufacturing  industry, including its success on the automobile,  semi-conductor, and computer markets, has squeezed the rate of  return of Japanese corporations operating in that country to the  depressed level of 1 percent. Since 1990, in fact, some  companies have been losing money, causing Japanese investment in  the United States to head downward steadily since 1989. In  contrast, Japanese enterprises in East Asia have been chalking  up margins of profit exceeding 5 percent. Japanese investment in  East Asia has been on the rise since 1990. In East Asia as a  whole, China has considerable appeal to Japan as a place to  invest mainly because it enjoys relative political stability,  its economic reform has brought it closer to the international  market, and it boasts ample manpower and raw materials, low  prices, and a vast domestic market. According to the latest  statistics, Chinese wages are almost one-twentieth those in  Japan. Of all Japanese enterprises in China, 70 percent are  making a profit, in contrast to the low-profit operations of  Japanese companies in West Europe and North America. This has  persuaded Japanese business to increase investment in China. The  Ricoh Corporation has decided to move the entire production of  its standard copiers to China. The Sanyo Electrical Company is  also considering shifting to China the production of television  sets, air-conditioners, refrigerators, and video-cameras. As of  late 1992, the Chinese Government had approved 3,694 investment  projects from Japan, with a negotiated investment of $5.97  billion, of which $3.88 billion were actually invested, 11.3  percent of all foreign investment in China. As Sino-Japanese  trade expands, Japan's investment in China will continue to grow  substantially, as indicated by the following:    First, research on the Chinese market and economy is being  taken seriously and the enthusiasm for investing in China is  still going strong among large-, medium-sized, and small  enterprises in Japan. There has been a marked increase in the  number of large investment projects in China. Accordingly,  economic and trade organizations along with banks and other  institutions in Japan have all augmented their research offices  and added staff to focus on changes in China's market and  economy and the situation surrounding this huge potential  consumer market. They regularly invite experts from the  pertinent research organizations in China to visit Japan to  brief them on China's economic reform and investment policy. A  number of banks have also put together China tours for their  customers so that they could get to understand China's  investment climate, etc., on the spot.    Second, investment consulting organizations have been set up  specifically targeting the market in China. The Babaiban Group  of Japan, a successful investor in the circulation sector in  China, recently created a "China commercial investment club" in  Tokyo. According to the group president, the investment climate  in China is very good at the moment. China needs Japan's  technology, experiences, and fund, so now is a good time for  Japan to open up a new market in China. Babaiban plans to open  1,000 stores in China by the year 2010. As they see it,  investing in the circulation business in China, where labor  costs are low, requires little investment in terms of equipment.  Even more important, China is a massive consumer market.    On the other hand, investing in China also presents some  problems, notably the following:    First, Japanese investors have indicated that some large  Japanese banks balk at making loans to small- and medium-sized  companies which want to invest in China because it is too risky.  This has dampened the interest of small- and medium-sized  companies in investing in China. However, if the Bank of China  would come forward to be the guarantor, the companies will find  it easier to obtain credit.    Second, there are signs of growing friction between Japanese  companies in China and the Chinese side over such issues as the  legal person status, the retention of foreign exchange, and the  examination of their financial and accounting systems.    Third, since 1992 there has been widespread concern among  Japanese investors about the overheating of the Chinese economy  which took place earlier and other problems like price increases  and unstable exchange rates. Endless price increases and rising  costs hurt the bottom line of joint ventures.    Fourth, the investment policy is too arbitrary and secretive  and there is an excess of administrative intervention.    2) Changes in the structure of Japanese investment in China    Direct Japanese investment in Asia (including China) has  changed in two remarkable ways since the latter half of 1980.  First, within the manufacturing sector, investment in  capital-intensive projects such as those in the electronic and  automobile industries now accounts for a rising share of total  investment. To encourage car-makers to invest in China, the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] in Japan  plans to hold regular meetings with the Chinese Government and  the enterprises, the focus being the automobile industry.  According to MITI estimates, China's annual automobile demand  will reach 3 to 5 million vehicles by the year 2000 (1.3 million  in 1992), most of them being family sedans. Japanese carmakers  will gradually shift their operations from Europe and United  States to China. Currently an excessive portion of total  investment goes to the non-manufacturing sector. In the future,  the center of gravity would gradually be shifted to the  manufacturing sector. Second, investment in the tertiary  industry has been rising relative to all investment. Japanese  investment in the tertiary industry is concentrated in banking,  commerce, and the restaurant trade. The well-known Babaiban  Group, for instance, expects to open close to 1,000 commercial  outlets in China by the year 2000.    2. Some Ideas on Expanding Sino-Japanese Trade and  Investment    1) On Expanding Sino-Japanese Trade    Despite the lingering recession in Japan and its diminished  demand for imports, the appreciation of the yen and mounting  pressure from the United States and Europe on Japan to open up  its market bode well for boosting Chinese exports to Japan.  Furthermore, the decision by Japan and the Coordinating  Committee on Export Controls [COCOM] to lift the embargo on a  growing number of products also makes it easier for China to  import from Japan.    However, there is concern in Japan's business community that  measures of macroeconomic regulation and control taken by China  to put the brakes on its overheated economy would worsen the  foreign trade environment and public psychology. To pave the way  for the resumption of China's membership in GATT, the renminbi  may yet be devalued again. As part of its market diversification  strategy and in order to reduce trade conflicts with the United  States and Europe, China will increase its imports from those  countries and South Korea, a move that will inevitably affect  the share of imports from Japan.    According to analyses, Chinese exports to Japan in 1993 will  grow at the same rate as in 1992 while imports are not expected  to increase as fast as in the preceding year. Sino-Japanese  trade is projected to grow 20 percent or so in 1993, for a total  value of $35 billion (Japanese customs figures). Specifically,  Chinese exports to Japan will rise 15 percent to about $19.5  billion; imports will go up about 30 percent to hit $15.5  billion. With imports rising faster than exports, China's trade  surplus with Japan will continue to shrink. Sino-Japanese trade  is projected to break the $50 billion barrier by 1995, making  China Japan's largest trading partner after the United States.    To develop Sino-Japanese trade, we need to examine a few  issues.    a) Sino-Japanese trade and investment are an important part  of economic and trade relations in Asia as a whole. A new  international trading pattern is taking shape today, one  characterized by growing economic regionalization. To turn its  economy around and prompted by self-interests and strategic  considerations, Japan is in the midst of refocusing its economic  and trade strategy to East Asia. With its expanding economy and  1.1 billion people, China naturally has become Japan's primary  target. It is important for them to further long-term  cooperation and enter into a lasting complementary economic  relationship. After establishing diplomatic ties and laboring  for over 20 years, China and Japan have built a friendly  cooperative relationship of mutual trust and complementariness.  This complementary relationship will assume more prominence and  the potential for developing bilateral economic and trade  cooperation is vast.    b) Trade disputes multiply and the anti-dumping issue must  be  faced up to. Nowadays protectionism is on the rise around the  world. As Sino-Japanese trade grows rapidly, trade friction  between the two countries may intensify. At a cabinet meeting on  29 January 1993, the Japanese Government decided to slap an  anti-dumping tax on manganese imports from China, the first time  Japan conducted an anti-dumping investigation and imposed an  anti-dumping tax on a foreign commodity invoking the terms of  GATT as well as its domestic tariff law. This move was also  unprecedented in the history of Sino-Japanese trade. Already  both the Japanese public and the government are deeply concerned  that Chinese textile imports are entering Japan excessively. The  possibility of a second anti-dumping investigation into a  Chinese product cannot be ruled out. We should give this matter  our full attention and come up with a response. No time should  be wasted in formulating all pertinent laws and regulations to  meet the new challenge. In addition, China should consider  acting correspondingly with regard to certain import commodities.    c) Enhance the competitiveness of export commodities and  expand our share of the Japanese market. The Japanese market is  ferociously competitive and highly demanding. Therefore it is  imperative that we never stop researching and developing new  commodities specifically with the changing characteristics of  the Japanese market in mind. In particular we need to marry  trade with science and technology to turn out more high added  value products and make ourselves more competitive. In addition  to ensuring the quality of Chinese products and broadening their  variety and design, we need to stabilize the supply of  merchandise long term and expand our exports to Japan. Recently  many customers have complained that the quality of Chinese  products has declined, deliveries are late, and export channels  are disorderly. All of that should be taken seriously by the  departments involved.    d) Use imports to increase exports. As the needs of economic  construction at home grow steadily, China will import  significantly more steel, machinery, and automobiles from Japan  in the future. Steel imports, in particular, are slated to rise  sharply. It has been calculated that China imported over 100  million tons of steel from Japan, enough to build 20 Laihu  bridges (at 600,000 tons per bridge), in the 20 years since the  two countries normalized their relations. At a time when the  Japanese economy is still in the doldrums and its currency is  rising in value, hurting its exports, the role played by China's  massive imports in economic growth in Japan is obvious. In  accordance with the principle of equality and mutual benefit,  therefore, China should continue to use imports to boost exports  to Japan, including electronic casts, conventional machine  tools, and coal.    e) Develop new commodities and cultivate the Japanese market  without cessation. Japan ran up a whopping $100 billion strong  surplus in its foreign trade account in 1992, to the intense  chagrin of the United States and countries in Europe which have  repeatedly pressured Japan to open up its domestic market, even  threatening to involve anti-dump provisions against Japan and  limit imports from Japan. Japan has no alternative but to open  up parts of its market in stages. This provides a good  opportunity for Chinese products to make their way into the  Japanese market. China has already acquired a wealth of  experience in attracting Japanese capital and technology,  improving packaging and design, and producing popular and  marketable products with a high added value. By spotting and  responding to trends and characteristics in the Japanese market,  we must be ready to adjust our export strategy anytime, for  example, by noting which commodities are going upscale, how uses  are being coordinated, and what designs are becoming  fashionable, and how improving packaging.    2) On Attracting Japanese Investment in China    a) The energy sector may well become the largest recipient  of  Japanese capital, a conclusion drawn from changes in Japan's  energy strategy.    In the wake of the disintegration of the Soviet Union and  changes in the Middle East, the energy community in Japan has  begun adjusting both the form and the strategy of its energy  trade. Instead of importing energy from abroad, which  essentially constitutes the current Japanese energy policy,  Japan is shifting to the development of energy resources  overseas. Japan's trade associations and oil companies have  begun petroleum prospecting overseas actively. Oil companies  also are getting heavily involved in the liquefied natural gas  market.    "Self-financed oil field" is the term used by Japan to refer  to an oil-field in which it has invested and whose crude oil  output it shares with the oil-producing nation in accordance  with a predetermined ratio. There is a fundamental difference  between Japanese and American or European international oil  capital: the Japanese petroleum community has no "self-financed  oil fields" or crude oil. This is the weakness of Japan's  corporations. After the first global energy crisis in 1973,  Japanese oil companies and leading trade associations acted on  the national policy of broadening the development of  self-financed oil-fields and got together to set up a joint  petroleum development corporation to begin oil prospecting  activities in Abu Dhabi, Indonesia, and China. However, with  U.S. and European companies already established there, the  Japanese found themselves shut out of the most productive  oil-fields. For the Japanese, this venture had very modest  results. In the late 1980's, major Japanese trade associations  abandoned investment-based oil trade, which is highly risky, one  after another. Taking advantage of the opportunity, Japanese oil  companies entered into direct trade with oil-producing nations  and the trend gained momentum. Their role in energy trade  weakened, the trade associations were forced to participate in  the international energy market via the "self-financed  oil-field" route. The appreciation of the yen and the explosion  of fixed assets during the "bubble economy" days gave Japanese  companies the financial wherewithal to invest in overseas oil  prospecting and extraction. The end of the Cold War between East  and West and the discovery of new oil-fields in countries like  Vietnam and Yemen also opened the door for the resurgence of  Japanese enterprises. Through a mix of competition and  cooperation, Japanese trade associations and oil companies are  in the process of putting together an integrated international  oil capital system in the U.S. and European mode.    In developing overseas energy resources, the Japanese  business community has not put all its eggs in the petroleum  basket. As interest in environmental protection intensifies  around the world, the demand for natural gas, which is far less  polluting than oil, is rising by the day. Power companies in  Japan have become more dependent on natural gas. In 1991, 28  percent of the electricity generated in Japan was derived from  petroleum, more than any other fuel. By the year 2000 the figure  is expected to fall below 20 percent. In contrast, 25 percent of  the power generated in the year 2000 will be derived from  natural gas, up from 22 percent in 1991. For this reason  Japanese enterprises have been rushing to invest in natural gas  development even as they put money into oil prospecting and  exploitation. This is the new characteristic of Japan's  involvement in the development of overseas energy resources.  China should diligently explore any opportunity to extract oil  and natural gas in cooperation with Japan.    b) The commercial and circulation sector can attract  Japanese  capital in a big way.    Since the circulation sector is a high-profit sector, it  must  be opened up to an extent that is just right. Specifically the  wholesale part of the sector cannot be opened while retail  operations can be thoroughly deregulated. Take advantage of this  opportunity to accelerate circulation reform as well.    c) The automobile industry may well become one of the  industries attracting most Japanese capital.    No major Japanese auto maker thus far has set up a  large-scale production base in China, where the automobile  market is one of the sectors with the most potential. Investing  in the Chinese car industry is the next big move in Japanese  investment, whether by transferring a plant here from Europe or  the United States, entering into a joint venture with China, or  setting up a wholly Japanese-owned enterprise. The Toyota  Corporation, for instance, plans to increase its assembling  capacity in Asia, including China, from 350,000 to 1 million  vehicles by the end of this century.    d) Most attractive to Japanese investors is the banking  industry. But a lot will depend on the deepening of banking  reform in China and how far China will go to open up banking to  foreign banks.</p>

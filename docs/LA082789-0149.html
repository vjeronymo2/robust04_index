			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BENEFITS OF GOLF COURSES VS. PARKS IN HUNTINGTON BEACH  </P> <P> The City Council had much to say last Monday night concerning the new proposed  golf course for Huntington Beach. Listening to those opposed to the idea had  you believing the next "Skins Game" was going to be played here.  </P> <P> The word "passive" was kicked around quite a bit. There is quite a bit of  passive park within the city limits of Huntington Beach. There are  approximately 60 parks within the city limits, including Central Park, with a  grand total of over 650 acres. Now that is what I call "enough passive" parks  and acreage for one city of this size.  </P> <P> What we need now is a way to continue to keep these parks flourishing for those  who want a passive park. Who said "golf course" as a money-maker? Great idea!  Lots of green grass, trees, water, sand and on top of all that, it helps to pay  for all those "passive parks" that don't earn a dime for the city.  </P> <P> Everyone in this city should be behind this new venture because it lightens the  tax load on all of us!  </P> <P> HOWARD D. SUBNICK  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

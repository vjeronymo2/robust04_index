			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Thomson to cut back on UK free newspapers THOMSON Corporation, the Canadian-controlled publishing and travel group, is severely curtailing its UK free-newspaper business, and selling or closing about one-seventh of its paid-for titles in North America. Thomson said yesterday that the planned disposals and closures will result in a USDollars 170m (Pounds 119m) charge against fourth-quarter 1992 earnings, which are due to be published in mid-March. A third of the writedown applies to publishing rights, circulation and goodwill at the UK free-newspaper operations, comprising about 70 weeklies under the Herald &amp; Post title. Citing the steep decline in advertising during the recession without the benefit of circulation revenues, Thomson said yesterday that 'we will be involved to a much lesser extent in the free newspaper business'. The company has not yet decided, however, which titles will be sold or closed. Several may be merged into larger units. The process is expected to take up to a year. None of Thomson's paid-for UK regional newspapers will be affected. Mr Gordon Paul, chief executive of Thomson Regional Newspapers in the UK, denied there was any fundamental change of direction. But he said: 'I do not want to pretend we are not going to review our business.' Thomson also plans to sell or close about 30 of its 217 daily and weekly papers in the US and Canada. The company refused to identify them, except to say they are all in small communities. Thomson shares lost 38 cents to CDollars 14 in early trading on the Toronto stock exchange.</p>

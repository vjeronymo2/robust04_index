			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A man convicted of killing another inmate at County Jail in Chula Vista last  year was sentenced Wednesday to 20 years to life in state prison.  </P> <P> Steve Edward Morrison, 39, of Mira Mesa, was given 16 years to life for the  April 14, 1989, attack upon Luis Jose Mena, 45, who died three weeks later.  </P> <P> San Diego Superior Court Judge David Gill gave Morrison four more years, which  will run consecutively, for Morrison's four prior convictions for burglary,  auto theft and escaping from custody.  </P> <P> Morrison's 20-year sentence is to run consecutively to a four-year sentence  imposed May 26 on the burglary charge for which Morrison was in jail at the  time of the murder.  </P> <P> A jury found Morrison not guilty of first-degree murder on Jan. 31, but ruled  he was guilty of second-degree murder.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Evan Miller argued that Morrison killed Mena with a large  push broom because he hated child molesters. Mena was in custody on a probation  violation of a child-molestation conviction.  </P> <P> Mena was struck six to 10 times, said inmates who testified at the trial, and  he suffered a fractured skull and brain damage.  </P> <P> Gill also fined Morrison $400.  </P> <P> Miller said crowding at the jail was not necessarily a factor in the slaying.  </P></p>

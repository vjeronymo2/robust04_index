			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 7 KYODO -- A senior Japanese  economic official met with U.S. Trade Representative [TR] Mickey  Kantor in Washington on Thursday [7 April] but said he is not on  a trouble-shooting mission to mend Japan's rocky trade ties with  the United States. "I have no request on the part of my  government," Nobuo Matsunaga, Japan's government representative  for external economic affairs, told reporters after a private  session with Kantor.    Matsunaga, who heads a think tank on international  relations,  said he called on Kantor for advice on setting up a private  forum to promote economic cooperation between Japan and North  America. "Most of our conversations were about the forum I am  thinking to establish," Matsunaga said.    Matsunaga, a close confidant of Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, insisted he and Kantor did not discuss any specific  issues on how to resume stalled bilateral framework trade talks.    But Matsunaga said he stressed to Kantor the importance to  maintaining healthy bilateral ties between Japan and the United  States, a conviction he said Kantor shared. "I am convinced  that we can ultimately sort out our differences," Matsunaga  later told reporters.    Matsunaga said he met with both Hosokawa and Foreign  Minister  Tsutomu Hata before coming to Washington and will report back to  Hosokawa after returning home this weekend. Apart from Kantor,  he met with the top state department official in charge of  economic relations, Undersecretary of State Joan Spero, on  Wednesday.    On Friday, Matsunaga is scheduled to meet separately with  Robert Rubin, head of the White House National Economic Council,  and Presidential National Security Adviser Tony Lake.    Matsunaga's trip to Washington came as the Clinton  administration was shifting to a less confrontational approach  in resolving trade disputes with Tokyo.    "We are moving in a measured and responsible and careful  manner in order to work with Japan," Kantor told reporters  Thursday.    Kantor said he expects to review all outstanding trade  issues  between Japan and the U.S. when he sees Hata next week in  Morocco. "I expect we will have a good meeting," Kantor said.    Kantor and Hata are going to Morocco to join trade and  foreign ministers from around the world in signing a new global  trade pact.</p>

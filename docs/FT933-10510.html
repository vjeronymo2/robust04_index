			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / De Klerk set to send in more troops PRESIDENT FW de Klerk of South Africa said yesterday he was ready to send more troops into black townships to stem violence in which nearly 100 people have died in five days, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. 'The troops are there already, we can send in more, and if necessary we will not hesitate to send in more,' Mr de Klerk said after attending a caucus of his National party. He said the government supported the idea of a multi-party peacekeeping force proposed on Monday by the African National Congress but added that he envisaged it as an auxiliary force charged with tasks such as crowd control. It could not replace the existing security forces which would remain under government control. Democracy negotiators on Tuesday asked a special technical committee on political violence to draft plans for such a force.</p>

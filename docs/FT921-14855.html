			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Trinity gets Pounds 27m for packaging side TRINITY International, the Chester-based publisher of the Liverpool Daily Post and Echo and local weekly newspapers in the US, Canada, north-west England and North Wales, is to sell its papermaking and packaging division to Danish Paper Packaging for Pounds 27m cash. The division has been a big profit earnerbut has been struggling in the recession. It made Pounds 5.42m out of the group's Pounds 18.2m in 1990, compared with Pounds 6.05m out of Pounds 17.7m in 1989. The price paid by Danish suggest the 1991 performance will turn out below Pounds 4m. Trinity had been deliberating about investing Pounds 15m-Pounds 20m to keep the business competitive. Its main product is the corrugated board used in cardboard boxes for bottled goods. Trinity went into the business in 1961, when it started to diversify out of its economically threatened Merseyside base. With the packaging industry consolidating throughout Europe and becoming dominated by larger, specialised groups, Trinity decided to divest. It will continue to look for acquisitions to expand its core media interests. Mr David Snedden, chief executive, said yesterday: 'We could not be certain of adequately rewarding our shareholders by spending more money on papermaking and packaging. We intend to stick to the communications game." Trinity yesterday also announced a series of senior appointments signalling the management succession of Mr Snedden, and Mr Christopher Czilinsky, managing director of the Liverpool Daily Post Mr Philip Graf, group corporate development director, will become deputy chief executive next month. Mr Snedden retires next year. Mr Czilinsky, who retires in a few weeks, will be succeeded by Mr Leo Coligan. Last year Trinity backed Mr Phil Redmond, the television programme-maker, in his rejected bid for the Granada TV franchise. It also applied to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for permission to bid for Southern Newspapers, the Southampton-based printing, property and publishing group. This led to Reed, Emap, and Westminster Press ' part of Pearson, owner of the Financial Times ' also seeking clearance to bid. But the price of Southern's shares then rose to 295p, so no bid was made. The price has since fallen to 245p. The groups can again decide whether to bid in the summer, after a six-month interval.</p>

			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Letter: The broader arguments against means testing Sir, John Willman ('Means to a public spending end', October 19) concludes that 'with pressure on public expenditure now growing, criticism of universal benefits is likely to become increasingly difficult to resist,' and cites in particular child benefit and retirement pensions as candidates for the means test. In the course of his article, however, he puts several cogent arguments against further means-testing - including its manifest failure to deliver benefits to all who need them and its negative impact on incentives to work and to save. But this does not exhaust the debate, of course. Right-wingers, for example, have become increasingly concerned about the growing intrusion of the state into people's private lives which the spread of means-testing has already brought about. Means-testing child benefit and/or pensions would hit precisely those households on modest means whom Labour was concerned about when putting forward its own pre-election tax proposals. And means-tested benefits, in the context of a society which puts such a premium on individual economic success, are too often seen as a badge of failure, both by their recipients and by those who fund them. If resources are tight, there are many forms of public spending - or foregone tax revenue - which would repay close examination before we get to 'universal' benefits. A society which used its social security system merely to relieve poverty once it had struck would have a distressingly narrow view of 'welfare'.

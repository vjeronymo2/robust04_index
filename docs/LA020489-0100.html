			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> The Federal Trade Commission, clearing the way for the nation's biggest merger,  agreed not to challenge the $24.5-billion acquisition of RJR Nabisco by  Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. -- provided that the two companies sell  certain products to reduce their market shares in ketchup, Oriental foods and  packaged nuts. The commission, ruling on a preliminary agreement announced  earlier this week, said KKR must within a year sell the Chun King Oriental  foods line of RJR Nabisco or the La Choy line of Beatrice/Hunt-Wesson Inc., a  unit of KKR; the Planters nuts line of RJR Nabisco or Beatrice's Fisher nuts  line, and RJR Nabisco's Del Monte ketchup or Beatrice's Hunt's ketchup. An FTC  official said that, if the brands were combined, they would have "probably  slightly under 60%" of total sales of $300 million in Oriental foods; about 25%  of the $500 million ketchup market, and about 50% of $1.5 billion in sales of  packaged nuts.  </P></p>

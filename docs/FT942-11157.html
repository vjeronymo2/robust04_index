			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Alumina terminal opened on Russia's east coast An Anglo-Russian project to open up one of the bottlenecks that has restricted the import of an essential raw material for the Russian aluminium industry became operational this week when 25,600 tonnes of alumina (aluminium oxide) was unloaded by new facilities at the east coast port of Vanino. The bulk alumina handling facilities, costing 'several million dollars,' are jointly owned by by Trans-World Metals, the UK-based trading group, and the Vanino Port Authority, one of the new Russian joint stock companies. Russia has only one other such handling facility, at Murmansk. According to Mr Alan Bekhor, managing director of Trans-World, said to be the biggest trader in Russian aluminium: 'The Vanino facilities open the way for alumina to get to Russia more efficiently. They represent a logical link between Australia, the world's biggest alumina producer, and Russia's big Siberian smelters.' The first alumina through the facilities was bought from Alcoa of Australia. Mr Bekhor said that within three months a second stage would lift the bulk alumina handling capacity at Vanino to 50,000 tonnes a month. The port is at one end of the Baikal-Amur railway which runs parallel to the Trans-Siberian railway. In theory the facilities are available to all but 'Trans-World will probably keep them busy for the rest of this year.' However, Mr Bekhor stressed: 'This is a long-term investment and there will be no quick returns.'</p>

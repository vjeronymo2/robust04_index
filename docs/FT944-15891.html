			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Fashion: A warrior shows off her armour - Me and My Wardrobe / Jane Mulvagh meets Steve Shirley Remember 'Power Dressing' as depicted by the glossy magazines? A slip of a girl in a shocking pink suit - all legs and heels - playing the corporate game. By the 1990s strident was out and the silhouette collapsed under the weight of recession and white-collar unemployment. So, was the Power Suit just a fashionable carapace to be shed as easily? Not for Steve Shirley. It is armour and she has been fighting behind it for 40 years, decades before the soubriquet 'Career Woman' was born. Donned for survival rather than fashion, her shell is as integral a part of her being as an armadillo's. 'I have contributed to the substantial world, not the fantasy world,' she insists. 'This is the trouble with fashion magazines; all they are concerned with is fantasy.' Steve Shirley has not softened one iota in spite of her success - she founded FI Group, a publicly quoted company which now has a Pounds 40m turnover; she has been awarded an OBE and countless honorary degrees; and is Master of The Worshipful Company of Information Technologists.  -Vera Stephanie Shirley (nee Buchthal) arrived in Britain in 1939, a five-year-old Jewish refugee and orphan accompanied only by her sister. At 18 she got a job as a science assistant in the civil service. She got by on a pittance, taking night classes in maths. There were so few women in the lower clerical ranks that she learnt to dress to blend in. 'I was more concerned to hide my poverty, than my femininity,' she says. She had two skirts, grey and black, and two tops in dark colours that could be washed overnight. White was impractical as it showed the wear and tear. By the age of 23 she had a maths degree, by 26 a husband and by 27, a graduate position. On up the ladder and middle management ranks required another skin - invisibility was replaced by transexual disguise. 'I took advice from a senior woman who warned me, 'Do not forget, you are there as an honorary man, so dress accordingly]'' Adopting the name Steve, she wore grey flannel suits, pin-tucked shirts, black velvet ties and flat sensible shoes to secure her footing on the next rung. 'Covering up . . . that is important in business,' she believes. The man's name, the suit, will power and ability earnt her credibility and by 1962 she had founded the FI computer software company. Could she decorate herself now? 'No - fashion was way, way, away. It was a question of clothing,' she retorts. Gradually, the conformity of the grey suit was replaced by the markings of a lone predator and a leader. Like a traditional soldier, she wore the bravado hues of boardroom battle. Colour was a weapon. She talks of reds with 'impact', 'powerful' blues, 'strong' purples, 'sharp' greens and 'my favourite yellow . . . the Jewish colour of the stars worn in the ghettoes . . . I am visually literate, that is certainly true, and I appreciate colour. 'I did Luscher's personality profile test - you choose the colours you prefer. Mine were extreme - vibrant reds and oranges. It clearly showed that I had drive and the clashing choices proved that I had the ability to cope with problems and change. I need the stress. 'My husband thought I ought to dress better when I went into the office  - not just when I went out selling - to assert my station.' Wishing to conform to the emerging dress codes of women in the boardroom, she sought professional advice. Nothing was left to chance. Launching herself into the public domain, she was invited to make speeches. And at 61 that public image persists and is being polished every day. Methodically she researches every detail: she asks what colour backdrop she will be speaking against and wears the right colours for maximum impact. With them, she wears white training shoes, to avoid making a noise when mounting the rostrum. 'Remember - a dozen people see you for each person you speak to. So dress to be noticed.' After 25 years as chairman and chief executive, she ceded control of the FI Group to her workforce. Not wishing to challenge her nominated successor's authority, clothes were used to signal non-threatening support. 'For the first year I wore softer dresses, but then I went back to suits. I did not want people to think that I had retired.' The lessons learnt, she now wishes to pass them on. 'All things being equal, I would always appoint a woman,' she says, insisting that positive discrimination is her right, as without her the company would not exist. She dispatches subordinates to be sharpened up sartorially; she gives younger 'sisters' a leg up the corporate ladder. 'To move into senior management and a leadership role I tell them that they must raise their energy level with exercise, and dress more like a leader. You will not get that promotion unless you dress for the next stage up. You may have sterling qualities but you will not have that punch. Clothes simulate it.' She recommends classic, non-sexual, tailored clothes, no trousers, no frills, and nothing 'pseudo'. By this she means costume jewellery, for example. It is important to proclaim financial success, especially in the US. Shirley is acquisitive about antique jewellery. 'I lost everything and I want my jewellery to look as though it is an heirloom.' Does she enjoy clothes? 'Er . . .yes. That sense of knowing you are wearing expensive stuff. To a refugee who has been really poor that is important, really important. I will probably never get over the fact that my mother collected candle ends.' With a touching and melancholy frankness she went further: 'I have a profoundly handicapped child. While he was still at home everything we had was smashed, and my clothes were something that could not get broken.' We pass through her austere abode up to her treasure trove. Three wardrobes stuffed with row upon row of neat plastic bags, all colour-coded and sheltering her triumphant suits - perhaps 100 or more. One senses that she longs to indulge after a lifetime's struggle; to soften up. But even at home she wears a suit. Does she like sexy clothes? 'A friend of mine was a consultant for Zandra Rhodes. I tried on a dress and felt very, very sexy but immediately I knew it wasn't me. I am not sentimental or illogical about clothes. But power is quite an aphrodisiac. I get propositioned much more than I would expect at my age.' Shirley is still in the thick of the fray, fighting not only for herself but for others now - for the disabled, for women students and entrepreneurs, for equality. When you have been a warrior all your life, it is hard to put aside your armour.</p>

Police in Zhaoqing carried out an undercover action on  November 2 last year after learning that drug traffickers from  Hong Kong had gone there with a big amount of money for trading  drugs with a local drug-dealer at his luxury residence. The  police launched a raid on the drug-traffickers early the  following early morning when the four suspects appeared outside  the house carrying bulging bags. They were arrested and 7,500  grams of heroin were found in the bags. The police also  captured three other suspects inside the house and discovered  RMB 620,000 in cash which had been brought there by the Hong  Kong suspects as well as 8,700 grams of heroin.    The police went on the same day to arrest two other suspects  who had sneaked into Shenzhen from Hong Kong and were found to  be accomplices in the drug-trafficking. Two more hideouts for  the drug trade were smashed in the urban area of Zhaoqing with  five drug-traffickers arrested.    Further raids were later carried out in Yunnan, Guangxi and  Luoding in Guangdong with the ring-leader together with six  suspects being captured. The drug ring was wiped out with the  elimination of the drug route by which the drugs were first  brought in from Yunnan and transported to Zhaoqing in Guangdong  via Guangxi for later shipment to Hong Kong drug dealers.</p>

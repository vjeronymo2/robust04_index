			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Survey of Greece (1): Power struggle mars recovery - Greece may be heading for a period of political instability that could wreck the government's attempts to reform the economy. Kerin Hope discusses the problems facing the EC's poorest nation, as two elderly politicians battle to win the approval of voters TO THE frustration of most Greeks, the country's elderly political leaders seem to think they are no less immortal than the gods on Mount Olympus. With his popularity at an all-time low, Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis is preparing constitutional amendments which would restore some executive power to the president. He hopes to take over in 1995, when the incumbent, Constantine Karamanlis, is due to step down. However, Andreas Papandreou, the opposition leader, whose health is already too fragile to permit putting in a full day's work, is just as keen to become head of state, according to senior members of his Panhellenic Socialist Movement. Both men are 75, but according to the unwritten rules of Greek party politics, neither can be unseated without first losing a parliamentary election. That is due to take place next spring, though it may come earlier if the quarrels in Mr Mitsotakis's conservative party get out of hand. Whatever happens, Greece appears to be headed for a period of political instability that could wreck the present government's efforts to put the economy on a sounder footing. Few analysts would bet on parliament being able to elect a new president with the required three-fifths majority. The alternative is a fresh election, followed by a presidential vote decided by a simple majority in the 300-member house. Mr Stefanos Manos, the economy minister, is already under pressure to relax wage restraints and curbs on public sector hiring. Yet even if he gives way, it is probably too late for the conservatives to claw back enough votes to stay in power. Conservative supporters are just as enraged as the socialists over the govern-ment's privatisation pro-gramme, which, among other things, calls for selling 49 per cent of OTE, the state telecoms company, by the end of 1993, and launching private sector power generation, without the participation of DeH, the state-owned electricity producer. Opposition to privatisation stems from the realisation that the practice of making patronage appointments to public sector corporations, whose bloated workforce exceeds 100,000, would immediately end. Nor can the conservatives hope to scrape home on the back of an economic recovery, originally forecast for the end of the year. The target of single-digit inflation by December is slipping, with 12 per cent now the best that Mr Manos can hope for. Moreover, the official prediction of 2 per cent growth in 1993 has been reduced by half. The government's position is further weakened by the recent decision of Mr Antonis Samaras, the former foreign minister, to found his own political splinter group. Mr Samaras, sacked last year for his hardline stance in Greece's dispute with Macedonia over the former Yugoslav republic's choice of name, retains a strong personal following among voters. In spite of having age on his side - he is 42 - Mr Samaras's bid to capture the middle ground between reform-minded conservatives and moderate socialists is undermined by his reputation for outspoken nationalism. Indeed his main parliamentary support comes from a group of extreme rightwing backbenchers. Because the conservatives have only a one-seat majority in parliament, Mr Mitsotakis faces the uncomfortable prospect of being held hostage by Mr Samaras's supporters until the election. Yet, the potential for internal division would be just as strong in Pasok, if Mr Papandreou were obliged to step aside because of failing health. If the socialists return to power, Mr Papandreou would be likely to conserve his energies by appointing a pair of deputy prime ministers to handle day-to-day running of the government. Nobody expects Mr Papandreou to make the succession process easier by naming a political heir. The result could be a long, drawn-out power struggle, again with potentially disastrous consequences for management of the economy. Greece's policy on ex-Yugoslavia is in any case contradictory, with the government being repeatedly criticised abroad for failing to crack down on Greek companies defying sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro - although the Greek navy participates in the Nato blockade of the Adriatic coastline. Indeed, the traditional Greek friendship with Serbia has grown stronger since the start of the Bosnian war underlining how the government is being pulled simultaneously in different directions: by its perceived interests in the Balkans and by the responsibilities of belonging to western institutions. On the other hand, there seems little chance that Greece will ignite a crisis in the southern Balkans. With 200,000 Albanian migrant workers already in the country, the government is well aware of the problems that a massive influx of refugees from Kosovo and Macedonia would create. Any Greek involvement in the Balkan imbroglio would also raise an immediate territorial threat, by encouraging Turkey to intervene on behalf of the ethnic Turkish minority in Thrace. Political problems and regional anxieties have tended to overshadow the progress which has been made on economic reform. Mr Manos has tried to clean up the public sector balance sheet, reforming the pension system in the face of stiff union opposition and rescheduling a heavy burden of domestic debt left over from the 1980s. He has brought in international auditors to straighten out the accounts at public sector corporations. By contrast with his predecessors, he shows a willingness to act on the advice provided by outside experts. One result is that in spite of technical hitches and resistance from within the revenue service, computerisation of main tax offices is finally under way. If nothing else, this year's revenue shortfall has spurred the government into making greater efforts to close holes in the tax net. Greeks must now record their personal tax number on an unlikely variety of documents, from car insurance to telephone bills. Abolition of price controls has given competition a boost, while the labour market is more flexible with the introduction of part-time work and liberalisation of shopping hours. The official unemployment figure has stabilised at around 9 per cent, giving credence to the government's claim that more than 150,000 new jobs have been created in the past three years. Despite present economic constraints, the structural reforms should improve the outlook for medium-term growth, based on much-increased aid inflows from the EC. Greece should receive Ecu18bn over the next five years from the community's structural funds. It will also be entitled to another Ecu2.5bn from the new cohesion fund for improving transport and environmental protection in the four poorer community states. Most of the new EC funding is destined for important infrastructure projects, notable by their absence during the past decade. Greece is desperately short of motorways, many regional airports lack radar equipment and ports are badly in need of expansion. With the overland route to EC markets closed by the war in Bosnia, improving communications in western Greece to link up with Italy is crucially important. If the politicians could switch their attention to practical matters, there is much that could be done.</p>

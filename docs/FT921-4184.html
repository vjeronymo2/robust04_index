			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): Matches escape the net - Excise Duty THE DUTY on matches and mechanical lighters, which was introduced during the First World War, will be abolished next year as a result of the falling yield derived from declining match sales and the increase in smuggling of lighters. The Chancellor believed it would be difficult for Customs to collect the tax after the removal of fiscal frontiers in the EC on January 1 1993. Matches and lighters are not subject to duty in all EC countries. In 1990-91 about Pounds 6m duty was raised from matches and Pounds 11m from lighters. The current rates of duty are 0.6p per box of 40 matches and 50p per lighter.</p>

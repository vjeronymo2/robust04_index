			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CITY TO FORM PROP. G POLICE REVIEW BOARD  </P> <P> San Diego city officials have decided to implement a new police review board  approved by voters under Proposition G in November and not to wait for the  outcome of a lawsuit challenging the city attorney's ruling that a rival,  tougher review board should also be impaneled.  </P> <P> George Penn, an assistant to the city manager, said Friday that he expects the  Proposition G panel to be in operation by mid-May, noting that the city already  has received the names of 50 people nominated to serve on the review board.  </P> <P> Penn also said that, if the courts rule in favor of the rival review board  under Proposition F, which was also approved by voters, then both panels would  be created.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Sensitive to This Problem'  </P> <P> "We're sensitive to this problem," Penn told the luncheon gathering at the  Catfish Club, an organization made up primarily of minority business and  community leaders in San Diego.  </P> <P> "If a court of law says we must have two police review boards, we'll implement  both."  </P> <P> Final ballot totals last November showed that both Propositions F and G  received a majority of "yes" votes. Proposition F's tally was 179,102 to  155,341, and Proposition G drew 179,917 to 160,166.  </P> <P> Because Proposition G had 815 more "yes" votes, the city attorney ruled that  that board should be created. It calls for a board appointed by the city  manager, but in most other respects it would be similar to the current police  review board.  </P> <P> The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit last month, contending that  the Proposition F board should also be impaneled. That board calls for a review  process in which police officers would be subpoenaed to testify in closed  hearings about allegations of misconduct.  </P> <P> A March 21 court hearing is scheduled in the lawsuit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> In Favor of Review Mechanism  </P> <P> Penn said the fact that both propositions received a majority of approval votes  shows that citizens are indeed concerned about allegations of police misconduct  and are in favor of some kind of police review mechanism to ensure that errant  officers are properly disciplined.  </P> <P> He said that, whether one review board or two panels are created, the board  members must remember that they represent the public and do not simply mimic  the Police Department. He said many review boards across the country have  failed because they found themselves acting as apologists for their local  police officials.  </P> <P> "You're there as a board member to serve a function, to be an advocate for the  community," Penn said.  </P> <P> The members of the existing police review board, formed in 1987, were appointed  by both the city manager and the police chief, a process that irritated many  community leaders and led to the ballot proposals for an alternative review  method.  </P> <P> Penn said none of the current review board members would be included in either  of the two new boards because voters made it clear they do not want the police  chief involved in the appointments. "You can see the obvious perception of  impropriety if someone is chosen by the police chief," he said.  </P></p>

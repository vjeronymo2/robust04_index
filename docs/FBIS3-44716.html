Statistics show that in 1993 the telecommunications sector  reported a sales value of more than 6.8 billion yuan and more  than 1.6 billion yuan in profits and taxes, doubling the figures  for the previous year.    There are now 18 high-tech telecommunications enterprises in  Shanghai, ten of which are joint-funded ones. They cover wire  and wireless telecommunications, satellite telecommunications,  transmission equipment and terminals.    A senior official in charge of the sector said that the  partnership of major foreign corporations was a major cause of  the rapid development of the industry.    In 1993 the telecommunications sector agreed upon seven  projects altogether with the Siemens company of Germany, Ricoh  of Japan and AT&amp;T of the U.S. They involve a total investment  of 200 million U.S. dollars.    When completed, these projects will increase their output  value by six billion yuan. The Shanghai Ricoh company alone  will add two billion yuan. It is planning to turn out 400,000  fax machines a year.</p>

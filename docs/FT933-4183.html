			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Major puts down revolt by right wing over taxation MR JOHN MAJOR, the prime minister, yesterday sought to exert his authority on the government by facing down a right-wing revolt on taxation and warning ministers not to step out of line in future. In a robust lecture to the first cabinet meeting for six weeks, Mr Major warned that grass roots Conservative activists were fed up with government disunity. He said the government must unite around agreed policies and draw a line under the battering it has sustained since its unexpected victory in the 1992 general election. The message was rammed home by Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, who reported on soundings taken from more than 150 constituency chairmen in the past week. Sir Norman said regional officials were desperate for a renewed sense of unity in the party, and tired of the splits and recriminations of the past year. He also confirmed the party's decision to concentrate its resources on fighting the growing threat posed by the Liberal Democrats in the south and south-west of England. Rightwing hopes of heading off the possibility of tax increases in the November budget were torpedoed in a forthright intervention by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. Mr Clarke forestalled any challenge to his budget strategy by saying all options remain open and ruling out a renegotiation of next year's agreed spending total. His vigorous defence of the chancellor's traditional right to control budget-making silenced rightwing ministers, who judged it prudent to drop plans to air the taxation issue. However, Mr Clarke pleased rightwingers in a speech to the CBI in Glasgow, in which he reaffirmed the government's determination to cut spending in the long term and promised a second year of tough controls on public sector pay. 'I have read some mistaken speculation that I might relax on the public pay front. Do not worry,' the chancellor said. 'We need to see the current pay realism continue.' Trade union leaders at the TUC conference in Brighton were dismayed. Some warned of industrial action if the government tried to tighten this year's 1.5 per cent limit on pay rises. Mr Alan Jinkinson , general secretary of Unison, the public service union, said he had no doubt about the 'serious consequences' of another year of imposed pay policy: 'Public service workers have already paid an unfair price for the government's inept mismanagement of the economy.' Most of the cabinet discussion took place at a one and a half hour meeting - held without officials - which followed a formal half-hour official cabinet meeting restricted largely to administrative matters. The tone of the debate reflects Mr Major's determination to exert a firmer grip on the government, which he believes can revive its popularity in line with economic recovery. However, rightwing backbenchers continued to claim that any increases in tax would be suicidal for the government. The tax nettle, Page 6 Joe Rogaly, Page 18</p>

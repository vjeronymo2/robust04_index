			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / International Company News: Philips to raise stake in Indian venture PHILIPS, the Dutch consumer electronics group, is increasing its holding in Pieco Electronics and Electricals, its Indian venture, to 51 per cent from 39.7 per cent, taking advantage of liberalisation of local foreign ownership laws. It also plans to enter the country's expanding telecommunications product market. Pieco will revert to its earlier name, Philips India, and become part of Philips' worldwide operations. It hopes the Philips brand name will boost consumer sales, now about 57 per cent of Pieco's turnover. By December, Pieco's share capital will be increased to Rs455m (Dollars 16m) from Rs333m, with the Dutch parent contributing Rs340m - the cost of buying an additional 11 per cent of the company's capital at a premium of Rs30 a share. Philips India and Philips Kommunications Industrie (PKI), Philips' Nuremberg-based subsidiary, will set up a pilot project in New Delhi to produce equipment based on synchronous digital hierarchy technology pioneered by the German company. Philips India, with technological support from Philips Telecom of Cambridge in the UK, will introduce a range of telecommunication equipment, such as private mobile radios and wide-area pagers. A factory will be built in Calcutta with a projected investment of Rs150m to augment and modernise Philips' facilities.</p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHERE IS ARTS SUPPORT COMING FROM?;  </P> <P> FUNDING: CULTURAL LEADERS CONCLUDE THAT COLLABORATION IS THE KEY TO SURVIVAL AT  A WORKSHOP ON 'SUPPORT FOR THE ARTS IN UNSUPPORTIVE TIMES.'  </P> <P> Arts funding is in big trouble and collaboration is the ticket to survival,  according to cultural leaders who convened last week in Los Angeles. They put  their heads together at "Support for the Arts in Unsupportive Times," a  workshop sponsored by the Frederick R. Weisman Art Foundation at the Century  Plaza Hotel.  </P> <P> "We don't have an agenda," said foundation director Henry Hopkins before the  group launched into a wide-ranging discussion of financial matters that also  considered such issues as censorship and multicultural representation.  </P> <P> Neither did the foundation expect the 20 participants to arrive at conclusions  or a plan for action. They didn't. A few of their number even took issue with  the workshop theme. Artist David Ireland said he had been "generously taken  care of by different foundations," and philanthropist Max Palevsky contended,  "If there is any time in the history of the world that the arts have been  supported, it's now . . . If you look at numbers, dollars and activities, these  are far from unsupportive times."  </P> <P> The prevailing view held that most arts organizations are dangerously  overextended -- and some are endangered. As the talks evolved, several villains  emerged -- sluggish museums, hidebound boards of trustees, the political right,  the press and John Frohnmayer, head of the embattled National Endowment for the  Arts.  </P> <P> But the group laid most problems at its own doorstep.  </P> <P> "The structures we have developed to support the arts are houses of cards,"  said Ella King Torry, of the Pew Charitable Trusts, noting that dependence on  earned income, box office or a few donors is "a shaky system" at best. "It's  like the homeless," she said. "If two things go wrong, if you have a bad season  and one of your funders falls out, you could go under."  </P> <P> Boards of trustees' system of governance also came under attack. "Our field is  not given to institutionalization and it should not be institutionalized for  the most part," said Claire Peeps, program director of the Los Angeles  Festival.  </P> <P> "As long as boards are made up of extremely rich Caucasian individuals those  boards will be inherently conservative," said Gary Garrels, director of the New  York-based DIA Foundation, who joined a chorus of concern about multicultural  representation in arts management.  </P> <P> "Responsibility is the central issue," said Tom Reese, associate director of  the Getty Center of the History of Art and the Humanities. "Money is what  boards understand" and they want to measure what they are getting for their  money. This leads to administrators developing "mission statements" that  outline their objectives. Then, they concern themselves about "the creation of  a product" that fits the statement rather than working as free agents, he said.  </P> <P> Isolation in various guises is also an endemic problem, according to the  speakers. Institutions have isolated themselves from artists because they are  preoccupied with their own survival. Trustees are isolated from multicultural  and community concerns. And the art world at large has not been accountable to  a large audience. In times of financial and political stress these facts make  it difficult for arts groups to speak from a position of unity and power,  participants said.  </P> <P> Problems seemed to be more apparent than solutions, however.  </P> <P> Cee Scott Brown, director of Creative Time in New York, said that he prefers to  get along without National Endowment for the Arts money -- considering its onus  of censorship -- and suggested establishing an alternate fund. But most other  speakers weren't ready to give up on the NEA or to accept the idea that the  private sector could or should pick up the slack. Instead, they advocated  restoring the endowment to an apolitical position or changing it so that it  functions more effectively.  </P> <P> "The NEA belongs to the people . . . It's the stamp of national approval that  puts art on the agenda," said Bella Lewitzky, director of the Bella Lewitzky  Dance Company. Lewitzky turned down a $72,000 NEA grant rather than sign an  anti-obscenity pledge and has filed suit against the agency. One of the  endowment's major assets is that it has been "more objective" and less subject  to petty politics than state or local arts councils, she said.  </P> <P> Countering talk of gloom and doom, philanthropist Peter Norton said that loss  of traditional support for the arts and an increase of censorship is a pendulum  sweep that offers possibilities for positive change. "It's very unfashionable  to be a white male now. Old fogies are on the run. We can't lose the custodians  of money and power and not expect to have lost anything. Diversity has a price,  but the decline of support from the old fogies is something we ought to  celebrate. It is something we certainly ought to adjust to."  </P> <P> A "lean time" may be "a better time" that will lead artists and institutions to  "do more with less and do it better," Norton said. How to do it better was the  subject of much questioning, however. Among the tentative, vague and admittedly  flawed suggestions: establishing barter systems and revenue-raising ventures  such as restaurants and artist-designed products, looking at the ways art is  supported in other countries, making more creative use of percent-for-art  monies and encouraging foundations to fund learning projects rather than  exhibitions.  </P> <P> The National Gallery of Art in Washington came under fire from Hopkins, who  suggested that the gallery's annual windfall of $40 million in government funds  may not be the best use of that money. He questioned whether "the nation's art"  should be "locked up in one museum" in the East and asked why the gallery  doesn't charge admission to offset expenses as other museums must.  </P> <P> The only consensus that emerged from the two-day meeting was a call for  collaboration, and even that seems fraught with peril. Several participants  pointed out that collaborative projects take more time and rarely satisfy  anyone. They also reminded one another that artists are creative loners.  </P> <P> But a hunkered-down mood -- along with heightened multicultural sensitivities  -- led speakers to agree that a new, pervasive kind of cooperation is needed if  the arts are to serve a larger public on a smaller budget.  </P> <P> "Collaboration is our future," said arts advocate Joy Silverman. It was one of  the few workshop pronouncements that went unchallenged.  </P></p>

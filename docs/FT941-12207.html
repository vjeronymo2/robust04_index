			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Lawson backed for top job at OECD The British government is backing Lord Lawson, the former chancellor, to be the next secretary-general of the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The job of running the 'club' of 24 industrialised nations falls vacant in September when Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the present secretary-general, completes his second five-year term of office. Mr Paye, a former French diplomat, is again a candidate for the job, as is Mr Donald Johnston, a Canadian Liberal politician. British government officials said yesterday that Lord Lawson was ideally qualified, pointing out that he was a strong supporter of international economic co-operation when chancellor. The OECD secretary-general has a tax-free salary of FFr91,000 a month (about Pounds 125,000 a year), a flat in the elegant 16th arrondissement of Paris and a chauffeur-driven car, and can qualify for additional allowances. The succession will be discussed by OECD ambassadors, aiming at a consensus by June. Lord Lawson's candidature is unusual because he has a heavyweight political background, whereas recent OECD heads have been bureaucrats. However, there is a growing tendency to put strong political figures into such posts - for example Mr Peter Sutherland's appointment as director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr Paye has earned praise for his stewardship of the OECD, but has adopted a low profile at a time of dramatic upheaval in the world economy. The OECD, which serves as a source of advice and a forum for exchanging views among its members, is also facing change, with Mexico negotiating membership and South Korea, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia anxious to join.</p>

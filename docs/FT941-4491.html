			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Northrop launches Pounds 1.39bn hostile offer for Grumman A takeover battle erupted last night over US defence group Grumman, as military aircraft manufacturer Northrop launched a Dollars 2.04bn (Pounds 1.39bn) hostile offer in response to an agreed Dollars 1.9bn bid unveiled by Martin Marietta on Monday. Northrop coupled its bid with an attack on Grumman's board for entering into a takeover deal with Martin Marietta, even though Northrop and Grumman had spent months in late 1993 and early 1994 discussing a friendly merger. It described as 'improper and illegal' a so-called lock-up agreement under which Grumman will pay Martin Marietta Dollars 50m if its offer for the company is outbid, and said this did not serve shareholders' interests. Northrop is bidding Dollars 60 a share in cash for Grumman, compared to Dollars 55 a share in cash on offer from Martin Marietta. Grumman's shares,which closed at Dollars 54 7/8 , down Dollars  1/8 in normal trading yesterday, soared to Dollars 61 3/4 in after-hours dealing. Northrop said it had arranged financing commitments of Dollars 2.8bn from Chase Manhattan Bank and Chemical Bank. Martin Marietta's bid is being financed by BankAmerica and JP Morgan. The struggle for Grumman manifests the consolidation in the US defence industry, which is rationalising in the face of a shrinking Pentagon budget. Most deals in the sector have been friendly, though in 1992 Martin Marietta and Northrop were on opposite sides of a Dollars 475m battle for LTV's missiles and aircraft divisions. That tussle was won by Northrop and two allies - Loral and Carlyle Group. Northrop, based in Los Angeles, has sales of about Dollars 5bn and derives roughly half its revenues from the B-2 stealth bomber programme, which is being wound down. It also makes the F-18 fighter and fuselage sections for Boeing 747 commercial jumbo jets. Maryland-based Martin Marietta, with 1993 sales of Dollars 9.3bn, has been expanding rapidly through takeovers. Both companies argue that Grumman, which used to be known primarily as a maker of warplanes, but has diversified in recent years into electronics and data systems, would make an excellent strategic fit and immediately add to their earnings per share. Some 40 per cent of Grumman's shares are owned by an employee investment plan. Mr Kent Kresa, chairman of Northrop, said that his company and Grumman had conducted months of merger discussions because of the fit between the businesses, and as late as February 25 Northrop had offered to make a bid of 'not less than Dollars 50 a share, if invited to do so.' He complained that Grumman had signed a merger agreement with Martin Marietta, without informing Northrop that it was in negotiations or inviting the company's best bid.</p>

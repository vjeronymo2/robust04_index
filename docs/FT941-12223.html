			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / End killings of Inkatha, says Mandela African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela yesterday urged his followers to stop killing members of the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party, as negotiators from the two parties met for further talks aimed at averting serious ethnic conflict. After meeting briefly yesterday the right-wing Freedom Alliance and the ANC said they would today consider their negotiating positions in a final attempt to amend the 1993 constitution to accommodate right-wing demands for regional autonomy. Full tripartite talks, including the government, would resume later in the week. There is no legal hurdle to further discussions, as under the electoral law, the last possible moment for agreement is still as much as three weeks away. The law states that parties must register for elections no more than 10 days after the planned April 27-29 election is officially promulgated. This has not yet been done, and promulgation could be as late as February 24. Inkatha and the white right will determine whether to register for elections on the basis of whether the constitution is amended to their liking. But negotiators from all sides said time was running out, with President F W de Klerk expected to proclaim the election this week to allow complicated preparations for the first all-race poll to begin. Right-wing parties also want a solution, knowing that, if they decide to enter the poll, they will have lost valuable campaign time. ANC negotiator Mr Joe Slovo said on radio he was pessimistic about a breakthrough in the three-month stalemate between the government, ANC and the Freedom Alliance, but 'while there's talk, there's life.' At the weekend, supporters of both Inkatha and white right Afrikaner Volksfront (Afrikaner People's Front) made clear their rejection of the poll, though neither party has yet made a final decision on participation. Mr Mandela reacted to weekend news of right-wing opposition by trying to reassure right-wing Afrikaners they can vote separately for their own homeland, a key demand from conservative Afrikaners. He made no such concession to Inkatha, which is demanding strong powers for regional governments, but called for peace between his supporters and those of Inkatha Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. 'It is disturbing there are some people who want to kill every Zulu because they believe every Zulu is Inkatha,' Mr Mandela told a crowd of 10,000 in Ikageng township outside Potchefstroom, western Transvaal. ANC members should reason with their opponents, not kill them, he said.</p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FED BASHING RAISES RISKS OF INFLATION  </P> <P> The 1980s have been a vintage decade for the Federal Reserve, the nation's  chief inflation fighter.  </P> <P> Only 10 years ago, with prices rising at alarming double-digit rates and the  value of the dollar collapsing, the central bank had lost all credibility and  was forced to engineer the worst recession since the end of World War II to  bring the inflationary spiral to a halt.  </P> <P> Since the end of the downturn in late 1982, though, the U.S. economy has  behaved like a fine wine that just keeps getting better with age. The nation  has enjoyed almost seven years of uninterrupted economic growth, largely  without the customary run-up in inflation. Much of the credit has landed on the  Fed.  </P> <P> But this is a wine that could quickly turn to vinegar. As the economy moves  toward fuller use of its labor, factories and other resources, the Fed no  longer enjoys much room for error. At the same time, the Bush Administration  appears to be setting up the central bank for blame in any future recession,  suggesting that the strong political support that the Fed has received for its  anti-inflation stance is on the wane.  </P> <P> "The road ahead may turn out to be a virtual mine field," Lyle Gramley, a  former Fed governor, told a recent gathering here of academic experts and  central bankers from around the world. Although Fed officials know from the  bitter experience of the 1970s that very low inflation is necessary to ensure  sustained economic growth, "the politicians may not have learned the same  lessons," Gramley said.  </P> <P> Fed officials still hope to bring inflation down close to zero, but politicians  happily tolerate today's rate of inflation -- about 5% a year -- if the only  cure is a recession. For the present, the Fed tacitly acknowledges that it is  unlikely to improve on today's inflation rate, a posture that will avert a  confrontation only as long as price pressures do not mount.  </P> <P> "The best you can expect is a capping of inflation at current levels,"  acknowledged Roger Guffey, president of the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank,  which sponsored the Jackson Hole conference on monetary policy.  </P> <P> To Guffey, that means that the Fed should probably aim at keeping interest  rates high enough to slow the economy to a very modest growth rate of less than  2% through at least the end of next year. Under such a scenario, inflationary  pressures might ease, but slow growth and rising unemployment could set off a  political backlash.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fed Officials Baffled  </P> <P> "I'm afraid we may be expecting too much," Guffey acknowledged. "Political  pressures could build to the boiling point."  </P> <P> The Fed is already feeling the heat.  </P> <P> Last month, White House budget director Richard G. Darman set off a new  campaign of public Fed bashing by the Bush Administration. "If we do have a  recession," he argued in a television interview, "I think it will be because  they erred on the side of caution."  </P> <P> President Bush later endorsed Darman's statement, calling it "very balanced."  </P> <P> The White House's chief economist, however, was more modest in his comments on  the Fed last Thursday. While not attacking the Fed directly, Michael J. Boskin  urged monetary officials to aim for stronger growth. "We would not be satisfied  with a definition of soft landing that merely avoids a recession," Boskin said.  </P> <P> Fed officials, accustomed as they are to taking the political blame for  economic downturns, are baffled by the recent wave of Administration attacks.  </P> <P> "The Fed managed to nip in the bud a flowering inflation in 1988 and turn the  corner to an easier monetary policy early enough in 1989 to avoid a recession,"  Gramley said. "That is a remarkably good performance. But it's not good enough  for the Administration."  </P> <P> Many economists see a danger that the brewing conflict may backfire on the  White House, pushing up interest rates in the bond market by raising doubts  among investors about the ability of the Fed to resist political pressures for  easier money.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Strong-Arming Criticized  </P> <P> In this view, investors realize that easy money will breed inflation -- and  therefore higher interest rates -- later. Anticipating those higher rates in  the future, investors bid up rates in the present.  </P> <P> David Hale, chief economist of Kemper Financial Services of Chicago, is  particularly critical of Darman for strong-arming the Fed. In a recent  newsletter, Hale turned a widely publicized Darman speech against him.  </P> <P> In a July speech, Darman complained that Americans consume too much and save  too little. He likened Americans to the child in the 1950s commercial who  screamed: "I want my Maypo! I want it NOW!"  </P> <P> Hale wrote: "In an unintended self-parody. . ., Darman made it clear that he  wants lower interest rates and, like the child in the Maypo ad of the 1950s, he  wants them NOWWWW! In fact, a Maypo-style Federal Reserve policy geared to  instant monetary gratification could be counterproductive for the  Administration by triggering a resurgence of bond market vigilantism."  </P> <P> Pressure from the White House to avoid an economic slowdown even at the risk of  higher inflation is only one of the problems facing the Fed.  </P> <P> For all their success in reducing inflation in the 1980s, central bankers at  the conference here confessed that they depended more on the brute force of  Draconian interest rates than on any reliable guide to conducting monetary  policy.  </P> <P> Simply trying to engineer a stable money supply, as advocated by "monetarist"  economists, turned out to be a widespread failure when it was attempted in the  late 1970s and early 1980s by a number of central banks, including those in the  United States and Britain.  </P> <P> </P> <P> M-1 De-Emphasized  </P> <P> In the United States, deregulation of banking interest rates led to huge swings  in the amount of money in checking accounts. That made it impossible for the  Fed to measure the relationship between the money supply and the output of the  economy.  </P> <P> As a result, the Fed informally dropped its focus on M-1, the measure of money  held in checking accounts and cash, as early as the summer of 1982 and publicly  abandoned its use a few years later.  </P> <P> Donald Kohn, the Fed's monetary policy staff chief, said measures of the money  supply will still play a role in conducting policy in the 1990s. But "it is  more likely to resemble the key supporting part of the late 1980s than the  romantic lead of the late 1970s and early 1980s," he said.  </P> <P> But even with bank deregulation largely over, central bankers see little reason  to believe that the money supply will become any more useful as a monetary  policy lodestar. Canada, for example, quit regulating interest rates long  before the United States did but still experienced the same problems because of  ongoing changes in financial practices.  </P> <P> "I would expect innovation to continue to play an important role in financial  markets," said Charles Freedman, deputy governor of the Bank of Canada.  "Periodic unpredictable shifts in monetary and credit aggregates are therefore  likely to occur in the future."  </P> <P> Central bankers are also facing greater demands to open their deliberations to  wider public scrutiny. While Fed officials have been far more willing to  discuss their positions in recent years than in the past, their power to  operate independently and largely in secret remains far beyond that of most  other Washington institutions. The only comparable body is probably the U.S.  Supreme Court.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Monetary Risks  </P> <P> Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), a widely respected lawmaker who is chairman of  Congress' Joint Economic Committee, recently introduced a bill with Rep. Byron  L. Dorgan (D-N.D.) that would force the Fed to include the secretary of the  Treasury in its decision-making meetings and disclose its minutes immediately,  rather than about six weeks later.  </P> <P> While the bill has almost no chance of becoming law, hearings on Hamilton's  proposal are likely to serve as a forum for wide-ranging challenges to the  Fed's independence.  </P> <P> At the same time, the challenges for monetary policy are getting tougher rather  than easier. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told the conference that fast-moving  changes in global markets and financial systems are "posing new risks. . . .  Monetary policy will not be functioning in a vacuum in the 1990s."  </P> <P> Perhaps that is why central bankers are worried that the economic shocks of the  1990s will be a lot different from those of the 1980s. The favorite joke at the  Jackson Hole conference summed that up best.  </P> <P> Several participants noted that the economy can usually be counted on to  perform something like Mae West, the famous vaudeville and movie vamp of the  1920s and '30s. "Whenever I am faced with the choice of two evils," she once  said, "I choose the one I haven't tried before."  </P></p>

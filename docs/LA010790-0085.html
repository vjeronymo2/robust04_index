			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> LUNDQUIST, BRADSHAW ADVANCE TO POSTSEASON  </P> <P> The identity of the National Football League's conference finalists won't be  known until late Sunday, but one competition in the playoffs is already  decided.  </P> <P> Verne Lundquist and Terry Bradshaw will be the CBS commentators at the  Minnesota-San Francisco game Saturday, indicating they won the season-long  battle among the network's crews to see which gets a playoff plum.  </P> <P> Pat Summerall and John Madden handle four of the five postseason CBS telecasts,  so there is little available for the other regular-season broadcast teams.  </P> <P> Summerall and Madden will be at Giants Stadium Sunday for the Giants-Rams game,  then will call the NFC Championship Game and the Super Bowl. CBS's "NFL Today"  crew, headed by Brent Musburger, will cross the country to broadcast at both  sites.  </P> <P> NBC, which uses three different broadcast teams in the playoffs, will have  Charlie Jones and Merlin Olsen in Cleveland for Saturday's Bills-Browns game.  Jones and Olsen have developed into a comfortable team and, in view of the  difficulties Bill Walsh has had in adjusting to a broadcast role, arguably  constitute NBC's top unit.  </P> <P> The Dick Enberg-Walsh pairing has Denver-Pittsburgh Sunday and is already  assigned to the AFC Championship Game a week later.  </P> <P> CBS plans to have an emergency generator at Candlestick Park in San Francisco  for Saturday's game just in case there is another earthquake.  </P> <P> An earthquake that measured 7.1 on the Richter scale hit the San Francisco Bay  Area Oct. 17, 31 minutes before the scheduled start of Game 3 of the World  Series in Candlestick.  </P> <P> "If we lose power, we would have the ability to maintain our signal," CBS  spokesman Tony Fox said.  </P> <P> The Big East has made itself a basketball power by producing champions on the  court and carefully structuring its television exposure. The poor teams don't  show up on CBS or ESPN all that often. Regular-season productions are carefully  manicured to put the best dunk forward.  </P> <P> Consider Tuesday night's St. John's-Connecticut opener. Here were two teams  with excellent records and high hopes, but even that wasn't enough if you  listened carefully to the "set up" of the show. Sure, we expected the 11-2  Redmen and the 10-2 Huskies to be presented in the best light. But wasn't it  surprising that we were 10 minutes into the telecast before learning that  Connecticut had already played -- and lost -- a Big East game?  </P> <P> Such is what we've come to expect of league broadcasts that make certain  conference image is cosmetically correct. Therefore, it wasn't surprising to  listen to John Sanders and Ron Perry sing the praises of both clubs with hardly  a word about UConn's difficult start against Villanova.  </P> <P> Attention to the image is hardly unique to the Big East in an age when college  sports polishes the apple non-stop. But that doesn't mean we have to like it.  </P> <P> Connecticut may suffer from the league's high profile simply because the  Huskies haven't been able to establish themselves in the first division of the  circuit. As a result they don't get the call from CBS, and their ESPN  appearances are minimal in comparison with Georgetown and Syracuse.  </P> <P> And when a 93-62 defeat can be passed off with the concluding phrase that  "UConn will be back" by an analyst like Ron Perry, we might guess that the PR  folks are running the show.  </P> <P> ESPN is starting the process of re-organizing its schedules to accomodate  conference college basketball this winter and to get ready for Major League  Baseball next spring.  </P> <P> Top Rank Boxing will occupy a Sunday night slot during the winter, then jump to  Thursday nights April 5 when the baseball season begins.  </P></p>

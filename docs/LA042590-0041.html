			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> 'Tie Me Up' Still an 'X': Despite arguments by longtime civil rights attorney  William Kunstler, the X rating given by the Motion Picture Assn. of America to  Miramax Films' "Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down" stands. The 12-person appeals board  deadlocked 6-6 Tuesday on Miramax's request that the adults-only rating be  changed to the less restrictive R. A two-thirds vote of the board was needed to  overturn the rating.  </P> <P> Kunstler said the X rating on the Spanish-language film, in which a man holds a  woman hostage in the hope that she will fall in love with him, was outrageous  in light of other films that have been given R ratings. Kunstler said he has  recommended to Miramax that they continue to fight the rating on grounds of  censorship under New York law. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Amendment of SW&hyph;846 (Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Agency proposed to add Method 4010 (Immunoassay Test for the Presence of Pentachlorophenate) to the Second and Third Editions of SW&hyph;846. The purpose behind this proposal was to aid owners/operators of wood surface protection plants with the proposed formulation testing requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to requiring the use of SW&hyph;846 methods for testing for the presence of pentachlorophenate in wood surface protection ``in-process'' formulation, the issue is moot since EPA is not listing any wood surface protection wastes as hazardous. Nonetheless, EPA believes that although no comments were received on Method 4010, Method 4010 is an appropriate method, in general, for testing for the presence of pentachlorophenate or pentachlorophenol and can, therefore, be used in other applications other than for wood surface protection formulation testing. The Agency is, therefore, adding Method 4010 to the Third Edition of SW&hyph;846 as Update IIA. We are not adding Method 4010 to the Second Edition of SW&hyph;846 since the Third Edition has replaced the Second Edition on August 31, 1993 for use in mandatory applications (58 FR 46040). Method 4010, including its protocol and documentation supporting this action can be found in the docket for this rulemaking. See the ``For Further Information'' Section in front of this preamble for the EPA contact person for further information or with questions on Method 4010. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Pollution Prevention and Waste Minimization <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency is preparing a separate guidance manual recommending voluntary pollution prevention and waste minimization techniques for the lumber industry. Since it has studied the surface protection industry in making a listing determination for wastes generated from the use of chlorophenolic formulations, EPA has gained a broad perspective on the best ways to reduce wastes generated by this wood surface protection industry. The ideas gained from the study are presented in this manual. Some recommended strategies for pollution prevention in the surface protection industry are described in this section. Further information can be found in the manual. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ultimate goal of pollution prevention is to reduce present and future threats to human health and the environment. Pollution prevention (also referred to as source reduction) is the use of materials, processes, or practices that reduce or eliminate the quantity and/or toxicity of wastes at the source of generation. Pollution prevention is the first step in a hierarchy of options for reducing the generation of waste. The first recommended pollution prevention option is to replace chemical treatment with another type of treatment to achieve surface protection. One alternate is to dry the wood to reduce water content (high water content leads to sapstain). The Agency is aware that this option may not be economically viable for a smaller mill. If such a system cannot be feasibly employed, it would be preferable for a user of chlorophenolic-containing formulations to switch to an alternate formulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other pollution prevention strategies for use within the surface protection industry include: (1) Providing local and general ventilation within the cutting process area to reduce dust that can accumulate on wood; (2) blowing wood with air to reduce the amount of sawdust on wood prior to surface protection; and (3) using drainage collection devices like gutters on rooftops to keep precipitation away from process wastes. The pollution prevention practices described here can be critical to reduce the amount of waste generated. Although the Agency is not listing these chlorophenolic wood surface protection wastes, the pollution prevention practices described in the guidance manual are applicable to any waste generating process. For wastes that cannot be reduced at the source, generators may consider recycling as the next best option. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

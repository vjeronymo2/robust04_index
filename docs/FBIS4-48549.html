			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Lusaka by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao] </F>   [Text] The Angolan peace talks were interrupted today at  the request of the National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA]. The leadership of the UNITA negotiating team  will leave for Huambo tomorrow to consult with Jonas Savimbi and  the UNITA Political Commission.    The consultations will center on UNITA's participation in  the  government at various levels, the future of the Voice of  Resistance of the Black Cockerel [Vorgan] in the present news  media structure, and the extension of the state administration,  within the framework of national reconciliation.    UNITA Information Secretary Jorge Valentim said despite the  existence of different views on the future of Vorgan in UNITA,  consensus has been reached and an agreeement will be concluded.  He said it is not a matter for concern, because the government  has not requested Vorgan's closure as it is an instrument that  all political parties can use. The major problem now lies in  UNITA's participation in the government at the central level.    UNITA says that for the past two months it has waited for a  government reply on government posts to be given to UNITA within  the framework of national reconciliation. UNITA is worried.  Speaking to the news media today, Jorge Valentim said there is  only way for these talks to go: Either the government should say  now what posts it will give UNITA and an agreement is signed, or  it should stay in Luanda and UNITA in Huambo. In view of of  this stand by UNITA this morning, the special representative of  U.S. President Bill Clinton to the talks left Lusaka this  afternoon and is already in Luanda to contact the State  Department from his embassy, and if necessary, the Luanda  government. The talks will remain interrupted until 24 May.</p>

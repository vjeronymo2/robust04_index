			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of letter by Colombian Prosecutor General Gustavo de </F> Greiff to U.S. Senator John Kerry; date not given]    [Text] Senator [John] Kerry's article, which he wrote  instead of conducting a rational debate, which from my point of  view is our only hope if we are to find a solution to a social  problem of such great magnitude, is a long chain of personal  attacks [ad hominem] that are not in accordance with your  position nor are they appropriate comments on a high-level  official of a sovereign state. But for the time being I will  ignore them so as not to lose focus on what is truly important.    However, some clarifications are important because the  senator is short on the truth. The senator is mistaken on the  following issues:    1. It is not true that I held secret negotiations with  members of the so-called "Cali Cartel." I believe that only  distance and access to only selected articles could have led the  senator to this conclusion. A law promoted by the Gaviria  administration gives those who are suspected of involvement in  criminal activities the opportunity to surrender to the district  attorney and to request an investigation in the hopes of  clarifying their legal situation. The cases I believe the  senator is thinking of are those involving Helmer Herrera, Juan  Ramirez, and Jose Olmedo Ocampo, who came to my office on 11,  13, and 14 January, respectively, to request the aforementioned  investigation. As stated in the law, my office issued a  communique reporting on the facts.    The points that must be stressed are the following: a) All  the procedures were conducted according to Colombian law. b)  There was nothing secret about the contacts that were required  by law and that led to the issuance of a public document.  Furthermore, and as established by the law, my office notified  the other Colombian judicial agencies and, at the same time,  asked the foreign governments (including Italy, France, Germany,  and the United States) to provide any legal evidence they might  have against these people. c) The documents these men received  following their visit to my office grant them no legal immunity  nor any advantage. The documents simply establish the facts and  purpose of their visit. Therefore, these harmless documents have  no bearing on the investigation. This whole incident is much  ado about nothing. Our capacity to prosecute these individuals  has not been jeopardized; furthermore, it could not have been  jeopardized for several reasons established in Colombian laws  and statutes.    2. The senator's knowledge of Colombia is not precise. At  all the forums to which I have access (including THE WASHINGTON  POST article the senator is responding to), I have unceasingly  talked about the horrible impact the drug traffickers,  regardless of where they may come from, have on Colombia. As a  matter of fact, the generous popular support I still enjoy in  Colombia is due to my determination to not only speak, but also  act against drug traffickers in general. However, for the  record, the senator is mistaken about which crimes are credited  to which cartel. I cannot blame the senator for this since the  cartels have been disastrous to this country, and keeping  straight who did what is not an easy task. But even keeping this  in mind, the story the senator writes in his article is nothing  more than a story; the exact same accusations -- participation  in the assassination of Luis Carlos Galan (true), massive public  relations campaigning against the extradition law (true), active  campaigning during the constitutional reforms (true) -- were  made against the Medellin Cartel throughout the long process of  the abolition of the extradition treaty and later during the  approval of the laws on sentence negotiations promoted by the  Gaviria administration.    The same "story" is being told again today with different  actors. One begins to ask oneself what interests are hidden  behind this story; could it be that there are people in the U.S.  Senate who would like to see the continuation of exactly the  same struggle, at a safe distance from the United States, rather  than considering alternatives that would distribute the burden  of a war against drugs more equally? Senator, on this point  there can be no doubt; the question from my viewpoint is not how  we should surrender in light of the drug problem, but rather,  how we should deal with it more effectively. Much of the  progress Colombia has recently made in this field can be  attributed to the institutional reorganization resulting from  the 1991 Constitution, a reorganization created by the office I  currently hold, which has been an instrument in the efforts to  ensure that the law in my country is respected. But it is still  necessary to do more, because, despite the new institutions, I  cannot see clearly that we are winning this war.    3. Senator Kerry is mistaken when he says that Julio Fabio  Urdinola -- a drug trafficker who surrendered to the Colombian  authorities on 11 March -- "when negotiating his agreement, made  use of an idea inspired by Cali, according to which, there is no  Cali Cartel, rather, individual drug traffickers acting  independently." This argument was not used by Urdinola (but how  could the senator know whether it was or was not used?) simply  because it is irrelevant. The crime for which we are accusing  Urdinola is cocaine trafficking; therefore, the existence or  nonexistence of the Cali Cartel is irrelevant. Senator Kerry  may not like the idea of facing the fact that the Cali  traffickers are not members of a cartel. But, of course, no  action or rhetoric on his part can change the facts. By the  way, in light of the little evidence that the U.S. and Colombian  Governments have against the members of the alleged Cali Cartel,  I do not understand the senator's apprehension about our using  sentence negotiation against the Cali traffickers. I believe  that, as long as we are thorough and demanding in the terms of  such agreements, we will have more opportunities to obtain  information on other traffickers than we would if we acted as we  did in the past.    4. Senator Kerry is mistaken in stating that Urdinola "now  faces only five years in prison." I believe I know about this  because my office is responsible for those procedures. The  length of Urdinola's sentence has not yet been discussed by the  Prosecutor General's office. At this time I will take advantage  of the opportunity to reiterate that debates on drug policy  should not be based only on rational arguments but also on truth.    Now that this has been clarified, please allow me to stress  some points made in the article the senator is responding to, as  well as other statements I have made on this subject:    1. In my opinion, the antidrug policy must be guided by two  goals: the reduction of trafficking and use and the dismantling  of organized crime (yes, Mr. Kerry, this includes the "Cali  Cartel," as well as organized crime in New York, Los Angeles,  Houston, Chicago, Boston, etc.). The drug policy must also be  guided by an important down-to-earth preference in favor of  multilateral decisions, decisions made on the basis of respect  and mutual understanding, not on disinformation and a  presumptuous double standard.    2. Senator Kerry's answer to my article, to the extent that  his answers contain an argument, takes it for granted that I am  willing to consider legalization in terms of a free market.  Nevertheless, I want to think about legalization models to break  the economic backbone of the drug traffickers (yes, Mr. Kerry,  the economic backbone of the Cali traffickers also), without  increasing the supply. Again and again, I have said that my  interest in considering legalization depends on the possibility  of devising a suitable model to reach the goals mentioned  earlier.    3. Senator Kerry has chosen to ignore the terms under which  I  defend the use of sentence negotiations. I have clearly said  that this negotiation can be a useful instrument to the extent  that we can obtain something that neither the United States nor  Colombia has obtained so far, despite all their efforts: the  cessation of all drug-related activities, full information on  the participants in all involved countries, operational modes,  location of laboratories, points of entry, financial  transactions, etc. In addition, I have said that such  agreements should not prevent the prosecution of both those who  fail to abide by the agreements and those who refuse to provide  full information.    4. Senator Kerry's insistence on the Cali Cartel's existence  suggests that he knows something we do not know. This leads me  to reiterate my request for a more effective information  exchange. There is only one way to settle the question of the  Cali Cartel's existence: by presenting evidence that supports  the statement. Both in word and deed, I have always been willing  to file charges against drug traffickers. It goes without  saying, of course, that I need evidence to do this. If the  senator possesses this evidence, we are prepared to use it.    Finally, I reiterate that a rational debate on the subject  is  essential. This involves listening to arguments and refraining  from questioning the moral character of the participants in the  debate solely because they hold a different viewpoint (something  easy to do from Washington's comfortable distance).

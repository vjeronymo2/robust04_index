			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: C&amp;W strong The best performance in a generally active telecoms sector came from Cable and Wireless as the shares responded to a strong push from Hoare Govett, the stockbroker, plus talk of sizeable switching activity involving other telecoms shares. By the close of trading, C&amp;W was 17 ahead at 862p, an all-time closing high, after touching a peak 863p earlier in the session. Turnover was 2.4m shares. C&amp;W's outperformance was largely at the expense of Vodafone, whose shares have outpaced those of C&amp;W in recent weeks. Vodafone ended the day a net 8 lower at 571p, with a hefty 4.7m shares traded. Dealers noted plenty of switching business in the market yesterday, out of Vodafone and to a lesser extent the two classes of BT, and into C&amp;W. BT 'old' managed a minor improvement of 1 1/2 at 428p, while the partly-paid were fractionally higher at 184p. Combined turnover in BT stock was 26m, comprising 14m of the 'old' and 12m of the 'new'. Hoare Govett, reiterating its strong buy stance on C&amp;W, said the recent takeover of McCaw, the US cellular group, by AT&amp;T, on a 'per head of population' valuation was worth 50p a share on the C&amp;W stock price. Today brings the launch of Vodafone's new pan-European 'Eurodigital' cellular service, the first of a number of cellular phone moves in the next few weeks, including the launching of C&amp;W's One-2-One PCN network and Vodafone's Metrodigital system. In addition to the new system launches, Cellnet, owned by BT and Securicor, is expected to introduce further price cuts in the near future.</p>

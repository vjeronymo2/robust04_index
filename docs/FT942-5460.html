			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / UK Company News: BZW criticised over Shoprite placement Institutional shareholders have expressed concern over a recent BZW-led placement of preference shares on behalf of Shoprite, the discount food retail group. It has emerged that BZW, sponsor to the issue and lead agent, retained 20 per cent of the Pounds 15m cumulative redeemable preference shares without making this clear to subscribing institutions. 'If they had told us that they were going to end up with 3m shares then there is no way that we would have taken any,' one fund manager said. 'The market's clear understanding of this placement was that they would end up with some but nothing like this amount,' said another institutional investor. Credit Lyonnais Laing also acted as placing agents on the issue but only for a small number of shares. Insiders say it did not retain any shares itself. BZW's holding is revealed in the share register for Shoprite Finance (UK), part of the Shoprite group which is based in the Isle of Man. More than 3m shares were alloted to Wedd Jefferson, a nominee company used by BZW. The holding has been reduced although BZW would not give any details. Since BZW's placement of the cumulative redeemable preference shares in February the price of Shoprite shares has fallen from 100p to 88p. Two weeks ago the company was forced to bring forward publication of its interim results from mid-June because profits for the period were substantially below expectations. The company announced that operating profits had fallen by 17 per cent from Pounds 2.43m to Pounds 2.02m while turnover for the six months to May 1 rose by 59 per cent, from Pounds 66m to Pounds 105m. BZW said yesterday: 'To retain 20 per cent of a placement is not unusual. We never make it clear how much we will retain.' At least part of BZW's holding was for price stabilisation.</p>

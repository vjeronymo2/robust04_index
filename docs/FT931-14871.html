			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: S&amp;P credit warning for US carriers STANDARD &amp; Poor's, one of the large Wall Street rating agencies, yesterday placed the debt securities of the three largest US carriers on creditwatch with a view to downgrading them. The companies are AMR, parent of American Airlines, UAL, parent of United, and Delta Air Lines. The rating agency said the creditwatch listings were based on adverse industry and competitive developments that have worsened an already negative credit outlook. S&amp;P cited the prevalance of foreign investment in second-tier US carriers, which was allowing these airlines to maintain operations and 'potentially pose more significant competition'. Air Canada, for example, planned to invest in Houston-based Continental Airlines, while KLM Royal Dutch Airlines planned to integrate operations with Northwest Airlines. S&amp;P pointed to the continued operation of bankrupt carriers, which were prolonging industry overcapacity caused by weak demand and over-aggressive aircraft orders.</p>

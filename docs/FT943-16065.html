			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / The small step from timidity to liquidity When the price of long-term capital jumps, as it has done in the first half of 1994, explanations abound. There is a capital shortage, argue some, because the world's savings are no longer large enough to support both the gargantuan borrowing appetites of too many governments and the rapidly rising demands of the recovering private sector. Not at all, argue others, there is simply an increasing fear of inflation and a worry that governments will soon more generally begin to raise short-term interest rates. Savings and investment will always balance, though maybe at a different interest rate. Yet the Swedish government, at least, may see things more starkly following last week's announcement by one of the country's biggest institutional investors, the insurance group Skandia, that it was ceasing to buy Swedish government bonds because state indebtedness was threatening to run out of control. Gerald Holtham, London-based international economist at Lehman Brothers, dismisses the idea that there is any kind of global capital shortage. This could only arise in much more buoyant economic circumstances, he says. Instead we have been seeing an increase in liquidity preference. The role of Japanese investors and institutions, seeking to escape risk, has been crucial here. They have been repatriating overseas assets and building up their liquid yen assets; to offset the flows the Bank of Japan has been buying US Treasury bills and other short-term paper. Moreover the western hedge funds and banks which last year were eagerly borrowing short and investing long have been unwinding their positions. However, I am not sure that the distinction between capital shortage and liquidity preference is particularly helpful. A mere expectation of a future capital shortage will in effect generate that shortage sooner. In any case, any current apparent shortage should be seen in the context of last year's capital glut, which caused borrowers to become complacent. In the UK, for instance, the government sold only Pounds 12.6bn of gilts to domestic long-term institutions in the 1993-94 fiscal year, down Pounds 3bn on 1992-93, but sold an unprecedented Pounds 17.5bn to foreigners. It also, according to Salomon Brothers, sold Pounds 5bn to securities dealers in the first nine months, but these sold out in the January-March quarter. This pattern was probably typical of many national government bond markets last year, and raises the question of how deficits can be funded if the speculative inflows cease, and still more if they are reversed. Meanwhile Gordon Pepper, of the City University Business School, has recently developed his monetarist theory of asset prices to attempt to explain the abruptness of the bond market break last winter. He says that when securities trades based on liquidity pressures become persistent it becomes impossible for the valuation shifts they cause to be reversed by speculative (or value-based) transactions, and then rises or falls in prices can become self-feeding. This happens when the financial system is badly out of equilibrium: the demand for finance is not equal to the supply of savings. Last year the bond markets were overwhelmed by liquidity-based purchases and were not able to discount adequately the predictable event of a monetary tightening by the US Federal Reserve. Once the signal came, however, the liquidity-based transactions went into reverse. By the same token, you could add, the bond markets may at some stage in the near future bounce sharply upwards, and thus yields fall, once the selling pressure abates. That is presumably, for instance, the expectation of the British government, which is refusing to fund its deficit in the normal way at the rates set by the market for medium- and long-term sterling debt. There is a UK issuers' strike to set against the buyers' strike in Sweden. Probably the notion of a capital shortage is too vague to apply precisely. But governments had better stop behaving as though there were an unlimited supply of global capital available to prop up bankrupt state pension schemes or pay for the soaring costs of unemployment. They will encounter a credibility shortage soon enough.</p>

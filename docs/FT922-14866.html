			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Chelsea given one week to find Pounds 22.85m CHELSEA FOOTBALL Club has been given seven days to find Pounds 22.85m to buy its Stamford Bridge ground in west London. The Court of Appeal yesterday upheld a High Court decision about a contract for the sale. If Chelsea does not pay, it faces eviction by its landlord Cabra Estates, a property company with more than Pounds 50m debt. One observer claimed there was as much chance of Chelsea finding the money as of the team becoming league champions. Mr John Duggan, chairman of Cabra, which already has an agreement to move Fulham Football Club out of its nearby ground, said he hoped an alternative venue could be found for Chelsea if the money were not forthcoming. A twist to the story yesterday was that Mr Ken Bates, Chelsea's chairman, increased his recently acquired stake in Cabra to 29.6 per cent. His investment vehicle Vanbrugh has spent about Pounds 3m on shares in the past week. Mr Bates has called for an extraordinary meeting. Resolutions would include the ousting of Mr Duggan and Mr Andrew Mackay, a non-executive who is the Conservative MP for East Berkshire. The appointment of one or more replacements would be proposed, although it is understood some other shareholders would object to Mr Bates coming on to the board because of the conflict of interest. He would in any case be severely restricted in debates about the future of Stamford Bridge. Negotiations between Chelsea and Cabra continued at least until Mr Duggan departed for a skiing holiday in Colorado on Saturday. He said he had turned down an offer of Pounds 10m cash plus some loan notes that could be converted into shares. Part of Mr Bates's argument for paying much less than Pounds 22.85m is the availability of Pounds 5m for Fulham to ground share and a deduction for the minority stake Chelsea has in the subsidiary that owns Stamford Bridge. Mr Duggan returns on April 8. Chelsea's deadline is April 9.</p>

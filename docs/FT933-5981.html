			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Palestinians split on peace plan: Leaders in occupied territories want talks on future of east Jerusalem DIVISIONS within the Palestinian movement over a proposed peace agreement with Israel widened yesterday as Israel started a further round of intense secret contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organisation in Europe. Senior PLO and Israeli officials continued to insist that a historic agreement on Palestinian self-rule would be signed within two weeks. But Palestinian negotiators from within the Israeli-occupied territories raised serious objections to the deal. The agreement provides for an Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and West Bank town of Jericho, the handover of the two areas to full Palestinian authority and a lesser degree of self-rule in the rest of the West Bank. As the US-sponsored Middle East peace negotiations entered their 11th round in Washington, Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, called the accord 'a conceptual breakthrough'. The European Community also welcomed the deal. But Iran denounced the agreement as an Israeli bribe to the PLO. Jordan and Syria were said to be concerned about it and Lebanon became the first Arab state to make public its reservations. Mr Mouwafaq al-Allaf, Syria's chief negotiator in Washington, accepted that progress between Israel and the Palestinians would boost peace talks. His optimism about an Israeli-Syrian breakthrough was echoed by Mr Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's chief negotiator with Syria. However, Mr Faisal Husseini, the leading Palestinian political figure in the occupied territories, yesterday insisted Israel should drop its refusal to talk about occupied east Jerusalem. According to Israeli interpretations of the deal, the PLO has given up its claims over east Jerusalem until final status talks start two years after the interim period of self-rule begins. 'I cannot accept there will be no talks on the future of Jerusalem for two years,' Mr Husseini told Liberation, the French newspaper. 'If anyone believes we Palestinians can do without East Jerusalem, he is completely mistaken. . . It is the stumbling block in the talks.' Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, Palestinian spokeswoman, also said a lot of details still had to be worked out and she cautioned against 'getting carried away by signals and symptoms before we have something really tied down'. Israel was also last night moving closer to official recognition of the PLO after a PLO official said the organisation's charter, which calls for the return of all lands which now make up the Jewish state, was null and void. Mr Uzi Baram, Israeli labour minister, said PLO recognition could be signed in tandem with a preliminary peace package. But there were conflicting signals over the conditions Israel might attach to such recognition. Mr Yossi Beilin, deputy foreign minister, said the PLO would have to drop clauses from its founding charter which called for violent acts against a Jewish state. Such a move would be extremely difficult for Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, to take. Both Mr Beilin and Mr Arafat said separately the agreement on self-rule could be implemented within four months. Mr Beilin said Israel and the Palestinians would establish three tracks of talks to discuss how to implement the Gaza-Jericho scheme, how to achieve early empowerment of Palestinians in the remainder of the West Bank, and how to hold Palestinian elections. Under the proposed agreement, the Palestinians would run nearly all aspects of their lives in Gaza and Jericho, including policing the two areas, as Israelitroops pulled out. The Foreign Ministry yesterday said Mr Uri Savir, its director-general, had left for secret talks in Europe with PLO officials to iron out final details of an agreement and prepare a document for mutual recognition between Israel and the PLO. Norwegian officials will also attend the talks. Israeli officials ruled out a signing ceremony between Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and Mr Arafat. Meanwhile, an opinion poll in a Hebrew daily newspaper said 74 per cent of Palestinians supported the plan.

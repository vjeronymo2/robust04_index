The communique was released following the government's  decision to forcefully reduce all coca crops in the Chapare  region and to mobilize Coca Reduction Directorate (DIRECO)  agents who "intimidate and threaten our rank-and-file comrades,  forcing them to reduce their coca crops."    In response to the government's "Option Zero"--which  involves  the eradication of our coca crops as a way of drug  enforcement--the Federation of Tropical Carrasco Settlers  proposes "Option One"--the expulsion of DEA officials from our  country--"to reassert our national sovereignty."    The eight-point communique released yesterday, after the  government again suspended a meeting scheduled to discuss coca  problems, instructs federation members to nationally and  regionally reorganize coca defense committees, which comprise  all existing institutions and organizations.    In a serious warning, which seems like an imposition, the  federation members call on citizens' committees of the tropical  region and mayors' offices to support the coca growers' struggle.    The communique notes: "If they refuse, the coca producers  will intervene these institutions."    The coca growers communique states: "Reject any governmental  attempt to carry out a forceful reduction of coca crops." The  communique also declares "a state of emergency and constant  mobilization of our federation's ranks, and a suspension of the  voluntary reduction of our coca crops until the government  implements development projects."    The coordinating committee of the five coca growers  federations also proposes "calling a protest rally in the town  of Ivirgarzama as soon as possible."    The communique concludes by stating: "Faced with the  government's Option Zero--which involves the complete removal of  coca in the tropical region--we propose Option One, involving  the DEA's expulsion from our national territory."</p>

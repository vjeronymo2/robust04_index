			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 23 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia  prefers the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum to  remain an informal grouping but it will have no choice but to go  along if other member countries want it to be otherwise, Prime  Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said Monday. He said if the other  APEC member countries wanted the grouping to have a permanent  secretariat and have their leaders meet every year, then  Malaysia would have to allow itself to be dragged along.    Dr. Mahathir was replying to a question during the  question-and-answer session after delivering a keynote address  at the 27th International General Meeting of the Pacific Basin  Economic Council (PBEC) here. He maintained, however, that APEC  meetings should not be institutionalised.    I feel, at this point of time, APEC should be a loose  organisation so that we can get to know each other better and  even if the leaders (of APEC countries) want to meet once a  while, then I think it's o.k., he said. For the time being, the  leaders should not meet so often (but should instead) leave it  to the bureaucrats and the ministers to take care of the  problems; Dr. Mahathir said when the idea of APEC was mooted,  Malaysia was very concerned that the powerful member countries  would impose their will on the weak members. APEC, the world's  biggest regional grouping, links 18 Pacific rim countries  including North America, Australia and New Zealand.    Later, speaking to reporters, Dr. Mahathir said he will  attend the APEC informal summit in Jakarta in November.</p>

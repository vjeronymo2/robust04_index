Brown, D.D.S.; Revocation of Registration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On July 23, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Phillip L. Brown, D.D.S. (Respondent) of Aurora, Colorado. The Order to Show Cause sought to revoke Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration, AB2731998, and to deny any pending applications for renewal of such registration. The Order to Show Cause alleged that Respondent's continued registration would be inconsistent with the public interest as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f). Specifically, the Order to Show Cause alleged that Respondent administered lethal doses of Demerol, a Schedule II controlled substance, and Valium, a Schedule IV controlled substance, while attempting to sedate a patient; and as a result of such action, Respondent pled guilty to and was convicted of one count of manslaughter in the State of Colorado and voluntarily surrendered his dental license to the Colorado State Board of Dental Examiners (Board), effective August 19, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent, acting on his own behalf, filed a timely request for a hearing. The matter was docketed before Administrative Law Judge Paul A. Tenney. Thereafter, the Government filed a motion for summary disposition alleging that Respondent no longer had state authority to handle controlled substances. Respondent did not file a response to this motion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 17, 1994, the administrative law judge issued an order stating that the motion for summary disposition was warranted as there was no question of material fact involved. Furthermore, he explained that the DEA lacks statutory authority to register a practitioner unless the practitioner currently has state authority to handle controlled substances and concluded that Respondent is without authority to handle controlled substances in the State of Colorado. Consequently, the administrative law judge granted the Government's motion for summary disposition and recommended that Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration be revoked. No exceptions were filed and on June 17, 1994, the entire record of these proceedings was transmitted to the Deputy Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After a careful review of the record in this matter, the Deputy Administrator adopts the administrative law judge's recommendation. DEA does not have the authority under the Controlled Substances Act to grant a registration to a practitioner if that practitioner is not authorized by a state to handle controlled substances.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Ramon Pla, M.D., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Docket No. 86&hyph;54, 51 FR 41168 (1986);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> George S. Heath, M.D., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Docket No. 86&hyph;24, 51 FR 26610 (1986);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Dale D. Shahan, D.D.S., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Docket No. 85&hyph;57, 51 FR 23481 (1986). There is no evidence in the record to contradict the Government's position that Respondent's Colorado dental license has been revoked pursuant to Respondent's surrender of his dental license and that his authority to handle controlled substances in the State of Colorado has been nullified. Consequently, revocation of Respondent's DEA registration is warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Deputy Administrator concurs with the administrative law judge's granting of the Government's motion for summary disposition. In the absence of a question of material fact, a plenary adversary administrative proceeding is not required.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See United States v.

Brown, D.D.S., be, and it hereby is, revoked and that any pending applications for renewal of such registration be, and they hereby are, denied.

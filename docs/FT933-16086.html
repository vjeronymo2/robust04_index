			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Nadir attended functions at No 10 MR ASIL NADIR, the fugitive businessmen, attended six functions at Downing Street during the 1980s, the prime minister disclosed last night, Philip Stephens writes. But in a series of parliamentary answers, Mr Major said that Mr Nadir had not been invited to No 10 since Baroness Thatcher was replaced in November 1990. Mr Major said that when he took office he halted the practice which had allowed the Conservative party to host fundraising events in Downing Street. He said that before that date a variety of political functions had taken place at which the costs had been met by political parties. Mr Nadir's visits to No 10 took place between 1984 and 1989, before the collapse of his Polly Peck International business empire.</p>

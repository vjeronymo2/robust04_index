			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Ernesto Samper Pizano, presidential candidate of </F> Colombia's Liberal Party, from the Gonzalo Jimenez de Quesada  Convention Center in Santa Fe de Bogota--live]    [Text] Mr. Humberto de la Calle Lombana, the vice president  of Colombia. [cheers]. Dear friends: We have won. [cheers]  This victory does not belong to Ernesto Samper; this victory  belongs to all of you. [cheers] For the first time, after  having adopted a new Constitution, we held an electoral process  in accordance with the rules established by the National  Constituent Assembly to modernize and cleanse the nation's  politics and its administration.    One thing in particular pleases me, and I would like to  spotlight it here, before all these foreign reporters.  Colombians have also defeated abstention today. [cheers] We  have shown the world Colombia has a great, modern, and open  democracy, under which there is full assurance that all  expressions of our pluralist society can compete.    All of Colombia's friends know that our country does fulfill  its international commitments and will continue to do so and  that they will find in Colombia an eager ally to fight for Latin  American and Caribbean integration, for international  cooperation, for the peaceful resolution of all conflicts, and  that we will combat drug trafficking and ensure that  international law prevails.    I am reaching the Colombian Presidency following a long  career that began many years ago and that has had many stages.  In all of them, in all of them there has been an invariable  guideline. I have been and I will always be a tireless worker,  and I believe there is no effort that can be spared when it  comes to helping the people. I have always acted, and I will  always act inspired by my great love for Colombia and by the  conviction that our country must be immense so it can house all  Colombians and their kids. [cheers]    I am now thinking about Luis Carlos Galan and many other  murdered people. His death was the biggest tragedy Colombians  experienced, but it would have been even worse if that sacrifice  were in vain. The ideals of Galan in favor of an honest exercise  of politics and government will be the objectives for which my  administration will work every day, every hour, and every  minute. [cheers]    I also salute President Gaviria. His vision and courage  gave Colombia a great push in favor of the country's  modernization, which we are going to continue. His government  proved we were not anchored in the past. My campaign programs  to create jobs and elect a government that can work in favor of  the people are no longer the proposals of a candidate; they are  the plans of a president who will fulfill them with everyone's  support.    I am very grateful to all Colombians for the support they  gave me today. I am especially grateful to my party, the  Liberal Party [cheers] and the members of the Alliance for  Colombia. I am grateful to those who voted for me. I also send  my fraternal greetings to those who voted for Andres Pastrana.  I invite them to work to make our dreams become a reality, our  dreams of peace, social justice, and progress. We are now  facing an open window, a window of opportunities, a window of  which we are going to take advantage with everyone's support and  for everyone's benefit.    Dr. Andres Pastrana should be praised for making a great  effort to conduct a different campaign. I found a persistent  competitor in him. I also extend to him my friendly hand and  congratulate him for conducting an innovative campaign. I want  to thank many people for their support and their contribution in  this victory. I want to emphasize the support of Jaquin, my  wife. [cheers] She experienced the intensity of this long  campaign. As anyone else, she always worked with enthusiasm,  which was needed during times of fatigue, and she exhibited an  optimism that never lagged when times were difficult. As anyone  else, she always had a smile. [cheers]    I want to thank my mother, Jaquin, Andres, Miguel, and  Felipe; they were decisive factors during this stage. They are  also going to be the most important individuals of my life.    I want to thank my collaborators and my running mate,  Humberto de la Calle. He is an exemplary Colombian. I also  want to thank Rosalba. Our work was worthwhile so that we could  come out ahead, not only because we won an election, but because  we have given Colombians a road full of hope. Our duty is to  think about the future generations. Our mission is to work for  the future. We are going to work without respite for the needy  of Colombia. We received a social mandate from the Colombian  countryside today. I want to speak with sincerity to  Colombians. I am anxious to start working for Colombia as early  as tomorrow.    I am counting on your support, your work, and even your  sacrifice, when necessary, to make our dream come true.  Everyone's commitment and participation are the greatest  strength our democracy has as well as our country's secret  weapon and the shortest way to prosperity.    My dear friends, let us work to take advantage of the  opportunities and face the challenges that await us during the  next four years. We will face them without hatred or fear and  with the responsibility the majority of our fellow Colombians  have given us. I call on all citizens of goodwill, who are the  majority, to join us in this time of change we are now  beginning. I hereby declare myself free of all bitterness or  animosity. [cheers]    No Colombian will be subject to discrimination during my  administration due to his or her political party, beliefs, or  racial origin. I invite all of those who mistakenly chose the  road of armed conflict to reconsider and lay down their weapons.  Let me say there is still space for peace. To my adversaries I  say: I guarantee you a part, if you so wish, in the process of  social transformation we will set in motion. I call on all of  you to join in this new period of work. The time for Colombia's  great social leap has come. [cheers]</p>

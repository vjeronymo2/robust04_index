			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: Risk and reward in new futures fund TWO YEARS after regulators opened the doors to geared futures and options unit trusts, the first geared futures and options fund (GFOF) is ready for presentation to the British public. The Govett Geared UK Index fund, to be launched on Monday, aims to double every capital movement in the FT-SE 100 index of UK stocks by using futures contracts to provide gearing. The 'gearing' means that the fund buys FT-SE index exposure, which is twice the value of the property of the fund. Any gains, but also any losses, are magnified by a factor of two. If the index were to fall 50 per cent overnight, the fund would fall 100 per cent and you would lose all your money (although, as with all unit trusts, you cannot lose more than your initial investment). If the index fall was spread over a longer period, losses would be smaller. The minimum investment of Pounds 5,000 means the fund is available to both retail and institutional investors. This worries some in the unit trust industry; they feel that such highly-geared funds are too dangerous for retail investors. Such a fund should, they say, be contemplated only as part of a large, diversified portfolio. The fund also differs from most other unit trusts because there is no active management team; in that sense, it is comparable with the recent spate of FT-SE index tracking funds. The intitial charge is 5 1/4 per cent (with a maximum permitted charge of 7 1/2 per cent). An annual charge of 1 per cent is deducted from the fund's income. Futures and options funds (FOFs), of which only a handful have been launched, can invest up to 10 per cent of their assets in derivative products, but the riskier GFOFs can have up to 20 per cent of their assets in futures and options. Govett already has raised Dollars 130m through a series of futures and options funds which use futures contracts but are not geared.</p>

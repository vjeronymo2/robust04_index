			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / International Company News: Toshiba, IBM share 'flash' technology TOSHIBA, the Japanese electronics company, is making a bid to recapture leadership in one of the hottest new products in the electronics industry - 'flash' memory devices - by means of a technology-sharing agreement with IBM. Toshiba invented flash memory - which stores electronic information in a semiconductor chip even when power is switched off - in 1986. But Intel, the leading US semiconductor maker, captured 85 per cent of the market by designing a product that was simpler to manufacture and cheaper than the original Toshiba design. The agreement, announced yesterday, pits a Toshiba-IBM partnership against an alliance between Intel and Sharp, the Japanese electronics group, announced earlier this year. At stake is a market which Dataquest expects to be worth Dollars 1.5bn by 1995, compared with about Dollars 130m today, and which should continue growing rapidly afterward. Flash memory cards - about the size of a credit card - will start replacing small disc drives in portable computers this year. They store data just like a hard disc, but since they are solid state, they contain no moving parts. Flash memory cards use less electricity and are much lighter, making them ideal for portable uses. They allow almost instant access to data, thus eliminating the delay when computers have to go back to the disc to retrieve information. Flash memory also poses a threat to some parts of the market for dynamic random access memory chips since they process information in a similar way to D-Ram chips, at slightly slower speeds. Unlike the D-Ram chip flash does not lose what it is working on when the power goes down. The Toshiba Nand (no-and internal logic) technology has always in theory been better than Intel's Nor (no-or) circuit design. Nand allows manufacture of a smaller, more highly integrated chip that is more powerful than the Nor technology. Nand chips also use five volts for both erase and write functions, while the Intel designs requires two voltages, 12 and five volts, making them more power-hungry. Intel, however, says its chip has succeeded in the market because the Toshiba design required more complex external control circuitry which eliminated the theoretical advantages of the basic chip. Toshiba is hoping to overcome this obstacle by means of the link with IBM. Toshiba has agreed to share its flash memory technology with IBM, while IBM will share technology under development for a controller device allowing high-speed read and write operations. The two will separately manufacture and market the devices. IBM's decision to link with Toshiba is a powerful vote of confidence in the basic technology. Intel joined forces with Sharp earlier this year for two reasons. First, the Japanese company had the technology and the resources to develop and manufacture the next generation of more powerful flash devices. Second, Sharp had the experience, which Intel lacked, in the consumer market with devices like electronic diaries, portable computers, and audio-visual equipment. By the time the IBM/Toshiba alliance results in new products - probably a matter of years from now - Intel and Sharp hope to have already created a large enough demand for their own product to allow for cheap, mass production.</p>

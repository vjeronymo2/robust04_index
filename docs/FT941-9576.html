			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Listing sought by Wellington Wellington Holdings, a manufacturer of hydraulic seals and other rubber products, is planning a stock market flotation next month which should value it at up to Pounds 50m. A Pounds 22m buy-out from Evered in 1989, Wellington is currently wholly owned by First Britannia, a venture capital fund, which will see its stake diluted to about 40 per cent after the flotation. A group of 24 managers will hold about 10 per cent. The company has a complex history dating back to the early 1980s when Tarmac bought a number of rubber businesses. These were sold to Evered in 1985. Evered added Hallite, then a listed seals manufacturer, two years later. Mr Brian Kent, the former chairman of Staveley Industries who has been appointed Wellington's non-executive chairman, says the businesses and the senior management have been largely unaffected by the ownership changes. The company has three legs: Hallite seals, which are used in a wide range hydraulic equipment; the rubber compounding division, supplying raw materials for remould tyres; and the conversion arm, which makes finished rubber products for the automotive, construction and engineering industries. The company has weathered the recession well. Sales of about Pounds 42m in 1993 were more than 18 per cent higher than two years earlier, while operating profits have risen by almost a third to Pounds 4.1m. Wellington will retain most of the Pounds 20m to be raised from the planned share placing, which is being handled by Kleinwort Benson Securities.</p>

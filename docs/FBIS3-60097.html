			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Finnish News Service Report: "Large Narcotics Gang </F> Uncovered"]    [Text] The Narcotics Violations Office of the Helsinki  Police is in the midst of investigating a narcotics ring that is  exceptionally large for Finland. Over the course of the  investigation, the police have held 85 persons for questioning  and charged 20 with smuggling and distributing narcotics.    On Tuesday [23 November], the case came up for trial in  Helsinki Municipal Court, where the prosecutor read an  indictment for aggravated narcotics violations against a  25-year-old man from Kervo. Further indictments are expected  against the other members of the gang.    The gang has been operating in the Helsinki region, the  Turku  area, and [other places] on the west coast. It is suspected of  having distributed and sold tens of kilograms of hashish, much  heroin and amphetamines, as well as the drugs LSD and ecstasy,  both of which have rarely been found in Finland.    The police seized a little over 1 kg of hashish and around  100 kg of amphetamines, as well as small amounts of other drugs.    Gang members are between age 17 and 35 and most have never  had prior involvement with the police. The suspected gang leader  worked full time on narcotics trafficking.    The gang has been operating for approximately one year, and  has constantly grown by recruiting new members. The police  believe the organization has spun off a number of smaller  subgroups, which remained loosely tied to each other.    The police got on the gang's trail last spring. The full  extent of the case is still not known. The police will still not  say from where the drug ring originated.    This drug ring is not the same one confirmed a short time  ago  of distributing "superheroin."</p>

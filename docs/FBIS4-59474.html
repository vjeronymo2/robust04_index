			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 14 May (MENA) -- The Arab Bar Association has  expressed its concern about the continuation of the sanctions  imposed on Iraq despite the fact that their harmful effects  infringe on the Iraqi citizens' basic rights to food and  medicine.    In a statement issued today, the association said that Arab  lawyers, appalled by the continuation of these conditions  imposed on the Iraqi people, appeal to the UN Security Council  members and president, the UN secretary general, and  international humanitarian organizations to immediately lift  sanctions imposed on Iraq.    The statement was issued on the occasion of the debate that  the UN Security Council will hold tomorrow to discuss continuing  the sanctions on Iraq.</p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THE FOLLOWING ARE COMMENTS MADE BY SHERIFF JOHN DUFFY AND OTHERS REGARDING  DUFFY'S DECISION NOT TO RUN FOR A SIXTH TERM:  </P> <P> "I believe very strongly that I could defeat any and all of the jackals who  haven't the courage to kill their own prey but rely upon others to provide them  something to feed upon. . . . They (the media) don't like me because I fulfill  the office of the sheriff the way the (county) charter says. I don't court them  and I simply don't kiss their butts."  </P> <P>  -- Sheriff John Duffy  </P> <P> "He will be remembered basically as a bully, as someone who was in office too  long and misused his position. He will be remembered as the J. Edgar Hoover of  San Diego law enforcement."  </P> <P>  -- Mike Aguirre, a San Diego lawyer  </P> <P> "If I called him a hundred times a year with law enforcement questions, I'd get  100 answers before we hung up. Many others call you back. Many others never  call you back. But Duffy would give you the answer, if it was within his  reach."  </P> <P>  -- Duffy supporter William Cowling  </P> <P> "Some (deputies) would follow him into the ocean. Others don't care for him at  all."  </P> <P>  -- Skip Murphy, president, Deputy Sheriffs Assn.  </P> <P> "Frankly, Duffy's a good cop. But he's not that good of an administrator.  That's come out many, many times."  </P> <P>  -- Supervisor George Bailey  </P> <P> "I'm encouraged by the fact that the man I've worked for for going on 21 years  has that kind of confidence in me. Certainly, I'm not going to shun his  support."  </P> <P>  -- Assistant Sheriff Jack Drown  </P> <P> "Does this guy want to win?"  </P> <P>  -- Political consultant David Lewis, reacting to news that Drown said he  welcomes Duffy's endorsement.  </P></p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / S Korea eases foreign exchange controls The South Korean government yesterday announced it would ease foreign exchange controls by the end of the decade. But the measures are more likely to benefit Korean companies seeking financing abroad than foreign investors wanting to gain access to Korea's financial markets. Seoul imposed tough controls on capital flows as a result of a debt crisis in the 1970s and has maintained them since in an attempt to control the money supply and reduce inflationary pressure in South Korea. The finance ministry measures announced yesterday resulted from recommendations of an advisory committee in September. Korean companies will be able to raise long-term foreign commercial loans from next year to finance the purchase of factories and advanced manufacturing equipment or technology from abroad. Foreign loans usually carry lower interest rates than domestic loans. Other remaining restrictions on corporate loans abroad will be removed by 1997. Korean companies will also be granted more freedom to raise funds on foreign capital markets through bond or securities issues by 1997. Foreign bond issues are now subject to a monetary ceiling which totalled Dollars 1.25bn (Pounds 800m) this year. The foreign funds inflow is expected to increase from Dollars 6bn in 1995 to Dollars 20bn by 1999, which will result in an appreciation of the South Korean currency, according to the finance ministry. But foreign investors in Korea are expected to be disappointed by the package. Although the foreign shareholding ceiling in listed Korean companies will be raised from 12 to 15 per cent next year, the government has not yet decided whether to abolish the quota by 1999. The opening of the bond market to foreign investors is expected to be limited to issues that Korean investors consider unattractive, such as non-guaranteed bonds issued by small and medium-sized companies beginning in 1996 or 1997. Limited investments in non-guaranteed bonds by large corporations will be allowed in 1998 or 1999, but the government has not given a commitment to the full opening of the bond market. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is likely to demand further financial liberalisation for foreign investors during talks on South Korea's scheduled entry into the group in 1996. Foreign companies will be allowed to issue stocks in South Korea next year and won-denominated bonds by 1997, although the latter may not be attractive because of high domestic bond rates.</p>

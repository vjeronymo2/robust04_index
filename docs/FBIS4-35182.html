			<p>BFN     [Text] President Hafiz al-Asad received Haydar Abu-Bakr  al-'Attas, former Yemeni prime minister and envoy of 'Ali Salim  al-Bid, secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party,  accompanied by 'Abd-al-Qawi Makkawi and Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz  al-Dali, at 1130 today. Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' attended  the meeting.    Talks dealt with the situation in Yemen and its regrettable  developments, as well as the current efforts to address it. The  talks also dealt with the impact of this situation on sisterly  Yemen and its future as well as on the pan-Arab interest of the  Arab nation.    The president emphasized to the Yemeni delegation that Syria  is concerned about what is taking place in Yemen and is  anxiously following the bloody developments that replaced  brotherly dialogue in addressing differences. The president  said fighting is not in the interest of the fraternal Yemeni  people, the Arab nation, or the unionist aspirations of the Arab  masses. The president said Syria renews its appeal to the  Yemeni brothers to stop resorting to arms and blood, apply  logic, observe national and pan-Arab interests, and return to  constructive brotherly dialogue out of concern for Yemen and its  unity -- land and people.    The Yemeni delegation expressed its appreciation for Syria's  pan-Arab position.    Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas and his delegation left Damascus  this evening following a two-day visit. Foreign Minister Faruq  al-Shar' saw them off at Damascus International Airport.    In a statement to the Syrian Arab News Agency, al-'Attas  said: Today, we were honored to be received by President Hafiz  al-Asad. We were pleased by the positive stand of sisterly Syria  and by the accurate analysis of the current situation in Yemen.  Viewpoints were completely identical on the danger posed by the  continuation of war in Yemen. This war threatens Yemen as well  as the Arab nation and the region with numerous dangers.  Therefore, we agreed to exert efforts and work together to stop  the war and deal with all differences peacefully.    Asked about halting fighting and preserving Yemeni unity, he  said: This is what we are working for. I think the mission on  which we have to work, along with brothers in Syria and all  brothers and friends, is that of stopping the war. By stopping  the war, we can deal with all issues and preserve what remains  of Yemen and safeguard its unionist march.    Responding to a question on the presence of contacts between  Aden and Sanaa, he said: There are no contacts at present,  except for those held through brothers and friends and the Arab  League.    Al-'Attas described his visit to Damascus by saying: It was  a visit we highly value because I sensed a positive stand of  solidarity and an accurate analysis of the situation in our  country as a result of the recently-declared war.    Al-'Attas welcomed all mediation and efforts to stop the war  and avert further Yemeni losses and address the situation  peacefully. He said: We welcomed the Egyptian mediation and the  Egyptian-Emirian mediation and we welcome every mediation.</p>

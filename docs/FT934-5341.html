			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: Italian banks close their ranks  -Haig Simonian on the background to a spate of regional mergers A decade ago, one big regional bank merger a year in Italy would have seemed revolutionary. In the past month, three regional banks have taken over like-sized counterparts, while another pair are merging amicably. Two deals were finalised last week alone. Banca Popolare di Verona, a stockmarket-listed bank based in Verona, clinched control of Banco San Geminiano e San Prospero, a regional counterpart from Modena after a three-week struggle. Banca d'America e d'Italia, the Italian subsidiary of Germany's Deutsche Bank, took a controlling stake in Banca Popolare di Lecco, a 89-branch regional based just north of Milan. The deal will cost BAI about L810bn (Dollars 479m) after an obligatory public tender offer to buy out minorities. Earlier in the month, Cassa di Risparmio di Parma e Piacenza, a fast-expanding savings bank, said it was planning to buy control of Credito Commerciale, a Milan-based regional bank and trade finance specialist which has fallen on hard times. Even after handing 40 of Credito Commerciale's branches back to its parent company, Sienna's big Monte di Paschi, the Parma institution, will be adding 70 branches to its network. In Bologna, one of Italy's main business centres, two big regional banks have advanced their plan to merge. Earlier this year, Credito Romagnolo, the larger of the pair, reached agreement with the city's savings bank on a share swap. The exchange was seen as the first step in a courtship leading to an eventual marriage. Recently, the two banks have said they intend to hurry the nuptials. All the mergers have the blessing of the Bank of Italy, which has in recent years encouraged mergers to create stronger, more competitive financial institutions. Italian banking is still very fragmented compared with France, Germany or the UK, where the sort of concentration now taking place is largely history. Concerned about the growth in foreign competition expected after the European Union's free internal market, the central bank began in the early 1990s to encourage regional banks to merge. The aim was to form bigger, more efficient and better-capitalised banks, reaping economies of scale offering more services than one bank alone. Concentration was also stimulated by substantial tax breaks for mergers. Competition also played a part. The elimination in 1990 of tough restrictions on branch expansion meant once tame regionals started opening branches on each others' territory. Bigger nationwide banks could also expand in areas, especially in the rich north, they had been viewing enviously for decades. The bank of Italy's fears of a foreign incursion have proved largely unfounded. Only two big transactions had taken place until last week. In 1986, Deutsche Bank spent Dollars 603m on BAI. Three years later, Credit Lyonnais of France bought an interest in Credito Bergamasco, which it now controls. Takeovers from abroad have been limited by very high asking prices for the sort of well-located regional banks in demand, and by their scarcity. Although the recession has flushed out additional supply, changes in business priorities among many foreigners, now pre-occupied by domestic downturns, has tended to dampen their interest. Worries about Italian political and economic uncertainty have also played a part. Significantly, neither of the two 'White Knights' believed to be interested in Banco San Geminiano were foreigners. Italian banks may also be better placed to understand the opportunities in their market and judge whether asking prices are reasonable, even if they remain high. The amounts paid for Banco San Geminiano and Banca Popolare di Lecco appear astronomic, in spite of the recession. That is especially true if the deals are seen against next month's privatisation of Credito Italiano, Italy's seventh biggest bank, which has almost 800 branches nationwide. Analysts estimate the 67 per cent stake being floated will raise about L2,000bn. The continuing attractiveness of regional banks has various causes. The protection offered until 1990 by the Bank of Italy's branch expansion rules allowed the biggest regionals to build up sizeable networks, which were highly concentrated in a specific part of the country. Fierce local loyalties meant the regional banks often enjoyed near monopolies, even when competition increased after the central bank relaxed its branching rules. And the established presence of the regional banks and strong local roots often provided unparallelled access to both depositors and growing small and medium-sized businesses, on which the regional banks tend to concentrate. Together, that could spell big profits, especially for regional banks in the richest parts of northern Italy, such as Lombardy, Emilia Romagna and the Veneto. Combined with relatively low staffing costs and good management, many northern regional banks have gained a cachet that this month's price tags are beginning to show.  ----------------------------------------------------               REGIONAL BANK TAKEOVERS  ----------------------------------------------------                                           Branches  ---------------------------------------------------- Banca Popolare di Lecco                        89 Banco San Geminiano e San Prospero            105 Credito Commerciale*                          110 Cassa di Risparmio di Bologna                 110  ---------------------------------------------------- * 40 branches being sold back to parent company  ----------------------------------------------------</p>

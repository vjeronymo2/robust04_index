The chemicals are hazardous substances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified for data needs by the Agency for Toxic Substances and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Disease Registry (ATSDR), National Toxicological Program (NTP)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and EPA pursuant to section 104(i)(5) of the Comprehensive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (CERCLA or Superfund)(42 U.S.C. 9601&hyph;9675). These 12 chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances are vinyl chloride, benzene, trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, hydrogen cyanide, sodium cyanide, toluene, methylene chloride, chloroethane, mercury, chromium, and beryllium. These substances and associated data needs appear in Table 1 below. The specific forms of the metals mercury, chromium, and beryllium to be tested are yet to be determined; EPA will solicit testing proposals for the specific forms of these metals at a later date. Testing proposals should cover all identified data needs of a substance (or multiple substances) in order to be considered for Enforceable Consent Agreement (ECA) negotiation. If, after receiving testing proposals, EPA elects to pursue negotiations for one or more ECAs applicable to specific chemicals, EPA will solicit requests to be designated an interested party at that point. EPA has authority to require testing for these 12 chemical substances under section 4 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)(15 U.S.C. 2601&hyph;2692) and if an ECA-based approach does not prove viable, EPA would proceed with rulemaking to require the needed testing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written testing proposals must be received by November 29, 1994.

Solicitation for Testing Proposals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->  EPA's procedures for requiring the testing of chemical substances under section 4 of TSCA include the adoption of ECAs and the promulgation of test rules. On numerous occasions, chemical companies have approached EPA to negotiate ECAs for testing chemicals which are likely to become the subject of proposed test rules. EPA will follow the procedures outlined in unit II of this notice to develop ECAs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> B. Chemical Data Needs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->  The data needs which are the subject of this notice were determined in accordance with the requirements of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986 which amended and extended CERCLA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Section 104(i) of CERCLA requires ATSDR and EPA to prepare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and revise a list of hazardous substances which are most commonly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found at facilities on the CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and which ATSDR and EPA, in their sole discretion, determine are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> posing the most significant potential threat to human health.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The lists of these 275 hazardous substances were published in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on April 17, 1987 (52 FR 12866); October 20,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1988 (53 FR 41280); October 26, 1989 (54 FR 43615); October 17,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1990 (55 FR 42067); October 17, 1991 (55 FR 52166); October 28,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1992 (57 FR 48801); and October 18, 1993 (58 FR 53739).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Section 104(i) of CERCLA also directs ATSDR to prepare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicological profiles of each listed hazardous substance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 104(i)(3) outlines the content of these profiles. Each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> profile is required to include an examination, summary and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpretation of available toxicological information and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> epidemiologic evaluations in order to ascertain the levels of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant human exposure for the substance and the associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health effects. The profiles must also include a determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of whether adequate information on the health effects of each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance is available or in the process of development. ATSDR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has prepared 110 toxicological profiles covering 195 substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (One toxicological profile may cover several related substances).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Under CERCLA, section 104(i)(5), when adequate information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not available on the health effects of each substance, ATSDR,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in cooperation with the National Toxicology Program (NTP), is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to assure the initiation of a research program designed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to determine such health effects (and techniques for developing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods to determine such health effects).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As the first step in developing its health effects research  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program, ATSDR identified data needs for each substance in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicological profiles. These data needs were reviewed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scientists from ATSDR, NTP, EPA and the Centers for Disease  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Control, peer reviewed by an external review panel, and made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available for public comment. Prior to final publication of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> toxicological profiles, ATSDR considered all public comments it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received regarding identification of data needs for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The next step in the development of the health effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> research program (or the substance-specific research program)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involved the creation of the ``Decision Guide for Identifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Substance-Specific Data Needs Related to Toxicological Profiles''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Decision Guide), published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on September  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11, 1989 (54 FR 37618). Applying the principles discussed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Decision Guide, ATSDR published the ``Identification of Priority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Data Needs for 38 Priority Hazardous Substances'' in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on October 17, 1991 (56 FR 52178). As required by CERCLA, section 104(i)(5), ATSDR considered recommendations from the Interagency Testing Committee (ITC), and, with EPA, coordinated development of these priority data needs with NTP and with programs of toxicological testing established under TSCA and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)(7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S.C. 136). The purpose of such coordination is to avoid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> duplication of effort and to assure that the listed hazardous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances are tested thoroughly at the earliest practicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date. ATSDR also considered public comments on identification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the priority data needs. On November 16, 1992, ATSDR published  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ``Announcement of Final Priority Data Needs for 38 Priority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hazardous Substances'' in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (57 FR 54150).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Copies of the FR actions cited above are available in the docket  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established for this action (OPPTS&hyph;42052P; FRL&hyph;4756&hyph;5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CERCLA, section 104(i)(5)(C) provides that TSCA authorities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be used to carry out the health effects research program. CERCLA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 104(i)(5)(D) declares that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 06 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [i]t is the sense of the Congress that the costs of [conducting health effects research programs] be borne by the manufacturers and processors of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous substances in question, as required in programs of toxicological testing under the Toxic Substances Control Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 06 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 06 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In October 1992, ATSDR requested that EPA test 38 substances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using authorities under TSCA and FIFRA. EPA coordinated extensively with other Federal agencies (including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Mine Safety and Health Administration, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission) and among its own programs (including Office of Air and Radiation, Office of Water, Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response, and Office of Research and Development) to evaluate ATSDR's request for testing. In addition, EPA, ATSDR, and the National Institute of Environmental Health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sciences (NIEHS) met as members of the Tri-Agency Superfund Applied Research Committee (TASARC) to discuss ATSDR's data needs and EPA's response. Copies of the minutes of the TASARC meetings are available in the docket established for this action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to ATSDR's initial request to test 38 substances, EPA deleted substances from the initial list and deleted and added associated data needs based on various factors including, but not limited to, the appropriateness of using TSCA authority to require testing of certain substances and the needs of other Federal Agencies and EPA programs for certain test data. Relevant correspondence between EPA and ATSDR regarding these selections is available in the docket established for this action. In a letter dated November 9, 1993, EPA informed ATSDR that EPA would pursue testing of ATSDR substances under section 4 of TSCA. The ATSDR list of 38 substances was modified to contain the 12 substances shown in Table 1 below with a summary description of data needs. These substances will be added to the next edition of the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics' Master Testing List scheduled for release in FY '95. Further description of the data needs are available in the docket established for this action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Note that TASARC has set up a workgroup to identify the specific forms of the metals mercury, chromium and beryllium to be tested. This workgroup will consider the needs of other Federal Agencies and EPA programs. In addition, EPA will solicit testing proposals for the specific forms of these metals at a later date. Note also that EPA has not yet developed testing guidelines for certain endpoints indicated in Table 1 below. EPA particularly encourages submission of testing guidelines for these endpoints which may be used as part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a testing proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA realizes that under certain circumstances, as outlined below, route-to-route extrapolation based on valid pharmacokinetic (PK) data can offer a useful and less expensive alternative to retesting by another route of exposure to chemical substances that have already been tested by one route. Therefore, EPA will consider entering into ECAs for PK testing under protocols proposed by prospective test sponsors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will consider route-to-route extrapolation of toxicity data from routes other than those proposed in Table 1 below when it is scientifically reasonable to empirically derive the risk. Derivation of the risk is only reasonable when portal-of-entry effects and first-pass effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be ruled out or adequately characterized. Regardless of the toxic endpoint considered, EPA's ability to perform quantitative route-to-route extrapolation is critically dependent on the amount and type of data available. The minimum information needed includes both the nature of the toxic effects and a description of the relationship between exposure and the toxic effect. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The preferred method for performing route-to-route extrapolation involves the development of a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model that describes the disposition (deposition, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination) of the chemical for the routes of interest. PBPK models must be used in conjunction with toxicity and mechanistic studies in order to relate the effective dose associated with an effect for the test species and conditions to other scenerios. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The primary purpose of this ASTDR/EPA health effects testing program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is to meet the substance-specific information needs of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public and the scientific community, and, consistent with the guidelines discussed in the Decision Guide, this testing program will supply toxicity and exposure information which will assist in the development of Superfund health assessments by ASTDR. In addition, because of the involvement by other Federal Agencies and EPA offices in reviewing the testing needs identified for these chemicals, this testing program will supply test data which will also meet the needs of other Federal Agencies and EPA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 3,L2,i1,s50,r100,r30 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Table <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  1._ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Data Needs and Testing Guidelines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Chemical and CAS No. <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Proposed Testing <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Guideline (40 CFR) <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=4 --> Vinyl chloride (75&hyph;01&hyph;4)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> Reproductive inhalation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> R  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=4 -->  <!-- PJG 007 0170 intable --> l&blank;

EPA may extend the deadline for receipt of testing proposals upon a showing of good faith efforts to develop testing proposals by the initial deadline. The testing proposals should describe the testing to be performed in detail (test guideline or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protocol, including route of administration, species, etc.) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explain in detail where there are deviations from tests proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by EPA in Table 1 above. The Agency suggests as a model the testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal submitted on  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> N- <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> methylpyrrolidone (NMP) by the NMP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Producers Group on September 11, 1992 found in the docket  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established for this action. In order for a testing proposal to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be eligible for consideration, the proposal should cover all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified data needs of a substance (or multiple substances).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   2. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Agency selection of most likely candidates for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ECA program.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA will review the submissions and select the most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promising submissions as candidates for negotiation. Submissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which fully address EPA's concerns will have a higher chance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> success than those which do not fully address all data needs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  3. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Formal solicitation of ``interested parties'' in the <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . If EPA selects a proposal as a candidate for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negotiations, such negotiations will be conducted pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures described in 40 CFR 790.28. Accordingly, EPA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publish a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  soliciting persons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interested in participating in or monitoring negotiations for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of an ECA, to so notify the Agency in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> writing. Those individuals and groups who respond to EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice by the deadline established in the notice will have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> status of ``interested parties'' and will be afforded opportunities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to participate in the negotiation process. Designation as an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``interested party'' will not incur any obligations. Submitters of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing proposals will be considered interested parties with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regard to the subject(s) of their proposals and need not respond  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the solicitation notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  4. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Negotiation of testing program and development of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ECA. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Negotiations will be conducted in meetings open to the public. Notification of meetings will be given only to persons identified as interested parties. The first negotiation meeting will establish the period for negotiation. If agreement is not reached within this prescribed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time limit and EPA chooses not to extend the negotiation period,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negotiations will be terminated and testing will be required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under a rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  5. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Approval of the ECA by interested parties and EPA and publication of a notice in the <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  After EPA and interested parties have agreed in principle on the terms of the ECA, the ECA text will be sent for approval to interested parties who are actual participants in the negotiation. Subsequent to approval of the ECA, EPA will publish a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  summarizing the testing program and announcing that in lieu of a test rule, the Agency has issued a testing Consent Order that incorporates the ECA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III.

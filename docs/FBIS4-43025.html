			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The National Council today made specific  decisions regarding future handling of the Cyprus issue.  Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said that in general,  there was consensus and unanimity on almost all issues. He also  said that the government will take the necessary measures to  deal with the developments as they are outlined. There is no  reason for concern, he said, and added that the Greek Cypriot  side has not subsided and will deal with every possibility. It  is possible, he said, that Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis  will go to New York in the coming days.    Following today's National Council meeting, President  Glavkos  Kliridhis briefed Greek Ambassador Alexandros Sandhis on the  decisions made in order for the latter to convey them to the  Greek Government.    When they arrived at the presidential palace this morning,  the political party leaders were asked to comment on reports  that the UN secretary general will submit a supplementary report  to the Security Council. Democratic Rally Chairman Ioannis  Matsis said it appears that pressure continues on the UN  secretary general, and some do not want to abandon the effort to  lead us where we do not want to go. Socialist EDEK [United  Democratic Union of Cyprus] Chairman Vasos Lissaridhis said that  if the UN secretary general submits a supplementary report, it  will mean that he has given in to pressure. Democratic Rally  Chairman Spiros Kiprianou [title as heard] said that if reports  are correct, it would be a new attempt to help out the Turkish  side. AKEL [Restorative Party of the Working People] General  Secretary Dhimitrios Khristofias said that he had no doubt that  there was an attempt to keep the confidence-building measures on  the negotiating table so that the two sides could meet each  other at some point. He added that yesterday's decision by the  National Council on the confidence-building measures was  correct, and that the issue is now whether the Greek Cypriot  side will remain firm in its decisions. [passage omitted]    Liberal Party President Nikolaos Rolandhis issued an open  letter to President Kliridhis in which he expresses the view  that the National Council has made a serious -- as he put it --  mistake in rushing with excessive speed to take a position on  the UN secretary general's report before the Security Council's  decision. Rolandhis also said that it was a mistake for the  National Council to close the book on the confidence-building  measures, and called on President Kliridhis not to reject a  proposal for the return of part of Famagusta if Denktas accepts,  even now, the 21 March document.</p>

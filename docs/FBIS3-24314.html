Hryb: 'Russia Needs Belarus, Just as Belarus Needs  Russia'"]    [Text] Not long ago Mecheslav Hryb, recently a  lieutenant general of militia, was elected the new head of  parliament in Belarus. He is interviewed by Lyudmila Novikova,  deputy editor in chief of ARGUMENTY I FAKTY.    [Novikova] Mecheslav Ivanovich, was it a surprise to you  when  you were elected chairman of the Supreme Soviet.    [Hryb] I did not want this.    [Novikova] Why?    [Hryb] Because I know the situation in the economy,  politics,  etc. Here one has to accept not congratulations but condolences.  I simply fulfilled the will of the president, who committed me  not to remove my candidacy.    [Novikova] How do you assess the present political and  economic situation in the republic?    [Hryb] It is very complicated. In a political sense, because  the fight for power became acute before the presidential  elections. Between parties, between groups, and even between  individual personalities. Only a cohesive, united, and  governable republic can come out of the crisis. It is not  governable today. Therefore, I am setting the task of organizing  governability as a priority. The economic situation in Belarus  is also extremely complicated. The volume of production is  falling, and individual enterprises are shutting down because  they do not have the money to buy energy resources and raw  materials to organize production. This is on the one hand. On  the other hand, more than 30 percent of enterprises are coming  to a stop because they do not have products for sale. After all,  the CIS countries are our sales market, first and foremost,  Russia.    [Novikova] Western products are cheaper and of a higher  quality, and this is what is bought. The market is the market.    [Hryb] The problem is that today Russia demands $74 from us  for 1,000 cubic meters of gas. But it sells it for $17 to its  own consumers. All of this goes into the cost of the commodity.  Plus customs duties of up to 30 percent. And when our product  reaches the Russian market, even if it is of a better quality,  it is not competitive in price.    [Novikova] What are you doing about this?    [Hryb] As chairman of the Supreme Soviet, in accordance with  the old constitution, I am the highest official, but I actually  do not have any rights. Everything has to be coordinated by the  Supreme Soviet, and it does the ratifying.    But the main thing is that we are trying as fast as possible  to conclude an economic union with Russia.    [Novikova] That is, join the ruble zone once again?    [Hryb] Let us analyze the nuances. An economic union with  Russia is the first step, joining the ruble zone is the second  step. By joining the ruble zone we would be able to buy energy  resources at the same price as Russia. The most reasonable  variant would be to buy at world prices. I am confident that  Russia will not be able to keep prices lower than world prices  on its own domestic market also. We need these prices today. We  are suffocating without them. Then, the removal of customs  barriers is also advantageous for Russia. I think that there are  opponents to this agreement in both Russia and our country. But  Russia is interested in Belarus to no less a degree. We also  have our advantages. In the final analysis, we are a corridor  for communications with Europe. For gas and oil pipelines. For  air defense, which we are conducting for the Russian Federation.  There are also other military installations that are located on  our territory in which Russia is interested. If everything is  calculated sensibly and soberly, both sides have interests. And,  secondly, this can be an excellent example for other states.    [Novikova] That is, you are again for the Union?    [Hryb] I am for an economic union. We have disrupted all  facets of cooperation, and we should somehow unite them through  the economy. Then the people will decide.    [Novikova] You will agree that there can be no economic  union  without a political one.    [Hryb] Why not? Why is Europe living in an economic union?  Take the three Slavic states: Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. We  have everything, and if we unite economically, we are  practically independent.    [Novikova] But the republics have fought so long and  persistently for independence.    [Hryb] Everything must have its time and place. No one is  encroaching on our sovereignty. The Supreme Soviet is inclined  to very active cooperation with Russia. And the population as  well. But there are also other interpretations. For example, the  statements of the leader of the People's Front, Poznyak, about  Russian terrorism in Soviet Belarus and about new borders. But  we do not accept him. The position of war and confrontation is  not our position. All kinds of things happened in history.    [Novikova] Mecheslav Ivanovich, you are a lawyer. How do you  assess the last action of our Duma concerning amnesty?    [Hryb] That is its business. It was able to adopt this law.    [Novikova] Would you adopt such a law?    [Hryb] Fortunately, we do not have such hostages, and there  are practically no political prisoners to this day. We tried to  find an accord, and we succeeded in hearing out the other side.    [Novikova] But you also recently had crowded rallies...    [Hryb] Two thousand people from the million and a half  population of Minsk came out during the agitation and propaganda  that was conducted for months on Independence Square. It was a  total failure. People are sick of it. And issues should not be  resolved at rallies.    [Novikova] Have you met with Yeltsin?    [Hryb] I have not met him in the position of chairman of the  Supreme Soviet. I only received congratulations from him, and I  thanked him. We had a very good conversation.    [Novikova] Do you have normal relations with Kebich?    [Hryb] They are normal. I do not know what kind of relations  he had with Shushkevich. Today, Shushkevich comes out on the  rostrum and says that he bears no grudges. But tomorrow they  appear once again. That is, they appeared overnight. Then there  are none again. Kebich and I have the same position with respect  to orientation toward the East and development of relations with  the West. He is engaged in his work, and I, in mine. We regard  each other respectfully. We exchange telephone calls, if it is  necessary.    [Novikova] Mecheslav Ivanovich, nonetheless, what is your  main objective now; after all, no matter what happens, you are  the head of state. What are you working on?    [Hryb] We are now working on adoption of the Constitution of  the Republic of Belarus. To date 152 articles have been passed  by an absolute majority. It remains to adopt the constitution in  its entirety and a law on the process for putting it into  effect. Then we can begin elections of the first president.    [Novikova] Do you think this will help us get out of the  crisis? There is a president in many republics.    [Hryb] This is not the problem. When it comes to a  president,  it is possible to identify negative cases, and it is also  possible to find positive cases. I think, nonetheless, that  there are more positive cases in the world than negative ones.  But a bad or good president will depend on whom the people elect.    [Novikova] Will you file your candidacy for president?    [Hryb] I do not have time for this now.    [Novikova] Whom do you see as president of Belarus?    [Hryb] It is better that I not name anyone, there are too  many candidates.    [Novikova] What do you think, is the appearance of a second  Kirsan Ilyumzhinov among us possible? Of the same age, the same  ambitions, and the same social position.    [Hryb] Everything is possible in life. There are also rich  people in Belarus.</p>

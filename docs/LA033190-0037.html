			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR AL DAVIS, HOME IS WHERE RAIDERS ARE  </P> <P> I had a dream. Los Angeles and Oakland both turned down Al Davis' request for a  billion-dollar franchise fee, so he decided that his would be the first team in  outer space, namely the moon.  </P> <P> However, upon applying for a license to take his team there, NASA rejected his  request. Their reason? "There is enough debris in space already."  </P> <P> AARON M. SHAYNE  </P> <P> and SHIRLEY E. SHAININ  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

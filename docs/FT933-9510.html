			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / French central bank trims overnight interest rate: Caution marks move to lower borrowing costs THE Bank of France cut overnight interest rates slightly yesterday. However, it underlined its cautious approach to lowering borrowing costs despite the increased room for manoeuvre resulting from the effective flotation of the franc. The bank cut the interest rate for 24-hour funds from 10 per cent to 9.75. The 5-10 day borrowing rate, suspended at the end of July and reintroduced last week, was unchanged at 10 per cent. The franc weakened following the announcement, slipping below FFr3.50 to the D-Mark. It is now more than seven centimes below its previous European exchange rate mechanism floor of FFr3.4305. The French currency's fluctuation bands within the ERM were widened from 2.25 per cent to 15 per cent at the beginning of the month following sustained speculative attacks. 'It is a step towards lower rates,' said Mr Christopher Potts, economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris, referring to yesterday's move. 'But it shows that the French government is keeping a close eye on the foreign exchange markets.' The importance of exchange rate considerations in French monetary policy reflects the fact that Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, has staked his credibility on a strong franc. It also reflects the central bank's desire to rebuild reserves severely depleted in its attempt to defend the franc. The need for continued adherence to a strong franc policy was expressed yesterday in an open letter to Le Monde newspaper. Signed by Jean-Claude Le Franc, described as a pseudonym for a group of senior French civil servants, the letter lamented the 'dislocation of the EMS' and said that France's right-wing political parties must not loosen monetary policy or let the franc fall. The letter, which praised the late prime minister, Mr Pierre Beregevoy who defended the franc against two assaults, appeared critical of Mr Balladur for failing to do so. But political analysts in Paris said the letter could also represent support for Mr Balladur who faces pressure from within his gaullist RPR party for rapid interest rate cuts and a more expansionary economic policy. Most economists expect the government to cut interest rates in an attempt to revive the recession-hit economy, but will do so gradually. Its strategy is expected to involve a continued easing in 24-hour rates so as to bring call market rates down from their current level of about 10 per cent.</p>

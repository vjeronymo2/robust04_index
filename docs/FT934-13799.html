			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Arts: Looking Through a Glass Onion - Theatre There is a mildly biblical sound to Looking Through a Glass Onion, the new entertainment at the Criterion. 'Glass Onion' is the name of a song by the late John Lennon; the looking through bit reminds one of St Paul, darkly. The sub-title is more accurate: John Lennon in Word and Music. The show is probably for addicts: to others it may seem a shade dull. Lennon is not nearly as inspired a musician as his one-time Beatles colleague, Paul McCartney. Nevertheless, he has a good story to tell. As the Beatles broke up, he went off with Yoko Ono to do his own thing. Someone else who did their own thing shot him dead in the street in New York. I admire the discretion of the production. There are the sounds of a couple of gun shots at the beginning, but we do not move to the final killing. This is largely a one-man show, written and performed by John Waters as Lennon. Waters simply tells the tale and sings the songs. 'We didn't come from Liverpool,' he says of the early Beatles, 'we were just there.' When they took off, 'every day was like the world cup final' (which England won when the Beatles were at their peak). Lennon admits the musical superiority of McCartney and the first act ends on 'Strawberry Fields' with the group still together. Then Lennon broke away, Yoko Ono, he claims not even knowing initially who he was. The pair of them became part of the peace movement of the early 1970s. According to the Waters version, the Anglo-Saxon press attacked Lennon because Yoko was a 'Nip'. The second half, however, is mainly songs, with some very effective lighting by Peter Neufeld and the musical direction and keyboards by Stewart D'Arietta. It struck me that there was one very clever off-rhyme; 'working placebo' with 'working class ego', but the linguistic acoustics are not perfect and I may have misheard it. Yet the piece did remind me of another off-rhyme, at least in modern English: 'Since 'tis not to be had at home, He'll travel for a martyrdom.' I've changed the gender, but that's the sort of thing Glass Onion is meant to be about: from Merseyside to London to the US. The religious touch in the title is not accidental. Criterion Theatre.

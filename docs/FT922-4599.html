			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: DoE softens line on unitary councils THE government has softened its view that the review of local government structure in English shires should lead to a wholesale adoption of unitary authorities, according to guidance to the independent Local Government Commission published yesterday. While Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, said that he expected 'substantially more unitary authorities in England after the review is completed than there are at the moment', the revised guidance explicitly recognises that 'in some areas the Commission may wish to recommend a continuation of the existing two-tier structure'. Mr Howard told a news conference at the environment department in London: 'The government does not wish to impose a national blueprint for reform, though I expect to see a substantial increase in the number of unitary authorities as a result of the review.' The draft guidance published in November by Mr Michael Heseltine expressed the government's view that unitary authorities could be the most beneficial structure in most areas. The guidance also spells out more fully how the commission should approach a cost-benefit analysis of possible changes to the existing structure, and extends the prospect of historic districts or cities retaining their identities without necessarily having councils, much as the draft guidance raised the possibility of non-administrative counties. Announcing the commission's programme of work, Mr Howard said it gave priority to areas 'with a history of dissatisfaction with the existing local government structure and to produce a balanced and manageable workload for the new commission'. As expected, Avon and Cleveland are among the first councils due for review. The commission will be required to complete its review in a particular area within eight to 16 months. The government intends that the first new authorities should be in place for April 1994, and that the changes should be completed in 1998. The first five or so members of the commission, which is expected to be about 12-strong, are likely to be announced within the month. Sir John Banham, the departing director-general of the CBI, is to chair it and is already looking for premises and preparing to recruit staff. Both the Tory-controlled Association of County Councils and the Association of District Councils welcomed the government's approach, but Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local government spokesman, said he feared the government's intention was to attack Labour county councils and 'pursue their overall agenda of centralisation and privatisation'. The Council for the Protection of Rural England, however, expressed some disappointment at the implications of the revised guidance for the environment. It warned that even the more detailed provisions still risked devastating the effective operation of land use and planning system under local authority control.

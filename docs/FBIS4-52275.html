			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Sim Chae-yun] </F>   [Text] Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae yesterday returned  home amid mixed appraisal on his first foreign visits that took  him to Japan, Russia and Germany.    During the 11-day overseas tour, Yi held meetings with his  counterparts and ranking government officials to discuss mutual  concerns with a particular emphasis on military exchanges and  security issues, including the knotty North Korean nuclear  problems.    Of particular note was that Yi was the first defense  minister  ever to visit the three countries. Yi took office last December.    He made the significant foreign visits in line with the  government policy to set up firm security relations with the  surrounding nations following his April 20 meeting with the  United States Defense Secretary William Perry he had just before  embarking on the overseas trips.    "Yi's visits have significant meaning in that they were  timed  with the rapidly changing security situation surrounding the  Korean peninsula," a ministry official said.    In Japan, Yi met former Defense Agency Director Kazuo Aichi  and agreed to expand military exchanges, mainly between military  personnel.    They reached agreement on the exchange of port calls by navy  vessels carrying cadets of the naval academies, promising to  realize the visit by the Korean side within the year.    They also signed a pact for the prevention of accidental  collision of military aircraft by notifying in advance the other  of flight plans in areas adjacent to open seas. [sentence as  published]    The visit to Japan was evaluated to have important  historical  meaning in that he paved the way for the military cooperation  between Seoul and Tokyo that has been regarded as a "taboo"  because the people still harbor bitter feelings for Japan's  1910-1945 colonial rule of Korea.    But, it lost steam since it was made in the middle of the  political chaos in the Japanese government without being able to  form a new cabinet after Morihiro Hosokawa resigned as prime  minister, military observers say.    After a spell of confusion over his visiting schedule Yi  managed to meet Aichi who was replaced later.    In Russia, Yi signed with Defense Minister Pavel Grachev a  1994- 95 letter of intent for the promotion of military  exchanges.    The two ministers agreed to upgrade the military exchange  level over that in 1993, promising to realize mutual visits by  ranking military leaders, with Grachev's visit to Seoul slated  for sometime this year.    The two reportedly discussed the issues regarding the  Russian  proposal to provide South Korea with military weapons to pay off  the $1.4 billion it owes for economic assistance.    But the ministry officials declined to confirm it, saying  the  matter is still under consideration.    The two ministers shared the view that the North Korean  attempt to develop nuclear weapons poses a serious threat to the  peace of the global community as well as in Northeast Asia.    In this vein, the North's nuclear ambition should be  deterred  under any circumstances and Pyongyang should return to the  Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) immediately to carry out  its duty as a responsible member of the international community,  they agreed.    The outcome of the Yi's visit to Russia was hailed as  successful as it placed a psychological burden on the North and  laid the groundwork for military cooperation between the  Cold-War foes.    But Yi came under fire for "wasting time without efficient  schedules from April 28 to May 3 which included weekend days and  Russian Easter day on May 2," the observers maintained.    Yi focused his efforts on ensuring procurement of Germany's  state-of-the-art military technology. But his bids seemed to  have failed due to Bonn's cautious attitude.    Yi and his German counterpart Volkere Ruhe adopted a joint  announcement pledging further military exchange, which the  ministry greeted as a momentous result, as it was the first  joint announcement made with non-NATO (North Atlantic Treaty  Organization) countries</p>

			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LEE'S 3 TOUCHDOWNS SPARK CRESPI  </P> <P> Sophomore running back Torie Lee scored three touchdowns to lead Crespi High to  a 21-7 Mission League victory over host Chaminade on Friday night in a  penalty-marred game.  </P> <P> Lee was Crespi's workhorse, gaining 191 yards in 34 carries.  </P> <P> He led off the scoring in the second quarter on a 14-yard pass reception from  junior quarterback Cody Smith (nine of 15 for 108 yards).  </P> <P> His second touchdown, a one-yard run, capped a 13-play, 61-yard drive to give  the Celts a 14-0 halftime lead.  </P> <P> "Torie had a very good physical football game for us tonight," Crespi Coach Tim  Lins said.  </P> <P> Crespi held Chaminade (1-5-1, 0-4) to minus-three yards in offense in the first  half and 97 in the game. However, the Celts were penalized seven times for 85  yards in the first half and 15 times for 185 yards in the game.  </P> <P> Crespi (6-1, 3-0 in league play) opened the second half with a nine-play,  70-yard drive -- capped by Lee's one-yard plunge -- to take a 21-0 lead.  </P> <P> Quarterback Jeff Meyer, who replaced starter Travis Hall (broken collarbone),  led the Chaminade offense in the second half. He completed eight of 20 for 91  yards and one touchdown, a 18-yard toss to junior Mike Sweeney for the game's  final score. GARY HYNES  </P></p>

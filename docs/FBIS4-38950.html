			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- The "Ukraine" democratic association on 1  June issued a statement in connection with the presence of  Russian cossack formations in Crimea. The document, in  particular, reads, as follows: "Recently, a neighboring state's  military formations have insolently held a so-called `grand  council' on our territory. They are guarding Crimea's antistate,  anti-Ukrainian parliament, creating havoc and raping women. We  demand the protection of Ukrainian citizens from unruly, armed  foreigners.    "We emphasize that the formation, development, actions, and  financing of the Russian cossacks are under the supervision of  the Russian Government. That is why we regard cossack raids on  our territory as Russia's interference in Ukraine's internal  affairs, the more so in that the existence and presence of  paramilitary public formations is outlawed in Ukraine."    The "Ukraine" democratic association demands that the  Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Ministry immediately lodge a note of  protest with the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry in connection  with the presence of Russian cossacks in Crimea and Russia's  active interference in Ukraine's internal affairs; that the  Internal Affairs Ministry deport Russian cossacks from Ukraine  and hold those from their formations who committed crimes liable  under Ukraine's laws; and that DerzhKomKordon [State Committee  for the Protection of Ukraine's State Border] immediately  enhance the regime of control at the border and introduce  Ukrainian entry visas to put an end to the influx of criminal  elements and prevent the import of drugs and arms.</p>

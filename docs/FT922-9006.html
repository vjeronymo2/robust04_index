			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / De Klerk orders 'hit squad' inquiry President F W de Klerk yesterday ordered a Supreme Court judge to reopen inquiries into the 1985 killing of a leading black activist after a newspaper alleged that a South African security agency was involved in the assassination. In the latest, and potentially most serious allegation about the existence of a government-directed hit squad, a Johannesburg newspaper yesterday linked the army intelligence chief with one of South Africa's most notorious political killings. It published what it claimed was an authentic document proposing the killing of Mr Matthew Goniwe and two other anti-apartheid leaders, dated June 7, 1985. The shot and mutilated bodies of Mr Goniwe and four colleagues, including the two named in the army intelligence document, purportedly sent to the State Security Council, (the highest state security body) were discovered two weeks later. The document is allegedly signed by Brigadier (now General) CP van der Westhuizen, now South Africa's military intelligence chief of staff. Mr de Klerk yesterday denied that any murder was ever ordered by the cabinet or the State Security Council, an inner cabinet which wielded massive power under former president P W Botha. If the newspaper can prove its claims, government will have to explain the current role of Gen van der Westhuizen. It would reinforce allegations the Government runs a 'dirty tricks' department, a pro-apartheid 'third force' within the security services. ANC president Nelson Mandela commented: 'People who were responsible for ordering the killing of a brilliant leader of the people are still in the army, probably in higher positions today.' There has been a string of unsolved assassinations of ANC officials in recent months.</p>

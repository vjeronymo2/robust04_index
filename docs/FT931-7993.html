			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / The importance of picking the right inflation target BRITAIN'S membership of the European exchange rate mechanism may have delivered painfully high interest rates, an uncompetitive exchange rate and a deeper recession than the government needed in order to control inflation. But it did have the advantage of simplicity. Monetary policy-making outside the ERM may be less painful; but, as the Bank of England's extensive inflation report demonstrates, it is much more complicated. In the ERM, the UK government's monetary policy was largely determined by the need to keep the exchange rate within its target zone, assuming this delivers low and stable inflation. But chastened by its ERM experience, and the failure of domestic money targeting in the early 1980s, the government now appears to have abandoned intermediate monetary targets altogether. Instead it has adopted an explicit inflation target, the annual rate of retail price inflation excluding mortgage interest payments, which the Treasury aims to keep within a 1-4 per cent range. The Bank of England, like the Treasury, appears in no mood to advocate a return to domestic monetary targeting. 'Inflation is a a monetary phenomenon,' the Bank confirms in language reminiscent of the writings of the monetarist guru and Chicago University economics professor Milton Friedman. But 'the lags between changes in monetary policy and changes in inflation are known only imprecisely, and will vary with the state of the cycle'. The current erratic behaviour of monetary aggregates merits only a little over one page in the Bank's 45-page report. Nor is the Bank willing to view the government's inflation target as a simple guide to policy. It makes sense, the report suggests, to announce an inflation target in order to guide expectations and to provide a means of assessing past performance. But 'monetary policy is set in relation not to the current rate of inflation but to inflationary trends over the next year or two'. The fact that underlying inflation rate is currently within its target range makes little difference to this judgment. The Bank also counsels against placing undue emphasis on the government's chosen inflation measure out of the many other inflation indicators that could have been picked. If all prices were to rise at the same rate, the Bank says, then there would be no ambiguity about the measurement of inflation. But relative prices change all the time. So while one price index is needed for assessing performance, and the underlying RPI is 'as good as any, and better than most', it would be 'unwise to rely on any single index as the only guide to inflationary trends in the economy'. Sterling's recent devaluation does, in fact, make it particularly important that movements in the underlying rate of retail price inflation are not the main guide to monetary policy. The devaluation will inevitably lead not only to higher import prices but also to a higher aggregate price level, and thus temporarily faster inflation, than would otherwise have been the case. What matters is that this rise in aggregate prices occurs through a rise in the prices of traded goods, largely manufactures, relative to non-traded goods in order to increase the profit margins of exporters and help close the trade deficit. This shift in relative prices is already under way. The left-hand chart tracks the squeeze on manufacturing export profit margins over the past seven years, the combination of sterling's appreciation and the poor state of the world economy. But last autumn's devaluation means that exporters have been able to raise the sterling prices of their goods, as the middle chart shows, which should increase export profit margins and volumes. Unless, that is, the rise in producer prices leads to higher wage inflation, thereby preventing the change in relative prices by spreading the increase in aggregate prices to non-traded goods as well. Wage settlements are currently depressed, largely because of the persisting recession. A rise in wage inflation, not the underlying RPI, should be the government's first serious inflationary danger signal.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------      INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: PRICES AND COMPETITIVENESS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Yearly figures are shown in index form with the common base year of 1985.

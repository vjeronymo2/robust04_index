			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Minister vetoes Scottish art plan Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, has vetoed the plan by the National Galleries of Scotland to establish a gallery of Scottish art in Glasgow, James Buxton writes. He said the plan, which had aroused intense controversy in Scotland, did not enjoy 'the broad general support appropriate to a major initiative of this kind'. Mr Lang's decision is a rebuff to Mr Angus Grossart, the merchant banker who is chairman of the trustees of the National Galleries of Scotland, and to Mr Timothy Clifford, the director of the galleries, who were the plan's proponents. The idea was to create a gallery to depict Scottish art and history. It would have been based around the collection in the Scottish national portrait gallery but include pictures from the National Gallery and the National Gallery of Scottish Art, all in Edinburgh, plus pictures in store. Glasgow made a successful bid for the new gallery to be in the city, but the plan caused an outcry when it was announced late last year. Opposition focused on the transfer of the portrait gallery collection, and there were objections to the idea of removing Scottish pictures from their international context, as well as to the choice of Glasgow rather than Edinburgh The trustees of the gallery then changed the plan to leave the portrait gallery untouched. Mr Lang said he would not have been prepared to permit the transfer of the portrait gallery collection in any case, but without this collection the proposals had 'lost their core'.</p>

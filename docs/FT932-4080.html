			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Leaked plan to cut invalidity benefit attacked THE GOVERNMENT was last night threatened with another damaging political row over its spending priorities after the leaking of plans to cut substantially the cost of invalidity benefit. A draft letter to the prime minister from Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, sets out proposals to tax invalidity benefit, make it less generous, focus it more on the long-term sick and introduce a tough medical test to restrict its availability. A clampdown on the benefit was widely expected but the leak's timing is highly embarrassing for ministers as they struggle to restore calm in Tory ranks after Mr Norman Lamont's damaging resignation speech. The proposals, drawn up in agreement with Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, would save Pounds 495m in the 1996-97 financial year and Pounds 1.3bn a year by the end of the century. But their impact on voters - particularly the elderly - will worry Tory MPs already nervous about losing the forthcoming Christchurch by-election where the Conservatives had a 23,000 majority in the general election. The letter to the prime minister, apparently accidently leaked to the Press Association news agency, says 'the changes are bound to be controversial' and reveals that Mr Lilley failed last year to win cabinet approval for similar changes. But it adds: 'I think the climate of opinion has now changed.' Mr Lilley also says that Mr Portillo favoured still bigger cuts. Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's Treasury spokesman, said Mr John Major had accused Labour of scaremongering in the past but now 'has no credibility left and is guilty of a gross deception on the British public'. The number of invalidity benefit claimants has grown from 600,000 in 1978-79 to 1.5m today while the cost has soared from Pounds 840m to Pounds 6.2bn over the same period - an increase that ministers do not believe corresponds to a rise in invalidity cases. Mr Lilley proposes restricting the changes to new benefit claimants. His letter says: 'Taxation would introduce an element of means testing which would be more acceptable than means testing the benefit itself.'</p>

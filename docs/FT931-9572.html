			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Nalgo challenges contracting out NALGO has launched a drive to ensure that the terms and conditions of employees remain the same when government departments contract out their computer services. The local government union is demanding a judicial review to compel the London boroughs of Hackney, Haringey, Tower Hamlets and Hillingdon to apply the EC directive - known as Tupe - which protects workers' pay and conditions. A review in Nalgo's favour, would, the union believes, create a precedent which would force all local and central government departments to adhere to the regulations. The boroughs, which share a single computing bureau, plan to contract work out to the private company CFM, a subsidiary of ICL, in April and not apply the regulations. CFM has refused to recognise Nalgo but has otherwise offered the 200 staff identical employment terms and conditions for the transfer. American Airlines has agreed to pay Pounds 80,000 to two unions - the TGWU general union and the AEEU craft union - in an out-of-court settlement involving an alleged breach of Tupe. The airline took over the Heathrow slots and staff of TWA in July 1991 and then offered workers new contracts without informing their unions. Under Tupe unions have to be informed of any changes in working practices. The Home Office yesterday announced the first contracts in the privatisation of the prison education service but many of them have been delayed by a High Court challenge under Tupe. Kent County Council is seeking a judicial review of the amount of notice given by the Home Office for the competitive tendering.</p>

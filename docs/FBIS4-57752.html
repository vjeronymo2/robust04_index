			<p>BFN     [Text] The Paraguayan and Romanian Governments yesterday  agreed to mutually promote and protect investments.  Representatives of the two countries signed a document at  Government Palace committing their governments to create  conditions to encourage investments between the two countries.  This is one of the main agreements between President Juan Carlos  Wasmosy and Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu.    Several documents were signed during the last day of the  official visit by the Romanian mission. The documents refer to  several bilateral projects between the two nations. The  agreement for the promotion and protection of investments is  based on the principle of nondiscriminatory treatment for  investors, seeking to enhance bilateral economic prosperity.    The agreement was signed by Foreign Minister Luis Maria  Ramirez Boettner and Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu.    The two governments also established more fluid contacts  seeking to work out a trade and economic cooperation agreement.  The idea is to create more favorable conditions for the  development of trade relations, economic cooperation, and to  promote and facilitate the exchange of products and services in  accordance with each country's legislation.    Ramirez Boettner and the Romanian foreign minister also  signed a memorandum of understanding to establish consultation  mechanisms on aspects of bilateral relations at the top Foreign  Ministry level.    Other bilateral agreements signed refer to cooperation in  science, education, culture, and sports.    The prime minister departed Paraguay at 1230 on 22 May. He  was seen off by President Wasmosy, ministers, and military and  civilian authorities.</p>

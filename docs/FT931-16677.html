			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian wheat crop ravaged by storms MORE THAN 40 per cent of Australia's wheat crop may have to be downgraded because of damage caused by heavy rain and hail storms, the Australian Wheat Board said yesterday. Mr John Lawrenson, managing director, said it would be several days before an accurate picture of the 'disastrous' harvest would emerge. However, the worst hit farmers are expected to lose up to half their forecast income. Officials said early estimates suggested that about 6m tonnes of the forecast crop of 14.4m tonnes had been affected by the weather, mostly in the week before Christmas. The bad weather has had little impact on the most valuable wheat grades, which are mainly produced in the warmer growing areas of Queensland and northern new South Wales. Conditions in South Australia, Victoria and southern New South Wales have had a devastating effect on production of Australian standard white wheat, which accounts for about 80 per cent of exports. About half the damaged wheat may have to be downgraded to feed grade wheat, intended for animal consumption. Feed grain is expected to sell for about ADollars 120 a tonne gross, compared with ADollars 180 a tonne for standard white. The board said it may be difficult to dispose of thedamaged wheat because of an international glut of feed grain caused by weather damage to European and Canadian crops and a record US maize harvest. Officials said there were no plans to destroy surplus grain, but some of the damaged wheat may be placed in storage until next year in the hope that prices will rise. Some of the damaged crop will be sold as lower grade milling wheat, at prices between ADollars 145 and ADollars 165 a tonne. Prices for the premium grades are expected to be unaffected. The board said it expected gross returns of ADollars 230 a tonne for prime hard wheat at 13 per cent protein, and ADollars 192 a tonne for hard wheat at 12 per cent protein. Growers had hoped for a big improvement on the 1991-92 crop of 9.6m tonnes, when drought exacerbated the effects of a financial squeeze caused by high interest rates.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Skachko: "Not All Have Resigned </F> Themselves to the Success of Soviet Power: Paths of Development  of the Presidency in Ukraine"]    [Text] Leonid Kravchuk gave three reasons for his decision  not to be a candidate for the early presidential elections in  June. First, the inopportune and inexpedient nature of  presidential elections at a time when elections to the new  parliament might not have been completed or when it would only  just have been formed. Second, in Leonid Kravchuk's opinion, his  participation in the elections would signify defense of the  socioeconomic situation that has taken shape in Ukraine. And,  finally, Leonid Kravchuk is unwilling to run because, were he to  do so, the other candidates would focus attention not on the  advancement of their programs of the development of the state  but on proof of the incapability of Leonid Kravchuk.    The other event of the week was the consideration in  parliament of the law on the election of the chairmen and  deputies of the local soviets of all levels and revisions to the  law adopted earlier on the elections for president of Ukraine.  The latest documents have, in fact, opened the way to the  restoration in Ukraine of soviet power in full, the difference  being merely that the soviets are not now backed by a united  Communist Party directing their work. Consequently, the new  soviets, controlled by different political forces in different  regions, could perfectly well under the conditions of the  weakening of the central authority contribute to the further  federalization of Ukraine. In addition, the revisions to the law  on the elections for president were clearly made in the  interests of candidates of the so-called power party for in  accordance with the new law, for example, only a nominee for  whom 50,000 signatures have been collected, of which no fewer  than 1,000 signatures need to have been collected in two-thirds  of the oblasts, may register as a candidate. Inasmuch as only  voter collectives and political parties, which in Ukraine  possess neither money nor sufficient influence, may nominate  presidential candidates, only the organized power structures are  capable of performing such work in support of their candidate.    President Leonid Kravchuk and the presidential structures  retain several options for further action. For example,  reconciling themselves to defeat and giving power to popularly  elected soviets and their chairmen combining, in addition, the  positions of chiefs of the local executives. It is this, it  would seem, to which Leonid Kravchuk's refusal to run at the  elections points. But Kravchuk himself made it understood in a  subsequent interview with the BBC that he, not being a member of  any party, could not be a party candidate but could, on the  other hand, be nominated by a voters' assembly, which he could  not prohibit from so doing. It is perfectly possible that Leonid  Kravchuk's refusal statement was nothing more than an endeavor  to test his popularity and provoke so-called letters from the  working people, who would demand that Leonid Kravchuk "not  abandon them at a difficult time for the country." Testifying in  support of this supposition is the fact that the surprise  decision was for the first time in the period since the election  of the president in Ukraine criticized on official radio and  television.    There are also other options, which are directly connected  with the parliamentary elections, which are already planned. One  of them--the passive-legitimate--is seeking the victory of  supporters of the executive at the elections, forming a  parliamentary majority, and adopting a clear policy of the  building of a presidential-parliamentary republic. That this  option is not being discounted is indicated by the numerous  nominations of representatives of the executive and the  presidential structures as candidates for people's deputy.    The second path may conditionally be called  active-legitimate. Its essence consists of aborting the March  parliamentary elections and, taking advantage of the  unpopularity of the present Supreme Council, whose authority  would be automatically extended, organizing an all-Ukraine  referendum on confidence in parliament, winning it, scheduling  new parliamentary elections, and canceling the presidential  elections, giving as the reason for this a reluctance to create  a power vacuum. The question of Leonid Kravchuk running or not  running would in this case disappear automatically.    The presidential structures could only venture upon this  option given the high popularity of Leonid Kravchuk, and this,  as we all know, is lacking: The president's rating is  approaching the zero mark.    But there remains to the presidential authorities one  further  scenario similar to the not entirely legitimate Russian  scenario, when the president, after parliamentary elections  which have not taken place, may without an all-Ukraine  referendum terminate the authority of the unpopular present  deputies, dissolve parliament, and set a date for new  parliamentary elections, timing to coincide with them a  referendum in support of his policy and, naturally, canceling  the presidential elections. The high popularity of the president  and a constructive program of reforms and an improvement in life  which is attractive to the population and which could be  presented for popular confirmation are needed for such a turn of  events also. Kravchuk's team has neither.    Of course, that both parliamentary elections and  presidential  elections, at which the winners would be representatives of the  reform forces, who would venture upon decisive actions and could  confront the degradation of the country, will be held could be  forecast also. But given the lack of coordination of action of  such forces and given the fragmentation of the democratic camp,  the main feature of the political struggle in Ukraine remains  the fact that it leaves the economy practically untouched. The  mass of the two groupings of the "power party" defending either  soviet power or the presidency remains supporters of a slow  version of reform of the economy. Only the liberals, few in  number, the representatives and proteges of new capital and new  owners and also the national democrats support a faster pace of  market economic reform. The possibility of their creating a  parliamentary majority in the event of elections being held is  very, very problematical.</p>

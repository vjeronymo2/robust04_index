			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN'S MAN AT THE ARMS CONTROL TABLETHE GREAT UNIVERSAL EMBRACE ARMS  SUMMITRY: A SKEPTIC'S ACCOUNT BY KENNETH L. ADELMAN (SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER:  $19.95; 368 PP.)  </P> <P> During much of Ronald Reagan's presidency Americans were treated to the  spectacle of appointees to high office speaking and acting as if they wished to  emasculate or even abolish the departments of government they had ostensibly  been hired to run. Education, Interior, Environmental Protection, Health and  Human Services, a host of regulatory agencies -- all at one time or another  were led by persons for whom lifting the weight of their own organization from  the backs of the governed was a mission akin to a religious calling.  </P> <P> Adelman came to the Arms Control Disarmament Agency after polishing his  ideological credentials as deputy to Jeane Kirkpatrick, the U.S. representative  to the United Nations. He replaced Eugene Rostow, the crusty former Yale Law  dean and founding member of the Committee on the Present Danger, who was fired  when Reagan's inner circle began to fear that he was too willing to strike a  deal with Moscow. (Those were the days when the Kremlin was still the center of  the "Evil Empire.")  </P> <P> Adelman, 36, saw it as his mission to save Reagan from the "arms controllers."  He writes: "No arms control deal can prevent nuclear devastation, reduce the  risk of war much, if at all, save money, or increase U.S. security, again much,  if at all." Arms control, he continues, "could easily hurt but cannot easily  help the nation; it is something to view more often with trepidation than  anticipation."  </P> <P> Although Adelman underlines Soviet statements, going back to Lenin, lauding  disarmament as sand in the face of the capitalist enemy, he does not join his  ideological friends who argue that success in negotiations with the Russians  will lull the West into a false sense of security and therefore into lowering  its guard. Quite the contrary. "It is hard to imagine the country being lulled  when conservatives keep sounding alarm bells about the perils of being lulled,"  he says. And the guard stays up: "No major American weapons system has been  stopped or seriously constrained by the terms of an arms agreement."  </P> <P> Here, indeed, is one root of Adelman's skepticism about the utility of  negotiated arms control. Agreements thus far have tended to curb only weapons  the two superpowers have not valued highly, and both have rushed to compensate  for reductions by building more of those weapons not covered by agreements. "No  area of science, medicine, or even public policy would continue to elicit so  much hope after so many years of unsuccessful effort," he writes. "Arms control  must be approached as one of the intangibles of life, a rite seemingly needed  to satisfy some deep longing in our collective soul." (His book takes its title  from a fabled disarmament conference among the animals in which each beast  proposed abolishing those weapons upon which its predators most relied until at  last the bear arose and said: "Comrades, let us abolish everything --  everything but the great universal embrace.")  </P> <P> Like some liberals these days, Adelman prefers reciprocal unilateral steps to  negotiated formal agreements. One side independently would eliminate a certain  number of deployed weapons or suspend production in one category, and then look  around to see what the other does in response. That would eliminate the  paranoid scratching for marginal advantage that often characterizes  negotiations. An example, at least in principle, is Soviet President Mikhail  Gorbachev's announcement late last year that by 1991 his country would reduce  its armed forces by half a million men, and eliminate a number of tanks and  artillery pieces, the weapons the West fears most, from positions facing NATO  forces. If he follows through with those reductions he can then reasonably  expect a comparable gesture from the West. If no such reciprocal move is  forthcoming he will be able to draw appropriate conclusions.  </P> <P> Where Adelman parts company with liberals is in his unswerving support of  Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) and his refusal to acknowledge that  a U.S. capability to destroy some incoming Soviet missiles might raise the  risks of war in a future crisis by spurring the Soviets to launch first, rather  than sit back and allow us to destroy a portion of their missiles in their  silos and then use our defenses to pick off most of those missiles they do  succeed in launching. He also fails to recognize that the very aspects of arms  control that he dismisses as ritualistic have had real value in inducing  Washington and Moscow to use their military relationship as a channel of  communication when their disagreements left them unable effectively to talk  about any of the other issues dividing them.  </P> <P> Adelman's book is schizophrenic about the Soviet Union. Its acknowledgement of  the profound changes under Gorbachev is grudging in the extreme, and tempered  by repeated recitations of all the international mischief that Moscow is  allegedly still working. That is not surprising: The pace of change in the  U.S.S.R. over the last year has been so rapid as to catch off balance any  author -- especially one who, like Adelman, takes such pains in so many  passages to establish his true-blue conservative coloration.  </P> <P> The most interesting parts of Adelman's book are not his provocative arguments  about arms control or his lucid and objective explanations of nuclear doctrine,  but his accounts of bureaucratic warfare over arms control within the  government in Washington, and his vivid narratives of the three  Reagan-Gorbachev meetings in which he participated. Especially good is his  description of the frantic, unscripted Reykjavik summit of October, 1986, in  which the two presidents, negotiating without aides, appeared to be on the  verge of a deal for eliminating nuclear ballistic missiles. His aim, he says,  was not to write a kiss-and-tell memoir, but his portraits of Reagan and his  principal lieutenants, especially Secretary of State George Shultz, Secretary  of Defense Caspar Weinberger and White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan, pull  no punches. And although he avows great affection for Reagan, in his pages the  President comes across as a genial stopped clock, right twice a day, but in  Reagan's case, Adelman argues, right when it counted. (The most memorable scene  -- Reagan's John Wayne-like remark to a television set showing Gorbachev's  arrival in Reykjavik: "When you stop trying to take over the world, then maybe  we can do some business.")  </P> <P> Adelman's book is marred by a patronizing, snide tone. The State Department, he  notes in a typical passage, fought one of his proposals "with an intensity  rarely displayed in its dealing with the Soviets or others around the world."  And just in case a reader does not fully grasp his point, he coyly adds a  parenthesis: "(State's 'diplomatic entrance' features a flower garden filled  with pansies and bleeding hearts.)"  </P> <P> The horticultural note suits Adelman's purpose, but it happens not to be true.  So, alas, do many other things he says. I cannot recall a book with more  factual errors. Most are minor -- names misspelled, numbers or dates wrong. But  many are serious. The Soviets, he writes, "now station more troops (in East  Germany) than exist in the entire United States Army." Wrong: The 1988 numbers  were 380,000 and 760,000, respectively. Evgeny Velikhov, the Soviet physicist,  is a "two-timer who manages their SDI program and castigates our SDI program on  the U.S. lecture circuit." Wrong: Velikhov has worked on lasers but plays no  significant role in the Soviet anti-missile program. The Soviets lead the  United States "on (SDI-related) ground-based lasers, particle beams, and  terminal defense." Wrong: Most experts say the United States leads in all these  fields. There are other incorrect statements. Many others are misleading. Some  seem designedly so. And the book is singularly devoid of references.  </P> <P> Adelman's glib, reckless writing will put off many readers. That is  regrettable, because his book is a significant contribution to recent history.  And its arguments deserve to be pondered.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO QUALITY OF MERCY  </P> <P> It is possible that Cuban Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez will be spared from a  firing squad by the his old friend and leader, Fidel Castro, but it would be  out of character for the Cuban dictator. Castro has decided that his island's  future lies in the most rigid and unforgiving Stalinist Communism, including  purges and show trials for those unfortunate apparatchiks who stray from the  party line.  </P> <P> Straying from the line may well be what doomed Ochoa and three other Cuban army  officers who were convicted in televised trials last week of smuggling drugs  and other crimes. In publicly admitting that high-level government officials  were involved in drug smuggling, the Castro regime contradicts a long-standing  denial of drug shipments through Cuba.  </P> <P> Few ever believed that, and some of his fiercest critics, including officials  in the U.S. government, are convinced not only that Cuban officials are  involved in drug trade, but that Castro himself has a hand in it. There is no  real evidence that Castro is directly involved, but it strains credulity that  high-ranking Cuban military officers could engage in illegal activities without  the jefe maximo of that tightly controlled island knowing something about it.  So there must be more to this case than a sudden decision by Castro to punish  drug traffickers.  </P> <P> The Ochoa trial may be as much political as criminal. Ochoa is not just any  general. He is a veteran of the Cuban revolution and commanded troops for  Castro in Ethiopia, Angola and Nicaragua. Ochoa may have been Cuba's most  popular man in uniform next to Castro. And that may have been why Castro and  his heir-apparent, brother Raul Castro, saw Ochoa as a threat.  </P> <P> Ochoa was educated in the Soviet Union, and has close ties there. He was one of  the few Cubans with enough prestige and power to disagree with Castro on the  merits of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms and the need for  similar experiments in Cuba. Castro has made it very clear he wants no  perestroika and glasnost on his island, and putting a popular and respected  leader like Ochoa up against the wall may be one way of reminding everybody in  Cuba who's in charge. That's the way Josef Stalin did it during the darkest  days of Soviet history.  </P></p>

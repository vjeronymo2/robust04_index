			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Castle Communications accepts Pounds 24.5m offer from US group Castle Communications, the USM-quoted record and video publisher, yesterday announced an agreed Pounds 24.5m bid from Alliance Entertainment of the US hours after the details appeared in a newspaper. The 360p a share cash offer has been accepted by directors and other investors accounting for 52.8 per cent of Castle's share capital. To the embarrassment of both companies, an interview with Mr Joseph Bianco, Alliance's chairman, giving the price of the offer appeared in the European Wall Street Journal. 'We didn't know the Wall Street Journal was going to put it in the European edition, which came out before we could make the formal announcement,' said Mr Bianco. Castle and its advisers discussed the problem with the Stock Exchange before the market opened and requested that trading in the shares be suspended until the full announcement was posted. After consulting the Takeover Panel, the Stock Exchange decided against a suspension and asked Alliance to put out a brief holding statement which did not include the price. This appeared on the screens at 9.40am, at which point the shares were still unchanged at 340p. They had risen to 355p by the time the full announcement was made at 2.28pm. Alliance, which is the largest independent distributor of recorded music in the US, has been looking to buy music copyrights and was attracted by Castle's catalogue of rights to 1960s and 1970s groups such as the Kinks. 'Castle also has a bunch of the best people in the business of exploiting those copyrights,' said Mr Bianco. Mr Terry Shand, Castle chairman, said: 'This is a unique opportunity for Castle to further develop its international business, to continue to expand its catalogue of rights and to take advantage of Alliance's considerable distribution network.' Castle shares jumped 58p to 335p two weeks ago when it announced it was in talks that might lead to an offer. The company was floated at 200p in 1987.</p>

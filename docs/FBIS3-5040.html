Korean People and Students Urged To Turn Out in </F> Anti-War, Anti-Nuke Struggle"--KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, March 3 (KCNA) -- "Let all the patriotic  people from all walks of life, who truly want to enjoy a  peaceful life in the territory of 3,000 ri free from nuclear  weapons and war, turn out in a nationwide anti-war, anti-nuke  struggle to remove the crisis of a nuclear war hanging over the  nation and safeguard peace!"    A spokesman for the Central Committee of the South Korean  National Democratic Front appealed this in a statement on Feb.  25, according to radio Voice of National Salvation from Seoul.    Drawing attention to the ever-expanding anti-war, anti-nuke  struggle of the South Korean people of different strata, the  spokesman said:    "All the patriotic and democratic forces and activist  organizations should raise higher the torch of the anti-war,  anti- nuke struggle and expand and develop it into a nationwide  struggle involving people of broad strata, one person inspiring  ten, ten persons a hundred, and a hundred persons a thousand.    "The entire people who set store by the destiny of the  nation  should rise as one in the anti-U.S. struggle to get the U.S.  troops and nuclear weapons withdrawn immediately, decisively  oppose the planned deployment of 'Patriot' missiles and  categorically frustrate the nuclear war games.    "Kim Yong-sam is the first-class traitor to the nation who  has unhesitatingly opened the whole rice market, the blood and  flesh of the people, flattering and yielding to outside forces,  and who does not mind plunging the whole country into the  holocaust of a nuclear war.    "The entire people should wage an anti-Kim Yong-sam struggle  on a nationwide scale, mindful that the nation would be  exterminated if his bellicose group is pardoned."</p>

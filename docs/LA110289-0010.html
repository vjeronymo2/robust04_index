			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEEL FABRICATORS  </P> <P> Esther McCoy's article "Los Angeles Case-Study Houses" (Opinion, Oct. 8)  revived memories by this retired steel fabricator. Houlberg Iron performed  several such houses, the most notable being Craig Ellwood's "Case Study House  Number One," on Schuyler Road in Beverly Hills (circa 1952). P.B. Philbrick was  the general contractor and proclaimed he only used $200 worth of wood on the  entire structure, and that was the forming material for the concrete floor and  foundation!  </P> <P> Ellwood was a perfectionist who demanded that all welds be ground smooth, and  hand-filed mitered corner joints were the rule. This was Houlberg Iron's first  such project. I also recall examining the drawings of the late A. Ouincy Jones'  "Below Grade" design (mentioned in McCoy's article) in his offices in West Los  Angeles and was excited by the sheer simplicity of lightweight steel  construction carrying the design to clean-cut perfection.  </P> <P> J.

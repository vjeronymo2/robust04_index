			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Racal back in the black with Pounds 23m - Shares fall 17p as turnround fails to meet company's expectations RACAL ELECTRONICS, the data communications, radio and network services group, yesterday reported the expected turnround but not to the extent anticipated by Sir Ernest Harrison, its chairman. Operating profits for the half year to October 9 increased by 28 per cent to Pounds 26.8m while at the pre-tax level a loss of Pounds 2.4m was turned into profits of Pounds 23.1m. Sales declined 6 per cent to Pounds 448m. The interim dividend of 1.5p is 3.4 times covered and comes from earnings per share up from 0.28p to 5.16p. Racal-Redac, the computer-aided design systems business, lost Pounds 3m in the first half after appearing to be on target for break-even at the time of the demerger of Chubb. The data communications division produced operating profits of Pounds 4.3m against a loss of Pounds 1.78m. This was cut on sales of Pounds 173m (Pounds 178m) and included profits for the first time of Pounds 2m from the Government Network Services arm. Mr David Elsbury, chief executive, said the market had to remember that data communications always enjoyed greater volume in the second half. Radio communications improved its margin by two percentage points to 16 per cent. Profits were Pounds 12.5m. Following the demerger of Chubb Security the result included interest receivable of Pounds 4.1m, an Pounds 11.6m swing from the Pounds 7.4m charge last year. The group also took high exceptional charges of Pounds 7.78m, covering redundancies, although it was half the figure for the same period last year. Net debt was reduced by positive cash flow from a pro-forma Pounds 61.2m, at the time of the demerger, to Pounds 59.7m after Pounds 18m of capital expenditure. COMMENT While these figures were broadly in line with expectations, the market remains concerned that Racal's biggest division, data communications, has still not convincingly turned the corner. And Redac again disappointed, turning in a loss where break-even was expected. Yesterday's share price fall - down 17p to 154p - has much to do with the shaving of full-year forecasts that this triggered and some profit taking after a strong run up in the share price. But earnings growth is still good and the possibility of a bid - the prize being the potential for raising data communications' margins - still cannot be ruled out. Even with shaved full-year forecasts of Pounds 50m, giving earnings of 11.1p, Racal is still on a slight prospective discount to the market and good value as it started its recovery from such a low base.</p>

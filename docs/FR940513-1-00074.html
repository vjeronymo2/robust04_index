			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The EPA is proposing that standards for the control of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vapors captured during the loading operations be one of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following: (1) A combustion device meeting 98 percent or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater destruction efficiency or (2) A recovery device  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting 95 percent or greater recovery efficiency. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difference in control efficiencies between recovery and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combustion is designed to not prohibit recovery systems,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which have smaller secondary air emission (sulfur dioxide,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nitrous oxides, and carbon monoxide) impacts than combustion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems. The smaller emissions reduction is also warranted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because these emissions are recovered as product instead of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> destroyed. Additionally, the EPA has data supporting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 95- and 98-percent control efficiencies as achievable for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery and combustion devices, respectively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Docket A&hyph;90&hyph;44, items II&hyph;A&hyph;7 and II&hyph;B&hyph;1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For terminals that use recovery devices for control of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline vapor emissions, the EPA is proposing an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative means of compliance. Such sources can comply by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensuring an outlet concentration of 1,000 ppmv or less for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions from gasoline loadings. The EPA believes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1,000 ppmv limit for gasoline vapor is generally more strict  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than the 95 percent reduction requirement. Data from an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing facility show this limit to be achievable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Docket A&hyph;90&hyph;44, item II&hyph;B&hyph;13). The intent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration alternative is to allow those facilities that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operate at a higher efficiency than required by the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard to perform a simpler compliance test, as they would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only have to test at the outlet of the control device.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because of the lower emission factors associated with crude  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oil emissions, the fact that hydrogen sulfide present in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> crude oil may poison the activated carbon, and that there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are no known facilities controlling crude oil emissions with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carbon adsorbers, the EPA is not proposing a concentration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative for controlling vapors from crude oil emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 5. Impacts of the Proposed RACT Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The environmental, costs, energy, and economic impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the proposed RACT standards are summarized in Tables 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through 3, and are represented by Regulatory Alternative II.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> They are also discussed in parts C.2. and C.3. above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Economic effects of the proposed RACT standards include a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum price increase of approximately 0.2 percent and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nationwide employment reductions of less than fifty. Up to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> five terminals controlled under the proposed standards could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be under increased competitive pressure. Economic effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on oil tankers include an average control cost per barrel of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> crude oil loaded equal to $0.002.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A primary concern in the implementation of the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards is safety. Section 183(f)(1) dictates that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA consult with the Coast Guard and consider safety when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgating these standards. Section 183(f)(2) states:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Regulations on Equipment Safety._Within 6 months  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after the date of the enactment of the Clean Air Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendments of 1990, the Secretary of the Department in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Coast Guard is operating shall issue regulations to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure the safety of the equipment and operations which are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to control emissions from the loading and unloading of tank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessels, under section 3703 of title 46 of the United States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Code and section 6 of the Ports and Waterways Safety Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (33 U.S.C. 1225). The standards promulgated by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator under paragraph (1) and the regulations issued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by a State or political subdivision regarding emissions from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the loading and unloading of tank vessels shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the regulations regarding safety of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department in which the Coast Guard is operating.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The Coast Guard regulations (55 FR 25396) were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgated in June 1990, before the passage of the amended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act. These standards dictate equipment, system, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operational requirements for vapor control systems for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benzene, gasoline, and crude oil. The EPA has maintained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communication with the Coast Guard throughout the rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process. All control systems installed as a result of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulation would be subject to the Coast Guard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, and nothing in the proposed standard should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construed as to require any act or omission that would be in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violation of any regulation or other requirements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> United States Coast Guard or prevent any act or omission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to secure the safety of a vessel or for saving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> life at sea. Representatives from the United States Coast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guard have participated in all phases of the development of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these proposed rules. The EPA is confidant that these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations are consistent with the Coast Guard regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that the safety factors have been adequately addressed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 6. Attainment/Nonattainment Status and Site Specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Risk Assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> At one time, the Agency was considering planning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulating based exclusively under the authority of section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 183(f). During this time, the Agency held a public meeting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to discuss a possible approach for considering a facility's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment/non-attainment status with respect to NAAQS ozone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program and a facility's site specific risk to the public in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developing the standards (see Docket A&hyph;90&hyph;44, item II&hyph;E&hyph;42).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This approach would have required intensive effort on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part of the Agency and the regulated community to develop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable criteria and technological methodologies for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrating whether the criteria have been met. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with regulation under section 112, any facility that might  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been exempted from RACT under section 183(f) with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach discussed at the public meeting would ultimately be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated under the MACT standards of section 112.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, no further consideration was given to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> D.

			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / A world of uncertainty: Developments from Germany to Japan have loosened the Group of Seven's grip on the global economic structure By rights, the next few days in Washington should be a period of quiet satisfaction for the capitalist west. Russia and the other republics that emerged from the wreckage of the Soviet Union have completed the formalities to join the International Monetary Fund next week (IMF), marking their entry into the international financial community and their acceptance of market economics. But there is no sense of triumph in the finance ministries and central banks of the world's richest nations, as they prepare for tomorrow's meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries and the regular spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank on the following two days. Over the past six months, it has dawned on policymakers that the world economic structure of the 1980s, which the G7 - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, the UK and Canada - could dominate, is no more. Nobody pretended it was an ideal economic order. But the G7 participants knew enough of each other's temperaments and goals to avoid damaging, public rows most of the time and occasionally to attempt ambitious schemes for co-ordinating policy. The old certainties have been replaced by widespread uncertainty and confusion. In the interdependent world economy of today, such confusion could pose a threat to the G7 nations and smaller industrialised countries too. Economists and pundits still like to think of a tri-polar world, with economic influence shared between the US, the European Community and Japan. But over the past six months, this vision has been threatened by bewildering developments in a vast territory from the Rhine Valley in the west to Tokyo in the east. Western policymakers are no longer able to assess accurately the import of three distinct economic developments: Nobody knows what is happening to the Russian economy: whether its precipitate decline in activity is approaching bottom or whether more misery lies ahead. It has become increasingly unclear whether Germany can make a success of unification. Some of Germany's trading partners fear that the new Lander will be incapable of being weaned off subsidies and transfer payments from the west, necessitating high German fiscal deficits and high interest rates for a considerable time. The causes and dynamics of Japan's shrinking stock market values are not clear to policymakers in other G7 countries. Officials in the US, Canada and Britain learned the hard way in the 1980s that asset price deflation is difficult to manage and translates all too easily into real recession. Although Japan's trading partners have so far accepted the assurances of Tokyo that all is under control, doubts remain. These three imponderables cannot be taken in isolation. The interdependence of the world economy means that all have serious implications for other countries. Germany's problems of integrating the new eastern Lander were felt throughout Europe last December. To curb the monetary expansion unleashed by massive fiscal transfers and subsidies to the east, the Bundesbank raised its interest rates to levels last seen in the 1930s. Since the G7 last met in Garden City, Long Island, in January, recognition has grown among Germany's trading partners that the country's problems are not those of an overmighty central bank. Instead, attention has focused on the mix of monetary and fiscal policy. The IMF this week joined the fray, calling for a more rapid reduction in Germany's fiscal deficits to help lower European interest rates. Such action is easier to prescribe than carry out, however. Transfers from west to eastern Germany totalled some DM140bn (Pounds 48bn) in 1991. The Bundesbank has calculated that last year's deficit amounted to about 4 per cent of German gross domestic product, and was therefore only slightly above its level at the beginning of the 1980s. But various costs of unification, including the accumulating debts of the Treuhand agency charged with privatising east German companies, have been kept off balance sheet. Counting in these factors, some independent experts believe German fiscal deficits are nearer to 6 or 7 per cent of GDP than the 3.6 per cent general government deficit projected for this year by the IMF in its latest World Economic Outlook. Such figures beg important questions regarding Russia. If the Germans have such difficulties absorbing eastern Germany, what hope can Russia and the other east European countries have for their own economic progress? And how far will the G7 finance ministers and central bankers be prepared to go to provide aid for Russia? Mr Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, said last week that he thought the Russian reform programme was intact. But nobody in western finance ministries or central banks has a clear idea of what Russian monetary policy constitutes. One example of confusion is the Russian attitude towards currency stability. Reports this week have suggested that the Russian government wants to adopt a 'crawling peg' system of adjustable exchange rates for the rouble. If that is the case, there will be no point in the west's discussing a Dollars 6bn stabilisation fund for the rouble at the G7 meeting tomorrow and at the meeting of ministers and central bankers from the Group of 10 big industrial countries on Monday. Although the west welcomes Russia and other former Soviet republics into the world of free markets, G7 officials have serious misgivings about committing their taxpayers to large-scale financial support. As a senior official muttered this week: 'What if Russia is just a bigger and endless version of eastern Germany?' There are worse scenarios: what if Russia and some of its neighbours fall prey to the same destructive trends that have plunged the former Yugoslav republics into civil war? Unanswered questions also remain over the possible damage that Tokyo's stock price slide could wreak. The lessons of the US, UK and Canada are that such asset price deflation heightens the risk of spectacular corporate failures. In Japan's case, it is easy to imagine growing problems for the country's banks when their capital bases have already been eroded by losses on large shareholdings, and more difficult borrowing conditions for clients of these banks abroad. Confidence in Japan would be greater if the government were more effective or more transparent. But G7 officials admit that it is difficult to gain an insight into the workings of the weak and scandal-prone administration of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa. These deep-seated worries throw the IMF's latest forecast of lacklustre 1.4 per cent growth in the world economy this year into sharp relief. The problems of Germany, Russia, Japan and the rest of the industrialised world would be easier to contemplate if growth were more assured. Whether these concerns surface in the final communiques of the G7 or the other meetings in Washington this week is open to doubt. Interesting discussions in such forums tend to produce bland statements. But the increased difficulty of managing the world economy cannot be held off the international agenda, and will be ripe for discussion at the Munich World Economic Summit of G7 leaders in July.</p>

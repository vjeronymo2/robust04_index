			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (22): Performance takes priority over cost - Charges / A good fund manager will be able to make up the initial charge to investors over time THE CHARGES that investors have to pay when they put money into a unit trust are relatively transparent  - particularly when compared with insurance products, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. Ironically, it is partly because of this transparency that many investors think they are too high; and, in the past few years, some providers have responded by cutting some of their charges. The element of competition that they have introduced into the market has fed through into an existing debate about how it ought best to structure its charges. The charges an investor faces are: THE ANNUAL CHARGE Since a unit trust is a managed fund, it charges an annual fee for the manager's services, which is usually in the region of 1-1.5 per cent each year. The higher the annual fee, the greater the chunk of the investment taken out by the manager to pay for research costs, software and the manager's salary. Investors must also pay ancillary charges for services such as trusteeship; in total, these are normally well under 1 per cent. THE INITIAL CHARGE This covers the costs of setting up the investment, which includes administration, paperwork and the commission paid to the intermediary selling the trust. The last is in the region of 3 per cent. The initial charge is usually between 5 and 6 per cent. So, from an outlay of Pounds 1,000, only Pounds 950 would actually be invested if the initial charge were 5 per cent. For many unit trust companies, the problem in reducing the initial charge is how to sell the product without paying the 3 per cent commission to an intermediary to do it for them. The alternatives are an expensive advertising campaign, strong performance to attract investors (which most members of the public are unlikely to be aware of without the help of their financial adviser) or building up a sufficiently large fund so that costs can be covered by the annual management fee. A handful of investment houses have managed to reduce their initial charge. Lazard cut the initial charge on its unit trusts altogether in 1988. Last year, Murray Johnstone, the Glasgow fund manager, reduced its initial charge from 6 per cent to 1 per cent. However, it partially compensated itself by increasing the annual management fee from 1 to 1.5 per cent. Lazard also charges an annual fee of 1.5 per cent. Bond funds usually have a much lower initial charge  - in the region of 3 per cent  - because the cost of dealing in gilts and bonds is lower than that on equities. Cash unit trusts often have no initial charge at all. THE BID/OFFER SPREAD Investors buy units at one price (the offer) and sell at another (the bid price). The offer price is always higher than the bid price. The difference between the two prices is known as the bid/offer spread, and is expressed as a percentage of the offer price. A typical bid/offer spread is usually about 6 per cent, but it can be wider. The cancellation price, which applies when the fund is shrinking and the manager is forced to sell investments, is the minimum bid price. Many investors think the initial and annual charges are the only ones to worry about and ignore the bid/offer spread, which is the true cost of investing in the fund. The spread includes the initial charge but also the costs of buying and selling the underlying investments (which will often have their own bid-offer spreads). Offshore companies have a single price (ie no bid-offer spreads) but the investor pays their initial charge separately. This is known as single pricing. Many in the industry, particularly those with plenty of offshore funds, have argued that single pricing would be a simpler and clearer way of quoting charges, and would bring the industry in line with the rest of Europe. The advantages of single pricing are not clear-cut for investors. Some argue that the true costs of creating new units are not passed on to new investors, imposing a burden therefore on existing investors. Under single pricing, existing unitholders would have to meet the costs of shrinking or expanding the fund when demand and supply do not match. Under the current system, new and departing investors pay those costs through the bid-offer spread. 'Single pricing would favour short-term investors at the expense of those investors taking a longer-term view, not something that the industry should be seen to encourage,' said Alan Maidment, managing director of Martin Currie unit trusts. The single-pricing debate is far from resolved. More pressing is the question of changes to the rules to permit unit trusts to introduce exit charges  - a well-established US practice which could enable funds to reduce their initial charge and would encourage long-term investment. The regulations do not stop this method of charging for unit trusts held within a personal equity plan. Fidelity was the first to do this by cutting its initial Pep charge from 5.25 per cent to 2 per cent, while imposing an exit fee of 3 per cent in the first year, declining steadily to zero after three years. The move was followed by Gartmore and Scottish Equitable. Although charges are important, performance takes priority. A good fund manager will be able to make up the cost of the initial charge to investors over time, while a fund with low charges but weak performance will make far less money for the investor. However, by investing in a fund with low charges, the investor should be tilting the odds in his favour.</p>

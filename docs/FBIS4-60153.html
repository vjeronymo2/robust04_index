			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] A spokesman for the Zionist entity's army has  announced that Israeli commandos have kidnapped Mustafa  al-Dirani, a leader of the Islamic resistance, from his house in  the village of Qasr Naba in Lebanon's al-Biqa' Valley.  Kidnapping and government terrorism are the main  characteristics of the Zionist entity and the declared policies  of Tel Aviv's Government.    Israel's brutal government lives in fear of the Muslims'  power and the ability of the Islamic resistance front in Lebanon  and occupied Palestine. The blows dealt by the Islamic  resistance keep Israel in a constant state of nervousness.  Therefore, it crushes all international values and norms and  rushes to announce its responsibility for kidnappings, killings,  and the most horrible crimes.    Israel has not minded perpetrating massacres, killing  Palestinians and breaking their bones and demolishing their  houses, and raiding south Lebanon and destroying residential  areas in Iqlim al-Tuffah. After all, the usurper state of  Israel was founded on the ideology of killing, terrorism, and  crime. This is how it has managed to establish itself in the  heart of the Islamic world for some length of time.    The Muslim Lebanese people, who are facing the Zionists in  the first line of battle, have a long and enlightened history of  confrontation with the Zionist entity. Over 13 years of direct  Zionist intervention in Lebanon, interference by other  international arrogant forces, and attempts by political  Maronite forces to divide Lebanon, the revolutionary Muslims  have played an important role in foiling all these conspiracies.  The massacres of Sabra and Shatila, and the destructive war  ignited by Michel 'Awn are still remembered. Those were links in  a conspiracy designed to annihilate the Lebanese Muslims,  restrict their freedom, and deny them their rights.    But it was the revolutionary Muslims who ended the theory of  Israel's steel arm in southern Lebanon. They stood up against  the despotic tendencies of Michel 'Awn's Maronite Army. They  forced that Army, which paved the way for the Zionist aggression  against Lebanon and the arrival of Israelis at the door of  Beirut, to surrender. The Lebanese people foiled the schemes of  Western espionage against Muslims. Their continued presence on  the political stage, therefore, is the guarantee of Lebanon's  independence and steadfastness in the face of Western schemes of  partition and Zionist schemes of sedition.    The name of the Islamic resistance front is associated with  the confrontation and repulsion of the Zionist aggressors. The  Islamic resistance in southern Lebanon is the only defensive  line against usurper Israel. Had the resistance not been there,  the Zionists would have realized their dreams. Lebanon's entity  is preserved through the jihad of the valiant Islamic resistance  front. The Zionists perpetrate acts of terrorism and kidnapping  because of their impotence and helplessness in the face of the  Islamic resistance in southern Lebanon.</p>

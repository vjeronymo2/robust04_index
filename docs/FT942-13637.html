			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: Boost for annuities This year's dive in the UK gilts market - about a 10 per cent drop in the price of 20-year stocks since January 1 - might have given investors a rough ride, but those about to retire could benefit. For sliding bond prices mean a rise in yields. And, when yields rise, so do annuity rates. The present trend of the high coupon, gross redemption yield of 15-year gilts virtually forecasts how annuity rates will move over the following few days. Annuity rates determine the income received by buyers when they retire. Life companies generally set their annuity rates in line with existing yields of long-dated government stock. But life expectancy rates also matter. Norwich Union, among others, announced new rates in January as a result of revising its life expectancy tables. Interestingly, the changes were not all one way. So, where does this leave the investor with a pension fund to cash in? First, consider if you need an income now or can afford to delay buying an annuity. If you see a low growth, low inflation environment continuing indefinitely, you could feel that now's as good a time as any to buy your annuity. You might, however, feel that the government could be forced to crank up the economy, with a consequent rise in inflation - and, therefore, annuity rates. You can, of course, hedge your bets by considering phased retirement so that you buy your annuities over a period of time. Second, you should shop round, using your open market option. This allows you to select the best annuity rate on offer, even if it is not from the life office running your fund. At any one time, there can be as much as a 25 per cent difference between the best and worst providers, which means substantial savings over the period of your retirement if you choose the right one. Remember, too, that different products suit different needs. Escalating annuities are an inflation hedge. And it can be tax-efficient to use your tax-free lump sum to buy a life annuity.

			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: BP The strangest thing about the board changes at BP is their timing. A week ago, the poor annual results were accompanied by sincere expressions of boardroom solidarity. Now that looks distinctly hollow. The individual changes may be logical enough, but as a whole they give an impression of turmoil. BP's chairman has been out wooing the big institutions of late. After yesterday that is going to be an even harder job.</p>

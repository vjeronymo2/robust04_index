			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Germany clarifies tax rule GERMANY'S Finance Ministry, attempting to close a potential loophole, is to ensure that Germans with accounts abroad are liable for a new tax on interest income, Reuter reports from Bonn. It will take effect at the start of next year. German bond prices fell last week on speculation that foreigners would be made subject to the modified 25 per cent withholding tax on interest income, agreed last November, or that Germans with non-resident accounts would have to pay it. The Finance Ministry last week made clear that there were no plans to make foreigners subject to the tax. The ministry said, however, that German banks acting as paying agents for interest income would be free to release it only after they had learned which investors outside Germany were not citizens and therefore not subject to the tax.</p>

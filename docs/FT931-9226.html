			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / International Company News: Happy to net a good return / A preview of the David Lloyd flotation MR DAVID Lloyd is expecting to bring his rapidly growing chain of tennis-based sports centres to the market early next month in a flotation he hopes will value the company at Pounds 50m. Ten years after launching his first club in Heston, the former Davis Cup tennis player and oldest brother in one of Britain's most successful tennis families, is to attempt to serve his most lucrative ace. Fired by a dearth of facilities, Mr Lloyd returned from running tennis centres in North America and set up his first David Lloyd Club in 1982. Since then six more clubs have been opened, membership has risen to 33,000 and profits have climbed sharply. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 625,000 in 1990 to Pounds 3m in the year to September 1992 and sales have more than doubled to Pounds 15m. Almost from the beginning, Mr Lloyd tweaked the formula so that today the seven centres are really fitness clubs -  that include gyms, squash courts, swimming pools, creches and restaurants -  centred around covered tennis courts. One benefit of the Lloyd formula is strong cash flow. So far, the centres have all been profitable in their first year. The trick is to ensure that the 20 per cent of members who drop out each year are rapidly replaced by new members and new signing on fees. Opening new centres also ensures a low tax rate -  about 10 per cent - as the company takes advantage of capital allowances. Mr Lloyd believes local authorities are more willing to grant planning permission in favourable locations, because the facilities are offered to local communities and schools. The decision to go public lies partly with Leisure Holdings, the Irish investor which owns 72 per cent of the equity and wants an exit. But Mr Lloyd is also keen to expand more quickly. 'The market is totally under-developed,' he says. 'From cash flow, bank facilities and the proceeds of the float we can open two facilities a year.' Advisers say that a float valuing the company at Pounds 50m would raise about Pounds 11m, reducing gearing from about 80 per cent at the last balance sheet date to below 20 per cent. Leisure Holdings, which is selling all its stake, would receive more than Pounds 36m. Mr Lloyd, who put all his investments into the first venture where he ran most of the club, including the kitchen and the bar, would retain 10 per cent of the company. No doubt this is one return Mr Lloyd is happy to net.</p>

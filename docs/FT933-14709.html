			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Tomkins shares fall despite raised dividend TOMKINS, the conglomerate which in December bought Ranks Hovis McDougall, the milling and baking company, increased earnings per share by 4 per cent last year but showed it has yet to convince investors of the merit of the acquisition. Reporting a year that demonstrated little consumer or industrial recovery in the UK or the US, Tomkins said pre-tax profits rose 29 per cent at Pounds 171.0m, on sales up 62 per cent at Pounds 2.06bn. Mr Greg Hutchings, chief executive, said RHM had neither enhanced nor diluted earnings in the period. Fully diluted earnings per share rose from 12.74p to 13.26p. The group is recommending a 4.545p final dividend - on a capital base enlarged to pay for the RHM acquisition - to make a 6.35p total, up 21 per cent. Although Tomkins' profits were in line with City expectations, the shares shed 11.5p to close at 212.5p. The fall follows a 16 per cent underperformance relative to the FT-All Share index since the start of the year. Mr Hutchings said it was not that institutional investors were criticising the acquisition as being less than good, 'it's just that they are saying 'prove it'.' Analysts said the share price fall reflected disappointment that Tomkins had given no more information on the extent of asset write-downs at RHM. Nor had the conglomerate produced evidence that RHM could be quickly turned around. Tomkins said operating margins at RHM were marginally lower on an annualised basis but that cost cutting measures this year should reverse the decline. Mr Hutchings said that in spite of closing four bakeries, which had removed about 8 per cent of baking capacity, RHM had not lost market share. 'There is not significant overcapacity left' in baking, he said. Tomkins finished the year with Pounds 120m of net cash. The group remained strongly cash generative and saw scope for reducing working capital at RHM. It did not see any signs of recovery in consumer or industrial confidence. But its high operational gearing would enable it to benefit when its markets did begin to grow strongly. Lex, Page 16; Details, Page 18</p>

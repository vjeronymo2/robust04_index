			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- Kazakhstan's President  Nursultan Nazarbayev arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday [6 April] for  a four-day visit, and talks with Japanese political and business  leaders.    Nazarbayev is scheduled to meet business leaders Thursday  and  hold talks with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in the evening.  On Friday, he is to meet Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko,  and hold a press conference.    Nazarbayev, 53, is accompanied by Kazakhstan business  executives and cabinet ministers, including Akezhan  Kazhegeljdin, first deputy prime minister, and Galym Abilsiitov,  deputy premier, and minister of science and new technology.    In talks between Nazarbayev and Hosokawa, Japan is expected  to voice support for Nazarbayev's efforts to promote  democratization, economic reforms and a shift toward a market  economy, Foreign Ministry officials said.    Japan will give high marks to Kazakhstan's entry into the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) as a nonnuclear state last  December and reaffirm its intention to cooperate in dismantling  Kazakhstan's nuclear weapons in accordance with an agreement  signed last month, the officials said.    Specifically, the Japanese Government will agree to help  people who were exposed to radioactivity near the former Soviet  Union's Semipalatinsk nuclear testing site by sending medical  experts and providing medical equipment, ministry sources said.    An estimated 233 million tons of radioactive substances are  left in Kazakhstan.    The costs will be covered by 100 million dollars Japan  pledged last year to help four former Soviet republics dismantle  nuclear weapons. The four are Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and  Kazakhstan.    Also on the agenda for talks are environmental cooperation,  economic cooperation and expanding personnel exchanges, the  officials said. The environmental cooperation involves  preservation of the environment in the Aral sea, they said.</p>

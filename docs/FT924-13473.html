			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (4): A fresh approach - Telecom ventures / Development funding THIS AUTUMN in the US, a new group of telecommunications specialists starts work at the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in Washington. Their brief is to provide funding for new telecommunication ventures around the world, and signals a new approach to investing in infrastructure by the World Bank Group. The IFC is the arm of the World Bank which looks after funding for commercially-oriented entrepreneurial ventures. It compliments the World Bank's wider role in assisting governments with public infrastructure projects. Traditionally, the IFC has only funded relatively small telecommunications projects such as regional paging networks. The long-term and more costly infrastructure installations remained strictly within the domain of the World Bank, which provided substantial loans to governments. Now that many governments are looking to the private sector to build and run infrastructure projects, it seemed appropriate for the IFC to take a wider role in telecoms. The IFC has been given a boost to its funding and has a remit to provide finance for very large projects, although the World Bank will also continue with its interest in the sector. Typically, new projects today are financed using a combination of loans from several sources. Money from the World Bank, IFC or other aid body, could be put together with direct investment by a foreign telephone company, as well as funding contributed by the government or network operator itself. Eastern European countries can also apply to the European Investment Bank or the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, (EBRD). For example, Bulgaria is getting Dollars 150m for an overlay network to connect the main towns and cities. More than half is coming from the European Investment Bank, and from funding generated by the Bulgarian phone company itself. The rest will be provided by the EBRD and the World Bank. Telecommunications networks are considered an attractive investment opportunity, because they can generate large profits once the network has been installed. Yet organising funding for new projects can be fraught with problems. A big factor in a decision to invest in telecomms is the political stability in the country which is looking to install the network. This is because the government retains the right to regulate tariffs, radio spectrum, way-leaves, and many other issues which affect the phone company's ability to carry out its business. In a shaky political environment, investors tend to run shy. Most of the interest among the lending bodies at the moment is turning towards eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). But interest is also reviving in some Latin American countries, such as Chile and Mexico, where the political environment is becoming more friendly to outside investors. However, each of the lending organisations operates differently. World Bank loans are agreed between the bank and the government of a country. Of the total sum lent, a portion may be for telecommunications. Loans are normally for 20 years, with a five-year grace period. The IFC acts more like a commercial bank. It could, for example, choose to take an equity stake in a venture, instead of just lending the money. According to Tim Nulte, a principal economist at the IFC, it will look for projects that offer a good commercial return, but it will act with a social conscience. This means that rural networks will not be neglected in favour of those serving business or large metropolitan markets where the profits are more obvious - 'under the right conditions, independent phone companies can be a very good business,' he says. Some eastern European countries are keen on the idea of having lots of small phone companies, which they believe could get phones into people's homes and offices more quickly than the incumbent monopoly phone company. The IFC could look favourably at this concept, based on the success of smaller phone companies in the US. Telephone companies invest directly in new networks by taking an an equity stake. They also take a proportionate share of the profits. They therefore look for the projects which have the greatest commercial viability. However, the phone companies also have to carry some of the risk in local currencies: they have to accept payment from subscribers in roubles, zlotys or forints, and re-invested the money locally. Some lending agencies have been criticised for only taking repayments in hard currency. But they have to borrow the money on the world financial markets in order to make the loan in the first place. They have to get hard currency in order to meet their own commitments. All investors in new telecomms networks put forward certain prerequisites before they will hand over any money. Nick Williams, a partner at Touche Ross management consultants, says that most lending agencies want to ensure that the regulatory environment is favourable to generating profits. They insist that the government restructures the telecommunications sector. The first step is usually to hire a foreign management consultancy to assess how best to do this. The money to pay for consultancy studies is often obtained as a direct grant from individual government's overseas aid funds. According to Nick Williams, there is a widely-held view that a strong, monopoly phone company that has the opportunity to get going on a firm footing, with perhaps the prospect of competition at a later stage. Telecommunication networks can start earning revenue quite early in their life: as soon as a new exchange is in place, it can start putting through calls. The income from the first stage is normally ploughed back into the business, to build up the network. Typically, the 30-40 per cent of the infrastructure cost which is self-funding, and that has to come from revenue generated. There is a fear that if competitive networks, along the lines of the British or US model, were introduced, it could damage the chances for these brand new networks to develop profitably. Lending agencies also like to see that steps are in place to turn the phone company from what was an unresponsive state-run organisation into a commercially sharp one. There is a need to learn financial and commercial skills which they have not previously needed. These include double entry accounting, cost centres and marketing. A particular concern in this sense is tariffs. In much of eastern Europe, call-charges are still priced the same way they were under the old communist regimes. Mr Williams explains that most tariffs are too low to generate the revenue needed to meet the loan repayments, yet to raise charges is politically unacceptable. In some cases, tariffs should be raised by 200 per cent. For example, in Czechoslovakia, the government decided recently not to increase it. Yet a new digital overlay network will require Dollars 1.5bn in funding, and the call charges are around 2p for an untimed local call.</p>

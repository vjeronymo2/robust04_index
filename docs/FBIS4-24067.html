			<p>BFN     [Text] Back to Rwanda for the second part of this bulletin,  with our guest, OAU Deputy Secretary General Pascal Ngayama.    The Organization of African Unity announced yesterday that  it  did not support French intervention in Rwanda. In a communique,  the OAU--which groups together 53 member countries--says that  the way this operation is being prepared, including the fact  that all the belligerents have not agreed to it, is extremely  risky. Ghislaine Dupont asked Ngayama why the OAU rejected  French intervention, although it accepted that of UN soldiers:    [Begin recording] [Ngayama] What is still rather curious--or  rather sad, if you like, in that kind of situation--is that  individual states always find the means to act, but they never  find any means in a concerted fashion. This is what is  happening, in a way. We would like more consultations.    [Dupont] Do you mean that France has acted alone in this  venture?    [Ngayama] In a way, because one resolution has been adopted  by the United Nations, and another will most probably have to be  adopted in order to give the go ahead to the action begun by  France. However, we would have liked to have as much cooperation  from the sides as possible. It would, of course, be deplorable  if one side did not cooperate, because it would have been  necessary for this side--the Rwandan Patriotic Front, in  particular--to really cooperate. Having said that, it goes  without saying that this does not mean that the OAU is  discouraged or does not wish the [word indistinct] to succeed.    It is just the opposite. We think we need to surround  ourselves with the greatest possible number of precautions, to  get the greatest possible agreement between all the sides, in  order to ensure that the action being undertaken can find some  support from everyone, in order to guarantee the desired success.    [Dupont] Do you support the Senegalese decision to agree to  participate in this humanitarian intervention force?    [Ngayama] There is no doubt that any state, any member of  the  OAU or of the international community, is perfectly free to  participate in this action--even if, let me say it again, this  action is not, let us say, in contradiction with what has been  done. [sentence as heard]    The aim of the OAU and of the international community, we  are  sure, is to arrive at a solution in accordance with the Arusha  agreements and to stop the massacres and end the hostilities.  There is no doubt about this. The OAU is a bit concerned that,  perhaps, by acting alone this might be a hindrance.    [Dupont] In the end, however, does not this dramatic crisis  in Rwanda show the impotence of the OAU, which, after all, tried  to create a mechanism to prevent conflicts more than a year ago  now? Is accusing France of going it alone not tantamount to  saying that the continent, the organization of this continent,  cannot do anything?    [Ngayama] No, do not think that. The OAU is working in  consultation with the United Nations, which has the main mandate  for maintaining peace and security in the world. There is not  one specifically African security in which only Africans are  involved. There is international security for which the United  Nations has a specific mandate. So we have a mechanism that  complements that of the United Nations. It is not a parallel  mechanism.    What we have established, in agreement with the United  Nations, is to supply what we were told the international  community was not able to supply: troops, for example, to  implement the decision of the United Nations. We are waiting  for the logistical support that the African states do not have  to be supplied by the international community or by the United  Nations. That is really what it is.    What has happened, however, is as if these efforts were  viewed poorly, or did not deserve interest or consideration or  to be supported. One individual state preferred to act alone.  The OAU decries a situation that it would have welcomed  normally, if it had been integrated into the context of the  efforts that we have always made with our partners in the  international community as a whole, including Africa's main  partners, certain great powers: France, the United States,  Germany, Belgium, and so on, as has always happened before.

			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: HOME IMPROVEMENT;  </P> <P> OLD REFRIGERATORS COST COLD CASH  </P> <P>  QUESTION: My old refrigerator/freezer has required several service calls  lately and I should get a new one. Is there much difference in the  energy-efficiency of refrigerators and what should I look for?  </P> <P> ANSWER: An old refrigerator/freezer can be the energy-hungry appliance in your  home. There is a tremendous variation in the energy-efficiency of  refrigerator/freezers. The electricity savings from replacing your old  refrigerator/freezer with a new, efficient one can pay back its purchase price  over its lifetime.  </P> <P> Energy-efficient refrigerator/freezers use smaller motors and compressors that  run less. Therefore, they should be virtually maintenance-free and quiet. Also,  since they have more insulation, food stays colder for longer periods during  power outages.  </P> <P> The most efficient design has the freezer above the refrigerator. This design  provides the most efficient flow of cold air throughout the unit. It also  requires the least amount of door gasket length, an area of great energy loss.  </P> <P> A typical side-by-side refrigerator/freezer uses about 25% more electricity  than a comparable freezer-on-top model. It is inefficient and difficult to keep  a tall vertical freezer cold enough, and there's more door gasket area.  </P> <P> Select the smallest refrigerator/freezer that is an adequate size for your  needs. A larger one loses more energy through its greater wall surface area.  Also, a reasonably full refrigerator uses less electricity than a more-empty  one.  </P> <P> A manual-defrost model is most energy-efficient. In order to automatically self  defrost, electric heaters come on inside your refrigerator and freezer several  times a day to melt the frost. In addition to using electricity for the  heaters, the compressor must run longer to cool it down again.  </P> <P> A model with separate temperature controls for the refrigerator and freezer  sections saves energy. Particularly, if you plan to keep frozen foods for  extended periods, you can set the freezer section colder without needlessly  lowering the temperature of the refrigerator section too.  </P> <P> Some new energy-efficient models have a small door within the large  refrigerator door. You can put frequently used items there so you won't have to  open the large door as often. An exterior ice dispenser saves energy. This  greatly reduces the loss of cold air and any frost buildup.  </P> <P> You should select a model that has an energy-saver switch. There are small  heaters near the door gasket area to reduce sweating. This switch turns these  heaters off when sweating isn't a problem.  </P> <P> You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 267 showing model numbers of  100 of the highest-efficiency refrigerator/freezers from 12 to 28 cubic feet,  capacities, and estimated annual electric operating costs for each. Please  include $1 and a self-addressed business-sized envelope.

Is it worthwhile to take a rake and level it better?  </P> <P> A: It would probably be a good idea to inspect it closer. Leveling it will  reduce the overall energy loss through your attic floor. Wear a breathing mask  and goggles when handling the insulation. Also, make sure that the insulation  did not settle over the soffit vents and block them.  </P> <P> Letters and questions to Dulley, a Cincinnati-based engineering consultant, may  be sent to James Dulley, Los Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati,  Ohio 45244.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Court rules lorry owners negligent The owners of a lorry which ran out of control killing six people could face prosecution after a coroner yesterday ruled that the deaths were 'involuntary unlawful killing'. The inquest had heard that all eight brakes on the tipper truck were defective when it crashed into a car and a van and ploughed into shops and houses in Sowerby Bridge, West Yorkshire, in September. Mr Mark Hinchliffe, deputy coroner for Halifax, exonerated the lorry driver, who died in the crash. Mr Hinchliffe told the hearing in Bradford that he had found a 'high standard of proof' that the owners of the lorry - Fewston Transport of Skipton, North Yorkshire - were grossly negligent. Mr Hinchliffe said there were people in different capacities in Fewston Transport who, by virtue of their office, responsibilities and expertise, had a duty to have regard to the health, welfare and safety of road users, and the public. He said there was a breach of that duty in this case on the part of one or more persons in failing to ensure that the brakes on the lorry were in good working order. 'That breach of duty arose from gross negligence to such a degree which should, in the opinion of this coroner's court, justify a conviction,' Mr Hinchliffe said. The coroner said the lorry had gone 49 working days since its last full safety check with no credible evidence of another one imminent. It was not the only lorry 'slipping through that particular net'. Inspector Gary Walsh, who headed the investigation, said he intended 'to have further discussions with the Crown Prosecution Service to assess the most suitable way forward'.</p>

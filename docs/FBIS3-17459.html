At the same time, the  MPPM is concerned that "although the frontist-unionist ideology  and political formations have suffered a total failure, their  adepts, hidden in ministries and academies, in structures of the  National Radio and Television, public education and culture, in  rightist newspapers, in the leadership of the Writers' Union,  continue to mislead the people." They corrupt the faith of the  young generation in the specificity of the Moldovan people and  its culture, they impose by all means the concept of Romanism of  the Moldovans, the declaration asserts. Its authors claim that  supporters of unionism want to transform Bessarabia, according  to the model of 1918, into a province of Grand Romania.  [passage indistinct]</p>

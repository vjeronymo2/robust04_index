			<p>CSO     [Text] The Nippon Protector Co. Ltd. (president: Yoshio  Sakai; TEL 06-384-3371), a maker and distributor of battery  rechargers, has developed a compact sealed-type battery  recharger that is waterproof and designed to be used in electric  vehicles. Calculations done by the company indicate that the  battery recharger can provide enough power for an  electric-powered light van to travel up to 10 km with one  15-minute charge, and 40 km with a one-hour charge. The company  reported that this was half the time that conventional battery  rechargers took. It plans to put the battery recharger into  full-scale production by summer of next year in hopes of selling  it to auto manufacturers. The price of the recharger is still  undecided at this time.    The newly developed battery recharger employs a direct  high-frequency switching system, and has an 87 percent energy  efficiency. The company said that it does not use a condenser to  switch from AC to DC power. This enabled them to make the  recharger lighter. It uses a 30-amp constant-current recharging  system that enables recharging at places where single-phase 200V  outlets are available. It has a built-in microprocessing unit  that starts recharging automatically. The battery recharger  weighs 17 kilograms, and at 50 cm x 26 cm x 56 cm, is one-third  the size of a conventional recharger.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ordinary term-of-years and life interests. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  If the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest to be valued is the right of a person to receive the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income of certain property, or to use certain nonincome-producing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> property, for a term of years or for the life of one individual,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the present value of the interest is computed by multiplying the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value of the property by the appropriate term-of-years or life  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest actuarial factor (that corresponds to the applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 7520 interest rate and term-of-years or life interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period). Internal Revenue Service Publication 1457 includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actuarial factors for an interest for a term of years in Table B  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and for the life of one individual in Table S. However, term-of- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years and life interest actuarial factors are not included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table B or Table S in &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6) of this chapter. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Internal Revenue Service Publication 1457 (or any other reliable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source of term-of-years and life interest actuarial factors) is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not conveniently available, an actuarial factor for the interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be derived mathematically. This actuarial factor may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> derived by subtracting the correlative remainder factor (that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corresponds to the applicable section 7520 interest rate and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> term of years or the life) in Table B (for a term of years) or in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table S (for the life of one individual) in &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6), as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the case may be, from 1.000000. For information about obtaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actuarial factors for other types of term-of-years and life  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interests, see paragraph (d)(4) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Annuities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (A) If the interest to be valued is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> right of a person to receive an annuity that is payable at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> end of each year for a term of years or for the life of one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual, the present value of the interest is computed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiplying the aggregate amount payable annually by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate annuity actuarial factor (that corresponds to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable section 7520 interest rate and annuity period).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Internal Revenue Service Publication 1457 includes actuarial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors in Table B (for an annuity payable for a term of years)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and in Table S (for an annuity payable for the life of one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual). However, annuity actuarial factors are not included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Table B or Table S in &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6) of this chapter. If  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Internal Revenue Service Publication 1457 (or any other reliable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source of annuity actuarial factors) is not conveniently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available, an annuity factor for a term of years or for one life  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be derived mathematically. This annuity factor may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> derived by subtracting the applicable remainder factor (that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corresponds to the applicable section 7520 interest rate and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annuity period) in Table B (in the case of a term-of-years  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annuity) or in Table S (in the case of a one-life annuity) in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6), as the case may be, from 1.000000 and then  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dividing the result by the applicable section 7520 interest rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expressed as a decimal number. See &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(d)(2)(iv) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chapter for an example that illustrates the computation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present value of an annuity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) If the annuity is payable at the end of semiannual,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quarterly, monthly, or weekly periods, the product obtained by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiplying the annuity factor by the aggregate amount payable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annually is then multiplied by the applicable adjustment factor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set forth in Table K in &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6) of this chapter at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate interest rate component for payments made at the end  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the specified periods. The provisions of this paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)(2)(iv)(B) are illustrated by the following example:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  On July 1, 1989, the donor agrees to pay the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annuitant the sum of $10,000 per year, payable in equal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> semiannual installments at the end of each period. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> semiannual installments are to be made on each December 31st and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> June 30th. The annuity is payable until the annuitant's death.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 1, 1989, the annuitant is 68 years and 5 months old. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> donee annuitant's age is taken as 68 for purposes of computing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the present value of the retained annuity. The section 7520 rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for July 1989 is 10.6 percent. Under Table S, the factor at 10.6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent for determining the present value of a remainder interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payable at the death of an individual aged 68 is .31371 Converting the remainder factor to an annuity factor, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described above, the annuity factor for determining the present  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value of an annuity transferred to an individual age 68 is 6.4744  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1.00000 minus .31371 divided by 10.6). The adjustment factor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from Table K in the column for payments made at the end of each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> semiannual period at the rate of 10.6 percent is 1.0258. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aggregate annual amount of the annuity, $10,000, is multiplied by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the factor 6.4744 and the product multiplied by 1.0258. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present value of the annuity beneficiary's interest is,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, $66,414 ($10,000&times;6.4744&times;1.0258). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (C) If an annuity is payable at the beginning of annual,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> semiannual, quarterly, monthly, or weekly periods for a term of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years, the value of the annuity is computed by multiplying the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aggregate amount payable annually by the annuity factor described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(A) of this section; and the product so  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtained is then multiplied by the adjustment factor in Table J  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in &sect;20.2031&hyph;7(d)(6) of this chapter at the appropriate interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate component for payments made at the beginning of specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> periods. If an annuity is payable at the beginning of annual,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> semiannual, quarterly, monthly, or weekly periods for one or more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lives, the value of the annuity is the sum of the first payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plus the present value of a similar annuity, the first payment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which is not to be made until the end of the payment period,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined as provided in paragraph (d)(2)(iv)(B) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

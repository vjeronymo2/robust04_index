			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs told of agency 'fault' THE Welsh Development Agency was savagely attacked in a Commons committee yesterday over redundancy payments amounting to Pounds 2.37m to former employees, reimbursement of car and petrol expenses paid to directors, a grant paid to Dr Gwyn Jones, its chairman, and a pensions payment. Mr Robert Sheldon, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said an 'astonishing tale' of evidence given to the committee indicated 'great laxity' on the part of the agency. He said: 'The evidence given has been very disconcerting. Standards shown have been well below what the committee has a right to expect. We will be presenting a very strong report.' It also emerged under questioning before the committee that the Welsh Office was unaware of changes in the scheme for redundancy payments introduced by the agency. Sir Richard Lloyd Jones, permanent secretary to the Welsh Office, told the committee: 'We were not consulted in advance of the payments being made. We would have been expected to have been told.' The agency also admitted that it had been 'conned' by Mr Neil Smith over his appointment as marketing director. Mr Smith had admitted forging and then using references and CVs to obtain pecuniary advantage and was last month jailed for two years for deception. Mr Philip Head, the agency's chief executive, said: 'We were conned about this appointment and the agency was at fault.' The strongest criticism, however, came from Mr Alan Williams (Labour, Swansea West), who questioned in particular redundancy and pensions provision for Mr Michael Price, former director of Welsh Development International, the agency's inward investment arm. A package amounting to about Pounds 220,000 to one man was 'a lot of money to buy silence,' he said. Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, yesterday announced an 11 per cent rise in local-authority capital spending to boost growth.</p>

The delegation, led by Commander Ba as its chief and Deputy  Commanders Wang Wenli and An Jiaoju as its deputy chiefs, began  its visits to armed police forces stationed in Qinghai and  Ningxia on 25 January. The members of the delegation, ignoring  fatigue, trying to overcome altitude sickness, and braving  piercing cold, made their way to offices and basic units to call  on officers and men. They also went down to squads and platoons  to inspect internal management, equipment, and warehouses and to  ask soldiers about their work, study, and daily life in detail.  The delegation fully affirmed the outstanding achievements made  by the large numbers of officers and men in maintaining social  stability, promoting the unity of various nationalities, and  revitalizing the economy. The delegation also encouraged the  officers and men to be ready to "stand at the front" in the  fight to safeguard national security and maintain social  stability, to conscientiously carry out the party's nationality  and religious policies, to cherish every tree and every blade of  grass in the places where they are stationed, to launch the  drive to support the government and cherish the people, and to  make new contributions to preserving public security and  promoting economic development in Qinghai and Ningxia in the new  year.</p>

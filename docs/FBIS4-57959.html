			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maria Yolanda Garcia from the "Union Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] Sunday, Interior Relations Minister Ramon Escovar  Salom announced that the Vagrancy Law will continue to be  enforced until a civil security law is approved. The interior  minister visited Metropolitan Police Headquarters, where he was  welcomed by Police Commander General Orlando Hernandez Villegas.  The objective of the visit was to exchange views on the  failures and successes in the struggle against increasing  criminal activity in Caracas.    Escovar Salom explained that although he opposes the way in  which the Vagrancy Law is being implemented, it is necessary to  continue enforcing the law as long as a civil security law is  not approved.    [Begin Escovar recording] As interior minister, I would like  to express my complete support for the Caracas police, as well  as my support for the governor and mayor of Caracas in their  handling of urban security issues. As you all know, up to  several weeks ago, the level of gun-related violent crimes was  down. But then these kinds of crimes soared, continued to rise,  and then began to drop off again. Most of all, I want to know  what will be done this weekend, and how it will be done, in  order to understand the shortcomings and to determine what  adjustments should be made.    I have invited the Federal District governor to a meeting to  reach an understanding on this issue. I am aware that you are  all interested in asking me about the use of firearms. I  imagine this is one of the main issues of concern, the other  being related to what is going to be done with the neighborhood  scourges -- those individuals involved in violent crimes in  Caracas and who represent a danger to the people.    As long as a new law is not approved, the Vagrancy Law will  remain in effect. Personally, I do not like the Vagrancy Law.  Nevertheless, there is no other option but to depend on this  law as long as Congress does not approve a civil security law.  Meanwhile, there will be a need to enforce the Vagrancy Law.  [end recording]    The interior minister also expressed his opposition to the  use of firearms to quell demonstrations. Escovar Salom  indicated that any officer of the Metropolitan Police or any  other police division that takes part in controlling  demonstrations must abstain from using his weapon to control  student activities.    [Begin Escovar recording, in progress] ...if there are  shortcomings in the actions of the Metropolitan Police or any  other police officers. Another issue I would like to explain is  related to the use of firearms. I cannot endorse the  indiscriminate use of firearms by police. This cannot be  tolerated in any country. In other words, the police can use  their weapons only in accordance with standard regulations.  This is why these weapons are described as service weapons. In  no way does this sanction police to use their firearms  indiscriminately against protesters. In other words, we need to  implement guidelines similar to those used in other countries  governing police actions.    On the other hand, we cannot have a police force that is  restricted, unprotected, and without room to maneuver. It is  impossible for police to conduct themselves like timid rabbits.  They must have mechanisms that allow them to exercise their  duties whenever necessary. This entails specialized training  for them in the area of respecting individual rights. We want  neither a police force that intimidates, nor one that is weak.  [end recording]    Escovar also indicated that he had information related to  the  likelihood of a food blockade in the metropolitan area, which  could result from the current strike by Coche Market workers.  He said he recently met with Caracas Mayor Aristobulo Isturiz  to discuss measures necessary to prevent difficulties or  inconveniences from affecting the population.    In addition, the interior minister indicated that measures  were also being taken to transfer those individuals suspected of  criminal activities to the El Dorado and (Igorro) Prisons in  Valencia. Both prisons are now undergoing renovations.</p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Indicators point to hesitant recovery THE longer leading index of economic indicators, which highlights turning points in the economic activity about 11 months in advance, rose from 105.9 in October to 107.6 in November. The Central Statistical Office said the change resulted from lower interest rates and higher share prices after sterling's devaluation. The shorter leading index, indicating turning points about four months in advance, rose from early last year but has flattened since July, reflecting the results of the Confederation of British Industry survey of new orders and expected changes in stocks. The decline in the coincident index, which moves in line with the business cycle, halted last spring and a rise since reflects some upturn in all components of the index except gross domestic product. The CSO said that although the coincident index has been rising, hesitation in the longer and shorter leading indicators may suggest that its rise will not be rapid in the short term.</p>

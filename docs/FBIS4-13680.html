			<p>BFN     [Text] Jordanian security authorities have reinforced  security precautions to protect Iraqi opposition figures  residing in Amman after the assassination of Shaykh Talib  al-Suhayl in Beirut.    The Jordanian Interior Ministry asked the Iraqi opposition  in  Jordan to stop its political and media activities against Iraq  and to adhere to observed regulations and laws. The Jordanian  Interior Ministry also decided not to renew the residency of any  Iraqi opposition after it expires. This is in order to limit  the activities of the Iraqi opposition and to prevent any future  tension between Jordanian authorities and the opposition if it  violates the red lines set by the Jordanian Government.    It was learned that although the Jordanian Government  allowed  a number of Iraqi opposition members to live in Amman, this does  not mean they are allowed to practice political and media  activities. This is especially true because Jordan is a  democratic country and cannot prevent any Arab citizen from  living in it as a long as he adheres to the regulations and  laws. Despite the fact that the opposition is carrying out  some simple social activities and is sending some faxes here and  there, this is not the same as allowing the Iraqi opposition to  work.</p>

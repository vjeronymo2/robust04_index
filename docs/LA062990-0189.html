			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> IT'S OFFICIAL -- BISHOP TO RETIRE  </P> <P> Veteran Denver Broncos offensive lineman Keith Bishop has formally announced  his retirement, according to Bishop's agent.  </P> <P> Bob Warren, based in Denver, said Thursday that the two-time Pro Bowler plans  to launch a career in coaching and has sent letters to the Broncos and the NFL  informing them he is ending his playing career.  </P> <P> Bishop, 33, plans to serve this fall as a graduate assistant coach at Baylor  University, his alma mater. He has been attending classes there since February.  </P> <P> The announcement marked the final development in a strange series of events  since last season.  </P> <P> After signing a five-year, $3.18-million contract in September, 1988, Bishop  began last season as the Broncos' starting left guard. Six games into the  season, he suffered back spasms and was replaced in the lineup by rookie Doug  Widell. Teammates confided that Bishop was bitter about his demotion, but  Bishop steadfastly refused to discuss the situation publicly.  </P></p>

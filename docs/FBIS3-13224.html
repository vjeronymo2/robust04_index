			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Majles met in open session yesterday chaired by  Mr. Rowhani, deputy speaker, after a one-hour delay. Mr.  Purqorbani, Mr. Kiani, Mr. Zare' and Mr. Rasulnezhad, deputies  from the cities of Kalibar, Falavarjan, Shiraz and Damavand and  Firuzkuh gave pre-agenda speeches. Then the Majles took up its  agenda, and we present the detailed proceedings below for our  esteemed readers.  <H5>  Deputy Speaker's Remarks </H5>   Dr. Hasan Rowhani, deputy speaker of the Majles, gave a  short  speech in honor of the joyous birth anniversary of the promoter  of justice in the world and the savior of all the world's  deprived and oppressed people, His Holiness the promised Mehdi  (may God hasten his joyful advent). He said: There is no doubt  that belief in Mehdi and expectation in its general sense is not  only limited to Shi'ites, but may not even be limited to  Muslims. In all those religions based on celestial truth, this  belief has always been a very important factor for hope and  action in important social affairs, and many important  liberation movements have arisen from this excellent source. He  also said: There is no doubt that the greatest problem facing  human society today is oppression and the lack of or shortage of  justice, the same thing that will bring about that holy man's  righteous government.    The deputy speaker added: In the traditions that have  reached  us from the exalted prophets and the imams (peace be upon them),  one of the greatest goals in that holy man's uprising was  justice and fairness. Unfortunately, in the course of history in  past centuries through today, humanity is still suffering from  the lack of justice and from oppression and extortion, even in  new forms. The greatest celestial gift for all oppressed people  is justice. There is no doubt that anticipation of that day has  been and is our greatest asset, and all basic movements that  have taken place in our society have always been affected by  expectation.  <H5>  Khan'ali Purqorbani, Deputy From Kalibar </H5>   The basic focus and the Muslim vice-regent's emphasis has  been attention to the vulnerable classes in society and the  nation's deprived areas.    The first pre-agenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles  session was Purqorbani, deputy from Kalibar. He offered  congratulations and felicitations on the birth anniversary of  His Holiness Mehdi (may God hasten his joyful advent) and on the  15th anniversary of the triumph of the Islamic revolution. He  discussed the fact that we are seeing the appearance and  manifestation of Islamic movements and uprisings all over the  world. During his talk he said: Based on Article 84 of the  Constitution, you deputies have sworn before God and the nation  that you are representatives of the entire nation and are  responsible to the nation of Iran. Since you have been informed  of the exalted leader's views concerning the Five-Year Plan and  you know that the basic focus and main emphasis in the words of  the vice-regent of the Muslims is securing social justice and  attention to the vulnerable class of society and the nation's  deprived areas, it is therefore just, before thinking about  districts and provinces and working to insert budget rows and  obtain credits for projects in your electoral districts, to  consider God and earnestly avoid price increases, which have  cast a shadow like a terrifying nightmare over the lives of the  deprived and society's vulnerable classes, because the nation  can never be summarized in the framework of a few cities or  provinces.    Continuing, he said: Although we are fully aware of the  investments in all economic, cultural, development, defense, and  welfare sectors in the framework of the First Five-Year Plan and  in this regard outstanding successes have truly been gained by  the people and the nation of Iran, we can never forget the great  sector of people and regions in the rural areas and in the  nation's border territories.    The speaker also said: Of course, we have the confident hope  that you respected deputies, with your God-pleasing work and  your conscience as deputies, will fill these gaps of deprivation  here and there in the budget and that in this regard my own  electoral district will not be forgotten. The municipality of  Kalibar is suffering increasing deprivation. It does not have  even one prosperous area. Unfortunately, in the First Five-Year  Plan it has not tasted prosperity. With a rural and urban  population of 140,000, it does not have a single asphalt  connective road or a single emergency hospital bed. Even the  center of the municipality lacks potable water. Just as our  forefathers left this world waiting for promises to be  fulfilled, we also wait.    He then discussed rural emigration, the abandonment of rural  areas for prosperous cities and working in false jobs.  Continuing, he asked the deputies and the respected government  for help and called for special attention to the following:  Expedited establishment and construction of the 96-bed Kalibar  hospital, expedited road construction for Urdeh and Kalibar,  water service for the municipality of Kalibar and its affiliated  villages, commencement of work on the Khoda Afarin dam, the  allocation of sufficient credit, and comprehensive support from  the president of the republic's deprived areas office, which is  the only supporter of the deprived areas.    In conclusion, Purqorbani praised and thanked the minister  of  the reconstruction crusade, the governor-general of East  Azarbaijan and other area officials for their attention to this  deprived area.  <H5>  Hoseyn Kiani, Deputy From Falavarjan </H5>   We Majles deputies must not allow something to become  expensive at our hands.    The next speaker was Kiani, deputy from Falavarjan. He  offered congratulations and felicitations on the arrival of 15  Sha'ban [28 January] and the birth anniversary of the only  savior of the world of humanity His Holiness the vice-regent and  Imam of the age (may God hasten his joyful advent). He said:  Throughout the implementation of the reconstruction, economic  adjustment, social justice, unification of the foreign exchange  rate and major investments for self-sufficiency, there were also  shortcomings and mistakes, and it can be said that these are the  cause of most of our current problems. We must not ignore this.  Insufficient work, wasteful spending, disorganization, abuses,  especially in contracts and domestic and foreign purchases, with  direct selections and sales sometimes replacing competitive  bidding, have caused delays in all projects, at rates several  times higher than designated international prices.    Therefore, what should be done about market stagnation, high  prices, inflation, bankruptcy, poverty, homeless, unemployment,  false employment, illicit incomes, usury, swindling, corruption,  theft, addiction, pessimism about officials, disgust with the  revolution and the government, suicide, family quarrels,  increased divorce, murder and crowded prisons?    Continuing, the speaker said: The Glorious Koran was  revealed  over a period of 23 years and its commands were gradually  explained to the people. There is no reason for social justice  and the government's programs to be implemented under pressure  over a period of eight years, creating problems for the  government itself, the people and the revolution.    He also said: The president of the republic said: "I would  like to do all the work during my presidency so the next  president of the republic will have nothing to do." Dear brother  Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani, I say that if others endure this  pressure and hardship, that is better than having all the people  anxious and unhappy, with all this nation's work being done in  the short period of eight years. It is better if we do some of  it in later years, so we do not make the people so unhappy,  anxious, and under pressure to survive. Kiani then said to the  Majles deputies: Last year it was approved in this very Majles  that the government would not make any thing expensive in the  year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994], and we saw that in  violation of the law everything became expensive. Our people are  truly suffering. We cannot tell that poor old man, the worker,  the staff employee or the crippled and disabled old woman why a  small amount of electrical power costs them 27,000 tomans,  15,000 tomans, and 30,000 tomans, or why other services are  rendered to the people at high prices.    Continuing, Kiani added: Dear brothers, last year we voted  that prices should not be high, and they made them high. Woe be  unto us this year if the Majles votes for high prices. I hope  the brothers and sisters will note carefully that the government  has now sent Note 25 to the Majles in order to be able to solve  its own problems in this way. We must not do anything to cause  all the discomfort and anxiety to be blamed on the Majles.    Continuing his speech, he asked the deputies all to vote to  eliminate Note 25.    In conclusion he said: We must not allow the Majles to make  anything expensive. Even if we do this, like it or not, the  government will raise prices, but it will not be done by the  Majles.  <H5>  Karim Zare', Deputy From Shiraz </H5>   Human beings armed with the weapon of science and technology  are the main agents in support of development.    The third pre-agenda speaker was Zare', deputy from Shiraz.  He offered congratulations and felicitations on the esteemed  birth anniversary of His Holiness the Imam of the Age (peace be  upon him). During his speech he condemned the crimes of the  aggressor Serbs and he called upon all free people to criticize  the United Nations and to awaken sleeping consciences for the  defense of the oppressed Muslims of Bosnia and Hercegovina. He  called on the Indian Government to end its oppression and  aggression in Kashmir.    Continuing, he then added: Human beings armed with the  weapon  of science and technology are the main agents in support of  development.    The speaker then asked that we find a way of continued  education for all those who want to be equipped with the weapon  of knowledge, education and technology, and who want to  participate in the world of the 21st century, which is the  century of the movement of minds.    Continuing, he said: Today we see about 1.2 million people  lining up for higher education. The first step is to reform  higher education, meaning to expand the journeyman programs,  which I have discussed previously in a project that received  abundant approval from the deputies. In view of the limitations  in the government budget for the expansion of higher education  at this time and in view of the existing realities and  shortages, provisions have been made for meeting the expenses of  applicants to government and nongovernment institutions of  higher education. Fortunately this motion is aimed at completing  the motion approved by the Supreme Cultural Revolutionary  Council and solving its main problem, which is securing a budget.    Continuing, Zare' said: Another issue is the necessity to  expand the expert guidance and doctoral programs, as well as the  post-doctoral or post-specialist programs at the universities,  or research centers must be established that have high academic  ability and potential resources.    He discussed the fact that the doctoral and post-doctoral  programs cannot only make young researchers more practiced and  experienced, but they can also procure employable research  manpower for basic and applied research.    Continuing his talk, Mr. Zare' issued the following memo  concerning the problems in his electoral district: I ask all  members of the society of deputies, Friday imams and governors  to show more concern for the cultural, sports, development and  civil backwardness in the province of Fars.    He thanked the government for expediting the Shiraz-Esfahan  railroad and for studying the Shiraz-Bushehr railroad, and he  asked that measures be taken to deal with the deprivation in his  electoral district. He also asked the minister of roads and  transportation for help building the Shiraz-Esfahan freeway.    He also called for the encouragement of cities, villages and  bridges that make the production of strategic goods their first  priority. He thanked the respected president of the Supreme  Cultural Revolution Council and its members for confirming the  part-time teaching system at the Free Islamic University. At the  end of his speech he also asked the minister of culture and  higher education and the minister of health care, treatment and  medical education to give more spiritual support to  nongovernment and nonprofit universities.  <H5>  Seyyed Ahmad Rasulinezhad, Deputy From Damavand And Firuzkuh </H5>   The reason some of the things we say are not heard and the  people do not accept and believe them is that they do not see  anything in practice.    The final pre-agenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles  session was Rasulinezhad, deputy from Damavand and Firuzkuh. He  discussed the dangers of influence by foreigners and agents who  have sold out through those dependent on personalities and  officials. He said: The enemies of the Islamic revolution, who  have given up gaining influence with top officials and  government officials, are trying, with the help of their agents,  to find their way into the gentlemen's homes.    Our late Imam said: "Keep watch over your homes." This  remark  was not addressed just to one person. This was addressed to  everyone, to us deputies, to the executive power, to the  judiciary and in two words, to the army and the nation.    He added: The question is, with whom do our children, those  close to us and our relatives spend their time, where do they go  and for what? Who plans the domestic and foreign trips, and who  goes with them? It is very important to know who the consultants  are and with whom they consult. How often in the future someone  will commit a crime, make a mistake and commit an abuse, but due  to his friends and colleagues and sometimes because he is  presented as an insider, he will be freed from the clutches of  justice and the trial.    He also discussed the tendency towards ostentation. He said:  Among the dangers of the tendency towards ostentation is taking  fancy and leisurely trips with people who live in comfort, are  without religion and do not live simply. While some people are  living in poverty and indigence, we are seeking to create a  fancy and comfortable life. We know that those who have  professed faith in the mission of the Prophet of God and who  have become Muslims did so through the work of the Prophet of  Islam. What they heard from him they also saw in his work and  behavior. The reason some of the things we say are not heard and  the people do not accept and believe them is that they do not  see anything in practice. The fact that the remarks by the  leader go so deeply into the public soul is because of the work  and behavior of the vice-regent of the Muslims. Let us learn  simple living from the exalted leader of the revolution and  apply it.    In conclusion he said: We are in full agreement with sports  facilities for women provided that religious law is fully  observed. It is necessary in trips by women's teams and in  planning athletic competition for women that religious criteria  be carefully observed so that the problems surrounding women's  sporting events last year in the Islamic nations will not be  repeated.    I remind some of the newspapers to reconsider their  unacceptable policies and dealings. Although during the Fourth  Majles there have been several questions from the Majles and the  relevant ministers, it is surprising and regrettable that one or  two newspapers insulted in various ways the minister of the  interior, this tormented figure who was imprisoned under the  Pahlavi regime, on the pretext of a question that was asked by  one of the deputies.    He also asked for help from the nation's banking system for  the Ministry of Cooperatives.  <H5>  Legislation </H5> <H3>  Bill Amending the Law on Procedures for Giving Medical  Examinations to Those Subject to Obligatory Public Service </H3>   The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles  session was the report on the first consultation of the Councils  Commission on the Bill Amending the Law on Procedures for Giving  Medical Examinations to Those Subject to Obligatory Public  Service, enacted in the year 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990],  the general form of which was approved by the Majles.    In discussing this bill, the expert from the Councils  Commission said: In Note 2, for those covered who are in need of  diagnostic examinations, the expected cost must first be  deposited in the government's account. In this note also, those  in need who are covered by the Imam's aid committee are exempt.  In the bill the government presented, individuals who are  covered by the Health Care Organization and do not have the  financial resources are also exempt. This bill was also approved  by the Councils Commission. The approval of this bill is a gift  to these dear ones as Oppressed Persons Week is about to begin  (the birth anniversary of His Holiness Mehdi [may God hasten his  joyful advent]).  <H3>  Motion To Amend Article 8 of the Law on Independence of  Attorney's Society </H3>   The second item on the agenda was the report from the first  consultation of the Councils Commission concerning the Motion To  Amend Article 8 of the Law on the Independence of the Judicial  Attorney's Society, approved 9/5/1333 [26 November 1954], the  general form of which was approved in the first consultation.    The Judicial Affairs Commission expert discussed this  motion.  He said: A requirement for doing judicial work in the judiciary  is the existence of people who are strong and insightful in  judicial affairs, are able to be aware of these legal  formalities and can prosecute a claim along the legal path.  Therefore the Attorney's Society took shape under the Law on the  Independence of the Judicial Attorney's Society so that official  attorneys would be used and it designated qualifications for  those who must work as official judicial attorneys.    One of these qualifications is having a judicial law license  from a reputable domestic or foreign university and also  undergoing a one-year apprenticeship. Such a person can work as  a first-class attorney.    In amending this law, they established privileges for a  series of individuals who could not undergo the apprenticeship.  One such person is the judicial judge, whether he has a law  license or not. What is under discussion right now is in  Paragraph 2 of this article, where deputies in the national  Majles and the now dissolved senate who worked on the Judicial  Affairs Commission and had the legal qualifications or had  studied in the universities were allowed to obtain licenses to  work as judicial attorneys after completing their Majles terms.    The proposal is that those who work on the Majles Judicial  Affairs Commission and have a law license, qualifications in  legal affairs or have studied in colleges and have been a member  of the commission for four years be exempt from the one-year  apprenticeship.  <H5>  Motion To Prevent Air Pollution </H5>   The final item on the agenda was the report from the first  consultation of the Agriculture Commission concerning the Motion  To Prevent Air Pollution, the general form of which was approved  by the deputies.    It is worth mentioning that as of Saturday of next week, the  1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] Budget Bill will be studied  by the deputies in three shifts. Under the new Majles Internal  Guidelines, first the general form and the question of revenues  will be presented, and then in the second consultation the  details will be studied.  <H5>  Majles Notes </H5> <H5>  Yesterday's Majles Ethics Lesson </H5>   A praiseworthy measure in the Fourth Majles is the holding  of  ethics lessons for the deputies. Yesterday Ayatollah Hoseyn  Nuri-Hamadani, a professor at Qom seminary, gave a talk and an  interpretation of human responsibilities and the role of worship.    Ayatollah Nuri discussed worship and its varieties in Islam.  He said one of the great forms of worship is alleviating  financial needs and solving the problems of the people. He also  said: The prophet said that whoever takes steps to meet the  needs of a Muslim is like someone who spends his entire life  worshipping God.    He advised the deputies to solve the problems of the people,  and he invited them to observe piety, order in their work and  life, praying all night and doing the evening prayer.    Continuing, Ayatollah Nuri enumerated the types of worship  and said worship is the best way to get help from the  magnificent Almighty. Continuing, he noted: The best worship is  to reflect on theology and then to guide humanity, and after  that comes meeting the needs and requirements of Muslims.    The professor from Qom Seminary said the evening prayer is  the best way to come close to God. He mentioned obtaining energy  from daily tasks, and for that he mentioned 20 beneficial things  and needs of Muslims.    Continuing, he said: One must obtain help through worship in  order to serve the people and put oneself on the path of  humanity. The human being must obtain help from a great power in  order to be able to carry out his responsibility. The Koran says  this power and source is seeking help through patience and  prayer. A human being must get energy from worship in order to  be able to serve.</p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: Patent settlement lifts Honeywell HONEYWELL, the US controls group, reported a sharp rise in first-quarter income, lifted by a payment of Dollars 127.5m from Minolta, the Japanese camera manufacturer, to settle a patent infringement dispute. Net income for the quarter rose to Dollars 116.8m, or Dollars 1.67 per share, from Dollars 71.8m, or Dollars 1.01, in the same period last year. Worldwide sales revenues rose to Dollars 1.48bn from Dollars 1.47bn. 'In the first quarter, we produced solid earnings in the midst of a languid economy,' said Mr James J. Renier, chairman and chief executive officer. The gain from the Minolta settlement was Dollars 108.3m after deducting expenses associated with the legal dispute. Honeywell took a Dollars 32.1m pre-tax charge for costs associated with 'productivity improvement programmes and the anticipated disposition of certain non-strategic product lines'. The company said this would include a unspecified number of job cuts. 'On a comparable basis, Honeywell earned Dollars 1.02 per share in the first quarter of 1992, which is consistent with our expectations,' Mr Renier said.</p>

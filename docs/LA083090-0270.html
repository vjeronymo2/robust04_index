			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> VARIETY OF EVENTS HIGHLIGHT LATINO ARTS  </P> <P> More than 300 Latino artists will be featured in the Sept. 1-16 Los Angeles  Festival in programs that include retrospectives of Mexican filmmakers Arturo  Ripstein and Jaime Hermosillo, performances by the noted Chilean theater group  El Gran Circo Teatro and a major exhibition of 130 Chicano art works.  </P> <P> Although even L.A. Festival organizers admit that the Pacific-themed festival  could not adequately represent all the Latino artistic activity going on in Los  Angeles as well as all the Latin American countries bordering the Pacific, Los  Angeles' cultural affairs chief praised the festival's Latino representation.  </P> <P> "My general opinion is that they've done a pretty good job of trying to  seriously address Latino artists from here in the city as well as from Latin  America and other (Spanish-speaking) countries," said Adolfo Nodal, general  manager of the city's Cultural Affairs Department.  </P> <P> The festival's general manager, Michael Vargas, said: "The festival programs  certainly serve a broad spectrum of the Latino public as well as the non-Latino  public that is interested in Latino programming. . . . (But) we can only  incorporate a small part of what's happening in L.A., because we're bringing  everything together into a two-week period. But we've developed as much Latino  programming and incorporated as many of the (Latino) institutions as we  possibly could have."  </P> <P> As with much of its non-Latino programming, the festival is simply  incorporating several already-planned Latino arts events under its banner.  Examples include "Chicano Art: Resistance and Affirmation, 1965-1985," a  mammoth exhibition of 130 works by 90 artists from across the United States at  UCLA's Wight Art Gallery and performances at various locations by several local  musical groups.  </P> <P> But, Vargas stressed, much of the programming will be new to Los Angeles'  Latino audiences.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's just the usual suspects at all," Vargas said. "Some of them  might be, like the bandas and mariachi groups that perform here all the time,  but we've got people like Daniel Martinez and Diane Gamboa and Harry Gamboa  that are all pretty well known in Los Angeles but are doing something new that  they haven't been able to do before -- a collaborative theater piece."  </P> <P> The piece Vargas was referring to is Martinez's "Ignore the Dents," an "urban  opera of social gridlock" being written by Harry Gamboa, with costumes by his  sister Diane and lighting by designer Aubrey Wilson.  </P> <P> The collaborative piece will be performed Sept. 7-8 at Broadway's Million  Dollar Theatre.  </P> <P> Also commissioned specifically for the festival is San Diego/Tijuana border  artist Guillermo Gomez-Pena's multilingual performance solo "1990." The piece,  part of his trilogy in progress, "1992," deals with the journey north into  California of a Mexican performance artist who is a cross between a mariachi  and a rock musician. It will be performed Sept. 12-16 at the Museum of  Contemporary Art.  </P> <P> One of the festival's theatrical centerpieces, Chile's El Gran Circo Teatro,  will perform two works in Spanish at the Santa Monica Pier. "La Negra Ester,"  to be performed Sept. 12-14, is a comic musical spectacle recounting the  turbulent passion of a poet for a prostitute at the brothel where he sings for  a living. And "Gran Circo Teatro de Chile Presenta al Gran Circo Teatro de  Chile," scheduled for Sept. 15-16, tackles the last 20 troubling years of  Chilean history.  </P> <P> Also included in the festival's Latino programming, Vargas noted, is the Sept.  8-11 "La Terra Nova 1990: Pacific Poetry Festival" to be held in Eagle Rock at  Occidental College's Keck Auditorium. A number of prominent Latin American  poets will participate in the bilingual program with California poets reading  the translations.  </P> <P> "The poetry program is special; these poets have not been here before," Vargas  said. "These kinds of things usually aren't included in a festival format, so  that's been something new for us to tackle.  </P> <P> "Also," Vargas continued, "the Hispanic films -- the Hermosillo films and the  Ripstein films -- these are major filmmakers, and although they have been shown  in this country before, they have not had major exposure in the United States.  So this is a chance to expose Spanish-speaking people in L.A. to these  filmmakers that they probably have heard of before, but have not seen."  </P> <P> A controversial mural, one that has been shown only in sections since its  creation in 1981, is scheduled to be unveiled Sept. 2 in its entirety at Union  Station. The 16-foot by 80-foot mural by local artist Barbara Carrasco is  titled "L.A. History -- A Mexican Perspective."  </P> <P> Other visual arts programs include the Municipal Art Gallery's 'Aqui y Alla,"  which will feature contemporary works by artists from Los Angeles and Mexico  City; Mixografia gallery's "Contemporary Mexican Masters," and Loyola  Marymount's Laband Art Gallery's "Image and Identity: Recent Chicana Art from  La Reina del Pueblo de Los Angeles de la Porciuncula," with works by Carrasco,  Laura Aguilar, Diane Gamboa, Margaret Garcia and Dolores Guerrero-Cruz.  </P></p>

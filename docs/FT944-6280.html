			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Tax): Faint praise from professionals - City reaction Boring, predictable, gratifyingly unexciting - a Budget with less immediate impact than any other in recent memory. These were some of the reactions to the Budget from insurance companies, accountancy firms, banks, building societies and institutional investors yesterday. Insurers regarded the Budget as broadly neutral. But there was relief that Mr Clarke decided against any increase in the new Insurance Premium Tax which came into effect in October. 'Anything at all which means premiums don't have to go up is a good thing,' said the Association of British Insurers. Competition in the sector means prices for many insurance products are falling, and insurers would have been under pressure to absorb rises in IPT above the current 2.5 per cent on gross premiums. The association also said the encouragement the chancellor had offered for home-owners to buy mortgage protection insurance would offer opportunities for insurance companies. Royal Insurance, one of the UK's largest composite insurers, described the budget as 'part strategic, part pragmatic'. It said the decision on IPT was 'not unexpected' given that the tax had only recently been introduced. It still expects the Treasury to increase the amount it raises from the tax over the longer term. Essentially good economically but disappointing on taxation, was the reaction of Mr Ian Barlow, head of tax at KPMG Peat Marwick. 'The Budget confirmed that we are taking a sound approach and that is great stuff. But in terms of tax the approach is very timid. Apart from being very good on savings, on Peps and so on, it was also good on Venture Capital Trusts which looks very attractive,' he said. But Mr Barlow said he was 'very disappointed at the weasel words on merging National Insurance and PAYE. I suspect that he has been fobbed off by his officials.' The Chancellor also appeared 'to have a penchant for new taxes and we saw a new one with landfill,' he added. Mr Andrew Jones, a tax partner at Ernst and Young, said the Budget was 'a lot of talk for not very much change. Lets wait and see what the next 12 months brings. I have been watching budgets for 27 years and I can't remember one with so little immediate impact.' Mr Clive Standford, of Touche Ross, said:'Most of the changes appear to be on the small business side - concentrating on attempts at deregulation and simplification and help for cashflow which we can see in several areas. But for big business there is not much at all. Mr Standford said that several moves would make money more available for small businesses: 'But it is tinkering at the edges.' 'No surprises,' was the instant conclusion of institutional shareholders. 'Boring, boring, boring,' was the reaction of a leading life insurance investor. Overall, they said it will make little impact on the way they allocate assets both between different classes and geographically. However, investors said the tone of the Budget, with its lower than expected forecast of the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement, is encouraging, particularly for future investment in gilts. 'It makes us a little more confident in the gilts market,' said Mr Paul Manduca, chief executive of Threadneedle Asset Management, the investment management division of BAT industries, noting that the fund has already been increasing its gilts purchases. Mr Brian Davis, chief executive of Nationwide Building Society, the UK's second largest, said that in general the Budget was tinkering at the edges in terms of the continued delivery of economic growth. 'Mr Clarke obviously believes the continuing growth is sustainable, I hope he's right,' he said. He added, however, that if the government were really confident more people would be in employment, then it would not have needed to cut some benefit entitlements. 'He seems to have hedged his bets.' Mr Alan Davies, chief economist of Barclays Bank, said: 'There is absolutely nothing there that wasn't predictable. Perhaps that is how things should be. The Budget was gratifyingly unexciting. What I want to see is a budget that is boring in the sense of being an exercise in book-keeping.' Reporting by Ralph Atkins, Jim Kelly, Alison Smith, Norma Cohen and Nicholas Denton</p>

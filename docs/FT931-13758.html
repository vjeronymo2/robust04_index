			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: Fertiliser groups in Dollars 80m joint venture THE Illinois-based IMC Fertilizer Group and Freeport-McMoRan Resource Partners have announced a plan to merge their phosphate fertiliser, phosphate rock and uranium businesses in a venture expected to provide about Dollars 80m in cost savings to the companies. The venture, which is subject to US regulatory approval, would be governed by a committee and operated by IMC Fertilizer. Freeport-McMoRan is the majority shareholder in Freeport-McMoRan Resource Partners. The deal will divide cost savings evenly, but split profits according to respective inputs. The combination is expected to provide savings at all levels of production, from mining to marketing. Mr Donald Pattison, analyst with C. J. Lawrence, said he expects the joint venture to consolidate phosphate rock mining operations in Florida, and close one of two deep water export terminals the companies operate on the Gulf coast of Florida. The new venture would represent about 30 per cent of US market share, and be among the largest such operations in the world. 'One way of looking at it is the joint venture will have about one-half the amount of Russia's production,' Mr Pattison said. IMC has 23m tons of phosphate rock capacity per year, while Freeport's is closer to 8.5m tons. An IMC spokesman estimated annual sales for the venture at Dollars 1bn. World prices for phosphate fertiliser have fallen to their lowest in 17 years, partly because Russia has been aggressively marketing its phosphate resources as China and India have weakened their central purchasing of fertiliser. The venture will not include IMC Fertilizer's potash, Rainbow, sulphur and oil and natural gas operations. Freeport-McMoRan Resource will retain its sulphur and oil and natural gas operations and its geothermal interests.</p>

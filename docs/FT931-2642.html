			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: FMT ends search for European partner via link with Rambaudi FMT, the Brighton-based machine tool producer which was bought out from Vickers in 1988, yesterday announced a co-operation deal with Rambaudi, a Turin-based machine tool builder. The deal, unveiled in London by Mr Mike Bright, chairman of FMT, and Mr Bruno Rambaudi, chairman and president of Rambaudi, ends a long search by FMT for a European co-operation partner. FMT is one of the few surviving British-owned machine tool builders competing head-on technologically with the Japanese producers in flexible manufacturing systems. For both companies the agreement represents a response to Japanese competition. The deal brings together two companies with a complementary product range. They will market each other's products in their home countries, and work together on joint projects in third markets where the best technology of both partners can be combined in a turnkey package. FMT's product portfolio will be strengthened with Rambaudi's range of vertical spindle machines, while the Brighton company's horizontal spindle machines will be available to Rambaudi for the Italian market. Both companies have seen sales and employment fall sharply over the past two years because of recession. FMT's turnover has fallen from Pounds 22m in 1989-90 to a projected Pounds 11m this year, while Rambaudi's has fallen from L70bn to L50bn (Pounds 22.8m). However, Mr Bright said recession was not the driving force behind the merger. By working together, the two companies would find it much easier to win European Community funding for research and development. The two companies are considering whether to work together on projects such as high-speed milling and machining. Closer financial ties have not been ruled out, although Mr Rambaudi said the initial priority was to ensure that what has been decided is working successfully.</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Preview of the Results Season: Cash flow statements should be of help in diagnosing the health of a company ONE USEFUL new feature of many companies' accounts this reporting season will be a cash flow statement designed to shed light on their financial strength. The old source and application of funds statement, introduced in 1975, was often criticised for its obscurity. The complexity of the new cash flow statement has already caused analysts to scratch their heads. It is certainly not a statement for the amateur investor. Some companies - including Hanson, Bass and Carlton Communications - have already produced the statement, introduced by the new Accounting Standards Board as its first financial reporting standard last year. It becomes compulsory for all medium and large companies with year ends after March 23 1992. The majority of the information that the cash flow statement contains could be gleaned from the old source and application statement and notes to the accounts - for those with a calculator and incredible persistence. The new statement makes some figures much easier to obtain, and reveals others which were not always provided in the past. It will also make far easier comparisons between companies, and with those in the US, which use a similar cash flow format. Overall, the statement shows the patterns of cash generation and consumption. It indicates how tax, dividends and new investment are paid for  -from operations or through new capital raised. Through a note to the accounts, it also reveals figures - which are not reconciled in the statement - under the heading 'analysis of changes in financing during the period', which show any debt acquired from acquisitions, and the effect of foreign currency translations. One example of the new format comes from the most recent annual report of Wm Low, the Scottish supermarket group which issued a profits warning last week. It would be difficult to have predicted its current problems from the cash flow statement, but it does give insights into last year's operations. For the year to September 7 1991 the company had a net cash inflow from operating activities (shown under this heading in the accompanying illustrated statement) of Pounds 27.8m. Note 24 to the accounts breaks the figure down further, showing that operating profit (as shown on the profit and loss account) was Pounds 22.3m. The note shows net changes in stocks, debtors and creditors - the working capital of the business - are just Pounds 48,000. The small proportion of working capital to operating profit is typical of a cash-generative business like a retailer. The note also shows a contribution from provisions of Pounds 374,000. These were made in the previous year for reorganisation and have been written back, boosting operating profit beyond the figure derived from normal activities - a number to watch to see the underlying profit of the business. Wm Low had returns on investments and servicing of finance consuming net cash of Pounds 7.1m, in which dividend and interest payments of Pounds 9m easily offset interest received of Pounds 2.1m. The interest received has increased sharply from Pounds 215,000 in 1990. But the profit and loss account shows interest payments of only Pounds 556,000 for 1991. The difference is explained by a large increase in the amount of interest which has been capitalised. Adding the taxation charges of Pounds 8.9m shown on the cash flow statement to the returns on investments and servicing and the inflows from operating activities, Wm Low had net 'revenue' cash inflows totalling Pounds 11.8m. Companies with net revenue cash outflows are not necessarily unhealthy. They may be investing heavily with the expectation of increases in sales the following year, for example. But the figure does give some indication of how and whether a business is able to service its outgoings. Adding back the dividend payments and dividing the sum by the number of shares would give a revenue cash inflow per share, which could be usefully compared with earnings per share. Other simple ratios show how far dividends or interest payable are covered by cash. Under investing activities, Wm Low spent Pounds 41.2m buying tangible fixed assets. This represents its ambitious and continuing programme of expansion of supermarkets during the year. This expansion programme has more than consumed the cash generated from a rights issue in December 1990, which is shown under the financing section. The issue of new shares raised Pounds 38.5m, although the expenses paid to generate the money cost just over Pounds 1m. Given a recent statement by the chairman that he intends to continue expanding space with further large expenditures in the future, Wm Low will clearly needs to turn to new sources of cash soon. Analysis of the cash flow statement is certainly still not simple. Mr Clive Goodhead, project director for the cash flow statement at the Accounting Standards Board, frowns on the demand from users of accounts for a single key number or ratio which can provide all the answers on the health of a company. 'To get sensible information you have to spend a lot of time looking at accounts,' he says.</p>

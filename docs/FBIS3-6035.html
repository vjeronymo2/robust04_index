			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 14 KYODO -- Former Construction  Minister Kishiro Nakamura, under arrest for alleged bribery,  tried to strike a deal with the fair trade watchdog to have it  drop a plan to file a motion against contractors in return for  his support on its planned hike in bid-rigging penalties,  informed sources said Monday [14 March].    Nakamura, then deputy chairman of the Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP) panel on antimonopoly laws, opposed a plan by the  Fair Trade Commission (FTC) in December 1991 to raise the  maximum penalty on violators to several hundreds of million yen  from 5 million yen.    In the Structural Impediments Initiative talks with the  United States, Japan was urged to raise penalties against  corporations which violate the antimonopoly law.    In February 1992, however, Nakamura reversed his initial  reluctance to support the hike after he allegedly received a 10  million yen bribe from leading contractor Kajima Corp. in  January and moved to persuade colleagues in the LDP construction  lobby to give in to the FTC plan, the sources said.    Prosecutors arrested Nakamura Friday for allegedly accepting  the 10 million yen bribe. He quit the LDP last Wednesday.    The money was apparently intended as a reward for using his  influence to help prevent the FTC from filing an accusation  against a 66-member cartel, including Kajima, for its  bid-rigging practices on public works projects in Saitama  Prefecture.    He met twice with then FTC Chairman Setsuo Umezawa and  pressured him not to file an accusation against the companies,  sources said.    The FTC submitted a revised plan on the antimonopoly law to  raise the maximum penalty to 100 million yen in March of that  year.    It announced two months later that it would not file an  accusation with prosecutors against the cartel.    FTC Chairman Masami Kogayu said Friday the commission was  never influenced by outside forces on decisions involving cases  impinging the Fair Trade Law.</p>

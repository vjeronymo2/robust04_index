			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME RENOVATION  </P> <P> I thoroughly enjoyed the piece on home renovation, "Off the Tract," by Barbara  Thornburg. I am saving the article as an inspiration and example of my dream  home. I was especially taken with the cutouts and curved walls used throughout  the house.  </P> <P> BARBARA HAMANE  </P> <P> San Gabriel  </P></p>

			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Russian budget given go-ahead The Russian budget for 1994 passed both houses of parliament yesterday - with leading members of parliament openly derisive of its feasibility and government officials admitting revenue was dropping and would drop further. Deputies in both houses appear to have agreed to pass the budget to give the government a legislative base for spending - and to avoid being bogged down in exhaustive debates on the 500 amendments proposed. Mr Nikolai Gonchar, chairman of the budget committee in the upper house, said the budget's targets could not be met but some budget was better than none. Mr Yegor Gaidar, leader of the main liberal party, Russia's Choice, told the Interfax news agency that the spending and revenue estimates were 'totally unrealistic' - though his faction voted it through. Mr Sergei Aleksashenko, deputy finance minister, said tax revenue was more than Rbs8,000bn (Pounds 2.8bn) down in the first part of the year and would drop further in the second - though other estimates put the shortfall much higher. Military expenditure, the focus of the biggest struggle for increases, has been set at Rbs40,000bn - up by Rbs2,500bn from the original figure but well below the Rbs55,000bn the military say is essential to maintain basic effectiveness. Figures produced by the government show that the Rbs40,000bn would include Rbs22,100bn for basic military financing, Rbs8,500bn for arms purchases, Rbs4,800bn for capital construction, Rbs2,500bn for scientific research and testing, and Rbs1,900bn for pensions. Anti-corruption crusader Alexander Lukashenko scored an upset victory over the prime minister in the first round of presidential elections in Belarus, sending shock waves through the former Soviet republic, Reuter reports from Minsk. Unofficial returns gave 45.1 per cent of Thursday's vote to Mr Lukashenko, who drew big crowds with speeches pledging to drive bribe-takers from office. Fifty per cent was needed for first-round victory. Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, who focused his campaign on a monetary union with Russia, was in second place with 17.4 per cent. The two leaders face a run-off poll in two weeks.</p>

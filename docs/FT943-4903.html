			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Unions defeat Finnish move Finland's centre-right government has averted a threatened large-scale strike by withdrawing budget proposals for 1995 that angered the trade unions. The coalition, facing parliamentary elections next March, decided not to propose a reduction in jobless benefits and the ending of tax deductibility of union dues. Announcing the changes only a few hours before the draft budget was given to parliament, Mr Esko Aho, prime minister, said the proposals - which would have raised about FM550m (Pounds 70.5m) - would be replaced by other measures and that the budget deficit would not grow. Following the government's move, the executive of the 1.1m-member Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions said it would recommend that the strike threat be withdrawn.</p>

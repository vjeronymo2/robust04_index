The visitors will be headed by Jean Pierre Desgeorges, vice  president of the French National Sponsorship Council [Consejo  Nacional de Patronato Frances] (CNPF), which is a collective  that includes 225 organizations in the industrial, financial,  and services sectors.    Cuban business sources consider this first CNPF visit as  very  important, because the collective represents approximately 1  million French businessmen, including chiefs of state,  ministers, and private and public leaders, and has 43 committees  in several countries that operate under the management of  important world business personalities.    At the meeting, which will continue until 10 February, the  32  members of the visiting delegation will hold talks and meet with  Cuban executives who work in various economic sectors, such as  construction material, tourism, transportation, electricity, and  banks, among others.    Likewise, it is expected the French delegation will meet  with  top Cuban officials, including Carlos Lage, vice president of  the Council of State; Osmany Cienfuegos, vice president of the  Council of Ministers; and Roberto Robaina, the Cuban foreign  minister.</p>

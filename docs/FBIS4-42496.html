			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Alison Cameron, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>   [Text] U.S. President Bill Clinton arrived in a wet and  windy Britain today as he continued his D-Day trip to Europe.  The President and First Lady were met by John Major and his wife  Norma after landing at RAF [Royal Air Force base] Mildenhall,  Suffolk. Mr Clinton will attend a remembrance service at the  American Military Cemetery in Madingley, near Cambridge, later  today.    During his stay in Britain -- his first since he became  President -- Mr Clinton will have talks with the Prime Minister  at Chequers and also meet acting Labour leader Margaret Beckett  at Hartwell House, near Aylesbury, Bucks. Tonight Mr Clinton  and his wife Hillary will attend a State dinner in Portsmouth as  guests of the Queen. Tomorrow they will meet U.S. D-Day  veterans and then watch an international flotilla before going  to Normandy.    Mr Clinton, the first post-war U.S. commander-in-chief  without military experience, returns from France on Wednesday [8  June] for a nostalgic visit to Oxford University where he will  receive an honorary doctorate.    He spent a year at University College as a Rhodes scholar in  the late 1960's.</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pounds 1m is not happiness for all Sir, Backing up R L Webb's letter (January 2) with regard to the proposed Pounds 1m premium bond prize, I would go further and suggest that this sum be divided into prizes of Pounds 1,000 each. Surely, like the thoughts of Micawber, Pounds 1,000 for most equals happiness and Pounds 1m for a few equal unhappiness all round. And unless Ernie takes note of public opinion I intend to draw out my not inconsiderable holding, which until recently attracted a regular prize of Pounds 50, which encouraged me to buy more.

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / International Company News: YSL suffers from sluggish market YVES Saint-Laurent, the French fashion house, suffered a sharp fall in net profits to FFr130m (Dollars 23.4m) in 1992 from FFr233m in 1991. The group was hit by the sluggish state of the global luxury goods market and a FFr40m loss on the launch of a new skin-care range. This may aggravate the political row over its FFr3.6bn acquisition earlier this year by Elf-Sanofi, a subsidiary of Elf-Aquitaine, the state-controlled oil group. YSL turnover slipped from FFr3.01bn in 1991 to FFr3.0bn, but operating profits declined dramatically to FFr379m from FFr512m over the same period. The group was also affected by the impact of the rationalisation of its licensing interests and of its perfume business, where it reduced sales to certain countries to counter the threat of the 'grey' market, or discount sector. The group hopes to improve in 1993, given that most of the problems that depressed its results in 1992 would not recur. The skin-care range should make a positive contribution, as should the new women's perfume that the group is launching later this year. YSL also expects to benefit from a reduction in financial costs, due to a debt reorganisation.</p>

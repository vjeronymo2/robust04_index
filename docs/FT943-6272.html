			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney asks watchdog to probe share price slide Euro Disney, the troubled leisure group, is to ask the Paris stock market authorities to investigate the recent fall in its shares, which yesterday were twice suspended after plunging to a record low. The group, which recently concluded negotiations with its banks for a FFr13bn (Dollars 2.4bn) financial rescue, saw its shares end the day 11.6 per cent down at FFr8.40 having plummeted to FFr7.75 during the morning. The shares were also suspended on Friday after a sharp fall. Euro Disney said that it had requested the Commission des Operations de Bourse, the Paris watchdog, to analyse why its shares had fallen so sharply, given that it had not released any new information over the past few days. Analysts attributed the decline in Euro Disney's shares to nervousness about the company's trading prospects and to concern about the implications of recent senior management changes at both Euro Disney and Walt Disney, its US parent. Mr Mike Montgomery, Euro Disney's well-regarded finance director, announced his resignation two weeks ago. His departure aggravated fears of a poor performance from Euro Disney, which is said to have had weak attendance levels this summer in spite of price-cutting and promotional initiatives. The news of Mr Montgomery's departure was followed by the surprise resignation of Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg, the high-profile head of Walt Disney's film division. The Disney parent company is still unsettled after the sudden death of Mr Frank Wells, its president, and the illness of Mr Michael Eisner, its chairman who recently underwent heart surgery. Walt Disney played a prominent role in Euro Disney's emergency restructuring. See World Stock Markets</p>

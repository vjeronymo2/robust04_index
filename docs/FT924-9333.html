			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Major puts back Maastricht ratification date: Prime minister's surprise move throws fresh doubt over process of European union BRITAIN last night threw into fresh doubt the process of European union after Mr John Major announced that final ratification of the Maastricht treaty would be delayed until after a second Danish referendum next May. The prime minister's move caused embarrassment among his own senior colleagues and bewilderment in Brussels and Denmark. Surprised Danish officials said a date for a second referendum had yet to be set. At the European Commission, senior officials said the delay amounted to 'a U-turn' on Mr Major's earlier commitment to remove uncertainty about Britain's position by ensuring speedy passage of the treaty through the Commons. If the final Commons vote does not take place until mid-May, UK ratification of the treaty could be delayed until October, since the legislation approving the agreement has also to be considered in detail in the Lords. In Brussels, officials argued that a delay until after the Danish referendum would give extra leverage to Denmark's attempt to add legally-binding amendments to the treaty. An aide to Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, said the announcement had 'come as a great surprise'. A Commission official said: 'Mr Major won the vote, so we don't understand why he's treating this as a defeat.' In London, one minister said the announcement was a 'terrible embarrassment' and meant the government had decided in effect to 'hide behind the Danish referendum'. Mr Delors arrives in London today for scheduled talks with Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, foreign minister, at which the delay will be discussed. A formal meeting between Mr Major and Mr Delors is not planned but the Commission president was due to accompany the prime minister to a football match tomorrow. Mr Major's move - a significant concession to his party's Euro-sceptics - followed the government's perilously small majority in Wednesday's Commons votes to restart the the treaty ratification process this month. Senior ministers confirmed that Mr Major had offered to link a vote on the final stage of the British legislation with Danish ratification in a last-minute attempt to win the support of potential Tory rebels ahead of Wednesday's vote. In Denmark, the timing of the second referendum is controversial, with parties sceptical about Maastricht keen to delay a vote, possibly until autumn next year. Mr Poul Schluter, the prime minister, said no date had yet been fixed for the referendum. But he told Danish television it was not excluded that the referendum could be held in May or June. He stressed that the EC and Denmark must first reach agreement on a special deal for the Danes and this must be approved by the Danish parliament before it could be put to a referendum. Mr Major's confirmation of the concession in the Commons yesterday also dismayed pro-European ministers and left Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, facing the awkward task of explaining the delay to Britain's European partners. The concession emerged from comments by Euro-sceptic Tory MPs who had belatedly been persuaded to vote with the government. Mr Michael Cartiss, a Tory MP who had planned to rebel, said: 'I voted for the government because the prime minister and Michael Heseltine (the trade and industry secretary) promised me there would be no third reading until after the referendum'. In Bonn, Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, insisted that Germany would abide by the timetable of its own ratification process, which should be completed by the end of November. But Mr Gunther Verheugen, opposition Social Democrats' chairman of the committee responsible for ratification, suggested a re-think might be necessary. He said if Danish concerns about Maastricht meant full-scale treaty amendments, it was not necessarily sensible for Germany to press ahead. Tory rebels fight on, Page 10 Joe Rogaly, Page 22</p>

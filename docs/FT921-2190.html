			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Depressed car market behind decline at BSG PROFITS at BSG International, the motor components, vehicle distribution and consumer products group, slipped back for the second year running, reflecting lower car sales volume and a sluggish leasing market. Pre-tax profits for 1991 amounted to Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 13.1m) which translated into earnings per share of 3.32p (4.29p). However, the final dividend is maintained at 2.5p to make a barely covered total of 3.2p, the same as in 1990. The group is looking for better results in the current year. 'The first two months have been encouraging, except for car distribution and leasing,' said Mr Tom Cannon, managing director, noting that the budget had made no difference to new car sales so far. 'We can trade more profitably in today's economy because we've cut back so much. Even if the economy doesn't move, we'll make more money,' he said. Indeed, Pounds 1.1m of the Pounds 2.03m profits reduction came from redundancy payments, largely at the Birmingham car sales and leasing operation, which has been reduced in scale and from which Pounds 4m in working capital has been removed. Reduction in costs helped to reduce gearing from 44 per cent to 39 per cent. Despite problems with an Australian lighting plant, which has not yet found any export markets, the group's international component operations held up strongly. Sales in the consumer and special products division, making children's car safety seats, pushchairs, nursery furniture and aircraft lavatory cubicles, rose 7 per cent and trading profits more than doubled to Pounds 8.76m.</p>

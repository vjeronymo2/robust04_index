			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: A plethora of PEPs ANYONE MIGHT think there was an election on. With personal equity plans (PEPs) thought widely to be under threat of abolition by a Labour government, a blitz of marketing for the products is under way. Many managers are producing attractive offers and discounts to entice customers before the end of the tax year. Do not, however, allow the political hype to force you into buying a PEP if it is inappropriate for you. If you cannot afford the long-term commitment (and you should think of a PEP as being at least a five-year investment), or would need to dig into other savings to fund it, do not go ahead. But if a PEP is right for you, and you have not bought one already in this tax year, it would be foolish not to take advantage of the deals on offer. PEPs are unlikely to be this cheap immediately after the election, whichever party wins. Schroders is re-launching its unit trust PEP to aim for income. A full PEP of Pounds 6,000 will include Pounds 3,000 invested in the Schroder income unit trust, with the rest put into a managed portfolio of about 10 income-producing equities. A Pounds 50 monthly savings plan is also available. The annual management fee is 1 per cent, and a discount of 1 per cent of the normal front-end fee of 5.25 per cent, plus VAT, is available from February 3 until April 5. Bank of Scotland's Self-Select PEP has been re-launched, and the bank says it is the cheapest self-select PEP available. There is now no initial charge for opening a plan (there used to be a flat-rate Pounds 30 fee), and the annual management fee is 1 per cent of the value of the portfolio. Dealing charges are higher: 1.5 per cent for transactions up to Pounds 5,000, 1 per cent for trades between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 12,500, and 0.5 per cent for deals bigger than this. But there is no need to deal if you do not want to. The Fidelity Double PEP offers a discount of 1 per cent on the front-end charge and will, until March 25, accept orders both for this tax year and for 1992-93. You can buy both the standard Pounds 6,000 PEP (Fidelity has a range of four) and a single-company PEP for both years, meaning that Fidelity can accept lump sums of up to Pounds 18,000 now. Money invested now for next year's PEP will be put into Fidelity's cash unit trust, which is earning interest of 10.31 per cent gross. The charges, including the discount, are 4.25 per cent initially and 3 per cent for the single-company PEP. If you are interested in Europe, then the Scottish Widows European PEP could be attractive. Its European unit trust will receive Pounds 3,000, and the rest will be invested in 'a carefully-selected portfolio of four or five companies quoted on a recognised EC stock exchange, other than that of the UK.' This takes advantage of relaxations in the PEP rules made in the last Budget. The discount, of 1 per cent of the front-end charge, is available only until February 14. Investment must be in lump sums of either Pounds 3,000 or Pounds 6,000. The charging structure is complex: excluding the discount, you must pay 6 per cent initially and 1.5 per cent annually for the unit trust, and 5.5 per cent plus VAT initially, and 1.5 per cent plus VAT annually, for the share portfolio. Stamp duty is also payable. The same change in the rules lifts the amount that can be invested in the Edinburgh Investment Trust to Pounds 3,000. The trust, the UK's second-largest, forms part of the Dunedin Investment Trusts PEP. The set-up charge is Pounds 24, with annual charges of 0.5 per cent. VAT must be added to both. People wanting to invest up to the full Pounds 6,000 limit can buy a 'top-up' portfolio of eight to 10 UK shares. Last, but certainly not least, Scottish Investment Trust is also taking advantage of the new rules to launch a PEP for the first time. If you opt for a PEP with just Pounds 3,000 in the investment trust, you pay only stamp duty. There is no dealing or set-up charge. But there is an initial fee of Pounds 24, with an annual charge of Pounds 30 plus VAT on a top-up portion of six FT-SE 100 shares which can be used to bring the PEP up to the Pounds 6,000 limit.</p>

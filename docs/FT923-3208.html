			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / International Company News: Write-off pushes Sansui into Y19bn loss SANSUI Electric, the Japanese consumer electronics company and former Polly Peck subsidiary, has announced losses after extraordinary items of Y19.2bn (Dollars 154.6m) in the six months to June. This follows a Y73.2bn loss in 1991. The latest results were hit by what is expected to be the final big write-off in the company's post-Polly Peck corporate restructuring. Sansui is still in the red at the operating level, but the interim figures included an extraordinary loss of Y17.2bn, related to the sale of Capetronics, a loss-making manufacturing company sold to Sansui by Polly Peck in 1990. Hong Kong-listed Semi-Tech (Global) recently purchased 51 per cent of Sansui in a Dollars 31m deal, whereby the bulk of the shares were purchased from the administrators of Polly Peck, for a nominal sum. Polly Peck retains a 20 per cent stake, while the Bank of Tokyo, Sansui's main creditor, has converted some debt for equity to take a stake of close to 5 per cent. Capetronics was purchased at the height of Japan's 'bubble economy' and on a Japanese price-earnings ratio, according to Sansui's new chairman Mr James Ting. The Taiwan-based manufacturing business was sold so that Sansui could focus on low-cost manufacturing in China, he said. Despite the dour picture painted by its latest results, Sansui's recent misery could finally be drawing to a close. It has forecast a profit in the second half of the year, due to property disposals; and it should be able to break even at the operating level in 1993, according to Mr Ting. Its new parent is the former Hong Kong computer manufacturer which launched the takeover and then turnround of Singer, the US sewing machine group. It intends to use Singer to help produce a similar performance for Sansui. Mr Ting has a simple business plan he is confident will bring it back to profit by 1994. He is proposing to bring the company's quality audio products down to mass market levels, focusing on high-turnover items, such as mini hi-fi units. Singer's 30,000 distribution outlets will then be used to develop sales. These have already been changed from a narrow focus on sewing machines to a wider range of consumer electronic products. The second part of the strategy is to pursue Sansui sales in China. 'China is in a time warp, as far as this industry is concerned,' said Mr Ting. Only recently have the Chinese demonstrated their enormous appetite for televisions and washing machines. Semi-Tech has enlisted the aid of Hong Kong's largest audio products manufacturer Tomei Holdings, through an equity swap. Tomei is to produce cheap audio products in China and it will also utilise its domestic sales quota for Sansui products. A Sansui retail network is also planned.</p>

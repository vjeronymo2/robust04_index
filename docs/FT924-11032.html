			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / World Trade News: EC accuses US of steel 'harassment' EUROPEAN Community and other steel exporters yesterday accused US steel producers of 'trade harassment' in mounting a series of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy actions. The 84 petitions by US producers, 38 directed against EC members, were filed after talks on a multilateral steel accord collapsed, the EC told Gatt's anti-dumping committee yesterday. The EC urged the US to scrap the actions. The suits, involving 21 countries, had been filed though no increase in steel exports to the US had occurred, and prices of EC steel were higher than US producers', the EC said. About 2m tonnes of EC steel exports worth Dollars 800m (Pounds 490.7m) a year were affected by the petitions. The US was using its anti-dumping procedures to harass foreign competitors, the EC claimed. It questioned if methods being used to assess dumping were in line with Gatt's anti-dumping code. But under Gatt rules, the US action cannot be legally challenged until duties are definitively imposed. The complaints were echoed by other steel exporters, including Japan, Brazil and Mexico.</p>

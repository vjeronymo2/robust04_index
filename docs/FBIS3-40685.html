			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Selling a Surrender"] </F>   [Text] In the aftermath of the agreement arrived at by  official negotiators of GATT member-countries in Geneva on  December 15, 1993, an orchestrated effort is being made to sell  the GATT deal at the end of the tortuous Uruguay Round which  commenced more than seven years ago at Punta del Este, as a  victory for all participating countries. Here at home, the Union  Government initially sought to dismiss opposition to the  deal--not only from political parties, but from a wide  cross-section of people including representatives of farmers,  agricultural workers, industrial employees, public sector  officers, and professional economists and analysts--as  ill-informed and baseless. Subsequently, however, it has been  forced to take a slightly different and at least somewhat  defensive tack, conceding that the deal is not altogether in our  favour, but arguing at the same time that this was the best we  could do under the circumstances. The domestic votaries of  globalisation within the framework of the existing world order  have, of course, been far more vociferous in their support to  the GATT deal.    The entire Uruguay Round of talks has seen a steady erosion  of the positions of the Third World and an enormous  strengthening of the hegemony of the big three--the United  States, the European Union and Japan--over world trade. One by  one, new areas--services, agriculture, domestic investment  policies, intellectual property rights--have been brought into  the agenda of multilateral negotiations, with the clear intent  of eroding the sovereign space available to the weaker  member-countries. In this context, the absurd argument of  symmetry in the loss of sovereign space--that if India loses  sovereignty in certain areas of economic policy on account of  the deal, so do the United States, the European Union and  others--needs to be nailed. Notwithstanding the new GATT  discipline and dispute settlement procedures--which themselves  are heavily biased in favour of developed countries--the strong  countries retain and will no doubt use from time to time their  bilateral/unilateral options.    Even leaving aside the extremely important issue of loss of  sovereign decision-making space, what is the balance-sheet of  gains and losses of India? Not a single improvement in terms by  India could get through. While the U.S. attempt to delay the  phasing out of the Multi Fibre Agreement (MFA) by another five  years has not succeeded, there is little cheer for Indian  textile exporters in the MFA phase-out calendar which opens up  slowly to the extent of 49 per cent in the first nine years, and  contains the somewhat incredible promise of the remaining  opening up occurring in the tenth year.    The other area where substantial gains are being claimed is  agriculture. The picture that is being painted of India's  agricultural exports expanding by leaps and bounds on account of  the reduction in agricultural subsidies in the countries of the  European Union is vastly exaggerated for at least two reasons.  First, the final reduction agreed upon in the bargaining between  the United States and the European Union is hardly significant.  Secondly, primary commodity exports have faced, for quite a long  period now, declining terms of trade, and the situation is  unlikely to change. Thus, even if exports were to increase in  physical terms, their value increase would be quite limited.  Further, with the increasing industrialisation of agriculture,  such modest gains as may be made in agricultural exports are  likely to be far outweighed by the losses in the ground yielded  in trade-related intellectual property rights (TRIPS).    What must additionally be noted as far as the implications  of  the Dunkel deal for India in the area of agriculture are  concerned, is the provision of minimum market access. This  provision requires us to allow agricultural imports to the  extent, at the minimum, of a certain percentage of domestic  consumption. This minimum is also slated to rise over time. The  argument that India can escape this provision by improving the  precarious balance of payments situation ignores the fact that  the provisions permitting even a temporary restriction of  imports on balance of payments grounds have now been  considerably diluted, and that in any case the IMF will be the  arbiter.    There are several areas in which the GATT deal is extremely  unfavourable to India. The new IPR regime severely restricts  access to new scientific and technological knowledge, and is  thus in sharp contrast to the principles of "free trade" so  sanctimoniously proclaimed by the West. It is a serious  impediment to our scientific and technological advance. The  introduction of product patent, the treatment of import as  equivalent to working of the patent, the right to patent life  forms, and the requirement of providing an effective, even if  sui generis, system of protection to IPR in plant  varieties--all these have strong negative implications for  biotechnology and agricultural advance.    The new IPR regime will sharply erode the self-reliance of  our drugs and pharmaceuticals sector and lead to increase in  prices of various drugs. The argument that most drugs currently  under use are not under patent ignores two important facts. A  "low" overall proportion of drugs not under patent is consistent  with the same proportion being much higher for specific groups,  and this is indeed the case with respect to such important  groups as anti-bacterial and anti-cancer drugs. Secondly, in the  context of the current biotechnology revolution, a lot of new  drugs will be emerging, and under the Dunkel text these will be  patented. Further, the claim that, where necessary, the  government can invoke provisions of compulsory licensing in the  public interest, is very misleading, since the Dunkel Draft  provisions on compulsory licensing are very weak.    Details apart, what needs to be unambiguously understood is  that the new GATT treaty violates our sovereignty by seriously  curtailing the power to decide policies not only in relation to  foreign trade but in relation to such fundamental areas as  agriculture, investment, and social welfare. Unfortunately, the  Government has shown no willingness at all to put up even a  decent fight, let alone try to evolve a serious negotiating  stance independently and in conjunction with other developing  countries. This is, of course, not surprising, given the present  Government's abject surrender to the diktats of the IMF and the  World Bank.    The bulldozing of the GATT deal symbolises the emerging  world  order of the 1990s. In the period immediately after the Second  World War, the imperial powers, save the United States, had  suffered a steep decline in political and economic terms; a  number of countries had embarked on the socialist path; and  there was a wave of decolonisation. The new institutions, the  IMF and the World Bank, were created, in the first instance, to  stabilise the capitalist economic order in its citadels, GATT,  while part of the same scheme of things, had to make some  concessions to developing countries, in the context of the Cold  War, and the presence of a group of socialist countries  sympathetic to the Third World. For a brief while, in the 1970s,  developing countries even made bold to assert themselves and  demand a new international economic order. There has now been a  sea-change, with the collapse of socialism in eastern Europe and  the former USSR, and the triumphant centralisation and  consolidation of international capital under U.S. hegemony. The  new GATT deal is a milestone on the road to global  recolonisation and a millstone around our necks.    There is still time. The treaty will not be signed until the  ministerial meet in April 1994. The people of this country can  still say `no' to recolonisation. The inadmissible alternative  is rule by transnational corporations and a mockery of people's  sovereignty and parliamentary democracy.</p>

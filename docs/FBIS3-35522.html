While the final casualty toll is  still unknown, Palestinian sources reported a short while ago  that 31 people were killed. PLO Executive Committee member  Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh said about 130 people were killed or wounded.  Monte Carlo radio correspondent in the occupied territories  reported that according to an initial count, 26 people were  killed and more than 70 wounded. An Israeli Army spokesman said  that only 10 Palestinians were killed when an Israeli settler  opened fire at the worshipers inside the mosque.    Commenting on the massacre a short while ago, PLO Chairman  Yasir 'Arafat said:    [Begin recording] I do not absolve the Israeli Army from  responsibility, because it is known that the Israeli Army posts  guards at and around the entrances to the Ibrahimi Mosque. How  did it allow armed settlers to enter the mosque while people  were performing the dawn prayers? There is some sort of  collusion. This has serious implications.    Everyone must realize that the blood of our people is not  without its price. The blood of our people is precious. These  faithful worshippers were fired on while they were performing  the dawn prayer at the Ibrahimi Mosque. I cannot but call on  the entire world--the cosponsors of the [Madrid] conference, the  permanent members and all other members of the UN Security  Council, the EC, the nonaligned states, the Arab states, and the  Islamic states--to shoulder their responsibility. I call in  particular on the cosponsors of the conference, who signed the  peace agreement with us. What kind of a peace is this they are  talking about when crimes have not ceased against our people and  the killing is continuing. [end recording]    Commenting on the massacre also, PLO Executive Committee  member Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh said:    [Begin recording] The Rabin government and the occupation  army shoulder full responsibility for this crime. No peace can  be achieved in the Palestinian territory as long as one settler  remains on this land. These are criminal gangs and one of the  tools of occupation. They must leave the Palestinian territory,  with the occupation. The PLO regards this big crime as a very  serious turning point. Complete protection for our people must  be ensured, and this protection cannot be provided by the  occupation forces. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Observer: Big round numbers What's Dollars 20m between friends? Not much if the friends are the creditors and administrators to Maxwell Communication Corporation, it seems. Unkind sorts might suggest that accountants Price Waterhouse can't add up, since their letter to creditors last week suggests asset realisations of Dollars 775m-Dollars 1,350m, while the accompanying detailed disclosure document suggests a range of Dollars 781m-Dollars 1,364m. But the firm assures Observer that the discrepancy is simply due to rounding the figures to the nearest, hey, Dollars 25m. One thing is certain. The discrepancy is nowhere near enough to cover all the professional fees involved - more than Dollars 78m to date . . . and rising.</p>

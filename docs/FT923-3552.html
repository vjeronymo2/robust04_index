			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Letter: A religion nothing like a railway system Sir, I refer to the feature, 'India: a penitential ride to Madurai' (August 29). Intelligent travel writing presupposes prior spade-work by the writer; a degree of sympathy with the subject; and, above all, humour that is neither frivolous nor offensive. I am afraid the feature fails on all counts. Why ever did Mr David Pilling visit India? Surely, it could not have been his intention to dissuade people from visiting India, since he appears to have secured facilities from the Indian Tourist Office. This is hardly the place to give him a rudimentary idea of Hinduism. Suffice to say that it is not 'like a railway system' - whether Indian or some other. No religion deserves such an uninformed and unwarranted comment. H C Guglani, attache, Embassy of India, Damascus</p>

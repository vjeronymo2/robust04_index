			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The meeting of mayors and deputies of legislative  bodies from southern Slovakia opened in Komarno this afternoon.  Jarmila Tosecka, our editor, will now highlight for us the  atmosphere of the meeting.    [Tosecka] Good afternoon, the meeting in Komarno is at  present reaching its climax. In the course of the past four  hours, a number of mayors of towns and villages took their turns  to make lengthier speeches from the platform, in which they  appraised the current local government's rights, draft of the  territorial-administration reorganization, and the  constitutional position of Hungarians in Slovakia.    That part of the meeting's agenda passed calmly, despite  critical reservations and fundamental proposals on the  resolution of the problems. The ensuing debate, however, was  marked by passionate words and statements.    At the close, the organizers acquainted the participants in  the meeting with the content of the open letter they are sending  to the Slovak president. Apart from other things, they appeal to  the whole Slovak public with these words: Let us seek a path to  ourselves but only on the principle of equality.    I shall now quote briefly from the final statement adopted  by  the participants in the national meeting of members of local  governments, mayors, and deputies of legislative bodies from  southern Slovakia in Komarno. The draft is currently being  presented by one of the organizers:    The Central European space is characterized by, among other  things, unsettled ethnical relations and accumulated tension  that could lead to tragic conflicts. We shall do everthing  possible in the interest of ensuring that such a conflict does  not break out in the Carpathian base. It is, however, necessary  to point out that ethnical problems must be tackled also here.  For Slovakia, which gained independence in 1993, this means that  relations between Slovaks and Hungarians must be built on new  foundations. In the interest of this, it is necessary to create  a new system of relations between Slovaks and Hungarians, and it  is necessary to pass new laws. The steps taken by the government  to date have contributed to the worsening of mutual relations.  The new system of relations is to strengthen the basic pillars  of democracy.</p>

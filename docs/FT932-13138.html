			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Pearson to acquire Thames Television in Pounds 99m deal PEARSON, the publishing, bank-ing and industrial group, yesterday agreed to buy Thames Television in a deal worth a total of Pounds 99m. Pearson's decision to buy the 59 per cent stake owned by Thorn EMI, the entertainment group, triggers a full bid for Thames, which formerly held the London weekday ITV franchise and is now the UK's largest independent producer. The deal is part of a wide-ranging move into the television market by Pearson. It already owns stakes in British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture, and Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, an ITV company. Lord Blakenham, chairman of Pearson, which also owns the Financial Times, said yesterday: 'Our strategy is to increase our involvement in the visual media.' The acquisition of Thames will be Pearson's first wholly-owned television production and distribution enterprise. Pearson clearly intends the deal to be the first step in the creation of an international television business. Thames will become the heart of a new division which will also include Pearson's interests in BSkyB and Yorkshire. Mr Richard Dunn will remain chief executive. Thames lost its franchise to Carlton in January, but sales of programmes such as The Bill, Wish You Were Here and This Is Your Life to ITV will bring in more than Pounds 40m this year. Although no contracts have been agreed beyond that, senior Thames executives believe it is likely that further contracts will be agreed for the programmes, which are in the ITV Top 20. Pearson will also be buying an international programme distribution business, Teddington studios in London, a 9.7 per cent stake in the Astra satellite system which has recently been revalued to Pounds 20m, a 15 per cent stake in UK Gold, the satellite channel based on programme libraries, and a library with more than 10,000 hours of useable programmes. At the end of 1992, Thames had net assets of Pounds 11.8m and a net cash balance of Pounds 13.8m after finance leases. Mr Frank Barlow, Pearson managing director, described the Thames deal as 'just an extension of our existing business', which was heavily based on intellectual property rights. Mr Barlow said he saw Thames as a base from which to expand into international broadcasting - including the possibility of taking stakes in broadcasters in other countries. As the owner of a UK national newspaper, Pearson is limited to a single 20 per cent stake in an ITV company. But it will keep its stake in Yorkshire-Tyne Tees below 15 per cent to continue to qualify as an independent producer under UK rules. There is likely to be an expansion in business, educational and childrens' programmes drawing on the strengths of the FT, and Pearson publishing interests, which include Longman and Penguin. Pearson's cash offer of 200p a share represents a premium of about 14 per cent on Thames' closing price on Thursday. They added 20p yesterday to close at 195p. Pearson shares rose by 10p to 429p.</p>

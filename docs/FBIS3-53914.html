			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hasan Abu-Zayid from Taba, from the "With the </F> Events" program]    [Text] A round of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations was  concluded in Taba this evening. On the Security Committee,  which discussed the issue of border crossings, the Israeli and  Palestinian sides have reached an agreement on a joint working  paper specifying the points of agreement and disagreement  concerning border crossings. In other words, there is no  progress on the Security Committee's talks, and the border  crossings remained the obstacle hindering any progress on this  committee's talks. 'Ami Glusqa, spokesman for the Israeli  delegation said that the two sides have drafted a joint working  paper covering the two sides' stands on all that is related to  the border crossings, which hinder any progress on the talks of  the Security Committee.    At the end of the session, Hasan 'Asfur, deputy head of the  Palestinian team, said that the problem of border crossings will  be discussed again during the next round of talks on Monday [24  January].    [Begin recording] ['Asfur] The meetings were businesslike. A  joint document has been drafted. We will start new discussions  on these topics on Monday. The discussions are difficult. We  do not expect speedy solutions. We are working hard to bridge  the points of disagreement.    [Abu-Zayid] Does this mean the question of crossings will be  discussed again in Taba?    ['Asfur] Next week, we will continue discussions on the  question of crossings. This week's discussions on this issue  were more businesslike than in the previous sessions.    [Abu-Zayid] What about other topics?    ['Asfur] There are others on the agenda, but we should  finish  this issue since we have already started with it.    [Abu-Zayid] With respect to the crossings question, will it  be raised during the 'Arafat-Peres meeting this week?    ['Asfur] It is the right of the Palestinian people's  leadership and the Israeli Government to discuss any issue.    [Abu-Zayid] But we have noticed that you have reached a dead  end with respect to the question of border crossings?    ['Asfur] Had we arrived at a dead end, we would not have  agreed to meet again.    [Abu-Zayid] Yes, but this question has taken enough time?    ['Asfur] It may take more time. We are not discussing time,  but a solution. We know that these are difficult negotiations  between two sides that have fought each other for a long time.  Reaching a solution is not as easy as some believe.    [Abu-Zayid] How important is the paper that you drafted  today  for the essence of the negotiations on the crossings?    ['Asfur] The paper has set a general perspective about all  the issues that we should discuss. So, we will not have to  exchange papers again or to present a detailed paper by each  side. We have drafted a paper which specifies all the issues  that we must discuss. [end recording]    The Civilian Affairs Committee, which is headed by Attorney  Jamil al-Tarifi for the Palestinians and Brigadier General Gadi  Zohar for the Israelis, discussed the electricity issue. Also,  the committee raised the question of launching a Palestinian  television and radio for the first time. We have learned that  tangible progress was achieved during today's session of the  Civilian Affairs Committee. Attorney Jamil al-Tarifi said:    [Begin recording] [Al-Tarifi] We have completed discussions  on the registration of residents and documents. Up to this  moment, Palestinian and Israeli experts are continuing  discussions on the question of electricity.    [Abu-Zayid] Is there progress on the discussions of the  Civilian Affairs Committee?    [Al-Tarifi] We expect so, God willing.    [Abu-Zayid] What about the question of the Palestinian radio  and television?    [Al-Tarifi] Our experts have not arrived yet. We are  expecting their arrival from Cairo. If they do not arrive  today, we will hold this issue until next week, God willing.    [Abu-Zayid] Will the committee hold another session today?    [Al-Tarifi] God willing.    [Abu-Zayid] Is there progress on the Security Committee.    [Al-Tarifi] God willing.    [Abu-Zayid] Attorney Jamil al-Tarifi, is there a linkage  between the talks of the Civilian Affairs and Security  Committees.    [Al-Tarifi] In the final analysis, everything is linked to  everything else. This is because there can be no comprehensive  agreement by the Civilian Affairs Committee without an agreement  on security issues. This is so there will only be one agreement.    [Abu-Zayid] Has a specified formula been reached on the  issues that have been agreed upon?    [Al-Tarifi] Yes, a specified formula has been reached  between  us and the Israelis on the transfer of all the powers that have  been agreed upon. [end recording]    Brigadier General Gadi Zohar, head of the Israeli team at  the  committee said that there is progress on this committee. He  said:    [Begin recording] [Zohar] During this round of talks, we  discussed a host of civilian issues, including electricity,  which we are discussing today, passports, identification cards,  etcetera. Contrary to our wishes, there is no speedy progress.  There is still a lot to be done. This takes time.    [Abu-Zayid] When will you finish all issues pertaining to  the  Civilian Affairs Committee?    [Zohar] Who knows? When we reach an agreement, we know that  we have finished our mission.

			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAIDERS OFFER MEMORIES, NOT GLORY;  </P> <P> OAKLAND CHEERS ITS FORMER TEAM IN 23-21 DEFEAT  </P> <P> For a brief moment, the once-and-perhaps future Oakland Raiders rode again,  almost as in days of yore. Steve Beuerlein rallied them in the fourth quarter  the way George Blanda used to, and the local population threw a  silver-and-black party for the ages.  </P> <P> What Los Angeles, which will be their home for the rest of the season, got out  of it, is something else.  </P> <P> The Houston Oilers chewed them up and spit them out in the first half when it  was first string-on-first string, outgaining them, 203-9.  </P> <P> But it was the Oilers' second string that snatched the Raiders' first  exhibition victory from their jaws, driving 47 yards in the closing seconds for  the winning touchdown. Allen Pinkett went the last yard untouched and the  Oilers won, 23-21, Saturday night before a sellout crowd of 50,642 in Oakland  Coliseum.  </P> <P> The Raiders are 0-3. The crowd that cheered them, the Raiderettes, the replays  and the fireworks obviously lifted them, but aside from looking more excited,  they showed as many holes as they had playing before 31,000 in the Coliseum.  </P> <P> Moreover, they are still a team in transition.  </P> <P> Linebacker Matt Millen, a starter since the team was playing here, was benched  for Jackie Shipp. Millen told friends he has been informed by the coaching  staff that he will be traded.  </P> <P> Mike Haynes, fighting to hold his job, had his problems. Todd Christensen took  a victory lap around the stadium during warmups and was cheered loudly, but was  held out. James Lofton played sparingly. All are in trouble and some could even  go in this week's cut to 60.  </P> <P> Beuerlein entered the game midway through the fourth quarter and drove the  Raiders 74 yards, 53 of it on a completion to the other exhibition sensation,  Mike Alexander. Beuerlein then threw a seven-yard swing pass to fullback Steve  Strachan, who ran over a Houston safety and put the Raiders ahead, 21-16,  giving local football fans their best moment of the second half of the decade.  </P> <P> The Oilers then took over at the Raider 47 with 1:49 left and drove behind  backup quarterback Cody Carlson.  </P> <P> From the Raider two, Carlson threw into the end zone and was intercepted by  Raider linebacker Thomas Benson, giving the locals their second-best moment.  But the play was called back because of a holding penalty.  </P> <P> On the next play, with seven seconds left from the Raider one, Carlson started  left, drew the Raider defense and pitched to Pinkett, who scored easily.  </P> <P> The locals are hoping for better things next decade.  </P> <P> The night started in the morning. The parking lot next to Oakland Coliseum was  opened at 9 a.m. and filled by vans and barbecuers by 10. Some hard partying  ensued.  </P> <P> "The crowd might be a little short," said Raider executive assistant Al  LoCasale shortly before the 7 p.m. game time, smiling. "Some of these people  will never make it in here."  </P> <P> The crowd went batty all through warmups. The team was introduced only as "the  Raiders."  </P> <P> Sentimentalists, the Raiders sent their only three players who had played here  -- Millen, Christensen and Howie Long -- out to call the coin toss. Of the  three, only Long is certain to make the final cut.  </P> <P> They lost the toss. The game began.  </P> <P> They went ahead, 7-0, when free agent cornerback Dan Land intercepted a pass by  Warren Moon that receiver Leonard Harris had tipped. Land returned it 10 yards  to the Houston 12.  </P> <P> Two plays later, Willie Gault shook Oiler cornerback Steve Brown off in the end  zone, got open and caught Jay Schroeder's pass. Jeff Jaeger kicked the point.  </P> <P> So much for Raider highlights in the first half.  </P> <P> Schroeder went three for 10 and was sacked twice. The Raider rushing game got  seven yards in six carries. There were no more first downs. At halftime, the  Oilers had outgained them, 203-9.  </P> <P> The Oilers settled for three field goals by Tony Zendejas, from 24, 26 and  finally from 53 yards, the last with four seconds left, for a 9-7 lead.  </P> <P> Raider Notes  </P> <P> Tight end report: The first time both players were healthy, the Raiders started  young Mike Dyal with the first unit. Todd Christensen wasn't brought on until  late, suggesting that he is in trouble, and could even go in Monday's cut. . .  . Cornerback wars (continued): Mike Haynes started, but he often came out in  favor of Lionel Washington in passing situations. Haynes was also beaten three  times on a single drive, on crossing patterns by Houston's Haywood Jeffires,  for 28, 18 and 17 yards. The Raider coaches had said that Haynes is having  trouble covering those patterns, so the veteran could be in trouble.  </P></p>

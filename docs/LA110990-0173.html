			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GERMANY, SOVIET UNION OK NONAGGRESSION PACT  </P> <P> As Germans celebrated the first anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall,  Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed a historic nonaggression treaty  with Chancellor Helmut Kohl today and got a hero's welcome for letting the wall  and the Iron Curtain collapse.  </P> <P> Both Kohl and Gorbachev stressed the importance of the historical changes that  have allowed closer ties as they signed the broad agreement that is to serve as  the foundation of future relations.  </P> <P> "Having signed this document one could hardly . . . think about until recently,  we have officially ended a whole historical process and opened a deep  perspective for ourselves," Gorbachev said.  </P> <P> In the treaty, both nations pledge not to attack the other and to honor the  borders of all European nations.  </P> <P> The upper house of Parliament, the Bundesrat, met in Berlin for the first time  since 1959 to commemorate the opening of the wall that signaled the collapse of  East Germany's Communist Party system and the triumph of democracy movements  across Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> But there was a commemoration of a somber sort, too, as the date is the same as  the anniversary of a 1938 Nazi pogrom in which Germans set fire to synagogues  and wrecked Jewish-owned shops, a foretaste of the Holocaust.  </P> <P> "In our history, Nov. 9 is an ambivalent date -- a day of joy, a day of horror  and of shame," Bundesrat President Henning Voscherau said. But, "A year ago, on  Nov. 9, 1989, the people overthrew a dictatorship in Germany for the first time  in our history," he continued. "Since then, Nov. 9 has become a shining light  in our history as well."  </P> <P> At a ceremony commemorating "Kristallnacht" (The Night of Broken Glass), German  Jewish leader Heinz Galinski indirectly criticized the government's recent  decision to halt Jewish immigration from the Soviet Union after a wave of  applications for asylum.  </P> <P> "To allow Jewish life in this country to wither away would mean bowing once  again to the will of the Nazi state," he said.  </P> <P> Berlin artist Ben Wagin laid the foundation stone outside the Reichstag  building for a memorial to more than 190 Germans killed trying to cross the  East-West German border, 80 of them at the Berlin Wall.  </P> <P> The wood and stone memorial will stand in the former "death strip" beside the  wall, once a deadly obstacle course of dog runs, tripwires, searchlights and  guard towers manned by troops with orders to shoot would-be escapees.  </P> <P> Only a few sections of the 107-mile wall still stand. And those sections have  been chipped away by souvenir hunters.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> ROYAL SUMMONS: Dr. Sidney Gibbons, a Santa Ana podiatrist, has the most exotic  BritFest souvenir so far -- a photo of British Princess Alexandra autographed  while he was doctoring her foot. . . . The Royal Corn, located on the  princess's right little toe, flared up Thursday, and Gibbons was summoned to  her hotel in Costa Mesa. . . . "I haven't made a house call in 20 years, but  what the hell, you don't see a princess every day," says Gibbons. "She's an  absolute delight." Jerry Hicks and Dave Lesher  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF CLUB PROS;  </P> <P> LEISURE: MEMBERS OF THE POSH RIVIERA COUNTRY CLUB WERE READY TO REVOLT WHEN A  JAPANESE GROUP BOUGHT IT. NOW THEY CAN'T SAY ENOUGH NICE THINGS ABOUT THE  OWNERS.  </P> <P> It was bad enough that unfamiliar Japanese investors bought the posh Riviera  Country Club -- an exclusive Pacific Palisades establishment steeped in  traditions dating back to the Golden Era of Hollywood.  </P> <P> But then came the announcement two months ago that the new owners would banish  motorized carts from the sublime fairways of the Riviera's world-class golf  course, requiring that they stay on paths. Some of the 600-plus club members,  who include celebrities and some of Southern California's business elite, were  up in arms.  </P> <P> Coming as one of the first pronouncements by the new owners, it was a sign,  some members feared, of more drastic measures to come.  </P> <P> Some felt that the ambience they had so learned to enjoy at one of the  Westside's premiere clubs was in jeopardy. Riviera members were abuzz about how  the new owners of a club in Valencia had added a Japanese restaurant and sushi  bar, Japanese bath complex and Japanese instructions to the signs on the  course.  </P> <P> Speculation was rampant. Would their club be next? Would the leisurely golf  games and the chummy days and nights at the clubhouse be the next to go? And  would the traditions fostered by decades of family ownership of the club give  way to profit-minded motivations by the Japanese investors?  </P> <P> Au contraire. The members now say they are happier than ever. And they admit --  a bit sheepishly perhaps -- that their xenophobia has been overcome by a love  they share with the new owners, that of hitting a tiny, dimpled ball hard  enough, and far enough to end up in a tiny hole in the ground.  </P> <P> Not long ago, the members criticized the Japanese for buying the Riviera in  particular and investing in the United States in general. Now, members gush  about how the Japanese' reverence for golf will return the Riviera club, the  golf course and even the sprawling Spanish-style clubhouse to their original  splendor.  </P> <P> New owner Noboru Watanabe, senior managing director of the Marukin Corp., even  plays a few rounds with "the boys" when he stops by from his home base in  Japan. Watanabe is said to be beside himself with glee over the Riviera being  the host of the 64th annual Los Angeles Open golf tournament, starting Feb. 19.  </P> <P> The change in ownership may even exemplify what is best about "the emerging  global marketplace," according to one of the members.  </P> <P> "Originally, we were 100% against the sale," said member Paul Savage, who sits  on the members' board of governors. "We didn't know who these people were."  </P> <P> "But now that we know them," he adds, "there has been a great turnaround among  the majority of members. They have been absolutely fantastic."  </P> <P> Just months ago, many members -- who paid as much as $25,000 to join -- were in  an uproar over the golf cart rule. They especially feared that some of their  elderly and infirm colleagues would have to take their golf games elsewhere,  since they relied on the carts to help them get around the massive fairways of  the 18-hole course.  </P> <P> "There was great anger about the carts, sure," Savage recalls. "There are  members who have been here 30 years," and they resented it.  </P> <P> "There was a great apprehension by almost everyone, you know, at the time about  the Japanese' buying of America in the first place," Savage says.  </P> <P> "We didn't know what the future would hold," recalls Joey Rosenberg, last  year's chairman of the board. "The Japanese have bought other clubs here . . .  and it really has negatively impacted on the membership and ambience of the  clubs."  </P> <P> With its traditions and reputation as a Los Angeles landmark, putting a sushi  bar at the Riviera would be tantamount to sacrilege, the members say.  </P> <P> Located off Sunset Boulevard below the Santa Monica Mountains, the Riviera is a  place where legends such as Ben Hogan and Arnold Palmer tested their mettle on  the fairways, and stars like W. C. Fields, Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford and  Clark Gable teed off.  </P> <P> Over the years, Hollywood's elite frequented the palatial clubhouse, complete  with lavish dining room, two ballrooms and luxurious hotel suites. Legend has  it that Errol Flynn was once arrested there after stealing the badge of an  off-duty policeman during a dinner party.  </P> <P> The Riviera has served as host of the U. S. Open and other PGA tournaments on  occasion. Hogan has had such spectacular luck there that part of the course is  known in golf circles as Hogan's Alley.  </P> <P> The idea for the club originated at the end of World War I, when members of the  Los Angeles Athletic Club -- including the grandfather of current athletic club  managing partners Frank and Charles Hathaway -- decided to build a club for  returning servicemen. Since then, it has become recognized around the world not  only as a top-flight golf course but a place where Hollywood's stars gather, an  American icon.  </P> <P> So it was not surprising that members were outraged and confused in May, 1988,  when it was first disclosed that a mysterious group of Japanese investors  intended to buy the Riviera for $108 million.  </P> <P> At the time, the United States was reeling from the news of Japanese purchases  of American real estate. Japan-bashing was in vogue.  </P> <P> Of particular note to the members were stories about the Japanese' obsession  with golf, a pastime that in their native country is so exclusive that a single  club membership costs as much as several million dollars.  </P> <P> The Japanese had already acquired as many as a dozen courses in California and  Hawaii, but probably none as high-profile as Riviera.  </P> <P> David Shulman, director of real estate research for the Salomon Bros.  investment banking firm, even speculated then that, "It may be cheaper for them  to fly over to play golf at the Riviera than it is for them to play golf at  home."  </P> <P> Adding insult to injury, club owner Laaco Ltd. for a long time refused to  identify the new purchasers. Outraged, the members rallied together and even  established a legal defense fund to protect their rights.  </P> <P> Laaco, which still owns the downtown Los Angeles Athletic Club and the  California Yacht Club in Marina del Rey, later announced that the  still-undisclosed buyers had decided to scale back their purchase plans and  intended to buy only a 49% interest in the club and the adjoining Riviera  Tennis Club.  </P> <P> Marukin, a large Japanese real estate company, was disclosed as the mysterious  investor in September, 1988. And last September, Marukin exercised an option to  buy Riviera outright, and assumed full ownership of the 168-acre club.  </P> <P> The initial secrecy, and the ambiguity over the deal, scared the club members.  But Watanabe and his father, Kaneo Watanabe, immediately pledged to honor the  club's traditions while improving the course and the clubhouse.  </P> <P> Watanabe could not be reached for comment for this article. But his on-site  representative, Yasushi (Joe) Masaki, recalls, "There were a lot of bad, nasty  comments and rumors, and some resistance by members."  </P> <P> The new owners, however, set to work pacifying the members, telling them of  their plans for improvements.  </P> <P> Of primary concern was that in recent years, the golf course had slipped a few  notches from its place as one of the nation's 20 premiere courses, according to  Rainer Gehres, the new general manager of the club under Marukin.  </P> <P> Gehres says the strict golf cart rule was instituted as part of a comprehensive  plan to restore the course. "It had dwindled a bit in the past. . . . Drastic  measures were necessary," he said in a recent interview.  </P> <P> The rule, implemented Dec. 15, was anything but popular at first. The members,  Gehres said, "were not enthusiastic. A number of them were concerned."  </P> <P> In fact, the board of governors rejected the rule in a lopsided, but symbolic  vote.  </P> <P> Soon, the new management team was dispatching crews to begin trimming the dense  eucalyptus trees just off the fairways, and was spending time and more than  $100,000 meticulously manicuring the course. The tender winter grass began  looking better almost immediately. The new owners had agreed to give special  cart privileges to members with handicapped parking permits, and the board  voted again last month, this time to support the cart rule.  </P> <P> Indeed, the new rule prohibiting carts on the fairways has helped conditions at  the course so much in just a few short months that the members now swear by it.  </P> <P> The owners have added employees, spruced up the 23 tennis courts at the  adjacent tennis club, installed a new marble floor in one ballroom and brought  in a renowned chef for the restaurant. They even froze memberships, to allow  the club's roster to thin out by attrition and give the members more room and  privacy.  </P> <P> In fact, Watanabe and his company have done such a good job overall in terms of  sprucing things up that most members are simply gushing with compliments.  </P> <P> Many members now say Noboru Watanabe's devotion to the game of golf is the  reason why improvements to the course have been so meticulous.  </P> <P> "Noboru Watanabe is an avid golfer," says Rosenberg, "and he loves this  course."  </P> <P> Gehres adds that: "The owner is so proud of this. Some people love Picassos,  others love golf courses."  </P> <P> Masaki, Watanabe's on-site liaison, agrees. He says Watanabe was a leader of  his college golf team in Tokyo, and often watched the U. S. Open and other  televised golf tournaments held at the Riviera. Once, he even watched the Los  Angeles Open from the sidelines at the club.  </P> <P> "He has always dreamed of playing here," says Masaki. "That small dream came  true, but also the bigger dream that he could own such a club. It was a  personal motivation."  </P> <P> Watanabe says buying the Riviera was meant to be a highly visible first move  into the recreation field by Marukin, which is in the final stages of building  a lavish club in Tokyo that it plans to call the Riviera Sports Club, according  to Masaki.  </P> <P> Rosenberg, admittedly one of the staunchest critics of the sale, concludes that  maybe he and other members were wrong in the beginning. "We weren't happy that  foreign investors bought the club," he says, "but the changes that are being  made have made it not that bad. I think to be objective about it, you have to  take each instance and each purchase individually."  </P></p>

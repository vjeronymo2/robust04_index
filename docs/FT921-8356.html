			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Survey of Tyne and Wear (4): Market is dull but firm - Housing WHEN the Newcastle-based Northern Rock Building Society announced a record financial year last week despite supposedly nationwide recession in property markets, it begged the question why. Something more than a local fluke was clearly at work because the smaller, Sunderland-based North of England society had also reported unprecedented good results the week before. While luck played no part, regional culture and history did. Tyne and Wear has never had a domestic property market based on false values or rampant inflation. Until recently, half the people lived in council or private rented accommodation. The area has long been comparatively short of middle-class managers or professionals compared with other northern counties such as Greater Manchester or West Yorkshire. Tyne and Wear is smaller and does not sprawl, and has had less pressure to push outwards into the countryside than elsewhere. The duller, but firm market produced by such factors is reflected in Northern Rock's own corporate culture. Mr Kevin Southwood, director and general manager, says: 'We have never done 100 per cent loans or non-status loans. We have always checked that people will be able to afford to pay. In our re-mortgage business, we never lend more than 80 per cent of the value of the property. 'When we have had to repossess from defaulting mortgagees, it has been because of marital breakdown or redundancy, not the inability of people who borrowed too much to cope with high interest rates. The result is that we have had only 35 repossessions on Tyneside over the past 12 months. 'For a Pounds 4.5bn building society, that is very, very small. Even when we have repossessed, we have not lost any money because prices are firm. Indeed, it is difficult to detect any decline in values. Some people say they could have sold for more a year ago, but there is no actual fall in terms of prices dropping below what people paid.' If anyone thinks this conservatism makes for a dull company, Northern Rock's results are testament to the virtues of prudence. It has achieved entirely organic expansion with no mergers; last year, assets grew by 29 per cent, profits by 33 per cent; it has done 45 per cent more lending and achieved more than 15 per cent reduction in unit costs. A 30 per cent market share in the north-east suggests a fair reflection of the state of regional economy. Northern Rock has a national spread, but half its branches are in the north-east and two-thirds of its 1,200 staff. In terms of asset value, it is now the eleventh-largest British building society. In an adjacent office block to Northern Rock, Mr Howard Dawe, chief executive of Bellway, the house builder, says: 'We have great faith in northern markets because traditionally there was low home ownership. It is only 60 per cent now.' He says regional housing markets only start to become saturated when owner-occupation reaches about 75 per cent of the housing stock. Then the market depends on people moving house, which fewer do in recession. At Northern Rock, Mr Southwood says that the region's evolving and broader economic structure is improving general affluence and upward mobility, so home ownership and trading up are continuing. The result is that while there has been a considerable slowdown at the top end, the market for houses priced up to Pounds 75,000 is still buoyant. Even houses costing over Pounds 100,000 are still selling, but the market is quieter. These prices would not buy much in the south, but in the north they do. 'Our main range is from one-bedroomed flats to five-bed semis, with prices running from Pounds 25,000 to Pounds 250,000,' Mr Dawe says. This did not win Bellway many admirers during the southern boom, when it hardly looked daring compared with its Tyneside rival Barratt. But its share price was five times Barratt's last week, giving Bellway a market capitalisation of Pounds 93.1m against Pounds 90.2m for Barratt. He is critical, however, of green belt policies, which he sees as based on a need to halt urban sprawl that is valid in the south but not in Tyne and Wear. He says shortage of good building land has put pressure on executive housing markets. Mr Southwood says these may actually have become locally overheated because of the shortage. The strong market encouraged the famous Gosforth rugby club to sell its Northumberland county ground for executive housing. Generally, two acres plus a house can cost more than Pounds 350,000. Darras Hall - Newcastle's 'executive ghetto' near the airport - offers prices from Pounds 180,000 to Pounds 400,000 and many relocating southerners, armed with large sums from southern sales before the recession, have in recent years looked no farther. Partly because the executive housing market is tight, the commuter belt for Tyneside has fanned out considerably northwards and westwards into Northumberland as roads have improved. This good local infrastructure is seen by economic development bodies - and relocating industry - as one of the region's prime attractions, especially for people used to miserable London commuting standards. There has therefore been a fast-growing awareness of the attractions of the Tyne Valley's many beautiful honey-coloured stone homes, in towns and villages such as Hexham and Corbridge and Wylam, or in nearby hamlets. Prices have responded accordingly and projects such as barn conversions are likely to provide local builders with lucrative work. Nevertheless, Newcastle has some highly attractive areas of good quality, executive housing close to the city centre and very readily accessible to the many fine cultural, leisure and shopping facilities it offers by dint of its regional capital status. All five boroughs have areas of up-market housing, often close to useful amenities such as the Metro rapid transit system. Indeed, the underground Metro system - which opened in 1984 at a cost of Pounds 284m - is becoming an increasingly important asset in the Tyne and Wear lifestyle, especially since it offers rather more pleasant rides and greater efficiency than its London counterpart. Three months ago, a new Pounds 12m extension opened to Newcastle Airport. It is a strategic element in the north east's infrastructure as it links the airport directly to British Rail services, attracting nearly Pounds 2.5m from the European Regional Development Fund. A feasibility study is in progress into extending the Metro to Sunderland, which would provide another strategically important link by improving regional coherence. Meanwhile, south of the river but inland, the demise of heavy industry such as the Consett steel works in County Durham has made areas such as Derwentside attractive and affordable for many in the Tyne and Wear workforce. The retreat of coal mining has also opened up interesting housing possibilities. The prime example is the upmarket new estate developed by Barratt and McLean in South Tyneside on the former Whitburn colliery. The adjacent pit heap has become a coastal park, due to be handed over to the National Trust. The coal stocking site is a nature reserve. Within the urban area, there has been new housing development, some of it very attractive, on several infill sites. On the fringes, in areas such as Kingston Park on the northern edge of Newcastle, there are large new housing estates. Despite cash restrictions, the local authorities have also been progressively upgrading their housing stock, including estates whose design made them unattractive to tenants. The government's urban programme has also been important here, with Bellway in particular exploiting it, as it has elsewhere in Britain. Ten years ago it bought nearly 200 run-down council flats in Scotswood and successfully converted them for sale at prices that local people could afford. It is now four years into Hebburn Village, on the site of the shipyard that built HMS Kelly, Lord Mountbatten's ship, in the Second World War. There will eventually be 500 low-cost homes, mainly of two- or three-bedroom size. Starting prices of Pounds 20,000 have now appreciated into the Pounds 30,000-Pounds 40,000 range. Eventually, a few up-market homes will be added, costing Pounds 60,000-Pounds 70,000. 'We are selling to people who are moving back into the district. They moved out because of poor housing and now it has improved they want to get back to familiar places and faces,' says Mr Bill Stevenson, Bellway's urban renewal chief.</p>

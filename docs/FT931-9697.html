			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / SEC's chief to step down early MR Richard Breeden is to step down as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next two months, he said yesterday, ending a busy and sometimes controversial three-year reign as the most powerful securities regulator in the US. Mr Breeden is leaving before his term's expiry in June. His resignation was expected in the wake of the Democratic victory in the presidential election last November. A lawyer with strong Republican ties, he was appointed by President George Bush in 1989. He had been on the White House staff and a key member of the team that arranged the bail-out of the collapsed US savings and loan industry. A new chairman is likely to be appointed by President Bill Clinton in the next few weeks. The front-runners for the job are believed to be Ms Consuela Washington, now securities counsel to the powerful House of Representatives energy and commerce committee, and Mr James Cheek, a Tennessee securities lawyer backed by Vice-President Al Gore. Mr Breeden said yesterday there was no particular reason for his early departure. 'It was simply time to go,' he said. During his tenure as chairman, he broadened the agency's enforcement agenda, sought to rid the securities industry of needless regulation, and promoted improvements in corporate governance. He also reformed the fast-growing mutual fund industry, eased restrictions on capital-raising by small companies and earned a reputation as a tough enforcer of the rules governing financial markets. Mr Breeden also launched the Market 2000 study of equities trading, the first big study of US markets in 20 years. It is due out this summer. Mr Breeden did not escape criticism, particularly over his role in what was seen as a politicisation of the normally independent SEC chairmanship. He always denied he had aligned the agency's policy too closely with the White House line. He also clashed on various occasions with other US and international regulatory agencies.</p>

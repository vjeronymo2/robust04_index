			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Novikov: "ZIL Did Not Get Far on the </F> Wheels of Privatization"]    [Text] The beginning of this year was marked by a  severe crisis in Russian machine-building. Productions at GAZ  [Gorkiy Automotive Plant], Rosselmash, and AZLK [Automotive  Plant imeni Leninskiy Komsomol] were shut down or switched to a  partial work week. Yesterday there was a conference of the labor  collective at the enterprise, in which FITUR [Federation of  Independent Trade Unions of Russia] Chairman M. Shakov  participated. ZIL general director Ye. Brakov briefed the worker  association on the situation at the plant.    In his words, ZIL operated relatively stably during  1992-1993. During this time it produced 373 billion rubles' [R]  worth of products. And the net profit remaining with the  enterprise amounted to R38 billion. But today the plant has  encountered the problem of selling its products. Mainly because  of the inability to pay on the part of the traditional motor  vehicle consumers--the army, agriculture, industrial enterprises.    Moreover, the enterprise, like, incidentally, all  law-abiding  domestic taxpayers, is gasping under the pressure of taxes. In  spite of the fact that ZIL is maintaining all of its facilities  of the social sphere at its own expense, the enterprise has to  make considerable deductions into the state budget and nonbudget  funds for social development.    As a result, ZIL first switched to a four-day work week and  soon after that production had to be halted. In Ye. Brakov's  words, for this year the enterprise concluded agreements for the  delivery of 159,000 motor vehicles. But according to the  estimates of experts, it will manage to sell only 55,000.  Because of the sharp drop in demand and the reduction of  production, the number of workers at the enterprise decreased  this year from 92,000 to 84,000. Wages average only R90,000.  Apparently the deterioration of the situation at ZIL threatens  to be catastrophic.    In the opinion of the leaders of the enterprise, the state,  which owns 20 percent of the ZIL shares, should help the plant.  ZIL specialists have calculated that R30 billion would save the  plant today. And ZIL would be able to repay this credit and  settle some of its debts, which have already reached R115  billion. Moreover, it would seem that the state should settle  first of all with those who purchase products from ZIL.  Obviously, the plant would not then start holding out its hand  for regular aid.</p>

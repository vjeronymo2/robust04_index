			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Russians forecast further sharp rise in rouble's value RUSSIAN government officials predicted yesterday that the rouble could reach Rbs50 to the dollar by the end of April as the currency continued to show a sharp rise in value. This would compare with a level of Rbs110 earlier this month. One Moscow bank set a rate of Rbs70 to the dollar yesterday. The rouble is still the official currency of all 15 of the former Soviet republics despite moves in some CIS states to introduce separate currencies. Mr Alexei Ulyukayev, the Russian government's senior adviser on the economy, said this week's currency movements were due to higher demand for roubles after the freeing of prices, the introduction of export tariffs and the rise in interest rates. However, foreign bankers in Moscow say the main cause is a shortage of roubles due to the inability of the printing plants to keep up with demand. The Russian central bank, which is creating a hard currency fund by taxing export earnings to stabilise the rouble, has been selling Dollars 2m-Dollars 3m a week to stop the rouble falling too far. The Russian fund is expected to remain relatively small because many Russian exporters are keeping their hard currency abroad. The government is negotiating with the International Monetary Fund on its application to join the IMF - expected to be completed in early March - and on the Russian demand for a stabilisation fund of Dollars 6bn-Dollars 7bn for the rouble to allow internal convertibility. Mr Ulyukayev also said that President Boris Yeltsin would shortly sign a decree penalising companies which charged excessively high prices. A blacklist would be drawn up from among the 2000 monopoly suppliers - most of the large enterprises - and those on it would suffer price and profit controls, the freezing of export licences and wages and the withdrawal of government subsidies. The decree is another sign that the government is trimming its economic reform in response to political and public pressures. The foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan yesterday called for an immediate ceasefire in the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, Reuter reports from Moscow. After eight hours of talks in Moscow, a joint statement said they had agreed on 'the need for an immediate ceasefire in the zone of the Karabakh conflict'. The ministers also called for roads to be unblocked and communications restored.</p>

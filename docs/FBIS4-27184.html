			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- The Japanese National  Security Council [NSC] headed by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on  Tuesday [31 May] took up the issue of Pyongyang's refusal to  permit full inspections of its nuclear activities, governemnt  sources said.    Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa reportedly briefed the  meeting  on the collapse of talks between North Korea and the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) over the inspection of  spent fuel rods being removed from a 5-megawatt reactor in the  Yongbyon complex.    Kakizawa also briefed the closed-door meeting on the  discussion currently under way within the United Nations  Security Council and reaction from other nations to the nuclear  impasse, the sources said.    Kakizawa later told reporters that North Korea has already  removed about half of the 8,000 fuel rods in the experimental  reactor.    He said that if the United Nations had waited to adopt a  presidential statement on the reactor refueling, the opportunity  to ensure no radioactive materials from the reactor have been  diverted to military purposes would be lost.    At Tuesday's meeting in Tokyo, the Japanese Defense Agency  explained the situation on the Korean peninsula and reported on  information it had received from the United States about North  Korea's expected missile launch, government sources said.    In New York on Monday, the UN Security Council adopted a  presidential statement urging North Korea to halt the fuel rod  removal after receiving a letter from the IAEA on Friday.</p>

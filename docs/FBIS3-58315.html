			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lydia Ninz: "1993 Brought 6.8 Percent </F> Unemployed"]    [Excerpt] Vienna -- The annual average unemployment figure  jumped from 5.9 to 6.8 percent last year, thus reaching a record  high in 39 years. There were an average of 222,000 registered  unemployed in Austria, some 30,000 more than the year before.  This is an increase of 15.1 percent.    Social Affairs Minister Josef Hesoun sees this development  embedded in the international situation. His press spokesman  said that Austria is "right at the bottom of the list on a  Europe-wide basis." Calculated by OECD methods, Austria's  unemployment rate goes down from 6.8 to 4.2 percent on paper.  Austria's economic experts had predicted 7 percent, the  ministry was more precise in its forecast.    For Hesoun, the new record unemployment figure is a "serious  situation," which should be countered by an active labor and  economic policy.    For the 1994 super election year, funds for measures to  avoid  unemployment were increased to a new high -- from 4.7 to 5  billion Austrian schillings. So far, these funds were used  mainly for retraining, various employment programs, subsidies to  companies, and lately for job funds. All employees and  employers of privately owned companies contribute to these.  Unemployment contributions were increased at the beginning of  this year. [passage omitted].</p>

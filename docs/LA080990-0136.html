			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> INITIAL OK FOR BUILDING PLAN  </P> <P> The City Council has given preliminary approval to a development agreement with  Maguire Thomas Partners Development to build a four-story office building at  1733 Ocean Ave. The site is currently occupied by the 40-year-old, three-story  Flamingo Hotel.  </P> <P> The council voted 6 to 1 Tuesday night to approve the agreement. Councilman Ken  Genser voted against the project.  </P> <P> In June, 1989, the Planning Commission was presented four options for the  project, including allowances for a five- or six-story building. Maguire  Thomas, which is building a 175-room hotel across the street at 1746 Ocean  Ave., chose to seek approval for the development agreement, which locks in  current building standards for the construction of a four-story, 56-foot high  building.  </P> <P> The development can be increased in height, however, if a draft design plan for  the Civic Center area is released by March 1 and it permits structures taller  than four stories, or if the General Plan is amended to allow buildings taller  than four stories in the Civic Center area.  </P> <P> A citizens advisory committee is drafting a design plan for the area bounded by  Ocean Avenue, 4th Street, Colorado Avenue and Pico Boulevard.  </P> <P> Maguire Thomas will be required to pay a $250,000 fee to a Civic Center and  Ocean front improvement fund.  </P></p>

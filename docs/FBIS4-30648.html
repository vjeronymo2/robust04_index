			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, June 28 (OANA-ANTARA) -- Visiting  Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating said that he welcomes the  recent issuance of economic deregulation package to encourage  greater foreign investments flow to Indonesia.    "We are happy about the decision taken by Indonesia to adopt  a policy of greater investment opportunities and also about  today's news reports on more deregulation packages," Keating  told a press conference here Tuesday.    Jakarta on Monday announced a deregulation package for the  industrial sector that reduces import duties on 739 tariff codes  covering manufacturing, agricultural, and health products.    The government earlier this month also announced a new  investment policy which allows foreign investors to have 95  percent shares in a join venture company.    Trade value between Indonesia and Australia was recorded at  U.S. $3 billion in 1993.    Keating also said that issues on Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) forum, bilateral ties, and economic  cooperation dominated his two-hour talk with President Suharto  earlier Tuesday.    He said that during the meeting President Suharto briefed  him  on the importance of maintaining national stability and national  unity at a time of great economic growth and transformation.    Underlining that relationship between Indonesia and  Australia  have improved dramatically in the last few years, he said that  the president also touched on other issues on the World Trade  Organization. [sentence as received]    When asked about the roles of Indonesia and ASEAN in general  within the structure of APEC, Keating said that ASEAN obviously  has a great role in the APEC forum.    "Indonesia now chairs the APEC," he said adding that such a  position is making Indonesia and other ASEAN countries important.    He further said that he had also expressed his regret to  President Suharto over the recent banning of three Indonesian  weeklies.    However, he also quoted the Indonesian head of state as  saying that "journalists had put some of these things...  national unity and stability at risk."    The banned press publications are TEMPO, EDITOR, and DETIK  which are all based in Jakarta.    Keating arrived in Jakarta on Monday evening for a two day  unofficial visit during which he will open an  Australia-Indonesia business seminar and attend the Australia  Today Indonesia 1994 held here from June 29 to July 3.</p>

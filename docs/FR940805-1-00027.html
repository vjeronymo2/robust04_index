			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Statement A_Geographic Market <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In Statement A, the Commission is proposing that the oil pipeline describe the geographic markets in which it seeks to make a showing that it lacks significant market power. The oil pipeline would have to explain why its method for selecting the geographic markets is appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission is proposing to require the oil pipeline to include both relevant origin and destination markets in its evidentiary presentation. This will provide interested parties with complete information about competition at the supply and delivery ends of the pipeline system. The Commission is not requiring the oil pipeline to file a market analysis of each point-to-point corridor. In light of the significant point-to-point traffic in the oil pipeline industry, this would be too onerous a requirement at the filing stage. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In addition, a point-to-point corridor analysis may exclude competitive alternatives to the relevant service and, in some instances, it could provide an inaccurate picture of market concentration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A protestant may, as part of its response to the oil pipeline's application, seek to prove that in its circumstances a point-to-point corridor approach should be used to determine the appropriate geographic market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission is not proposing to require a pipeline to file pursuant to any particular geographic market definition. The Commission expects that oil pipelines will propose to use BEAs as their geographic markets. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the past, the Commission itself has used BEAs as the appropriate geographic markets. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  However, as indicated above, Justice stated that it could no longer recommend the use of arbitrary markets such as BEAs because there may not be a high degree of correlation between the size of the relevant markets and BEAs. The burden will be on the oil pipeline to explain why its use of BEAs or any other definition of the geographic market is appropriate. If a pipeline uses BEAs, it must show that each BEA represents an appropriate geographic market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The term BEA refers to United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis Economic Areas. BEAs are geographic regions surrounding major cities that are intended to represent areas of actual economic activity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Buckeye Pipe Line Co., 53 FERC &para; 61,473 (1990). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information provided in the various statements should help the protestants assess whether a particular BEA does in fact represent an appropriate market. Of course, the oil pipeline may choose to define its relevant geographic markets at a sub-BEA level, such as by a given radius around its terminals. As with BEAs, the oil pipeline must explain why this geographic market definition is appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Statement B_Product Market <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In Statement B, the Commission is proposing that the oil pipeline identify the product market or markets for which it seeks to establish that it lacks significant market power. The oil pipeline would have to explain why the particular product definition is appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the ICA, the Commission regulates the transportation of oil by pipeline. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In a market power analysis, the Commission must determine the oil pipeline's ability to exercise market power over this transportation service. However, a market power analysis in general cannot be made solely in the context of transportation rates. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Where competing alternatives constrain the applicant's ability to raise transport prices, the effect of such constraints are ultimately reflected in the price of the commodity being transported. Hence, the delivered commodity price (relevant product price plus transportation charges) generally will be the relevant price to be analyzed for making a comparison of the alternatives to a pipeline's services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 49 U.S.C. 1(1)(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In some instances, such as for origin markets or crude oil pipelines, it may be appropriate to make a case based only on transportation rates. The pipeline may elect to file such a case. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission is not proposing a specific way to define the product markets. The relevant product market first would be distinguished between the transportation of crude oil and the transportation of refined products. Crude oil transportation could further be divided to include transportation of natural gas liquids while products transportation could be delineated by type, such as motor gasoline, distillates, or jet fuel. The oil pipeline should, in the first instance, select its product market. The information provided in the various statements should help the protestants assess whether the oil pipeline's definition of the product market is appropriate. The burden is on the oil pipeline to justify its choice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Statement C_The Oil Pipeline's Facilities and Services <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In Statement C, the Commission is proposing that the oil pipeline describe its own facilities and services in the relevant markets. Statement C would have to include all pertinent data about the pipeline's facilities and services in those markets. For example, without limitation, the oil pipeline would have to include data on the capacity of its facilities, on its throughput, on its receipts in its origin markets, on its deliveries in its destination markets and to its major consuming markets, and the mileage between its terminals and its major consuming markets. Data should be supplied for each commodity carried, such as jet fuel, gasoline, etc. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The people,  however, in cooperation with the National Army of Democratic  Kampuchea [NADK], attacked and dispersed the invading troops to  protect their lives and property. We killed eight enemy  soldiers, wounded more than 10, and captured 16 others,  including a colonel and a Vietnamese soldier. We seized 25  assorted firearms, five sets of field radios, and some war  materiel.    Between 6 and 8 February, the two-headed government attacked  the people and DK with over 300 troops in an area west of Route  56. After three days of fighting, we completely dispersed them.  We killed five invading soldiers, wounded 12 others, and seized  11 assorted firearms and some war materiel.    Leaders of the Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed  government on 29 January forced their soldiers to attack the  people and NADK in the Srah Kev area, Baribo District, Kompong  Chhnang Province. We attacked and completely dispersed them as  they were approaching the area. We killed or wounded 13 enemy  soldiers, destroyed a vehicle loaded with ammunition, and seized  nine AK rifles and some war materiel. We completely control the  area.    Leaders of the Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed  government on 1 February forced their soldiers to attack the  people and NADK at O Krabau and Pel villages in Moung District  of Battambang Province.

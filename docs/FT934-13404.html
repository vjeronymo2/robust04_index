			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Air France strikers face force threat STRIKING Air France workers were warned yesterday by Mr Bernard Bosson, the French transport minister, that the government would use force 'if necessary' to clear them from the runways at the two main Paris airports. Both Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports were yesterday thrown into chaos for the second successive day because of the strike by employees, who are protesting against proposals to cut 4,000 jobs and to reduce overtime pay at the loss-making national airline. Mr Bosson said after leaving a parliamentary session that the situation was 'intolerable' and that the government would act on its threat to clear the runways forcibly 'if it remains impossible for the airlines to operate'. The strike also spread to airports elsewhere in France, with Nice and Marseilles being blocked for part of the day. Both Air France and Aeroports de Paris, which runs the Paris airports, said last night that they could give no indication as to the likely situation today. Air France workers occupied the runways at Orly, the main airport for domestic flights, for most of yesterday morning. The blockade was broken up by police during the afternoon, but the strikers returned in early evening. Squads of riot police moved into Charles de Gaulle airport during the early hours of the morning to stop strikers from occupying the runways and forming picket lines on access roads as they did on Tuesday. Some international airlines, including Germany's Lufthansa, managed to get flights out of Charles de Gaulle. However, hundreds of other international flights and almost all Air France flights were cancelled. Several carriers took passengers by coach to Brussels or Frankfurt, but hundreds of people were left stranded at airport hotels. Mr Bernard Attali, chairman of Air France, called on the unions to start negotiating on a local basis. Central discussions between Air France and the unions were suspended last weekend. Mr Attali also affirmed that, despite the strike, he was still determined to press ahead with his cost- cutting plan.</p>

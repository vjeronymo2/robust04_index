			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / UK Company News: MCC Pounds 15m loan facility A committee of banks has agreed to lend Pounds 15m in new money to Maxwell Communication Corporation. The banks are seeking security against Macmillan Inc, MCC's main US asset. Mr Jonathan Phillips, one of MCC's administrators, said that terms for the short-term facility had been broadly agreed and it was hoped that it could be drawn upon later this week. The agreement needs the consent from the US courts.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Kohei Murayama] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 3 KYODO -- The Ministry of Finance  faced renewed political pressure Thursday [3 February] after the  government earlier announced a new tax plan that complies with  the ministry's strong demand to guarantee funding for income tax  cuts.    Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii made light of the issue in  his meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Mickey Kantor, quipping  that "the political weather is bad."    But the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [of Japan -- SDPJ] --  the largest party in the ruling coalition -- continued to demand  revision of the tax plan, which was announced in the early hours  of the same day by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa without SDP  approval.    An SDP official said the party will quit the coalition  unless  there are changes in the timing and scope of a new welfare tax  intended to pay for a cut in income tax.    Hosokawa was quoted by one of his ministers as saying that  he  may change his decision in line with a compromise reached at a  meeting later of coalition party leaders.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura also told a  regular morning press meeting that the government is ready to  revise the plan. A revision, if made, would be a reversal for  the Finance Ministry, which had won its call for the offsetting  tax in the face of strong opposition from the SDP.    The plan calls for tax cuts of 6 trillion yen, including 5.3  trillion yen in national income tax and local resident's tax, to  be paid for by a 7 percent national welfare tax on goods and  services from April 1997 in place of the current 3 percent  consumption tax.    In a last-ditch effort to end the continuing row, which  appeared likely to delay the announcement of an economic  stimulus package due out in the evening, some SDP leaders  visited Finance Minister Fujii, but both sides declined to  comment on the meeting.    Meanwhile, the ministry issued a detailed report explaining  the financial justification for the 7 percent rate of the  welfare tax.    The report appeared intended to clarify Fujii's press  remarks  shortly after the government decision early Thursday in which he  denied there would be any net tax increases.    The new tax is expected to generate revenues of some 9.5  trillion yen a year, while the tax cuts total only 6 trillion  yen, the ministry said.    As for the net 3.5 trillion in net revenues, it cited some  800 billion yen in additional welfare spending, about 1.3  trillion yen in tax burdens from the new tax on government  purchases of goods and services, and repayment of principal of  some 1.4 trillion yen for short-term government bonds.    The government needs to issue about 18 billion yen worth of  "bridge" bonds to cover the three-year period before  implementation of the new tax, and principal repayments will  take over 10 years. The repayment period would be longer when  including interest, the report said.    In his press remarks, Fujii vowed his utmost efforts to win  public support and stressed that revenues would be for social  welfare.    Unlike the consumption tax, the new tax would be introduced  by a law defining it as "a politically objective tax," Fujii  said.</p>

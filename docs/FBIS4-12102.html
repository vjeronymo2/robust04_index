			<p>BFN     [Text] Jerusalem, QUDS PRESS -- With the imminent  establishment of Palestinian self-administration and the  expected arrival of senior Fatah officials to Gaza and Jericho,  site of this administration, Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement]  has called for the election of a Palestinian national leadership  in the occupied territories.    In a statement, Hamas called on all national forces and  groups to meet and formulate a national program on the basis of  the Israeli Army's full withdrawal, the removal of settlements,  and the election of a national leadership that safeguards the  right of the Palestinian people to obtaining their rights and to  self-determination.    The statement proclaimed Hamas' rejection of the principle  of  reinstating former mayors instead of the current ones, some of  whom were appointed by the Israeli authorities. It called for  adopting the method of elections as the only means for choosing  leading officials in municipalities, institutions, trade unions,  and all popular bodies.    Hamas, which is resolutely opposed to holding talks with the  Israelis, described the deployment of international observers in  Hebron, expected to take place within a week, as a symbolic  measure that seeks to justify the resumption of talks between  Israel and the PLO.    The statement called on all Arab countries to exert pressure  on the United States in the wake of its recent stance on  Jerusalem, so that the Clinton administration would back down  from this stance and declare that, in accordance with  international law, the Palestinian territories are occupied.  The statement urged the Arabs to adhere to the economic boycott  of Israel and refuse to normalize relations with it.</p>

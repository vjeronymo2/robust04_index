			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Malaysia hints at end to UK ban Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, has hinted that his government might consider lifting its ban on offering government contracts to British compan ies. The ban was imposed in late February, in retaliation for a report in the Sunday Times newspaper in London which alleged that a British company had been involved in negotiations to offer Dr Mahathir bribes in exchange for a contract. Dr Mahathir said that now that Mr Andrew Neil, the Sunday Times editor, had been transferred to a new post, British media reports on Malaysia might improve. 'If we find that the British media reports the truth and no longer prints lies, there is no reason why we cannot resume business,' Dr Mahathir told Malaysia's national news agency Bernama. Mr Neil, who is taking up a temporary post in New York, told Reuters that he was delighted if his move was to be used as an excuse by Dr Mahathir to end what he described as the 'absurd embargo' against British companies. Mr Richard Needham, UK trade minister, is due to visit Malaysia next month.</p>

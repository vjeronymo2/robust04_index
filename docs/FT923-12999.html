			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Industrial upturn reported in north SALES and orders rose significantly in the second quarter of this year for companies in the north of England, boosting confidence in business prospects and pointing the way out of recession, according to the latest Business Survey North issued yesterday. The second-quarter improvement in most indicators suggests that companies in north-east England and Cumbria are recovering 'slowly but steadily' from recession, says the report. In contrast to the previous survey, manufacturers performed better than service companies. The survey, carried out by the Northern Development Company and Tyne and Wear and Teesside chambers of commerce, was based on responses from 756 companies in the region. It shows 33.5 per cent of companies predicting an improvement in business conditions in the third quarter and just 9 per cent a decline; 59.8 per cent of companies expected increased turnover in the next 12 months and 53.5 per cent higher profits. UK sales in the second quarter rose substantially and export sales, although remaining below last year's average, rallied from their first quarter setback. Investment in plant, machinery and buildings remained 'modest', says the report.</p>

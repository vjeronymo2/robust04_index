In the August 6 order, the Commission specifically provided that Transwestern would be permitted to propose ``a prospective charge to recover these costs from its current open access transportation customers.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transwestern requested rehearing of the August 6 order and, in addition, filed motions requesting additional time with which to comply with the requirements of the August 6 order, which extensions were granted by the Commission. On March 25, 1994, the Commission issued its ``Order Denying Rehearing,'' directing Transwestern to comply with the requirements of the August 6 order and reiterated that Transwestern could file to recover the disallowed costs through a mechanism that does not constitute a surcharge to its ``former sales customers based upon their past sales contract demand'' (``March 25 order''). Accordingly and without waiving its rights to file an alternate rate mechanism to recover the disallowed costs, Transwestern is filing a revised tariff sheet in compliance with the August 6 and March 25 orders. The only changes Transwestern is proposing in Sheet No. 5M are to adjust the direct bill amounts in accordance with such orders and to explain in footnote one that section 24, ``Gas Supply Inventory Charge'', has been canceled. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transwestern requested any waiver of any Commission Regulation and its tariff provisions as may be required to allow the tariff sheet referenced above to become effective on April 25, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transwestern states that copies of the filing were served on its gas utility customers, interested state commissions, and all parties to this proceeding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such protests should be filed on or before May 5, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

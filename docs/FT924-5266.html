			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Newspaper Publishing in profit NEWSPAPER Publishing, owner of The Independent and the Independent on Sunday has turned a Pounds 10m loss in 1991 into a pre-tax profit of Pounds 28,000 in the year to September. Sir Ralph Dahrendorf, chairman, said yesterday: 'The bottom line is one of satisfactory progress both in commercial terms and in reputation.' The newspaper group's position improved despite the depth of the recession because of a number of factors. Revenues increased from Pounds 79m to Pounds 81.8m and there was an operating profit of Pounds 358,000 (Pounds 6.58m loss). The main factors here were savings in newsprint costs and lower overheads following the integration of the the two titles. Exceptional costs this year were only Pounds 138,000, against Pounds 1.9m before which was mainly attributable to redundancy costs. Because of an Pounds 8m refinancing which allowed all bank borrowings to be paid off, interest charges this year fell to Pounds 461,000 (Pounds 1.88m) The company now has about Pounds 1m in the bank.</p>

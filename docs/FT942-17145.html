			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Survey of Business in Dorset (8): Help for employers - Business development The 'one-stop shop' has arrived in Dorset. Local business leaders are delighted that they have succeeded in winning trade and industry department funds for the initiative, which aims to streamline all business development services for companies into one operation. Dorset is the only successful applicant in southern England outside London. But the business leaders also accept that the plan must have some success - and swiftly - because the county's economy is in poor health. Funded initially by government grants, its aim is to provide all the various services for businesses which are currently offered by competing bodies - including the county council, the Training and Enterprise Council (Tec), the Enterprise Agency and the chamber of commerce - under one roof. The idea is that employers should quickly find their way to the precise assistance they need. This, it is hoped, will help Dorset's more troubled employers, such as the defence sub-contractors. Meanwhile, the Dorset Business Link will also attempt a sophisticated exercise in 'picking winners'. 'Growth ready' companies - small companies with good prospects of expansion  -will be targeted by the Business Link's advisers for 'a high-level process of diagnosis and support'. Four personal business advisers have been appointed from backgrounds in the civil service with the Department of Employment, and in management of small and medium-sized companies. According to Mr John Morrison, chief executive of Dorset Tec, the service will ensure 'that firms get the answers they need promptly, as a result of a single local-rate phone call whether it's a question of marketing, finance, export services, planning, health and safety, or any one of the numerous other business issues they need help with'. The Business Link will also attempt to identify export opportunities in Europe, following on the work of the old Enterprise Agency, and will also guide employers to the local training centres - for example, for helping sales representatives with foreign languages. Tecs were invited to lead the bid, and Dorset Tec did so,boosted by government league tables which placed it first out of the 75 Tecs now established, appearing in the top 25 per cent for six out of seven of the criteria covered, including cost-effectiveness and quality of provision for Youth Training and Employment Training, the scheme for unemployed adults. It was also highly ranked for the number of Dorset companies committed to Investors in People, a scheme to improve the training of people in work. Weymouth College was the first college in the country to attain the distinction, while Frizzells, the biggest employer in Bournemouth and Poole, was among the first companies to do so. Despite this strong performance, some local employers still complain about whether or not the Tec provides genuinely useful services. Mrs Beryl Kite, chief executive of the Dorset chamber of commerce and industry, and acting chief executive of the new Business Link, claims that if the one-stop shop does not work in Dorset, 'it's not going to work anywhere'. Dorset's comparative remoteness from other business centres has helped. The county is more compact than some rural areas, most of its businesses are pressed into one conurbation, and all the local agencies share the same boundaries. This gave Dorset a head-start over metropolitan areas which included institutional disputes between several Tecs or unitary authorities, or where more employers' organisations were clamouring for attention, according to Mrs Kite. But there is alarm among businesses about the local government reorganisation. If it goes ahead - and the new structure should be implemented in 1996 if the government persists with its plans - then Bournemouth and Poole councillors want to create two separate unitary authorities for the conurbation. Ancient rivalries, caused by the fact that Bournemouth was in Hampshire until the last reorganisation in 1974, lie behind the councillors' position, which infuriates local businesses. One employer fumed: 'Christchurch, Bournemouth and Poole look like one conurbation from the air and they feel like one when you drive through them. From my point of view, services I need come from those three areas and they need co-ordination. I can't see why we need more than one council.' While the entire conurbation is currently served by the county council, there would be no authority with overall control of planning if the plans were carried out. If reorganisation goes ahead it looks unlikely to help developing businesses in the area. But Mrs Kite remains positive: 'Unless they actually change the county boundary, we'll still be serving the same area, no matter how they choose to rename it.'</p>

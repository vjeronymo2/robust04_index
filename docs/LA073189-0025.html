			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The supporters and opponents of Folsom's slow-growth initiative agree that the  city needs a second traffic bridge over the American River. But they cannot  agree where the bridge should be built. And the two sides are far apart in  their interpretation of what Measure N, to be on the ballot Aug. 22, says about  a second bridge for Folsom. Proponents said the initiative requires the city to  study the possibility of building the bridge just below Folsom Dam. A "yes"  vote also will prohibit the building of a bridge over Oak Avenue Parkway or  other areas leading into residential streets. Opponents say the measure is  confusing. Some believe that it mandates a bridge below the dam while others  say the language in the initiative is so unclear that lawyers will be working  overtime to interpret it.  </P></p>

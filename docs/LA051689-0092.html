			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> MEXICO TO ALLOW 100% FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN SOME INDUSTRIES  </P> <P> Mexico will unveil a revamped law this week that allows foreign investors to  buy into the tourist industry and drops other restrictions in some areas, the  government newspaper El Nacional has reported.  </P> <P> The new regulations, which are to take effect today, replace the 1973 Foreign  Investment Law that set a 49% limit on non-Mexican capital participation in  most areas of the economy, the paper said Sunday.  </P> <P> The law, which has long been considered outmoded and a drag on economic growth,  has increasingly been waived in recent years.  </P> <P> The new law will permit 100% foreign investment in tourism, in-bond industries,  or maquiladoras, and some forms of transportation, El Nacional said.  </P> <P> It added, however, that only Mexican capital investment will be allowed in  radio and television, retail banking, forestry, basic petrochemicals and oil  exploration.  </P> <P> A 49% limit on foreign capital would be enforced in the secondary petrochemical  industry, most mining ventures and the fishing industry, El Nacional said.  </P> <P> The old law placed a 100% ban on foreign investment in all sectors of the  country's key petrochemical industry.  </P></p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / US and EC in last-ditch trade talks THE European Community and the US are to make a final effort to resolve their farm trade disputes at a top-level meeting in Chicago tomorrow and Monday. The meeting, between Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, and Mr Ed Madigan, his US counterpart, is seen on both sides as the last chance to avert a trade war, and salvage hopes for wide-ranging trade liberalisation under the Uruguay Round, which has been held up for two years by the food exports row. In the US, a trade official said there was little optimism that the new talks would provide a breakthrough. They agreed to meet after Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister and current president of the EC, urged President George Bush to make one last try for a settlement before the US presidential election. By Monday night, the eve of the US election, the US and EC will either have resolved small outstanding differences on EC oilseeds output and wheat exports, and US exports of cheap cereals substitutes, or Washington will probably go ahead with punitive tariffs on EC farm products - a move that would almost certainly trigger retaliation. Mr Bush has been keen to get an agriculture agreement before the election, according to an aide, because he will find it difficult to continue negotiations if he loses the election. Senior EC officials think a deal can be done, but are suspicious of US timing. They say any agreement will be very finely balanced, and will fall short of the demands of the powerful US farm lobbies. This week, the US relented in efforts to hold the EC to maximum oilseeds output of 9m tonnes, compared with 11.4m tonnes now, offering to accept the ceiling implicit in the Community's reformed Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of 9.5m tonnes. But it wants binding guarantees. Mr MacSharry is willing to carry into an international agreement the enforcement mechanisms of the CAP reform, but refuses to move outside the CAP framework. The two sides appear to have agreed to cut subsidised food exports volume by 21 per cent, compared with 24 per cent under the Uruguay Round. France has been opposing a Gatt deal because it claims this provision will batter its lucrative wheat exports. The EC wants a commitment from the US that its exports of corn-gluten - a feedstock substitute cheap enough to undercut almost any cereals price - will not undermine the CAP reform, which cuts cereals prices by about a third to near world market price.</p>

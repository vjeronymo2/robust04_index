			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: I have them all taped HAVE YOU read the 'Camillagate' tapes, which are said to be of a conversation between Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles? Do not bother. They are juvenile and banal. Instead, let me offer you a fragment of a tape I made on Thursday, all above board, of a four-way tele-conference I arranged between the Queen, the prime minister, Lord King of Wartnaby (the chairman of British Airways), and Hawks &amp; Handsaws. I think you will find it instructive, for it shows how Britain is run. Hawks &amp; Handsaws: I think, first, we might address Elizabeth's concerns about the spring Budget. Elizabeth II: Thankyou, Michael. As you know, Mr Major, I am soon to start paying tax on a portion, yet to be announced, of my income. I shall sign the cheques quite happily, safe in the knowledge that you and my other ministers need money for motorways, airports, hospitals - all manner of good works. What worries me are these reports that you and Mr Lamont are considering raising income tax. To have to start paying income tax is bad luck enough; to have the rate hoisted peremptorily, far above one's head, would be enormously horrendous. John Major: Let me assure you, your majesty, with promptitude and alacrity, that the government will not be raising income tax in this Budget or any other. As you know, the chancellor is an odd-ball - an entertaining fellow, good at party conferences, but headstrong and flamboyant. I shall announce his new post four weeks after the Budget. On the other hand, a considerable sum of money has got to be found, so find it I shall. The Budget will reveal subtle ways for rehabilitating the public exchequer. Elizabeth II: I trust, Mr Major, that you are not going to commence phasing out mortgage interest tax relief. I am in the process of mortgaging several of my palaces. And then there is VAT. Until recently, I was oblivious of its existence, but I am informed by my racing manager that I shall be liable to grotesque amounts of VAT on my bloodstock transactions. John Major: Have no fear, your majesty. The pernicious amount of VAT on UK bloodstock is something which the Treasury is struggling to resolve. In the meantime, I believe Michael wishes to broach a scheme for rehabilitating the royal finances and recapturing the love and affection which formerly marked your reign. Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Yah, right. It is a deeply ingenious scheme, but it will need a big sponsor. That is why I asked Lord King to join our tele-conference. The reason, Elizabeth, for your loss of popularity has little to do with your children and much to do with the government. It is weary, worn and wracked. People are fed up, so they are directing their ire at the symbols of authority. What the monarchy needs is a PR coup. It is time you won the Derby. You have hundreds of racehorses, but they are all notoriously slow. I have had a word with Henryk de Kwiatkowski, America's leading owner - you met him in Kentucky - who will lease you a racehorse to run in the Derby. He owns an unraced firebrand that cannot be overtaken and is sure to last the Derby's 1 1/2 miles. Henryk will fly it to Britain. It will race in your colours. Victory is assured. The populace will be delirious. What is more, you can win millions off the bookies. They know nothing of this horse. Elizabeth II: How remarkably super. Mummy will be delighted. John Major: A quite considerable brainwave. Hawks &amp; Handsaws: But we need a generous sponsor. I want this sponsor to put up a special Derby prize of Pounds 25m - sufficient, Elizabeth, to cover some of your income tax - plus extra funds to pay for a free day out on Epsom Downs for up to 3m people. There'll be bands, food, Champagne - a day of national reconciliation topped by royal victory in the Derby. Naturally, British Airways came to mind. The fiasco of its dirty tricks campaign against Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic will not be forgotten until BA spends titanic sums on positive PR. Lord King: You are right. I used to tell people that the way I ran my airline was through fear. But fear is not enough. My lesson was painfully learned. I am ready to atone. Pounds 25m is not a lot of money. You have an old head on young shoulders. I should like to buy you dinner. Are you free tomorrow? After this the tape gets really interesting, but also a little saucy. A full version will appear in the Sydney Morning Herald on Monday.</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metals prices drop again after poor economic data WIDESPREAD gloom about worldwide economic activity took its toll at the London Metal Exchange yesterday. Prices, which all finished last week lower than they started, again fell across the board. The situation was aggravated by the Chinese, who previously this year emerged as big buyers and helped to support prices. Yesterday they changed tactics, selling copper and aluminium, the LME's most heavily-traded metals. Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group, said metals had been 'whiplashed by a torrent of poor economic data' from the US, Japan and by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development which said gross domestic product growth in member countries would not exceed 1.5 per cent this year when it predicted 2.2 per cent growth at the beginning of 1992. 'The past week is one in which the metal markets realised that metal demand growth was not going to ride to the rescue,' he added. 'The onus is back squarely on metal producers. The choice is simple - cut back refined metal output or spend another year in purgatory.' According to Ms Lesley Campbell, trader at Rudolf Wolff, part of the Noranda natural resources group, there have been occasions in the past year when big players in the LME's copper, aluminium and zinc markets provided price support - 'more than the fundamentals have justified.' She added: 'Too many blind eyes have been turned away from the fundamentals for too long.' Zinc, which has been buoyed by an options-related technical squeeze for much of this year, showed the biggest fall yesterday. Zinc for delivery in three months was down nearly 3.5 per cent from Friday's close or by Dollars 44 a tonne to Dollars 1,243.50. At one point on the LME yesterday nickel for delivery in three months fell to Dollars 6,630, its lowest level since February 1990, nearly Dollars 1,100 below the best price this summer and only marginally above Dollars 3 a lb - a level which holds tremendous psychological importance for the producers and for market sentiment. The price recovered slightly later to close at Dollars 6,640 a tonne, down Dollars 110 or 1.6 per cent on Friday's close.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Not Quite the Dream Team] </F>   [Text] A mixed bag -- that's our verdict on the new  cabinet. There are some excellent appointments; some truly  appalling; and many that are just mediocre.    That makes it better than any cabinet this country has seen  before, but leaves us disappointed that Nelson Mandela has not  made the fullest and best use of the large amount of talent  available to him. And there are some choices that are  horrifyingly inappropriate.    The real shock must be the absence of Cyril Ramaphosa.  Mandela has blundered badly by not finding or creating the  right post to make full use of Ramaphosa's talents and  experience in the cabinet.    Notable cabinet selections are:    -- Dullah Omar, justice: A sensible choice, he has extensive  court experience as both a lawyer and attorney. He will now be  in charge of those judges that refused to release him from  detention without trial in a notorious 1980s test case.    -- Joe Slovo, housing: An inspired use of a practical man  with the radical credibility to deal with the huge demands this  ministry will face.    -- Dr Nkosozana Zuma, health: A sound decision. Health  workers say she has experience and a good grasp of health  policy, even though her public image is poor.    -- Joe Modise, defence: The SADF generals may be happy to  have a hawk with a tarnished reputation (for his failure to stop  torture in exile camps), but anyone associated with Umkhonto we  Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] when he led it  will tell you how poor a choice he is.    -- Sidney Mufamadi, safety and security: An interesting  choice, he has been groomed for the post.    -- Dr Sibusiso Bhengu, education: An unexpected minister.  He has had no involvement in any of the extensive policy and  planning work in this field. As rector of Fort Hare, he had to  leave after falling foul of an internal student conflict.  Mandela probably had in mind that as a Zulu and a former IFP  general secretary, he would help balance the cabinet.    -- Alfred Nzo in foreign affairs is a surprise. There cannot  be a less appropriate choice for such a critical post as this  dour and ineffectual man who was ousted as ANC general secretary.    -- Pallo Jordan, posts, telecommunications and broadcasting:  The natural choice.    -- Mac Maharaj, transport: Has been given a surprisingly  junior post, but at least his talents are in the cabinet.    -- Roelf Meyer, a Nat [National Party] that Mandela can  trust, is a brilliant choice for provincial and constitutional  affairs.    -- Derek Hanekom, land: Will be a relief to anyone concerned  with this issue. He has earned respect for his involvement in  it in recent years, but will face a tough task in his forced  partnership with Kraai van Niekerk, who holds the post of  agricultural minister.    -- Stella Sigcau can only have been chosen for public  enterprises because she is a traditional leader and one of the  few women with cabinet experience, albeit in a homeland where  she was ousted amid corruption charges by Bantu Holomisa, now a  deputy minister.    -- Derek Keys is a wise compromise in finance, particularly  as he is fenced in by the formidable trio of Trevor Manuel in  trade and industry, Jay Naidoo in reconstruction and Alec Erwin  as deputy finance minister.    -- Steve Tshwete was a natural choice for sport.    -- If Mangosuthu Buthelezi had to have a senior post, home  affairs is fairly neutral, though it means he will run future  elections.    It is extraordinary that so important a reconstruction  portfolio as welfare should be in the hands of a Nat with a  dubious reputation, Abe Williams.    -- Artists must be horrified at falling into the combined  hands of the IFP's Ben Ngubane, minister of arts, culture,  science and technology, and deputy minister Winnie Mandela.  They will find themselves caught between a Zulu nationalist and  a woman still under investigation for alleged corruption in the  ANC department of welfare. What a disappointment in the very  week when the president inauguration celebrations, a brilliant  choreographed display of all- inclusive multiculturism, showed  us the power of cultures as a benign, unifying national force.    Some of the more controversial appointments are off-set by  strong deputy ministerships, such as Valli Moosa in provincial  affairs, Aziz Pahad in foreign affairs, and Penuell Manduna in  home affairs. Others -- such as education and welfare -- will  depend on strong appointments to the key posts of  directors-general.    Mandela did reasonably well in negotiating a political,  racial, and geographic balance, but made little attempt to  achieve a gender balance.    He has assembled a team with some strengths, but too many  weaknesses. The pity is that it could have been a dream team.</p>

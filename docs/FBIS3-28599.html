Public opinion varied regarding  the appropriate timing for the elections, as over 30 percent  each supported "as soon as possible after this fall" and "one or  two years later." When asked which parties the respondents  would like to vote for in the next elections, the LDP won 25  percent support for single-seat constituencies, and 26 percent  for proportional representation constituencies. While the LDP  held the top positions in both constituencies, its popularity  declined by 6 percent from the previous survey held in June 1993  on the eve of the latest general elections. As the result, our  latest survey revealed the decline of the LDP and Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ].    On a multiple choice question on top priority issues, the  second largest group of 46 percent said "anti-corruption  measures" is the most important task after the political reform  debates, although 68 percent indicated economic issues such as  "the yen rate appreciation, recession, and inflation" are more  important. It appeared the public strongly believe political  reform efforts must not be concluded with the enactment of the  new election system.    Regarding the appropriate timing for the next general  elections, 33 percent said "as soon as possible after this fall  (when new election constituencies are prepared)," 32 percent  said "one or two years later," and 22 percent said "elections  are not needed until the terms of lower house members expire."  The respondents' attitudes widely varied on the question.    The YOMIURI questionnaire then asked which parties the  respondents would like to vote for in the next general  elections. For single-seat constituencies, the support rates for  the LDP, the Japan New Party [JNP], Shinseito, and the SDPJ were  25, 18, 10, and 8 percent respectively. Both Sakigake and  Komeito obtained support of 4 percent, and the Japan Communist  Party [JCP] and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] obtained  support of 2 percent. The support rates for proportional  representation constituencies were 26 percent for the LDP, 19  percent for the JNP, 10 percent for Shinseito, 9 percent for the  SDPJ, 4 percent for Komeito, 3 percent for Sakigake, and 2  percent for the JCP and the DSP. In the June 1993 survey, the  rates were 31 percent for the LDP, 15 percent for the SDPJ, and  12 percent for the JNP; however, these figures should be  compared with those in the latest survey because Shinseito and  Sakigake were organized after the previous survey.</p>

			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Queens Moat in talks with banks on roll-over terms Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group discussing a Pounds 1.3bn refinancing plan with its bankers, is in talks to extend its standstill agreement which expires on Monday. It has also appointed two non-executive directors. The group has been without any non-executives since Mr David Howell and Mr John Gale resigned last November. The roll-over of the standstill is unlikely to be opposed by the banks. However, there is some debate over the length of the extension. The banks may prefer monthly roll-overs of the standstill, while the company would like an extension to the end of April, by which time it expects to have the accounts for 1993 finalised and given to creditors and shareholders. Neither group can be expected to vote on restructuring proposals until they have seen the trading results for 1993 and the year-end balance sheet - which will incorporate a property revaluation. The men just appointed - Mr Michael Beckett and Mr Richard Jewson - will sit on the remuneration and audit committees and attend two board meetings a month as well as being available when needed. They will each receive an annual fee of Pounds 27,500, but will not have other incentive arrangements. Mr Beckett, 57, is known as a troubleshooter and a 'very independent' non-executive. He was a managing director of Consolidated Goldfields when it was taken over by Hanson in 1989. He has also been chairman of Ultramar, the oil group, and a non-executive director of Ranks Hovis McDougall. At RHM he worked with Stanley Metcalfe, who is now chairman of QMH, although he is understood to have been short-listed for a directorship before Mr Metcalfe joined the company. He is also chairman of Horace Clarkson, Watts Blake Bearne, Monarch Resources and a director of BPB Industries. Mr Jewson, 49, was chairman and chief executive of Meyer International, the timber group, until it was decided to split the roles and his chairmanship ended last month. He is also a non-executive director of Anglian Water and the Eastern Counties Newspaper group.</p>

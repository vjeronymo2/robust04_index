			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / TSB launches code for small businesses TSB, BRITAIN'S sixth-largest bank, is to announce details of its banking code for small-business customers on Monday. Included in the code of practice are commitments to notify customers in advance of changes to quarterly banking charges, and to publish its basic framework of tariffs for the larger of its small-business customers. TSB is the fifth bank to unveil a business-banking code after strong criticism of lenders last summer for their alleged poor treatment of small-business customers. The code also applies to its Hill Samuel merchant bank subsidiary. The bank was not one of those called in to see Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to explain their actions last summer. However, it has decided to follow the big four high street banks - Barclays, Lloyds, NatWest and Midland - in publishing a code to emphasise its role as a provider of finance to business. A brochure outlining the code of practice will be available from TSB branches from January 6. The code promises fair terms and conditions in contracts with customers. Contracts will be written in plain language. The bank will give reasonable notice of any changes in contract terms. Advance notification of charges will be introduced later in the year after computer modifications. TSB will also ask customers who negotiate an overdraft or loan to sign and return a letter acknowledging acceptance of the terms and conditions. It believes this will bring home to customers the obligations they are entering into. As well as providing customers with details of its fixed business tariffs, which currently apply to companies with a turnover of up to Pounds 250,000, the bank will publicise its tariffs applying to larger businesses. These tariffs remain negotiable, but TSB said the publishing of basic rates would give customers a basis for negotiation instead of dealing in the dark.</p>

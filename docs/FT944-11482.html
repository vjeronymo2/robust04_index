			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Finance and the Family: 'Tax free' can trap you - Scheherazade Daneshkhu finds that savers can lose out Marketing experts have long used sex to promote their products. In the world of investments, the words 'tax free' have something of the same pull. But investors should beware of buying something simply because it carries that tag. Take basic-rate taxpayers who buy a personal equity plan solely because it will save them tax. They are likely to find that the savings take many years to arrive because of the provider's costs in running the Pep. Ian Hughes, a freight and distribution consultant, is wary of investments billed this way. He was sold a 10-year friendly society policy by his financial adviser who told him it offered 'unique' tax-free advantages that would bring higher returns than other 10-year investments. Friendly societies run tax-exempt 10-year savings plans where interest rolls up gross of tax. In return for tax exemption, the maximum contribution into these policies is capped by the government at Pounds 200 a year, or Pounds 18 a month. Hughes was told that his Pounds 9-a-month policy from Family Assurance friendly society, amounting to a total investment of Pounds 1,080 over the full term, would have a likely maturity value of Pounds 2,611. But when the plan reached maturity at the beginning of October, it delivered Pounds 1,222. As the table (by Micropal) shows, the plan did not keep up with inflation or with a building society account. Hughes will not have to pay tax on his matured lump sum, but that is not much comfort, since the building society figure is shown after deduction of basic-rate tax. The table also shows that the average friendly society returned Pounds 1,900 over the same period, beating Micropal's unit, investment trust and insurance fund indices. Family Assurance's Growth Fund performance is lower than the average for friendly societies but it is better than the figure for the insurance funds sector. Barry Chambers, marketing director at Family Assurance, argues that it is not fair to compare the performance of the fund - which has just under Pounds 30m - with the other, far smaller funds in the friendly society sector where the next largest has just under Pounds 1m under management. But Hughes received much less on his policy. This is because the figures in the table do not take charges into account, and it is here that friendly societies fall down despite their tax advantages. For one thing, the annual charge is high: Family Assurance charges 1.95 per cent. Chambers admitted Hughes did not get a good return. 'The reason for that is the impact of charges,' he said. 'Although they were comparatively low in monetary terms, as a percentage of premium - Pounds 9 a month - they were high.' Fixed costs do eat away a higher proportion of a low-premium investment than others, but there are some tax-free policies which offer good returns at no charge. Small savers can earn up to 8.62 per cent a year tax free through the government's save-as-you-earn (Saye) scheme. This is a five-year plan with a minimum monthly saving of Pounds 1 a month and a maximum of only Pounds 20, or Pounds 1,200 maximum. The bonus, paid at the end of five years, is equivalent to an annual return of 8.3 per cent. If the money is left for another two years, it is 8.62 per cent. These figures gross up to 13.8 and 14.4 per cent for a higher-rate taxpayer, or 11.1 and 11.5 per cent for someone paying the lower rate. Early withdrawals are allowed but no interest is paid if a withdrawal is made in the first year; the rate is 6 per cent thereafter. You can have only one Saye contract at a time. Abbey National, Alliance &amp; Leicester, Bradford &amp; Bingley, Bristol &amp; West, Britannia and Halifax are among those offering the scheme.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        How does it compare?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                    Value after Investment                      10 yrs, Pounds  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Av friendly society                      1,901 UK gen investm trust                     1,884 UK bal unit trust                        1,865 Family Growth                            1,668 Life insurance fund                      1,654 UK retail price index                    1,358 Building society*                        1,279 Hughes' policy                           1,222  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The table shows the value at October 1 1994 of Pounds9 a month invested since October 3 1984.

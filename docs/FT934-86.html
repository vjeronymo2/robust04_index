			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / British Rail plans new services British Rail yesterday announced plans for new passenger services and shorter journey times for its summer 1994 timetable, the last it will control before privatisation begins next year. The improvements include new direct services from Manchester Airport to Glasgow and Edinburgh. Cardiff will be linked via Bristol to London Waterloo to connect with Channel tunnel services. New services will include Maidstone to Gatwick Airport, and West Worthing to Eastbourne via Brighton. BR says it hopes to provide more trains on popular routes, and to open more than 10 new stations.</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Brazil fails to sell petrochemical stake Brazil's 1994 privatisation campaign started slowly yesterday when an auction of shares in petrochemical company Petroqumica Uniao (PQU) failed to attract enough buyers. The auction, which had already been delayed five times and cancelled once, will be extended to today to try and meet the government's requirement that 75 per cent of the shares on offer be subscribed. Yesterday, bids were received for only 64 per cent. According to some observers, the poor response was a ruse by interested bidders - mainly PQU's customers - to keep the price at the government's minimum accepted level. Fiercer competition would have pushed the price upwards from the minimum of Dollars 330m. The two main bidders yesterday were consortia involving PQU customers, including Shell, petrol distributor Ipiranga, and Union Carbide. The bidders have until mid-afternoon today to raise their bids to the necessary level. PQU is 68 per cent-owned by a subsidiary of Petrobras, the government-controlled oil monopoly. If today's auction is completed, this stake will fall to 20 per cent, while employees will take a 10 per cent holding.</p>

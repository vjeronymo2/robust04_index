			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: SAS emerges from the red Scandinavian Airlines System emerged from a long period of losses yesterday to report a pre-tax profit of SKr617m (Dollars 79.1m) in the first six months of the year, against a deficit of SKr609m in the first half of 1993. The jointly-run Danish, Norwegian and Swedish airline confirmed an earlier forecast that it would make its first full-year profit for five years this year, in spite of heavy restructuring costs and a change in its accounting of depreciation charges. Sales rose only modestly, to SKr19.28bn from SKr18.95bn, but operating income in the first half swung from a loss of SKr145m last time to a surplus of SKr615m. A 12 per cent increase in air traffic revenues, and lower operating costs, offset a SKr311m increase in depreciation charges and restructuring costs of SKr274m. The pre-tax result also benefited from a net exchange rate gain of SKr130m - after a SKr425m loss last year - and a capital gain of SKr374m from the sale in May of SAS Leisure, the tour operator, to Airtours of the UK. The SAS Leisure sale was part of a radical restructuring to cut almost 3,000 jobs and SKr3bn in costs. It was undertaken following the collapse last year of the Alcazar project, an ambitious plan to merge SAS with Swissair, Austrian Airways and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. SAS said it also completed the sale on August 1 of SAS Service Partner, its catering division, to Gate Gourmet International, Swissair's catering division, for a capital gain of SKr270m. It is also selling Diners Club Nordic, a credit card operation, to Sweden's Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken for a capital gain of up to SKr200m. That sale will be completed in the third quarter. At the halfway stage, net debt had been reduced by SKr3.9bn to SKr9.95bn.</p>

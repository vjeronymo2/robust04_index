			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Imigran talk hits Glaxo Pharmaceuticals group Glaxo failed to benefit from yesterday's market rally as a letter in one medical journal over one of its key drugs lowered the temperature. The Lancet letter related to Imigran, the anti-migraine treatment. It examined data that had been discussed before and did little more than continue an academic debate. But it came at a time when the leading pharmaceuticals companies are awaiting approval for some of their products in the US - the Food and Drug Administration tends to try and clear its books at the end of the year. Glaxo could win long-awaited approval for an oral version of Imigran. The shares were off 10 at worst, but there was reassurance from some more seasoned analysts, combined with news of a senior company appointment, that aided sentiment - Glaxo said it had appointed Dr James Niedel as its global research and development director. An additional boost from US buying late in the afternoon helped the stock to finish only 3 lower on the day at 626p. Turnover reached a heavy 13m shares.</p>

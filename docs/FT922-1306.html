			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Debate may foil Tory Euro-sceptics MR JOHN MAJOR may directly confront his critics in the Conservative party by holding a full-scale Commons debate on Britain's priorities for its presidency of the European Community. Senior ministers said the prime minister was considering a debate before parliament begins its summer recess next month. The suggestion came amid indications that European enthusiasts in the cabinet have decided to move on to the offensive against the Euro-sceptics in the Tory party who are opposing the Maastricht accords on European Union. Mr Major, who will tonight hold talks in Downing Street with Mr Jacques Delors on his plans for the presidency, has made clear that the legislation to ratify Maastricht will not return to the Commons until the late autumn. But ministers said that he might seek to isolate the Euro-sceptics by calling a more general debate before the recess. The debate would be framed so as to prevent either Labour or rebels in his own party from forcing a substantial vote while rallying support for the government's position. Mr Major has put enlargement of the Community, the completion of the single market and tight controls on spending at the centre of his agenda for the next six months. In a speech last night Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, fired the first shots in what colleagues said would be a determined campaign by the ministerial enthusiasts for European integration. Mr Hunt, whose speech was approved in advance by Downing Street, called on Conservatives to embrace a 'bold vision' of Europe, seizing the opportunity to create an ever more united community of peoples while preserving national diversities.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: South West edges up 4% - Profits growth restricted at two water companies SOUTH WEST Water saw its first half pre-tax profits rise restricted to 4 per cent by the costs of cleaning up beaches from Lyme Regis to Penzance. Profit came to Pounds 48.9m in the six months ended September 30 1992, against Pounds 47.1m, and was generated from turnover ahead 15 per cent to Pounds 96.7m (Pounds 84.1m). Earnings per share were 37.1p (36.1p) and the interim dividend is 7.8p (7.1p). Over 93 per cent of turnover comes from the core regulated water and sewerage businesses. The increase was mainly the result of price rises of 16 per cent in the core businesses, even though the impact of recession on commercial water customers cut 1 per cent off core turnover. Alone among the 10 public water and sewerage companies, South West has secured an increase in its price formula from Ofwat, the industry regulator, since privatisation in 1989. Its original limit of annual rises of 6.5 per cent above the rate of inflation was lifted to 11.5 per cent to cover the rising costs of its water treatment programme. South West has a particularly high number of beaches whose quality is regulated by EC directives, and it expects that its capital investment programme will eventually cost it some Pounds 2.2bn between privatisation and the end of the decade. Within total turnover, revenues from the non-regulated water services, instrumentation and pipeline businesses rose to Pounds 17.5m (Pounds 11.1m), partly because of work on South West's own water treatment schemes. Mr Keith Court, chairman, attributed part of the 25 per cent advance in operating profits from Pounds 33.3m to Pounds 41.6m to cost control, and added that it compensated for the fall in interest receivable to Pounds 7.6m (Pounds 13.9m). The investment programme cut net cash to just Pounds 90m at the end of September from Pounds 212m in March 1992 and Pounds 180m in September 1991. The increase in tax to Pounds 3m (Pounds 2.9m) was ACT paid on dividends - like much of the water industry, the group's capital allowances shield it from mainstream corporation tax. Mr Ken Hill, finance director, said: 'We're feeling pretty robust, and there are signs that the recession may have peaked in the south west although we are not complacent'. COMMENT Results from South West Water were at the top end of analysts' expectations although the shares failed to respond. But the capital spending programme will probably drain the last of the cash by next March giving a net interest charge for the first time since flotation, while depreciation charges will continue to rise. In the past few weeks the group has agreed with Ofwat that annual price rises for the next two years will be 11 per cent on top of inflation. While the deal gives welcome stability up to Ofwat's 1994 periodic review of the industry's pricing structure, Ofwat's thinking on price increases in the second half of the decade is only beginning to emerge and long-term returns remain hard to estimate. With those concerns, and the dividend for the second half likely to rise by less than that of the first, the shares may lack reasons to perform.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Wuhan, June 22 (XINHUA) -- Central China's Hubei  Province will build a new billion yuan, 160 km railway linking  it to the Three Gorges area, where China's largest water control  dam will be located.    According to local officials, the new railway line will  start  from Yingcheng city in eastern Hubei and join the existing  Jiaozuo railway line at Jingzhou city, also in Hubei, via the  province's Tianmen and Zhongxiang cities and Jingshan County,  and extend to Yichang city, which is quite close to the huge  projected dam.    The new railway line will have a capacity to carry more than  20 million tons per year.    Construction of the line will begin during the next  five-year- plan period (1996-2000) and the whole project will be  completed within three years.    Foreign funds, such as foreign governmental loans and  investment from transnational consortiums, will be used besides  locally-raised funds to pay for the new line.    Engineers say that it will help shorten the travelling  distance between Wuhan, the province's capital, and Yichang by  240 km, compared with the existing Handan and Jiaozhi railway  lines.    The officials added that the new line would be of great  importance for improving the comprehensive transport system in  central China, promoting economic development along the Chang  Jiang river, and helping the construction of the Three Gorges  Dam.</p>

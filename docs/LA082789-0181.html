			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> BUYING A HOME OR CONDO WITHIN FHA LOAN LIMITS  </P> <P> FHA loans are 30-year fixed-rate mortgages that are available to anyone with  the income and credit needed to qualify. They are insured by the FHA and funded  by approved banks, savings and loans, mortgage companies and other lending  institutions.  </P> <P> To buy a home with an FHA loan, you must find a piece of property that is in  the $101,250 range of the funding limit. It must qualify for FHA financing in  terms of its condition and the relationship of the asking price to the  appraised value.  </P> <P> If you are considering buying a condominium or townhouse, you can check with  your agent or the homeowners association to see if the property is in an  FHA-approved complex. Title companies will provide lists of such properties.  </P> <P> If you are seeking a single-family home, the property will have to be in  suitable shape to pass the FHA inspection and be priced in line with the market  value.  </P> <P> Make sure you have the cash needed to close the purchase. Together with the  down payment and the closing costs, it will cost you anywhere from about $5,000  to $8,000 in cash to buy a property close to the FHA limit.  </P> <P> Once you've saved the amount for closing costs and located the property, find a  bank or lending institution that offers FHA loans by consulting with your  agent, checking with a loan broker or turning to the telephone directory and  making some calls.  </P> <P> With some FHA loans, depending on the type of property purchased, an up-front  fee of as much as $4,000 will be charged for mortgage insurance, but that  charge can be added to the amount of loan financed, as can the 1% origination  fee charged for the loan. Both charges can be added on top of the maximum  $101,250 loan amount.  </P> <P> With most FHA condo loans, the mortgage insurance is charged as a monthly fee  of about $40.  </P> <P> Discount points may be charged by the lender and are paid by either the buyer  or the seller in an FHA transaction. Usually, you'll have the option of taking  a higher interest rate with no points or a lower rate with points. The length  of time you plan to hold the property and the amount of cash available at  closing usually determine which route is best for you.  </P> <P> FHA loans require tax impounds, which add about $105 to the monthly payment.  Together with $889 a month for principal and interest on a 10%, fixed-rate  loan, and $40 for mortgage insurance, the total monthly payment comes to about  $1,034 for an FHA loan of $101,250.

			<p><P> June 30, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUBBLE: LIKE A SHOT IN THE DARK;  </P> <P> TROUBLED SPACE AGENCY SENDS UP AN UNTESTED TELESCOPE, LOSES BIG  </P> <P> The National Aeronautics and Space Administration obviously has serious  internal management problems. There was nothing wrong with the Hubble Space  Telescope project that a measure of properly organized pre-launch testing  couldn't have caught and fixed.  </P> <P> But because basic testing of the orbiting telescope's two mirrors was not done,  the world now sees the inglorious result of NASA's laxity and ineptitude: A  $1.5-billion piece of equipment that, until a defect with one of its mirrors is  fixed, is not much more than a hunk of orbiting junk. How was this fiasco  allowed to happen?  </P> <P> Lew Allen, director of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, has been  asked fo find out. And Congress, with a hearing already started, will want to  find out for itself. Inevitably the manufacturer -- Hughes Danbury Optical  Systems, Inc. -- will be questioned about producing a couple of  multimillion-dollar mirrors that did not work.  </P> <P> Congress would be wrong to spare the rod on the manufacturer, if the facts  uncover a design flaw or manufacturer's blunder. But in truth the job of the  space agency is to monitor such work and prevent fiascoes.  </P> <P> This one is a real beaut. NASA's huge budget ($10.9 billion in 1989) now needs  to be reviewed; its penchant for selling Congress and the American people on  unbelievably expensive projects called to account. Over the next 25 years NASA  would like to operate six huge earth-observation satellites. That ambition now  needs to be examined by Congress with a skeptical eye. Just Thursday the  shuttle fleet was grounded, once again, after NASA detected mysterious fuel  leaks on two of the three crafts.  </P> <P> Many warned that the 1986 Challenger disaster, caused by a fuel leak that  claimed the lives of six astronauts, showed a fundamental defect in the  management structure and competence of the space agency. Four years later there  is reason to ask if that warning was understated.  </P></p>

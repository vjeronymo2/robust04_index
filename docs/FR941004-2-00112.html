			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Plants Committee is currently composed of individuals representing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> six CITES geographic regions: North America, Central and South America and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Caribbean, Asia, Oceania, Africa, and Europe. Each CITES Region  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently has one representative on the Plants Committee. Dr. Bruce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MacBryde of the Service's Office of Scientific Authority serves as Vice-Chair of the Plants Committee (representing North America). The Regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representatives are selected by their respective regional caucuses, at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> COP. A Chair will be selected by the new Plants Committee, most likely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during a meeting to be held at the close of COP9.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Identification Manual Committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Continue to support the Identification Manual Committee and development of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> animal and plant identification manuals for use by port and border  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement officers, in providing a standard of reference for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identification of CITES species, within available resources and priorities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The enforcement officers of the Parties must be equipped with guides which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are accurate, realistic, and helpful in the identification of the many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CITES species and products found in trade throughout the world.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Nomenclature Committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet. This agenda  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> item has two subitems in the provisional agenda:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Report of the Chairman  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Recommendations of the Committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Encourage the development and adoption of checklists for all taxa, within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> budgetary limits and priorities to be decided upon by the Parties. Support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revisions of existing checklists for fauna prior to development of new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ones. Because of the expense in developing checklists for taxa, the United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States supports recognition of existing checklists for remaining taxa when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suitable. Implementation of the Convention is strengthened by the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uniform names of listed species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service understands that the report of the Chair presents technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nomenclatural corrections and recommended revisions to names included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Appendices at the Plenipotentiary Conference and at COP1. Those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revisions will require adoption by the Parties at COP9.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> XIII. Evolution of the Convention  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Strategic Plan of the Secretariat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is possible at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. How To Improve the Effectiveness of the Convention  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is possible at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This agenda item was suggested by the delegate from Canada at the March  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994 Standing Committee meeting; the Standing Committee agreed that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review of the general evolution and implementation of CITES should by done  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by an independent body, and that a project proposal for this review should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be developed by the Secretariat. The main concern of the United States is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what funding will be available for such a project, and that it not impair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ability of other functions in the Secretariat budget to receive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> XIV. Interpretation and Implementation of the Convention  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Review of the Resolutions of the Conference of the Parties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Support the effort begun by the Secretariat immediately following COP8, at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the direction of the Standing Committee, to review all of the resolutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Conference of the Parties with the goal of assisting Parties in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective utilization of the resolutions, in order to more effectively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement the Convention, by: (1) Deleting resolutions that have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> superseded or whose purpose has been accomplished; and (2) consolidating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolutions that deal with the same subject.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At every Standing Committee meeting since COP8, the United States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delegation has strongly urged (and the Committee has adopted this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendation of the United States) that any consolidation of resolutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retain the text of the original, including the preamble, so as to: (1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assist the Parties, while retaining the original intent of the resolution;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (2) reduce unnecessary or unproductive debate at COP9 on ``old'' issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the United States supports deleting only out-of-date resolutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are truly non-controversial, and retaining the text of the original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for any consolidations. The Standing Committee reiterated its support for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this approach at its March 1994 meeting. The United States supports an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expedited approval of these consolidations in Plenary Session at COP9,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which will only be possible if the original text of resolutions (preamble  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and operative paragraphs) are retained, so that any consolidations will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structural and not substantive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (a) Deletion of Resolutions that are out of date.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> See Doc. 9.19.1_Deletion of Resolutions that are Out of Date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Support the deletion of resolutions that are out of date, if they have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> superseded by other resolutions or have been overtaken by events. Likely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to support the deletion of all resolutions proposed by the Secretariat and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circulated to the Parties, with the following exceptions: Conf. 2.8, 3.13,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and those relating to certain parts and derivatives of plants_Conf. 2.18,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.24, 6.18, and 8.17 (b) and (c). Certain other resolutions on plants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remain pertinent unless they are superseded by new resolutions coming from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> COP9, e.g., Conf. 5.15 in relation to Doc. 9.30 on nursery registration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

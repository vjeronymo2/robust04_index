			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / UK Company News: Lopex bounces back and looks to resume dividends LOPEX, the communications group, returned pre-tax profits of Pounds 210,000 in the year to end-December against previous losses of Pounds 398,000. Directors do not recommend a dividend, but said they would propose a final dividend for 1993 'in the absence of unforeseen circumstances'. The last payment was a final for the 1990 year. The preliminary results include a pro forma balance sheet adjusted for a Pounds 3.5m rights issue in February this year, which moved cash up to Pounds 7.89m (Pounds 4.35m), and the sale of its stake in a Dutch business. Also long term obligations fell to Pounds 5.91m (Pounds 7.46m in the 1992 balance sheet) because of the conversion of a long term bonus for employees into shares. Investments fell to Pounds 2.13m (Pounds 2.27m). Turnover, which includes the cost of advertising space ultimately paid by customers, fell to Pounds 146m (Pounds 206m). The company said stripping out disposals the comparative figure for 1991 was Pounds 155m. Revenue - commission on sales - fell to Pounds 41.1m (Pounds 58.7m). Lopex made an exceptional provision for redundancy costs of Pounds 594,000 (Pounds 1.28m), partly offset by the release of a reorganisation provision of Pounds 421,000. It also made an extraordinary provision of Pounds 548,000 (gain Pounds 1.86m) covering the loss on sale or closure of discontinued operations, including goodwill originally written off to reserves but included in the acquisition considerations. The company paid interest of Pounds 950,000 (Pounds 2.03m), but after interest and dividends received the net charge was Pounds 693,000 (Pounds 1.49m). The company's share of profits in associated companies, less losses, fell to Pounds 105,000 (Pounds 316,000). The loss per share fell from 4.76p to 0.21p.</p>

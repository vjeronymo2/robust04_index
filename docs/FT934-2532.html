			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / TV job for Balladur ally Mr Jean-Pierre Elkabbach yesterday took charge of France's two state-controlled television stations when he was appointed chairman of France Television as part of the government's shake-up of the media. Mr Elkabbach, 56, is known in France as an aggressive television interviewer. He is close to a number of prominent conservative politicians, notably Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister. He co-authored a book with Mr Balladur in the late 1980s. The selection of Mr Elkabbach for such a sensitive position as the head of France Television, which controls the France 2 and France 3 channels, has been interpreted as an unashamedly political choice by the Balladur administration. Mr Elkabbach came to the fore in French television under the conservative governments of the 1970s, when the state exercised stringent control of the media. He was so closely associated with the right that when the Socialists took power in 1981 crowds chanted 'Elkabbach Resign]' at a victory rally. However, Mr Elkabbach eventually became close to Mr Francois Mitterrand, the socialist president, after collaborating with him on a television biography. He has been regarded as the favourite to take charge of France Television since Mr Herve Bourges, his left-leaning predecessor, announced he would not stay on for a second term. Mr Bourges, who implemented a radical cost-cutting programme at France 2 and France 3, last week became France's ambassador to Unesco. The appointment of Mr Elkabbach comes at a time of sweeping reform across French television. Mr Alain Carignon, the communications minister, is tabling legislation to liberalise the broadcasting system. His reforms will include relaxing controls over investment and renegotiating the licence of Canal-Plus, the successful pay-TV channel.</p>

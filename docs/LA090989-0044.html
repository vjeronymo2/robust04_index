			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HART AIR ASSAULT FELLS CANYON, 30-12  </P> <P> The more things change in the colorful football rivalry between Hart and Canyon  highs, the more things stay the same.  </P> <P> For the third time in as many years -- and under the tutelage of as many head  coaches -- Hart defeated Canyon, firing multiple weapons at the Cowboys to  claim a 30-12 victory before an overflow crowd of approximately 8,000 on Friday  night at College of the Canyons.  </P> <P> Hart Coach Mike Herrington, the third Indian chief since 1987, made his return  to his alma mater a success, unfolding a complex and balanced offense that  piled up 397 yards against a befuddled Cowboy defense.  </P> <P> Pulling the trigger was senior quarterback Rob Westervelt, the third prolific  Hart quarterback in the past four years. Westervelt was sensational, completing  18 of 24 passes for 263 yards and three touchdowns.  </P> <P> "These guys are great, the line, especially," Westervelt said. "All I needed  was a little motivation."  </P> <P> Westervelt capped two lengthy first-half drives with scoring passes of 11 and  23 yards to John DePaco. He added a 10-yard touchdown to tight end Chad  Fotheringham to open the scoring in the third quarter.  </P> <P> Westervelt completed 16 of his first 19 passes -- including a string of nine in  a row -- for 234 yards. The Cowboy defense was unable to sack him.  </P> <P> Herrington stopped short of declaring Westervelt a better quarterback than  former Hart quarterbacks Jim Bonds, a 1987 graduate, and Darren Renfro, who  graduated in 1988. But he didn't withhold his praise.  </P> <P> "He had a great game," a beaming Herrington said. "We talked about it in the  coaches' meetings: If Robby's on, he's capable of having a great game. He's a  little bit different than a Bonds or a Renfro. He sits in the pocket well and  just waits and waits for a man to get open."  </P> <P> There were plenty of them. DePaco caught three passes for 49 yards. Lance  Migita, a 5-foot-6 flanker, snared eight passes for 114 yards.  </P> <P> Senior tailback Howard Blackwell led all ballcarriers with 107 yards in 19  carries -- including a 25-yard touchdown run with 3:06 to play that gave Hart a  30-6 lead. He also caught four passes for 64 yards.  </P> <P> "We knew going in that we had a lot of receivers," Herrington said. "It was  just a matter of which one catches the ball."  </P> <P> Said Migita: "Robby and the rest of us, we all played together on the sophomore  team. So, we're experienced."  </P> <P> Canyon Coach Harry Welch, whose team played without the services of standout  tailback Chris Peery, who underwent surgery for a non-football injury earlier  in the week, rolled up 238 yards in offense.  </P> <P> Senior quarterback Tim Beidle completed 16 of 25 passes for 166 yards and a  touchdown. Senior wide receiver Clint Beauer made nine catches for 92 yards.  </P> <P> But without Peery, who watched from a wheelchair, the Cowboy offense was, for  the most part, punchless.  </P> <P> "Last year, we had leadership from our experienced kids," Welch said. "This  year, we didn't."  </P> <P> Canyon did, however, receive the game's first break. Three plays into the game,  Westervelt could not handle the snap from center on Hart's five-yard line.  Linebacker Brad Weaver recovered and the Cowboys had a first and goal at the  six.  </P> <P> Five plays later against a stubborn Hart defense, tailback Mark Santos, who led  Canyon ballcarriers with 68 yards in 16 carries, swept left for the touchdown.  Steve Mann's extra-point attempt was wide to the left.  </P> <P> "I said, 'That's just six points, that's gonna happen' " Westervelt said. "I  knew we were gonna score. We said, 'We're not gonna lose to these guys.' That's  the way we were brought up."  </P> <P> Westervelt led Hart 87 yards in 16 plays on its next series as the Indians took  the lead for good. He completed five of six passes on the drive, including the  11-yard pass to DePaco for the score.  </P> <P> Blackwell accounted for 25 yards on the ground.  </P> <P> On Hart's next series, Westervelt marched the Indians 78 yards in eight plays,  culminating with a 23-yard strike to DePaco in the corner of the end zone.  </P> <P> The drive included completions of 20 and 13 yards to Blackwell and a 17-yard  pass to Migita.  </P></p>

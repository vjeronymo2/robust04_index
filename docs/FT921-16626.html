			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Management: Fashion beers, Pulling ahead before the bubble bursts - Philip Rawstorne looks at the popularity of imported brews A LIGHT Mexican lager served with a slice of lime in the neck of the bottle has become the latest trend in British clubs, pubs and restaurants. Sol, brewed at Veracruz on Mexico's Gulf coast, has become the fashionable drink to be seen with. Introduced at a Mexican restaurant in London's Covent Garden in 1985, UK sales of Sol were 22,000 bottles by 1987. This year they are expected to reach 48m bottles, worth a total of about Pounds 50m. Now widely distributed through pubs, bar-restaurants and off-licences, Sol is positioned to turn its trendy image into a more established feature of the UK beer market. But in spite of its current marketing success, the odds against it doing so are great. Most so-called fashion beers turn out to be no more than froth on the market. They bubble briefly, then go flat. Very few settle into a permanent market niche; even fewer expand into mainstream brands. Imported premium lagers - as distinct from those brands such as Belgium's 'reassuringly expensive' Stella Artois which are foreign-owned but brewed in the UK - amounted to about 1.1m barrels last year. That is little more than Britain's beer drinkers consume in 10 days; but its retail value is about Pounds 350m. Even so, more than 200 brands from 20 countries continue to strive hopefully to capture the sort of attention now being accorded to Sol. There are a further three from Mexico - Corona, which enjoyed a short but spectacular boom in the US, Dos Equis, a dark lager, and Tecate, which is best sipped, some say, from a glass with a salt-encrusted rim. Rolling Rock, which comes from Latrobe, Pennsylvania, in distinctive long-necked green bottles, is sponsoring jazz concerts to acquire the sort of trendiness in the UK that it enjoys in Manhattan. From Canada comes Moosehead and Molson, which was launched in 1988 with a Pounds 2m advertising campaign by Jim Dunk, an overweight, balding actor who perversely advised beer-drinkers to avoid the brand. Budweiser Budvar and Pilsner Urquell have come with exemplary quality credentials from Czechoslovakia. There is San Miguel from Spain, Sapporo Dry from Japan, Steinlager from New Zealand and Furstenberg from Germany. Fresh from his marketing triumph with Sol, Harry Drnec, chief executive of Maison Caurette, the independent UK drinks distributor, has launched Genuine Miller Draft, the sixth best-selling US beer, into the market. Cold-filtered to preserve flavour, and free of additives, the beer will sell for Pounds 1.60 to Pounds 2.50p a bottle in pubs and clubs. Prospects for imported lagers have never been better, according to Drnec. The UK's premium lager market is growing at 12 per cent a year. Consumers are trading up, prepared to pay higher prices for what they perceive as better products; and drinks retailers, meanwhile, are competing to offer a greater choice. 'It was the development of wine-bars in the late 1970s and early 1980s that first opened the market for imported bottled beers. 'That continued with the trend to bar-restaurants,' said Drnec. 'Now that the major brewers have been forced by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to separate their pub retailing operations from their breweries, pubs are moving in the same direction. They are now being run by professional retailers, concerned more with catering for consumer choice than with pushing through volume sales of one or two beers.' The growing take-home beer market has also been encouraging supermarkets and off-licences to extend their range of brands. But the 200 brands are competing for a narrow slice of a sector which is dominated by Holsten Pils and Beck's from Germany, and Grolsch from the Netherlands. These three brands last year accounted for more than 80 per cent of imported lager. Holsten - long advertised as the 'odd lager' - is brewed in Hamburg to Germany's strict purity rules and is by far the largest brand in the sector with annual retail sales of Pounds 200m. It was launched in the UK in the post-war gloom of 1949, long before the British pub-goer had acquired a taste for any lager. Courage, which distributes the beer, keeps the brand trendily up-to-date with Pounds 6m-worth of advertising humorously focused on anagrams of the brand name, such as Stops In Hell. Beck's was introduced into the UK at Joe Allen's restaurant in London in 1978. Within a few years, its distribution was taken over by Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the UK brewer which is strongly represented in the take-home trade. Last year, Beck's sales totalled 170,000 barrels; this year they are expected to be about 30 per cent higher. Grolsch entered the UK market in 1979, setting up its own marketing and sales organisation to develop the brand. With the slogan 'You can't top a Grolsch', its advertising first focused on the beer's swing-top bottle as a distinctive and stylish brand emblem, then gradually widened the message to convey the quality of the product. The measured pace of its promotion over more than a decade lifted sales to 140,000 barrels last year. Growth of more than 20 per cent seems likely this year. The development of Holsten, Beck's and Grolsch, suggests that success in the market depends on two factors - a fashionable or stylish image to distinguish a brand from its competitors; and a record of product quality that will sustain its appeal after the novelty has worn off. 'Both are essential,' said Keith Lay, UK marketing manager for Grolsch. Warsteiner and Hacker Pschorr, two German brands with an impeccable heritage, have made little impact in the UK because of their lack of fashion appeal. Sol, with a stylishness carefully nurtured in London's chic bars, has got ahead of the pack. It has yet to prove it has the stamina to stay there.</p>

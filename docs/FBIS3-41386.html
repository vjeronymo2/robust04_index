			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Barbara Smit: "Europol To Stretch Arm of the Law </F> Over Borders"]    [Text] Amsterdam -- A prototype European Community police  force was launched yesterday, with officers from the 12 member  states making no secret of their ambition eventually to enforce  the law across the EC, ignoring borders.    In a sleek building formerly occupied by the Dutch secret  service in The Hague, the first chief of Europol, Herr Jurgen  Storbeck, said he hoped to move rapidly beyond mere surveillance  of drug traffickers.    Task forces or even multinational police squads should be  set  up, he said--a scheme long demanded by Chancellor Kohl of  Germany, but which causes shudders in London and some other  European capitals.    "I think governments will agree to this federal ideal. What  was unthinkable 10 years ago has now become thinkable," said  Herr Storbeck, former German head of Interpol in Wiesbaden.    For now, British Tory nightmares of multilingual officers  roaming the continent are some way from reality.    Yesterday, as a launch ceremony was held, intelligence  officers sat at computer monitors, checking the cross-border  activities of drugs smugglers. More direct action against crime  will have to wait until October, while EC countries wrangle over  the legal convention establishing the force under the Maastricht  Treaty.    Herr Storbeck said the agency could gather detailed  information on the movements and criminal records of citizens  around Europe in less than three hours.    Since mid-January, 19 "liaison officers" representing the 12  EC member states, including two Britons, have handled about 20  cases, supplying relevant data gathered from their national  police services.    This is only the first step towards the planned creation of  Europe-wide databanks on crime and terrorism.    However, there could be stumbling blocks ahead over privacy  rules and a lack of trust between national intelligence services.    "The national services have an obligation to provide us with  information, but we don't have any powers to force them if they  are reluctant," said Herr Storbeck.</p>

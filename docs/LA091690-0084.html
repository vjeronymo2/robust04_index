			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH COUNTY OR NORTH COUNTY FOR JAIL?  </P> <P> I read, then laughed, at the Sept. 9 letter to the editor by Suzanne Hutchinson  about placing a new jail in Gypsum Canyon.  </P> <P> Her first sentence, "It's time for NIMBY to stop," was refreshing. I agree.  </P> <P> Her last sentence, however, "Let's build a jail in Gypsum Canyon now," coupled  with her address, Huntington Beach, revealed her true colors.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach is a comfortable 20-plus miles from Gypsum Canyon. That's  definitely not in her back yard.  </P> <P> BRUCE G. BAILEY  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Foreign investment pours in A wave of foreign investment money has swept into Russia this year, accounting for sharp rises in the shares on Russia's nascent stock markets, according to local stockbrokers, write John Thornhill and John Lloyd in Moscow. Investors have been attracted by the availability of shares following Russia's mass privatisation programme, the relative success of the economic stabilisation plan which has reduced inflation to 4 per cent a month, and the more settled political climate. Mr Martin Andersson, director of Brunswick, a private Moscow-based finance company, said: 'There has been a tremendous shift in interest during the past six to eight months. What we have seen first is an interest from portfolio investors, mainly from the US. But we are now seeing increased interest from strategic investors. There have not been tanks on the streets for several months and there has been a period of relative political stability.' Mr Anatoly Chubais, privatisation minister, has estimated that foreign investors have recently been buying Russian shares at a rate of Dollars 500m a month. But estimates vary considerably. CS First Boston, the US investment bank, suggests portfolio investment is running at Dollars 2bn for the first half of this year; Brunswick estimates Dollars 1bn which might reach Dollars 3bn by year-end. Local stockbrokers say much of this money comes from speculative hedge funds seeking an exposure to Russia's developing economy and the commodity cycle. 'This is the ultimate emerging market,' says one stockbroker. Some Russian flight capital also appears to be returning. Mr Mikhail Alexandrov, executive director of Alpha Capital, a Russian stockbroking firm, said: 'You can't easily divide portfolio and strategic capital coming in. In some industries, like oil, the only way a foreigner can make an investment is portfolio investment. In others, you can make a direct stake. We have both coming in now very quickly indeed.' Most western fund managers are still deterred by the poor transparency in the share markets and company accounts, the sheer physical difficulty of buying and registering shares, and the remaining political and economic risks. But the government is committed to developing and reforming Russia's capital markets to provide companies with alternative means of finance as it weens them off state credits.</p>

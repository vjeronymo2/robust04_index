			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REASON AND RHETORIC ON FLAG BURNING AND FREE SPEECH  </P> <P> My heart aches! Yes, I cannot believe that our country has come to the point  where our flag, in our own United States, is not respected, protected, and,  yes, venerated by our people.  </P> <P> We criticize other countries that desecrate our flag, that almost act  uncivilized in a lot of ways and yet these other people from other countries do  respect their country's flag.  </P> <P> This country has taken in many people from all over the world, and yet if you  have occasion to speak to these people they speak very fondly of their flag.  </P> <P> Our neighbor to the south, Mexico, not long ago, fined a well-known entertainer  because he forgot the words to the national anthem when he sang at a public  gathering.  </P> <P> I am an American of Mexican descent, and my parents taught me to respect the  United States flag and not to offend it by any of my actions or words.  </P> <P> The Supreme Court's decision of last June regarding so-called "right of free"  speech stinks; it has nothing to do with "free speech" -- it has to do with  respect of our national symbol.  </P> <P> ESTHER RODARTE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

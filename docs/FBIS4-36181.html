			<p>BFN     [Text] Several of the war prisoners from the northern  forces who were captured in Wadi Hadhramaut reported that they  had been pushed into the lost war. They said that they  surrendered after their commander had run away from the battle  and left them without water. They also said they are from the  central territories. They expressed happiness for the brotherly  reception by the forces of the DRY [Democratic Republic of  Yemen] after they had surrendered.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["From the press review"] </F>   [Text] The dailies ANGKATAN BERSENJATA and PELITA  highlight the visit of Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic to  Indonesia in their respective editorials. The Bosnian president  is asking members of the Nonaligned Movement [NAM], which is  chaired by President Suharto, to send a peacekeeping force to  Bosnia-Herzegovina to end the civil war in the Balkan nation.  The Bosnian war is dragging on. Some 250,000 people have been  killed, thousands more injured, and (?2 million) made refugees  by the war.    Peace efforts undertaken by the United Nations, the European  Community, and NATO have failed. The worrisome situation is  partly due to the continued UN arms embargo on the nation.  Serbian and Croatian forces continue their attacks in violation  of the UN resolutions on the cease-fire.    The two dailies describe as normal and noteworthy the  request  of President Alija Izetbegovic for a peacekeeping force from  Indonesia and the NAM in order to achieve peace in the former  Yugoslav republic because former Yugoslavia is a NAM founding  member. This will also strengthen efforts of Islamic Conference  Organization members and the United States to have the arms  embargo lifted and peace efforts by the United Nations, the  European Community, and NATO.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Labor Party Chairman Thorbjorn Jagland by </F> Oyvind Johnsen; place and date not given: "We Can Govern as Part  of EU"]    [Text] The economic and monetary union with the EC will  give the government greater possibilities for control. A united  European social democracy has a different view of the Maastricht  treaty from that of the Social Democrats Against the European  Union (SME), according to the Labor Party leader Thorbjorn  Jagland in this interview with ARBEIDERBLADET.    The fight over Norwegian membership in the European Union  [EU] is in full swing. Many think it will be decided by the  labor movement. Within the Labor Party there are broad  differences in the point of view of the party leadership and the  Social Democrats against the EU, where Hallvard Bakke is a  well-known figure.    VG [VERDENS GANG] hinted last week that the Labor Party's  patience with SME soon ought to be over. Jagland disagrees with  the advice: "The nonsocialists are asking with increasing  loudness when my patience with the SME will be at an end -- in  the hope that it will come to an end.... They hope that this  matter will create problems for us by dividing us.    ``However, there is no end to my patience. We have to live  with this kind of tension; it is part of life. We are going  through a dramatic transition period, and it would be artificial  if we were in total agreement on these questions. It would be  strange if it was not difficult for the Labor Party to accept  Bakke's point of view. On the other hand, it is strange that  there are no people visibly in favor of the EU in the SV  [Socialist Left Party], and that is their problem right now.''  <H5>  Thinks Alike </H5>   [Jagland] When it comes right down to it, the difference  between me and Bakke is not so great. We think alike in many  ways.    [Johnsen] In other words, Bakke will be a good man to bring  into the EU?    [Jagland] Yes, it will be good to have Hallvard with us  because of his critical view of the conservatives' way of  dealing with unemployment issues.    [Johnsen] Do you think the SME should have unlimited freedom  in the Storting group also?    [Jagland] With respect to the referendum and our work in the  time prior to that, we need complete freedom. However, in the  Storting group normal rules of play must be in effect. In the  Storting chamber there is the usual party discipline; that  question has been decided. Moreover, we do not view the SME as a  part of the party organization, but as a "no" organization in  which party members participate. Within the party there is  nothing called the SME.  <H5>  Different View </H5>   [Johnsen] SME thinks that the EU embodies a liberal market  policy. How can you advocate membership in the EU if this is  correct?    [Jagland] As far as I understand, the SME thinks that it is  the objectives of the Maastricht treaty concerning a low  increase in prices, reduced budget deficits, and the foreign  exchange policy that will prevent us from carrying out an active  employment strategy. The united social democrats in West Europe  hold a totally different view in this matter from that of the  SME. We think that those objectives are a precondition for  having a more active employment policy.    We cannot solve employment problems by promoting growth  driven by inflation. Demand-driven growth is a classic example  of private demand being inflated in order to increase  employment. This period in our history is over. It is contrary  to any sensible environmental policies.    On the contrary, we should promote growth driven by  investments; growth resulting from goal-oriented focusing on  objectives that will create jobs while at the same time  improving the environment. Just think of the enormous amounts of  money the EU is currently investing in improvements of the  energy network in Europe. This will create growth and jobs,  while at the same time improving the environment because energy  will be used more effectively.  <H5>  As in Norway </H5>   [Jagland] As far as the budget deficit is concerned, the  Maastricht treaty subscribes to more or less the same policy we  have had in Norway that aims to reduce the deficit in  combination with actively focusing on promoting employment. We  have to squeeze the government money out of entitlements and  into active employment initiatives.    But if we have gotten no further than thinking that the rich  countries in the world should continue to finance their own  welfare by more and more borrowing, we really are in a crisis  situation. It is a fact that when we have these big budget  deficits we borrow for our own welfare. If our goal is not for  the rich countries to finance their own budgets, at least we  should quit talking about the environment and about solidarity  with the poor countries. In that case what we have is pure  egoism; egoism that involves continued borrowing by the rich  countries to the detriment of the poor.  <H5>  Short-Term Thinking </H5>   [Jagland] As to the third item, foreign exchange policy, the  SME talks about us relinquishing our right to devalue our  currency. However, what happened in the 1980's showed what the  result of fluctuations in the exchange rates led to. It resulted  in all decisions, whether taken by business leaders or  politicians, being based on short-term considerations. Nothing  was being considered besides the exchange rates on the following  day, and the fact that all decisions were based on short-term  considerations was one of the main reasons why unemployment grew.    And nothing can be more capitalistic and market oriented  than  watching the exchange rates and then raking in the profits from  that.  <H5>  New Liberalism </H5>   [Johnsen] What you are saying now in fact, is that the SME  arguments concerning a more relaxed attitude toward inflation,  deficit, and exchange rates in reality is more typical of  market-driven liberalism than the Maastricht treaty?    [Jagland] Yes, in my opinion that is just what it is. First,  one is talking about an old-fashioned policy of growth; with  demand that ruins the environment without solving unemployment  problems. And at the same time one allows currency speculators  to run a good part of the world's economy.    If one quits using slogans, one will see that market  liberalism gained a foothold for two reasons. One was the fact  that foreign exchange rates began fluctuating, the other that  movement of capital was freed up. These two things taken  together are what we in a nutshell call neoliberalism. If we  want to get rid of neoliberalism we shall have to deal with both  these things.  <H5>  Not Radical </H5>   [Johnsen] But the SME's point of view is uniting many among  the Labor Party extremists. How does this fit in with what you  are saying about liberalism?    [Jagland] You must ask the SME about what is so radical  about  having a high rate of inflation with ensuing high interest  rates, and a high deficit that undermines the national economy  while at the same time strengthening the private economy. If one  wants government control, one must talk on this level and try to  create stability. Only then one will be able to govern.    I will also mention how we were able to govern during the  period we often call the golden age of social democracy, which  covers the period from just after the war up through the 1970's.  We call this the golden age mainly because we had progress every  year. The government had much direct control, but the main  reason was that it was possible to plan for the long run. Einar  Gerhardsen [Norwegian prime minister] knew what the krone was  worth year by year, inflation was 2-3 percent and interest rates  were correspondingly low. Then both the government and business  could plan for the long run. That is how we had stability, and  that was called control.    We must return to such stable conditions. We are trying to  do  this through the Maastricht treaty's economic and monetary  union. We adhere to the fact that stable prices and the  attendant low interest rates are necessary -- and this will lead  to a smaller deficit.  <H5>  Common Interests </H5>   [Johnsen] You say that in reality the Maastricht treaty has  more room for the social democracy's policy of control than for  liberal policies?    [Jagland] That is my clear understanding. But the union is a  framework that all responsible powers can use. In today's Europe  the labor movement and industrial capitalists have common  interests directed against speculators who constitute a threat  against both parties. One has tried to unite these common  interest groups in the treaty. Those are the groups with broad,  social interests, those who think long-term, and who are not  just considering short-term profit.  <H5>  Misunderstanding </H5>   [Johnsen] The SME maintains that the EU has decided to let  market forces solve the problems connected with unemployment. Is  this correct, and how does this agree with your view of the EU?    [Jagland] No, that is a fundamental misunderstanding. In  this  case policies carried out by each individual country have been  confused with what the EU stands for. When looking at the  actions of the EU, there have been several attempts on the part  of the European Commission to achieve a more active employment  strategy. Jacques Delors has proposed a massive increase in the  EU's budget with a view to increasing investments and  initiatives that would lower unemployment. But this has met with  no response from the conservative governments in West Europe.    In other words one must determine what is what. One item is  the employment policy of the conservative governments. Another  item is the white paper from the commission, which was an  important step in the right direction. It did not include  everything and we disagreed with some of it. But it did include  much of the program submitted by the social democrats for  putting Europe to work again. The white paper was diluted by the  EU's ministers of finance, and we are dissatisfied with the  result, but that too is a step in the right direction.  <H5>  Friedman's Thoughts </H5>   [Johnsen] What about the SME's contention that unemployment  was caused to a great extent by the EU's anti-inflationary  policy?    [Jagland] There are two important reasons why unemployment  in  Europe increased. One is the short-term view we talked about.  The other is because most welfare states maneuver themselves  into a tight spot because of deficit spending. There was no  money with which to fight unemployment. The conservative  governments let things slide. They did not even attempt to  regain stability by resorting to changing foreign exchange  policies.    Milton Friedman was the most important monetaristic thinker  and his ideas received priority: Currency rates should float  completely freely. What also should have been done was to  actively use public budgets to fight unemployment. Instead,  budgets were cut back. Unemployment rose and so also the budget  deficits.  <H5>  Active Policy </H5>   [Johnsen] But the Maastricht treaty provides no guidance for  direct, active measures against unemployment. Can one achieve  results without that?    [Jagland] As social democrats we want active employment  policies, and we think the Maastricht treaty should have a  supplementary policy that includes this. In this instance SME  and we agree. The social democrats agree on the treaty's  objectives.    [Johnsen] Well, the SME is really also against the  Maastricht  treaty's objectives....    [Jagland] Yes, but I really do not understand that. The  treaty's objective is a premise for an active policy against  unemployment.    [Johnsen] How can the social democrats create a more active  employment policy in the EU when the conservatives are holding  back?    [Jagland] If the Nordic countries join, the picture will be  different, especially if there is a political change in Germany.  It is quite possible that there will be a social democratic  government in Sweden this fall; this is already the case in  Denmark, and some time in the future, there is a possibility in  Great Britain also. Even in the short run many things might  happen.    Moreover, it is a misunderstanding to think that the social  democrats were alone in creating the welfare states in Europe.  In Europe there is a cultural and historical basis for a broad  front of social democrats and a nonsocialist center against  uninhibited capitalism. The social democrats are an important  factor, but they could not have done the job without help from  the nonsocialist center.  <H5>  Restrictive Measures </H5>   [Johnsen] Speculators constitute a big problem for currency  stability. What would you do about them?    [Jagland] It is possible to implement restrictive measures,  but one country cannot do it alone. I do not think one can say  that free movement of capital is here forever. We must see if it  is possible to initiate restrictive measures on an international  scale. The best remedy, however, would be to return to the  situation we had after the war when exchange rates did not  fluctuate so much. We came close to having a form of common  exchange. The dollar was set, and everybody tied their exchange  rate to it.  <H5>  ECU Is Good </H5>   [Johnsen] In other words: You think that the controversial  common currency -- the ECU -- would benefit the states in their  fight against speculators?    [Jagland] Yes, that is my understanding. We have reached a  historical point when we must ask ourselves if we should not do  what was done a couple of hundred years ago when it was  determined that a meter was a meter and a kilogram a kilogram.  The way it is now, having technology that enables us to transfer  billions across the borders within a second, we must have some  bold objectives where foreign exchange is concerned: To decide  that a krone is a krone.    The most important realization today is the fact that the  amount of capital is so huge and unconstrainable by borders that  no country can do anything alone. We must coordinate exchange  rate policies by regions. If the EU creates stability in Europe,  the EU can also spearhead a movement of recreating a system of  global stability, which can regain national financial power from  the speculators.</p>

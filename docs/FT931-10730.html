British Petroleum's figures should show it has begun to recover from its recent nadir. With historical cost profits of Pounds 100m forecast for the final quarter, losses for the year are expected to be Pounds 487m (profits Pounds 1.2bn). Last year, BP heavily restructured management and operations. After several quarters of negative cashflow, it is expected to have been cash neutral in the final quarter. Lloyds Bank, which has been the most profitable of the clearing banks in recent years, announces its full-year results for 1992 on Friday. It is the first big clearing bank to report after bringing forward its announcement by two weeks. Analysts anticipate pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 650m after last year's Pounds 645m, but one estimate is of Pounds 745m. Provisions for bad and doubtful debts are estimated at between Pounds 650m and Pounds 870m, against Pounds 918m in 1991. Reuters, the international news and information group, is expected on Tuesday to reveal an increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 340m to Pounds 380m for the year to December. British Telecommunications unveils its third quarter results on Thursday, these are expected to show its resilience. Pre-tax profits are expected to be Pounds 720m-Pounds 750m (Pounds 759m a year earlier).</p>

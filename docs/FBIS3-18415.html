			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Profit and Loss"] </F>   [Text] The political situation in the Netherlands has been  given a thorough shaking, although voters produced a smaller  earthquake than expected. The differences between the big  parties have diminished considerably, but the ranking has not  changed. Therefore, in the midst of all the distress about the  predicted losses, the PvdA [Labor Party] in particular can  breathe again while the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] is  experiencing the most difficult period of its existence.    The outcome of the municipal elections are reason enough for  the VVD [People's Party For Freedom and Democracy] and D66  [Democratic 66] to be satisfied, but not elated. They did win,  but they attracted only half of the votes lost by the government  parties. In particular D66's growth was smaller than what had  been predicted in recent years. Therefore, the Democratic power  base in the cities is narrower than what looked likely before  the elections.    The results are only of limited importance for the  parliamentary elections of 3 May, but the present coalition  looks certain to lose its majority. A third party will soon be  necessary to be able to form a cabinet. Therefore, in the  coming months the struggle will be dominated by the question of  which party will finish second after the CDA.    A section of the electorate is showing an increasing  aversion  to the minor differences between the main tendencies in  Netherlands politics. This can explain the strong growth of  GreenLeft, and the Socialist Party is also benefitting from this  factor. It is regrettable that the extreme right is tapping  into all forms of dissatisfaction, but the new councils will be  able to combat them.</p>

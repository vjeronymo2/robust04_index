The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is quoted as saying:    "To enhance the role of the county and remove the gap  between  town and country and the gap between the working class and the  peasantry is a strategic task facing the working-class party and  state after the establishment of the socialist system."    The author of the article says:    The idea, theory and policies set out in the work have  displayed a great vitality in promoting socialist rural  construction, developing the local economy and improving the  people's standard of living.    The validity and vitality of the idea and theory on the  position and role of the county in socialist construction find  expression, first of all, in that the rural base of socialism  has been consolidated through the dynamic promotion of the  ideological revolution and active efforts to make the party  members and other working people revolutionary and assimilate  them to the working class.    The function and role of the county party committee have  been  enhanced and ideological education of the working class on the  revolutionary and working-class lines has been strengthened,  with the result that the party members and other working people  are firmly equipped with the revolutionary idea of our party,  the socialist idea of chuche, and they take the chuche idea as  the guiding principle.    Although the imperialists and reactionaries have launched a  more vicious political and ideological offensive than ever  before to undermine the people's faith in socialism, our  agricultural working people firmly trust the party and the  leader and are building socialism with might and main, full of  confidence and optimism, meeting the challenge of the enemy.    The great vitality of the idea and theory on the position  and  role of the county in socialist construction finds clear  expression also in that a great progress has been made in  promoting socialist rural construction and removing the gap  between town and country.    In Korea today the county serves as a centre linking town  and  country in all spheres of politics, the economy and culture and  as the basic unit of guidance and management of agriculture.    With the increase of the state's material and technical  assistance to the countryside with the county as the base,  advanced industrial management and production culture have been  introduced widely in rural communities and the gap between  industry and agriculture is getting narrower.    The great vitality of the idea and theory on the position  and  role of the county in socialist construction finds another clear  expression in that the local economy has been developed  comprehensively so as to satisfy the growing material demands of  the people and evenly develop all parts of the country.    Comprehensive development of the local economy makes it  possible to diminish the differences between local areas in  economic development by enabling every county to make an  effective and rational use of its favorable natural and  geographical conditions and production reserves to the maximum.    All counties, either in plain areas or in-mountainous areas,  have done away with age-old backwardness and taken on new looks,  those in-mountainous areas making use of mountains and those in  the coastal areas making use of the seas in the development of  the local economy. They are now positively contributing to the  development of the local economy and the improvement of the  people's standard of living.</p>

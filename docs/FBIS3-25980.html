A makeshift laboratory used to make the haul of  about 22 kilograms of pure ice was discovered during raids by  more than 40 officers from the Narcotics Bureau and the  Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). Two boys aged  about 10 were delivered into the care of the Social Welfare  Department yesterday after officers found them living in a Sha  Tin flat used by members of the 14K Yee triad to manufacture and  store the drugs.    "This is the first ice manufacturing case in Hong Kong for  17  years and the second largest seizure ever made," said Detective  Chief Inspector Yeung Tak-keung, head of the bureau's export  section. The ice was destined for the Philippines, where it  would have retailed for about $10 million, compared with a Hong  Kong wholesale value of $700,000.    Authorities said the busts did not indicate Hong Kong was  becoming a burgeoning market for ice. "In the Philippines and  Japan, ice is the drug of choice. In Hong Kong, heroin remains  the drug of choice. Ice doesn't have a market here," said ICAC  Chief Investigator Mike Squires. Mr Squires said four people  arrested were members of the 14K Yee triad society whose  official meeting place above a shop in North Poin was also  uncovered in the raids.    In the past, Hong Kong has been mainly used as transit point  for ice manufactured in laboratories in southern China and  shipped to countries including the Philippines, Japan, Taiwan,  South Korea and Hawaii. "We believe the syndicate has been  active in ice trafficking for some time, but we believe we broke  it up at the beginning of their plans to manufacture it in Hong  Kong," Chief Inspector Yeung said.    He said the synthetics used to make the ice had come from a  mainland crime group operating near Guangzhou and smuggled to  Hong Kong for final processing in the Sha Tin flat. "They were  importing the mixture from China and then treating it and  combining it with other liquids in Hong Kong until it  crystallised and was in its purest form," Chief Inspector Yeung  said.    The 22 kg of ice and most of the manufacturing paraphernalia  were found in the flat with the boys' 42-year-old mother, who  was arrested. "The children were living in a flat used as an  ice factory, but we do not believed they were using drugs. It's  a pity that such things happen to them at that age," Chief  Inspector Yeung said. Three men, including the suspected  ringleader and self-taught chemist and two would-be couriers,  were arrested during raids on Monday night and early yesterday  at premises in North Point. Four machete-type knives and a  small quantity of heroin were also seized.</p>

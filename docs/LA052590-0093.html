			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> PITTSBURGH TROUPE AT TERRACE THEATER  </P> <P> The social order may be turning upside down in various Soviet republics, but in  the repertory of the Duquesne University Tamburitzans, centuries of traditional  Slavic dance and song are protected, celebrated and displayed for American  audiences.  </P> <P> A Pittsburgh-based troupe of 40 dancers, singers and musicians, the  Tamburitzans offered a tightly structured program at the packed Terrace Theater  in Long Beach on Wednesday evening.  </P> <P> Now in their 53rd year, they took the stage with interwoven ensembles of  dancers and instrumentalists. From bagpipes, oboe-like sopels and the women's  throats came the strange and wonderful harmonies of Croatia; meanwhile, men  danced in lines with men, and women in clusters with women.  </P> <P> A single choreographer, Zeljko Jergan, arranged the dances for the first half  of the seamless presentation. After intermission, each work had a different  provenance, including a charming adaptation of a satirical sketch by Igor  Moiseyev. In this number, the "Starogorodski Kadrille," students in homely  dresses and mismatched coats, pretending to be post-revolutionary Russian  clerks pretending to be the aristocrats they despised, danced a  pre-revolutionary quadrille.  </P> <P> Stomping dances in high black boots were performed to Polish folk melodies; May  Festival dances from Serbia were executed by processions of men and maidens  wearing traditional curly-toed shoes. The dancers' upright bearing contrasted  pleasantly with their deft footwork. Clusters of musicians played a variety of  stringed instruments as well as accordions and the haunting pipes.  </P> <P> The Tamburitzans will offer additional performances Saturday at 9 p.m. and  Sunday at 7:30 p.m in the Gindi Auditorium at the University of Judaism.

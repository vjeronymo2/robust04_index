According to the U.S. newspaper THE NEW YORK TIMES dated 27  March, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry ordered that modern fighters  be dispatched to South Korea and Japan immediately if the UN  Security Council imposes sanctions on our country. He has also  ordered an increase in the supply of ammunition and parts for  the U.S. Air Force in South Korea so that modern fighters, such  as the F-117 Stealth fighters and F-15E's, can go into action  immediately.    The war fanatic also held a so-called news conference on 25  March, in which he raved about the need for thorough measures to  cope with possible contingencies on the Korean peninsula and  disclosed an operational plan for the additional dispatch of  U.S. troops and military equipment to South Korea to augment the  combat capability of U.S. imperialist aggression forces in South  Korea.    He did not forget to rave that the step of dispatching  modern  fighters to South Korea is aimed at coping with someone's  southward invasion. However, the U.S. military leaders' order  on the additional dispatch of armed forces, which is timed with  the recent frenzied commotions of military threats against us by  the U.S. bellicose circles, show that the U.S. imperialists are  the ones who are aggravating tension on the Korean peninsula and  that they are the main culprit in leading the situation to the  brink of war.    The fact that the U.S. imperialists have recently moved the  U.S. Navy task force, including aircraft carriers, to the waters  near our country, prepared their aggression forces in the U.S.  mainland and in the area surrounding the Korean peninsula for a  state of swift dispatch, and transported war material and U.S.  troops to be mobilized in the Team Spirit joint military  exercise to U.S. bases in Japan by air, clearly proves once  again that they are intentionally maneuvering to further  aggravate the situation on the Korean peninsula.    If the U.S. imperialists think that they can frighten  someone  with these military threats and blackmail, they are  miscalculating. The U.S. imperialists should clearly see that  this road of dashing to confrontation and war leads to their own  grave and act with discretion.</p>

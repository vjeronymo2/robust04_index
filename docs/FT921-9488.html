			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Action by Lloyd's Names: Expression of relief as settlement is achieved - Pounds 116m Outhwaite settlement is significant triumph for those who acted to recover heavy losses NAMES WHO joined Mr Peter Nutting in taking action against Outhwaite joined yesterday in praising his role and the financial relief the settlement would provide. But many did not want to talk publicly about the arrangement. 'When all's said and done it has been a very personal and painful experience,' said one Name who wanted to remain anonymous yesterday. 'I'm just pleased it is all over.' Mr Robert Williams, a businessman with a Pounds 60,000 share of the syndicate's income, against which he estimates he has already paid out Pounds 280,000, said: 'My first impression is that the settlement is very good. I will certainly be buying a magnum of champagne. 'My reaction is one of extreme pleasure and gratitude to Mr Nutting. Nobody else took the slightest interest in our plight.' Since he joined as a Name in 1973 he had expected an average return of about 10 per cent over the years. 'Outhwaite was a catastrophe far beyond anything that had happened. 'For the last five years I have been waking up with a cloud over my head and thinking I'll be bankrupted. There is no price you can put on the extreme pain and suffering I suffered. It was like a creeping paralysis. I had to sell my business, cash in my life insurance and borrow large sums.' But he struck a note of caution about the decision. 'The big unknown is the quantity of future losses. Until it is all capped one has to be very cautious.' Other Names were worried about the fact that Mr Outhwaite has still not been able to close the 1982 underwriting year and that claims could continue to come in. 'This is still a running sore,' added another Name. Mr Geoffrey McLean sold his construction company to Tarmac in the 1970s and invested some of the proceeds in becoming a Name. In spite of being one of the beneficiaries of the settlement, he regrets that decision. With a Pounds 25,000 line on Outhwaite he stands to recover more than Pounds 100,000 to set against losses incurred more recently. 'As the affair unfolded we could see we couldn't lose - the risks were stupid. The idea of insurance is to spread the risk. Outhwaite concentrated it.' But the affair has 'soured his faith' in Lloyd's. 'I suppose I joined because of a bit of greed, maybe something to do with the cachet. I'd have been better off without it.'</p>

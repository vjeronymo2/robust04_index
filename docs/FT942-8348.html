			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: Margins hurt building groups Four big Japanese construction companies have reported lower pre-tax profits for the year to March, underlining the poor state of the building sector. The declines came in spite of government efforts to boost the economy through construction related projects. Most companies blamed intense competition for sagging margins and warned that the introduction of competitive tendering for public sector orders would erode margins further this year. Three of the four cut their dividends or said they would reduce them during the current year. Three of Japan's biggest property companies also posted poor results, in spite of large sales of property to boost net income. All three reported lower pre-tax profits and warned that results would deteriorate further this year. Shimizu, Japan's largest general contractor, posted pre-tax profits down 9.6 per cent to Y119bn (Dollars 1.15bn), on sales 3.4 per cent lower at Y2.09bn. Mr Takeshi Shiroishi, vice-president, said orders had been below budget, with falls in private and public sector demand. The group cut its dividend from Y14 per share to Y10 and said it would cut it again to Y9 this year. It predicted pre-tax profits this year would fall to Y50bn on turnover of Y1,800bn. Taisei, one of the largest building and civil engineering groups, reported pre-tax profits down 27.7 per cent at Y73bn, on sales 6.5 per cent lower at Y1,850bn. The company said improvements in housing construction and public works spending had not offset poor demand in the private sector. It warned that pre-tax profits would fall again this year to Y33bn on sales of Y1,550bn. The company said the dividend, maintained at Y12 per share for last year, would be cut to Y8 for the current 12 months. Kaijima, the building and civil engineer, posted pre-tax profits down 23.4 per cent at Y67.4bn, on sales 10.4 per cent lower at Y1,750bn. The dividend is cut from Y13 per share to Y9. It forecast pre-tax profits this year of Y57bn on sales of Y1,700bn. Obayashi, the Osaka-based construction group was the only one of the four to post increases in pre-tax profits, up 17.8 per cent at Y57.7bn, and sales, up 7.6 per cent at Y1,636bn. The company, which is strong in south-east Asia, said it had benefited from public works orders. However, after-tax profits dropped 52.3 per cent to Y10.3bn following the Y30bn liquidation of a US subsidiary. The group maintained its dividend at Y8 per share. It predicted pre-tax profits this year would drop to Y42bn on sales of Y1,450bn.</p>

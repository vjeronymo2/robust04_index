			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOCUS ON THE FAMILY GROUP PLANS TO MOVE;  </P> <P> MINISTRY: THE CHRISTIAN ORGANIZATION IN POMONA THAT HAS GROWN INTO A  $63-MILLION-A-YEAR MEDIA EMPIRE INTENDS TO RELOCATE TO COLORADO SPRINGS.  </P> <P> Focus on the Family, which was founded by psychologist James Dobson 13 years  ago to promote Christian family values and has grown into a $63-million-a-year  media empire, announced Thursday that it has outgrown its headquarters in  Pomona and plans to move to Colorado Springs, Colo.  </P> <P> Dobson, the organization's president, said the move is contingent on the sale  of its property in Pomona, but the move could occur 18 months to two years  after the sale.  </P> <P> Paul Nelson, executive vice president, said the 750 employees at the Pomona  headquarters were told of the plan Thursday and will be offered the chance to  transfer to Colorado.  </P> <P> Pomona Mayor Donna Smith said she is disappointed by the decision because of  the loss of jobs and the loss of a valuable "ministry that is desperately  needed."  </P> <P> But Nelson said that although the nonprofit organization has strong support in  California, most of its work -- answering a volume of mail that reaches 10,000  letters a day and preparing radio programs -- can be done just as easily in  Colorado.  </P> <P> Nelson said Focus on the Family was faced with the alternative of constructing  a high-rise office building on its 13-acre site in Pomona or finding a larger  site elsewhere to meet its expansion needs.  </P> <P> Because of the expense of high-rise construction and the higher labor and  operating costs in California, he said, it will be cheaper to move to Colorado.  "It will also be cheaper for our employees to live there," he said.  </P> <P> Dobson, who was an associate clinical professor of pediatrics at USC for 14  years, started Focus on the Family in 1977 after writing a series of popular  books on parenting and marriage from a conservative Christian perspective. He  started with one secretary in a two-room office in Arcadia, expanded to a dozen  employees in 1980 and now runs an organization that includes a lobbying arm in  Washington and a Canadian branch in Vancouver. Its radio broadcasts reach an  estimated 1 million listeners on 1,450 stations in the United States and  overseas.  </P> <P> Dobson gained national attention in 1989 when he interviewed serial killer Ted  Bundy in Florida shortly before his execution and recorded on videotape Bundy's  claim that his crimes were influenced by pornography.  </P> <P> Nelson said Colorado Springs was selected because of a gift of $4 million from  the El Pomar Foundation, contingent upon the move. The foundation was  established in 1937 by Spencer Penrose, who made a fortune in gold in Colorado.  The foundation makes grants exclusively to groups in Colorado.  </P></p>

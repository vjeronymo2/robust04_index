			<p><P> March 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BROAD SUPPORT GIVEN SWEEPING HOUSING BILL;  </P> <P> WOULD PROVIDE HELP FOR FIRST-TIME HOME BUYERS  </P> <P> Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and other senators introduced sweeping  legislation Wednesday that would make home ownership easier for first-time  buyers and provide about $4.1 billion to state and local governments to  increase affordable rental housing.  </P> <P> The bill, likely to be the most significant housing proposal to come before the  101st Congress, has drawn bipartisan support and stands a good chance of being  embraced by the Bush Administration, despite its cost, Cranston said.  </P> <P> "It is imperative that we reverse a decade of neglect in housing policy in this  country," he said during a press conference, flanked by the bill's main  Republican co-sponsor, Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.). "It's deplorable that  young families, even with two wage earners, have been priced out of housing  markets across the nation."  </P> <P> Cranston conceded that the Administration has yet to take a position on the  bill but noted that Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp was  "very enthusiastic" about the proposal in recent meetings, especially sections  designed to bring young, two-paycheck families into the home ownership market  for the first time.  </P> <P> "I think there's a new attitude in this Administration toward the government's  role in housing," D'Amato added. "You're going to see an Administration that  looks to work with Congress on this issue, to get something done."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Would Lift Limit  </P> <P> Under the legislation, which is co-sponsored by 25 senators, the federal  government would allow home buyers to use funds in their individual retirement  accounts or 401(k) retirement plans to make down payments on homes. The benefit  would be restricted to people who have not owned a home in three years.  </P> <P> Also, the bill would remove the current $101,250 limit for mortgages under  which buyers may participate in the Federal Home Administration mortgage  assistance program. Instead, purchasers could qualify for federal assistance on  mortgages that are no more than 95% of a state's median home sales price.  </P> <P> In California, which has some of the highest housing prices in the nation, the  FHA ceiling would be raised to $155,000, enabling more families to qualify for  assistance, Cranston said.  </P> <P> D'Amato, citing studies by private housing experts, said 500,000 families  across the country could have been helped to buy homes in 1987, had the new  provisions been in effect.  </P> <P> A second goal of the bill would be to expand the nation's dwindling supply of  affordable rental housing, especially for lower-income people. Under the  measure, the federal government would provide $3 billion to state and local  governments that are sponsoring housing programs in concert with private  developers.  </P> <P> The legislation would distribute these funds through a new HUD agency called  the Housing Opportunity Program.  </P></p>

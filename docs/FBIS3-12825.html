			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tehran, March 5, IRNA--Palestine Islamic jihad  movement's secretary-general, Fathi Shaqaqi said here Saturday  [6 March] that the Zionists will see a chain of vengeful  operations soon in retaliation for the last Friday's massacre of  Muslim worshippers at Ibrahimi mosque in al-Khalil.    Speaking to IRNA, he said the bloodbath in al-Khalil  [Hebron]  was a pre-designed plot carried out by the Qods occupier forces.    Shaqaqi said the Zionists were dissatisfied with the active  presence of Palestinian Muslims at Prophet Ibrahim's (peace be  upon him) mosque. They committed the horrible crime to  strengthen their own presence in al-Khalil which houses 27  Jewish settlements, he said.    He brushed aside the Zionist claim that the crime may have  been carried by an individual and said the people who were  present at the scene said that some militarymen opened fire on  the crowd in the mosque.    Elsewhere on reflection of the crime and its impact on the  world, Shaqaqi said the shameful crime made Russia call, for the  first time in the recent year, for international support for the  Palestinian people living in the occupied lands.</p>

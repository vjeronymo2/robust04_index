			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> COSBY CLAIMS MEDIA VENDETTA  </P> <P> Comedian Bill Cosby isn't laughing about what he perceives as a media vendetta  against him.  </P> <P> "I don't understand why people are picking on me, and that's essentially what  this stuff is," the entertainer said about media coverage after "The Cosby  Show" dropped a mural from the NBC-TV series' opening credits.  </P> <P> A Harlem teacher protested the use of her students' artwork as a backdrop so  Cosby eliminated the offending opening credits using the background. Cosby  complains the dispute was slanted by the media to attack him personally.  </P> <P> "I'm very, very upset and I'm not going to take this kind of treatment.  Celebrities are very, very easy to take a shot at," Cosby told "A Current  Affair."  </P></p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / US markets tense over interest rates US stock and bond markets held their ground in nervous trading yesterday as investors waited to see if the Federal Reserve's open market committee (FOMC), which began a two-day meeting in the afternoon, would vote to raise interest rates. The recent decline in the dollar's value had convinced some Wall Street analysts that the Fed governors and regional presidents who make up the FOMC would decide the currency needed the support of higher interest rates. Although market sentiment has since shifted towards the view that central bank support is unlikely, the dollar held firm against the yen in New York yesterday. It was quoted at Y98.90 in late New York trading, having dipped to Y98.825 in London from Y98.9 on Monday. Against the D-Mark, the dollar lost more than a pfennig during London trading, closing at DM1.5826 against DM1.5965 on Monday. In New York, it fell to DM1.5800 in late trading. Traders in New York attributed the decline to a temporary surge in demand for the D-Mark. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 5.83 at 3,652.48 with other stock indices ending flat. Treasury market prices barely moved. Although all eyes were on the FOMC yesterday, some analysts thought the Fed would not review its stance until it saw job figures, due on Friday. Michael Prowse in Washington adds: President Bill Clinton said yesterday the priority at the Group of Seven economic summit beginning on Friday would be to find ways of co-operating more effectively to create jobs. On the eve of his departure for the summit, Mr Clinton did not directly address fears that exchange rate volatility would depress global growth prospects. He signalled instead that G7 leaders should focus on economic fundamentals, especially those relevant to the 'well-being of working people'. He said G7 leaders needed to address the 'tinderbox issues of global population growth and the environmental crisis' and to lay plans for creating global 'information superhighways'.

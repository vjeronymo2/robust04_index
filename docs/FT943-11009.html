			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / People: Cornford hopes insight pays off Mike Cornford, recently departed head of global foreign exchange at Natwest Markets, is now running a currency management group called Currency Insight. The new business, which is in the process of being set up, will focus on short-term trading strategies, offering investors a low risk, moderate style of return, rather than the high risk strategies often pursued by hedge funds. Currency Insight is backed by Dawnay Day, a small merchant bank. It will also be working in conjunction with Chilton Capital, a forex consultancy group, which will assist in raising funds. Cornford said he would primarily be trying to attract funds from an institutional base. His marketing pitch is to offer investment managers access to 25 years' experience as an interbank trader in the foreign exchange market - the perspective, as he calls it, of a 'fly on the wall of a dealing room. . . I strongly believe there is a real demand for somebody who is closedly identified with the day-to-day comments in the marketplace.' He said the timing of his venture was opportune becausethe volatility of financial markets this year, often at odds with perceived economic fundamentals, had forced fund managers to be less dogmatic about their investment strategies.</p>

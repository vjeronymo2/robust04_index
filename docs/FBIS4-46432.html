			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Anti-Terrorist Police Investigate </F> Three Foreigners"]    [Text] (ANSA) Caserta, Italy, June 5 -- Local and national  special branch anti-terrorist police are working with  international investigators in an attempt to determine the real  identities of three foreign nationals detained here, in this  city in the Naples hinterland, and the reason for their arrival  in Italy.    It was learned at the weekend the three were arrested in a  small villa on the coast north of Naples in November or December  last year and found in possession of counterfeit documents, ten  passports which had been stolen in the United States and address  books packed with the names and telephone numbers of people  resident throughout the Middle East.    The suspects were named as Echen Oyechei, 22, from Nigeria,  Barle Binda Brown, 32, who claims to come from the United  States, and Yvette Perbach, 21, from former East Germany.  Policemen from Castel Volturno, on the southern Tyrrhenian  north of Naples, took the trio into custody in a villa rented in  the names of foreign nationals, including that of Echen Oyechei.  Many of the residents of the area are members of the military  attached to the nearby NATO base and their families.    Also turned up during a search of the small villa, it was  learned at the weekend, were notes written in coded Arabic,  credit cards and other documents in the name of Italian  journalist and writer Roberto Gervasi and newspaper clippings of  reports of bombings, terrorist acts and protest demonstrations  which had occurred in the Israeli- occupied Arab territories,  especially Gaza.    Also found were maps of the centers of cities and towns on  the southern Tyrrhenian around Naples and photographs of Castel  Volturno law enforcement personnel and notes on their movements  in patrolling the area.    Oyechei declared himself a political prisoner at the time of  his arrest and, later, claimed that he was working for Israeli  intelligence on a search for a Palestinian terrorist, said the  U.S. FBI was looking for him and threatened suicide if he were  turned over to U.S. authorities.    The woman who identified herself as Barle Binda Brown  reportedly was found to speak English with a Ukrainian accent  when she was questioned in what she claimed was her native  language. Shortly before her arrest, she and the other woman  taken into custody arrived in Italy together on a flight from  Istanbul.    As investigations into the three were pursued, the Caserta  police chief, Luciano Rosini, ordered tighter surveillance and  checks of the area ahead of the Group of Seven industrialized  nations summit in Naples, on the calendar for early next month.</p>

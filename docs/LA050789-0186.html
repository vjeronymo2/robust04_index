			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CAL LUTHERAN WINS DISTRICT 3 CROWN;  </P> <P> FIFTH-INNING RALLY GIVES REGALS SECOND CONSECUTIVE TITLE, 4-1  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran, normally a strong hitting team, was struggling at the plate in  Saturday's NAIA District 3 softball championship game against Azusa Pacific.  </P> <P> The Regals had only one hit through four innings against Azusa Pacific when Cal  Lutheran Coach Wendy Olson -- Beckemeyer decided that it was time for a quick  lesson.  </P> <P> "We weren't taking advantage of the first pitch today," Olson -- Beckemeyer  said. "The first pitch to every batter was right down the middle for a strike  and the girls were just taking the pitch, so I told them to be aggressive  first-ball hitters."  </P> <P> The lesson was well-taken. Cal Lutheran pounded out four hits -- three on first  pitches -- in the bottom of the fifth to take a two-run lead en route to a 4-1  victory at home and its second consecutive district championship.  </P> <P> "I had been walked the last eight times that I batted so I was real hungry to  get some hits today, " said Danielle Piotrowski, whose two-run double on a  first pitch highlighted the fifth-inning rally. "It just took one person to get  a hit and that got us started."  </P> <P> Azusa Pacific (16-18) scored its run in the second inning when CLU starting  pitcher Leslie Stevens walked Kim Young with the bases loaded. The Lady Cougars  held onto the slim lead until the fifth when the CLU batters began to take  advantage of Dana Swingrover's perfect first pitches.  </P> <P> DeeAndra Pilkington came in from center field to pitch three stellar innings of  relief. Pilkington, normally a starter, gave up one hit and struck out three in  improving her record to 17-4.  </P> <P> Olson -- Beckemeyer told Pilkington, who had only one previous relief  appearance, to be ready if needed. "I wanted DeeAndra to keep warmed up between  innings in the outfield because I wanted to bring her in as an intimidation  factor since Azusa has never beaten her this year," she said.  </P> <P> Piotrowski went three for three with a triple, double and three runs batted in.  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran (33-16) will play host to Mesa College of Grand Junction, Colo.,  in a three-game regional series Friday and Saturday. The winner will advance to  the NAIA championships in Midland, Mich., May 18-20.  </P> <P> "It should be a great challenge for us, but if we play together like a team  like we have been doing, we can beat them," Pilkington said.  </P></p>

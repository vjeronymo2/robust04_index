			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir </F> by Shlomo Ganor in the studio on 17 June -- recorded in Hebrew  with Arabic subtitles; processed from the Hebrew]    [Text] [Ganor] Mr. Savir, what were the results of the  fifth round of multilateral talks, which ended last night in  Rabat?    [Savir] There were representatives from 14 Arab countries,  the Palestinian Authority, Israel, the United States, Japan,  Russia, and Europe. We decided on approximately 35 projects.  We agreed to strengthen economic cooperation. We decided that  the economy must be based on open borders and the free movement  of commodities. For the first time, it was decided to establish  a permanent Middle East framework, in which Jordan, the  Palestinians, Egypt, and Israel would participate, to monitor  various regional projects in the fields of transportation,  tourism, and electricity. I believe that the main achievement  of the Rabat conference was the sense shared by all the  participants that through economic cooperation and by working  together, we can develop the region.    [Ganor] What viable regional plans were agreed on?    [Savir] The main issue this time was tourism. A whole day  was devoted to this subject. There are various facets  pertaining to tourism. Work has begin on feasibility surveys  for roads and railway tracks. During this round, the United  States proposed a plan to promote civil aviation between the  countries in the region. An instructional center will be  established in Egypt to train qualified personnel to handle  regional tourism. Swiss experts will prepare feasibility  studies in al-'Aqabah, Elat, and Jericho. Approximately 1.5  million tourists visit here each year. As peace draws near,  these figures should rise to European levels. Similar projects  are being formulated in the fields of agriculture and with  regard to linking the region's electricity grids. Feasibility  studies will soon be completed, and then we will have to attract  investments from the private sector. This issue was discussed  as well.    [Ganor] What time frames are we talking about?    [Savir] We are talking about uninterrupted work. Whenever a  round of talks such as the recent one in Rabat takes place,  attention is focused on the multilateral economic talks;  however, experts now hold limited conferences on specific  subjects -- whether it be tourism, transportation, or  communications -- almost every week. These experts are about to  complete feasibility studies. I believe that the crowning  achievement this time was the unprecedented discussion on the  establishment of a financial mechanism to finance these  projects. Second, a conference with the participation of the  private sector will take place in Marrakech in November, at the  initiative of Foreign Minister Peres. These projects will be  presented to the managers of the largest U.S., Japanese,  European, and Middle Eastern companies, including Israel. An  attempt will be made to attract them to invest here. The Middle  East understands that it must function as a region, not just as  Egyptians, Jordanians, and Israelis. If we do not coalesce as  one economic region, the international community will not invest  here, because the various regions of the world are competing for  funds.    [Ganor] What is the probability of Syria joining the  multilateral talks?    [Savir] That is hard to say. This decision is for Syria to  make. At this stage, it has still not joined; however,  representatives from the EC and Japan said that they visited  Damascus on the eve of the Rabat conference and sensed great  Syrian interest in all these projects. The Syrians asked the  Europeans to return to Damascus to brief them on the results.  Perhaps Syria is beginning to understand that the train has  already left the station and that this opportunity must not be  missed. Ultimately, not only will Syria contribute to the peace  process, but the peace process will also contribute to the  Syrian economy. I believe that the multilateral track has now  become too important for any party to want to remain outside.  No one can afford to remain outside. As I said before,  however, this is a Syrian decision, and it is undoubtedly linked  to progress in the bilateral talks.    [Ganor] In your talks with the Moroccan representatives, was  there any agreement on how to translate the special relationship  between the two countries into diplomatic ties?    [Savir] We were given a very warm welcome by the Moroccan  Government. We held various talks. At this stage, there is a  great deal of very positive normalization in our ties with  Morocco, but we have still not reached the stage of formalized  relations. We discussed the strengthening of economic ties.  Look, one keeps on meeting Israeli tourists in Rabat. When we  left, we ran into a delegation of 300 people at the airport.  The Moroccan Manufacturers Association expressed its desire to  formalize ties with its Israeli counterpart. Therefore, our  relations are growing stronger. We are seeing the fruits of  peace, although we have not yet established diplomatic  relations. Let us fill in the contents first, and the framework  will undoubtedly follow.    [Ganor] Thank you, Mr. Savir.</p>

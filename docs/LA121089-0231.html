			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENT AT THE CROSSROADS;  </P> <P> THE OCEAN: OUR SEA, ITS CREATURES AND MAN;  </P> <P> SEWAGE, LITTER, INDUSTRIAL WASTE RAISE FEARS OF WHAT THE TIDE WILL BRING IN  NEXT.;  </P> <P> FINDING A CURE FOR A POISONED PACIFIC  </P> <P> Standing atop the bluffs at Santa Monica's Palisades Park or walking on the  warm sands of Huntington Beach, it is easy to picture the sea as unimaginably  vast, almost limitless. Oceans, after all, cover 70% of the Earth's surface and  contain 98.8% of its water. But oceans also receive enough of the world's  wastes to raise public fears about the safety of such pleasurable pastimes as  swimming, surfing and fishing.  </P> <P> The good news, according to scientists, is that anti-pollution laws enacted  over the last two decades are having their intended effect. "The levels of some  contaminants are one-one-hundredth of what they were in the early 1970s," said  Henry Schafer of the Southern California Water Resources Research Project.  </P> <P> The bad news is that some fish species remain too contaminated to eat, some  surfers and swimmers still complain of pollution-related illnesses, and  scientific evidence indicates that cleaning up the stubborn pollution that  lingers will be very expensive, if it is technically feasible at all, and the  benefits relatively small.  </P> <P> People create pollution, and always will. The questions for the near future  are: How much pollution can we afford to live with? How clean can we afford to  make the ocean?  </P> <P> Pollution takes many paths to the sea, and the usual bogymen of tanker  accidents and toxic industrial discharges are only a few. More voluminous and  perhaps more dangerous -- there is not enough information on all pollutants to  know for sure -- are the byproducts of everyday living: pollution that comes  through sewers and storm drains, litter and even toxic contaminants that waft  out to sea as smog.  </P> <P> Marine mammal activist Margaret Johnson of Huntington Beach fears that the sea  is being used as a "big Tidy Bowl." An exaggeration, perhaps, but there is a  surprising volume of "waste water" -- treated sewage -- poured into coastal  waters daily. Los Angeles County squirts 800 million gallons into Santa Monica  Bay every 24 hours. Orange County disposes of 260 million gallons off  Huntington Beach. San Diego County adds 190 million gallons off Point Loma.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Urban Poisons  </P> <P> On top of this are all-too-frequent accidental releases of raw sewage -- 40  million gallons in Los Angeles County alone in 1987 and 1988, leading to the  closure of every beach in the county at least once during that time. Laguna  Beach has suffered 16 raw sewage spills in the last two years, earning that  town an odorous reputation as "Sewage Strand." "It happens with such frequency  that you start getting a little gun-shy every time you go into the water,"  surfer Todd Marker said. "You just hope you don't pick up some strange  disease."  </P> <P> Longest suffering are the areas nearest urban centers -- Santa Monica Bay is  carpeted with Los Angeles' sewage sludge and the harbor with toxic cargo  spills, while San Diego Bay is souped up with industrial effluent. But there  also are some surprising problem spots, such as Mugu Lagoon in Ventura County.  Fertilizers and pesticides used long ago on the farmland that became Camarillo  now seep through Revolon Slough and into the lagoon, poisoning its precious  wetlands and kelp beds.  </P> <P> The sea off Mugu Lagoon is the only area in Southern California where the  shellfish samples are so tainted that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  will not allow them to be sold for human consumption. But Mugu is not the only  area where fishermen are advised not to eat their catch. Authorities also warn  anglers to avoid eating such bottom-dwelling species as white croaker from  Santa Monica Bay because they contain high levels of the long-banned pesticide  DDT.  </P> <P> Indeed, records from what was once the world's largest pesticide factory show  that 2,000 tons of the long-lasting DDT have been dumped near one area, at Los  Angeles County's sewage outfall near White's Point on the Palos Verdes  Peninsula. The state can only guess at the volume and location of toxic  discharge graveyards never recorded.  </P> <P> One hopeful note is that the worst damage evidently was done more than 10 years  ago and was limited to near-coastal waters, where it was convenient to dump  poisonous wastes. Pollution has not affected the abundant fisheries farther  offshore, where the bulk of commercial fishing is done -- a harvest that  produces most of the seafood destined for markets and restaurants.  </P> <P> Another hopeful note is that some scientists believe the situation is  improving. Alan Mearns of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  in Seattle said levels of contaminants in many near-shore species have fallen  by as much as 99% since the bad old days of the early 1970s, when the Food and  Drug Administration was seizing shipments of bonito, tuna and other fish that  were too tainted for interstate sale.  </P> <P> "I'm really kind of impressed how things have improved over the last 15 years,"  Mearns said. "Levels of DDT have dropped dramatically. There are still some hot  spots, no doubt, but over the entire (south) coast, things are much, much  better."  </P> <P> The Water Resources Research Project's Schafer concurs, but he balks at  pronouncing the patient cured. "Before we can say everything is hunky-dory, we  have to know everything (about how the complex ocean ecosystem works)," he  said. "To do that, there is enough work to keep scientists employed for the  next century."  </P> <P> </P> <P> How Clean?  </P> <P> The Southern California Assn. of Governments has boasted that "Santa Monica Bay  is cleaner than Puget Sound (near Seattle and Tacoma), cleaner than Boston  Harbor, cleaner even than San Francisco Bay." But that does not mean it is  clean. Victor Cabelli, a University of Rhode Island researcher who co-authored  for SCAG a favorable report on the health of the bay, has conceded that a dip  in certain bacteria-rich waters can result in a case of the "three-day runs."  Lifeguards, swimmers and surfers blame pollution for a variety of ills --  rashes, flu-like symptoms, and eye and ear infections -- that vanish when they  stay ashore.  </P> <P> Schafer, for one, is skeptical of such reports. "I live in Huntington Beach and  I know the surfers there complain all the time about getting sick," he said,  "but they are still out there. I can't believe they would keep going out there  if they were really getting sick."  </P> <P> The city of Los Angeles, at least, has stopped pumping sewage sludge into the  sea, leading Dorothy Green of the Santa Monica environmental group Heal the Bay  to marvel that the city is "producing the best quality effluent since 1910."  But nine sanitation districts serving 80% of Orange County residents rejected  improved sewage treatment in July, partly because it would have added $2 a  month to an average customer's bill.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, San Diego County flatly denies the value of costly secondary  treatment -- the special filtration that decreases the amount of solid material  in sewage water released into the sea -- and it is supported by a number of  scientists from the Scripps Institute of Oceanography. Director Emeritus Roger  Revelle said he knows of no evidence that secondary treatment benefits the  environment when used at treatment plants that release waste water into the  open sea. "We don't get rid of the bacteria. We don't get rid of the viruses.  We don't get rid of the toxic metals," he asserted.  </P> <P> It is no insignificant claim, considering the billions of dollars that cities  have poured into such systems. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is  unconvinced. It maintains that lesser-treated discharge from San Diego's sewage  plant contains so much bacteria that it hurts kelp beds and bottom-dwelling  organisms. Also, the state Water Resources Control Board has detected high  levels of potentially toxic silver in the sea nearby.  </P> <P> Such changes in ocean chemistry can alter the ecological balance, although the  significance of this is not certain. For example, divers have found exotic clam  species near the outfall of Orange County's sewage plant; the non-native  shellfish apparently are better suited to sewage effluent and have supplanted  the once-ubiquitous native brittle red starfish. Some scientists argue that  such unexpected events are a warning that complex ecological interrelationships  are being changed and far more negative changes could result. Others argue that  the net result is more fish, so the overall effect is better than benign.  </P> <P> Maddeningly, the debate over sewage treatment distracts people from an even  more important issue: detoxification of contaminated runoff water in storm  drains. Everyone agrees that runoff is the big remaining unregulated source of  ocean pollution -- "tiny toxic rivers (that) empty into the sea," said Wheeler  J. North, a marine biology professor at Caltech.  </P> <P> Overlooked as well is ordinary litter, especially plastics, which is so out of  control that even in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, researchers find  thousands of plastic foam bits in every square mile. The plastic debris can be  as deadly to wildlife looking for food as it is dispiriting to people looking  for an unspoiled environment.  </P> <P> As public interest rises anew -- partly because of the social activism of such  celebrities as actor Ted Danson, a founder of the American Oceans Campaign --  many ocean issues are approaching political showdowns. The biggest will come  next October with the expiration of a congressional moratorium on offshore oil  leasing. The stakes in that well-publicized battle are tremendous.  </P> <P> There are 2,142 wells on 42 platforms off Southern California; the federal  government wants to add up to 1,458 wells and 26 platforms to tap the 2.6  billion barrels of oil that may lie undiscovered off the coast. But California  knows well the environmental cost of that oil. There was the 1969 Union Oil  blowout in Santa Barbara, and California still is plagued by smog from  platforms beyond the reach of state law. Adding to that anxiety is an Interior  Department warning that there is a 94% chance of a major oil spill off Southern  California within 30 years -- twice the likelihood of a major earthquake.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Next Spill  </P> <P> With visions of Exxon Valdez dancing in their heads, California politicians are  lining up to stop drilling and start preparing for the next spill. Lt. Gov. Leo  T. McCarthy and Controller Gray Davis, among others, champion a bill that would  charge oil companies 50 cents a barrel to fund a $500-million oil disaster  cleanup fund. Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and Assemblyman Tom Hayden  (D-Santa Monica) favor a ballot initiative that would have its own $500-million  cleanup fund and create a full-time bureaucracy to monitor oil transportation  and plan for disasters.  </P> <P> Westside marine biologist Rimmon C. Fay, a 30-year veteran of ocean issues, is  encouraged by such interest, as well as signs that the ocean still can heal  itself. Kelp forests in Santa Monica Bay, for example, are expanding. Even so,  Fay realizes there is much left to do.  </P> <P> "The objectives of (federal anti-pollution laws) are being attained, and that  is a good feeling," Fay said. "But I cannot rejoice at winning a battle without  still being concerned about the war. The reversal that we see is only partial.  If ecology has anything to tell us, it's that we have to live within the  constraints of the ecosystem. But we are not doing it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> REPORT CARD  </P> <P> Average score: 6.3  </P> <P> Three views on our progress, rated on a one to 10 scale  </P> <P>  * Christine Reed, Santa Monica city councilwoman: "The fact that the city of  L.A. stopped putting (sewage) sludge in the bay . . . is significant, but the  grade is not going to move up until we deal with urban runoff and with the L.A.  County sewage plant." Score: 5  </P> <P> * Mark Pisano, Southern California Assn. of Governments: "In the last three to  four years, we have begun to see progress . . . in reducing the amount of  organic (contaminants) but as far as planning and strategy, we are not as far  along as we are in air pollution." Score: 5  </P> <P> * Willard Bascomb, Scripps Institute of Oceanography: "It's not perfect, but  it's getting better every day. What the numbers have shown for many years . . .  is that everything is as good as it's ever going to be." Score: 9  </P> <P> </P> <P> TURNING POINTS  </P> <P> * December, 1989 -- U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and San Diego argue in  court over the environmental value of requiring secondary treatment of city's  sewage waste water that is dumped in the ocean off Point Loma.  </P> <P> * December, 1989 -- U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to consider Los  Angeles County's request for a waiver from federal law requiring installation  of expensive secondary treatment process for sewage waste water that is dumped  into Santa Monica Bay.  </P> <P> * February, 1990 -- Completion of Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project's  assessment of the scale and impact of toxic street runoff on water quality in  Santa Monica Bay, with implications for all coastal waters off urbanized  Southern California.  </P> <P> * October, 1990 -- End of congressional moratorium on federal oil leases off  the Southern California coast, renewing debate over the risks and benefits of  increased development and transportation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> VOICES  </P> <P> "It's kind of sad and it's getting worse and worse every day because they just  keep polluting it more and more. As you can see, there's oil and tar in the  sand. That didn't used to be there 10 years ago. Sometimes you go out here and  the water will look green like it is now, but you'll come home with a sore  throat, stuffy head. Your ear aches. It's really sad. Look down the beach and  see all the trash here."  </P> <P>  -- Surfer Danny Lemaster, 26, of Lawndale  </P> <P> "I've been dory fishing for about 12 years, and I haven't seen much change in  the ocean. If anything, the water seems cleaner. Not so much garbage floating  around . . . It seems like more people competing for the same amount of fish.  Whether the ocean is cleaner or not, hasn't seemed to slow people's appetite  for fish.  </P> <P>  -- Newport Beach doryman Rick Breneman  </P> <P> </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S COASTAL TOXIC HOT SPOTS  </P> <P> An analysis of coastal waters regularly tasted by the State Water Resources  Control Board.  </P> <P> 1.

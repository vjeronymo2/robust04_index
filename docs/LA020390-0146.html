			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CUSTODY DENIAL FOR DRUG USE OKD;  </P> <P> THE LAW: THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT KEPT INTACT A PRECEDENT-SETTING APPEAL  COURT RULING AGAINST A MOTHER WHOSE CHILD WAS BORN SUFFERING THE EFFECTS OF  ILLEGAL DRUGS SHE TOOK DURING PREGNANCY.  </P> <P> The California Supreme Court, acting in a precedent-setting case, has cleared  the way for authorities to deny a mother custody of a child born suffering the  effects of illegal drugs she took during pregnancy.  </P> <P> Over two dissenting votes, the justices refused to disturb a ruling last  November by a state Court of Appeal in San Diego that for the first time denied  custody solely because of a mother's drug use.  </P> <P> The high court action, taken in a brief order released Thursday, allows the  appellate decision to become binding on trial courts throughout California.  Only Justices Allen E. Broussard and Marcus M. Kaufman voted to grant a hearing  of the mother's appeal.  </P> <P> The justices declined to hear claims by the attorney for a Vista woman in the  case that drug use -- without other evidence of child abuse -- was insufficient  grounds to deny custody. The ruling was so broad, the lawyer warned, that  officials theoretically could remove custody because of harm to a child from  the mother's smoking of cigarettes.  </P> <P> The attorney, James G. Dunn of San Diego, said Friday that the ruling  represented an invasion of the constitutional right to privacy, and that an  appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was probable. "We believe the state is  improperly interfering with a mother's prenatal conduct," he said.  </P> <P> Concern also was expressed by Pamela A. Mohr, directing attorney for the  Childrens Rights Project in Los Angeles, one of several legal and medical  groups that had urged the high court to overturn the appellate ruling.  </P> <P> Mohr said the decision will have a "tremendous impact" in Los Angeles, perhaps  doubling the 2,500 cases involving drug-affected babies that come into court  annually. The risk of losing custody solely because of drug use, she added,  would discourage pregnant women from obtaining prenatal and hospital care.  </P> <P> "We are very disturbed by this ruling," Mohr said.  </P> <P> San Diego Deputy Dist. Atty. Edward J. Mantyla agreed that now it was likely  that there will be increased attempts by authorities to deny custody to mothers  whose children are affected by drug use. But he cautioned that such action by  Juvenile Courts will be far from automatic. Also, he said, there are  alternatives, such as permitting a father to retain custody.  </P> <P> The high court's refusal to set aside the decision came as public concern has  grown over narcotics use by mothers-to-be. The appeals court noted that  according to a recent government study, an estimated 11% of the children born  in U.S. hospitals have been exposed to dangerous drugs.  </P> <P> Legislation introduced at the state Capitol would provide added treatment  programs for maternal drug abuse and in some instances allow manslaughter  charges to be brought against mothers whose children die after birth from drug  exposure.  </P> <P> The case involved a woman identified only as Kelly D., who gave premature birth  to a son, Troy D., in February, 1988, at an Oceanside hospital. Both the mother  and son tested positive for amphetamines and opiates, with the boy suffering  from weight loss, lethargy and other signs of drug withdrawal.  </P> <P> The hospital reported the results to child protection authorities, and later a  Juvenile Court took custody from the parents and placed the boy with his  grandparents. The parents were permitted visits only with the consent of a  social worker and were ordered to submit to psychological evaluations and to  undergo drug rehabilitation, including drug testing.  </P> <P> The mother challenged the action in court. But last Nov. 15, the state Court of  Appeal upheld the removal of the child, saying officials had acted properly to  protect the boy from abuse and neglect.  </P> <P> "The severe problem of babies born under the influence of dangerous drugs due  to their mothers' use of such drugs during pregnancy has reached great  proportions," Appellate Justice Charles W. Froehlich, Jr., wrote for the panel.  "We agree that prenatal use of dangerous drugs by a mother is (evidence) of  future child neglect."  </P> <P> The court acknowledged that the fetus does not enjoy the same legal status as a  child after birth. But nonetheless, it said, a living child "must be afforded  the protection of the Juvenile Court even though he is at risk because of his  mother's actions before his birth."  </P></p>

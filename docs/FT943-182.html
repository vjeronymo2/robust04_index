			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Observer: Pique in Greek Two consortia bid to build an underground railway in Thessaloniki in northern Greece. One is Greek-led, the other a Franco-Canadian combine. So which does the government back? Well, it's not the home team. Despite the fact that Macedonian Metro - led by the country's biggest construction company Mechaniki - came up with the lower bid of Dr120bn (Dollars 500m), it now seems to be out of the running. The committee set up by the public works ministry to evaluate the project did not bother to meet the consortium partners and simply rejected their financing arrangements as 'insecure'. This prompted an apopletic Prodromos Emfietzoglou, Mechaniki's founder chairman, to attack the government. He has been waving around copies of letters from the European Investment Bank offering to finance half the cost of the project, another from Germany's state-owned development aid bank Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KFW) for another 40 per cent, and a third from Citibank and others offering a further 15 per cent. To add insult to injury, Emfietzoglou knows the committee's chairman, Kyriakos Anastasiades - they were classmates at engineering school. Their paths have subsequently diverged, however. The former has risen to the very top of Mechaniki, while Anastasiades remains a poorly paid professor of civil engineering at the country's Thessaloniki University. Tut tut. Not a touch of professional jealousy, surely?</p>

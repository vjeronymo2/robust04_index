			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 21 Mar (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has  announced that Dennis Ross, the U.S. envoy and coordinator on  the Middle East peace talks, will arrive in Cairo tomorrow,  Tuesday, to hold talks and consultations on the peace process.  This comes as part of his tour of the region to discuss current  contacts and the resumption of negotiations.    Musa said in statements today that after the negotiations  resume, the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles should  be implemented quickly and autonomy should begin in Gaza and  Jericho. He added that there is no reason for the continuous  stalling and postponement of the Israeli withdrawal and  implementation of the agenda agreed on in the Declaration of  Principles. We are waiting for this agenda to be finalized, he  said, as long as all the parties agree to negotiate.    As for postponing negotiations on the settlements until the  final stages of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, Musa said  in his statements that the final stage of the negotiations must  not be delayed beyond the end of the second year after  implementing the current agreement on Gaza and Jericho.    The foreign minister clarified that if the Israeli  withdrawal  and Palestinian repatriation were to begin a month from now, in  April, for example, arrangements should begin then.    'Amr Musa affirmed that the important issue is to  immediately  stop building new settlements in the occupied Arab territories.  No new settlements should be built.    'Amr Musa affirmed that the presence of settlements in the  occupied Arab territories causes security violations. Besides,  the territories on which these settlements are built do not  belong to them. They have absolutely no right to build. Most  settlers are criminals, which is not acceptable. We understand  that there can be coexistence but we do not understand why a  group of crazy criminals or crazy people should be in control,  such as Gush Emunim, Kahana Hay, and their ilk, because this is  terrorism in its purest form; it is the dangerous and blind kind  of terrorism based on fanaticism that is recognized by no law.  This is a very important issue.    The foreign minister again demanded that the Palestinians be  provided with security. He said this is the lesson we have  learned from the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. Musa also asked  the Israeli occupation forces to provide the Palestinian people  under occupation with protection. This is stipulated by  international resolutions.    On the Addis Ababa meeting to convene on 23 March, Musa said  that one of the most important topics proposed to the meeting is  the mechanism for resolving conflicts in Africa. It will be  chaired by Egypt, the current chairman of the OAU.    He said the mechanism will address the issue of the OAU's  intervention in current conflicts and in the prevention of  disputes that might erupt.    He added that they will discuss the Somalia issue and  developments in this connection following the dialogue that took  place in Egypt among the 13 Somali factions. Burundi, the  conflict between Cameroon and Nigeria, and the situation in  Rwanda will also be addressed.</p>

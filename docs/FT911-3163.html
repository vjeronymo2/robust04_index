			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Survey of Cornwall (7): A policy for youth - Cornwall pioneers training schemes BRITAIN'S first Training and Enterprise Council, for Devon and Cornwall, was established just over a year ago at the beginning of April 1990. The Councils (known as Tecs) are a mechanism for giving local businessmen and employers a greater involvement in recruitment and training. They took over responsibility, from the government's Training Agency, for the two major unemployment schemes, the Youth Training Scheme (YTS) and Employment Training (ET) for the older long-term jobless. (The Training Agency, which has its headquarters in Sheffield, was previously the Manpower Services Commission.) The Devon and Cornwall Tec consists of a main board in Plymouth and five area boards (Tabs), including one for Cornwall. The Tabs also offer a business advisory service, administer enterprise allowances and run a programme of business seminars. The two big employment programmes took the lion's share of spending, probably around Pounds 20m for the YTS in the last 12 months and possibly Pounds 11m for all the TECs. Some 7,500 youngsters have been involved in the YTS administered by the Devon and Cornwall Tec. Other young people from the area, including some in the Cornwall Tab area, took part in nationally administered schemes. Precise numbers of people associated with employment training are hard to assess. Some people have been involved for only a few hours going along and seeing what the scheme meant. However, at any given time in the last year there were probably around 5,000 tied in in some way with employment training. This year, the Devon and Cornwall Tec has an overall budget of Pounds 49.7m, of which Pounds 29.6m will be spent on young people and Pounds 9.7m on adults. The rest will go on management costs, business programmes and local initiatives. Roughly two-thirds of the total will be spent in Devon and one-third in Cornwall. The YTS and the ET have been criticised as being too broad brush and insufficiently interested in training. They were aimed chiefly at alleviating unemployment, and some employers, it is said, saw the YTS as a pool of obtaining cheap labour. Young people who entered the YTS complained that it was just a way of denying them unemployment benefit. By giving young people YTS money instead of the dole the unemployment figures were made to look better. While there was theoretically a retraining element in the job to which they were directed, this was not always so in practice. The YTS gave way to youth training and this in turn is now being replaced by another more wideranging scheme - Training Credits. This involves the careers service office, which is part of the local education authority, employers' organisations, employers, licensed providers, approved trainers and, of course, the young people themselves. The process starts when a young person goes to the careers advisory service. An action plan for work and training is then drawn up. If the youngster is lucky enough to find a job straight off the employer gets together with the employee and the approved trainer to organise the job and the training and the voucher (or 'credit') is triggered. The credit can be anything from Pounds 1,000 to Pounds 4,500 depending on time and qualifications aimed for. If no job is immediately on offer the young person takes his action plan from the career service to a licensed provider. This person makes an assessment and transitional training is given until the right kind of job is found, and the voucher is put into effect In practice the process should be less tangled than it sounds. But there are problems. So far in Cornwall, the Tab has appointed six licensed providers and some 90 bodies have applied to become approved trainers. Around 30 have been approved so far. One is Cornwall College, a college of further education, which has a reputation for adapting to the changing needs of education. (It can also organise some degrees courses in association with the Polytechnic in Plymouth.) Its unconventional approach is reflected in its use of a a 60 ft long bus equipped with a video computer, 12-seat lecture room and some catering facilities, which physically takes the school to the pupils. Cornwall has a distinct pattern of unemployment. Its 10 per cent seasonally adjusted rate is one of the highest rates in the country. It also has among the lowest wage rates. With the tin mining industry collapsing and English China Clays, one of the largest manufacturing concerns laying off 750 people, there are particular problems among the older unemployed. The Tab is trying to address these specific problems. Approved trainers such as Cornwall College can help by acknowledging that the major industry is now tourism, and by tailoring its courses and training accordingly.</p>

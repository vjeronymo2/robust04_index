			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: MEDICAL  </P> <P> Disease Detection International Inc. said it has received U.S. Food and Drug  Administration approval to market blood tests that can measure the presence of  antibodies to viruses that cause rubella, herpes, cytomegalvirus or toxoplasma  within 7 minutes in a doctor's office.  </P> <P> Current tests, which typically are conducted in clinical laboratories, require  blood samples to be diluted and take several hours to complete, the Irvine  diagnostics company said.  </P> <P> The tests, called SeroCard tests, use plastic cards embedded with membranes on  which doctors place a drop of blood from a patient's finger. DDI President H.  Thad Morris said the appearance of a blue spot on the card indicates a positive  test.  </P> <P> A positive test means that antibodies to the viruses are present in the  bloodstream and that the patient has developed an immunity to further  infection.  </P> <P> The company said the tests are most often conducted to determine if pregnant  women are susceptible to the viral infections, which can cause birth defects.  </P> <P> Rubella, also known as German measles, causes enlargement of lymph nodes in the  neck and a rash. Herpes is a skin inflammation characterized by small blisters.  Cytomegalvirus is a disease involving abnormal cell enlargement. Toxoplasma is  a parasitic organism sometimes found in uncooked pork products.  </P> <P> DDI said it has developed a similar 7-minute physician-conducted test to detect  the presence of antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which  causes AIDS. A positive HIV test indicates the presence of antibodies, however  the antibodies have not successfully fought the virus.  </P> <P> The company said that later this year it will seek FDA formal clinical approval  for the HIV test.  </P> <P> The HIV test was developed jointly with Ferring Pharmaceuticals in Sweden. DDI  said that, so far, it has tested more than 2,000 clinical specimens using the  SeroCard. And it is selling the test for research and investigative use by  physicians.  </P> <P> Morris said the company expects to receive Swedish regulatory approval to  market the product later this spring. If U.S. approval is not received, he  said, Ferring will begin production in Sweden, and DDI will seek marketing  approval in other European countries and in Japan.  </P> <P> Morris said the FDA has told him there are "many questions that must be  answered" before approval will be granted.  </P></p>

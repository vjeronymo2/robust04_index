			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Pick up a P-P-Pib . . . - Scheherazade Daneshkhu follows the fortunes of a popular investment As prices of bonds and other fixed-interest investments have fallen, permanent-interest bearing shares (Pibs) have not been immune from the drop. These are issued by building societies to raise capital but, in spite of their name, are not the type of share that gives investors a slice of a company's assets. Instead, they are loans from the investor to the society. They have been popular with private investors because of the relatively high income they can provide, even though the Pibs market is relatively small and illiquid - the sort of market in which institutions rather than individuals are more usually to be found. The table shows the coupon and present yields on Pibs. Gross yields of 9.16 per cent to more than 11 per cent are attractive to income-seekers at a time when base rates are 5.25 per cent. Also, Pibs held directly are exempt from capital gains tax. The level of income, however, is a reflection of greater risk. Pibs offer higher yields than gilts because building societies are less secure than the government. And they are irredeemable, which means there is no repayment date: hence the name 'permanent interest-bearing.' Investors can get back their capital only by selling in the stock market - where prices fluctuate. In addition, Pibs are deeply subordinated. This means that if the building society were to collapse, investors in Pibs would rank behind all other lenders, depositors and shareholders for repayment. There is no compensation scheme to protect them, either. Investors in Pibs have been experiencing ups and downs over the past few weeks. 'Pibs have suffered recently, with prices falling in excess of gilt prices as retail investors look to take profits,' says Simon Mozley, of Hoare Govett. Some Pibs have suffered more than others. 'Issues by North of England and Newcastle have been held predominantly by private individuals and the shortage of stock has meant that, historically, they have been on very tight spreads,' adds Mozley, referring to the difference in buying and selling prices. 'It is not surprising that they have seen the most extreme price fall with no institutional support. Issues by the Halifax and Leeds have shown the least underperformance, reflecting the strong institutional holding.' Should those holding Pibs be worried about the fall in prices? A look at the table shows that if most investors bought them at face value, they would be sitting on a reasonable profit in capital appreciation terms. But Pibs tend to be bought by private individuals for the income they provide, not as speculative instruments for capital growth. Richard Boyton, of Boyton Financial Services, says: 'Obviously, Pibs are interest-rate sensitive and there has been a wonderful run of capital appreciation. I believe we are at or near the bottom of the interest rate cycle. As interest rates climb, the value of Pibs will fall; but if you bought Pibs for the income stream, you should ignore the underlying fluctuating capital value.' Although Boyton does not advise selling the Pibs, at the moment he prefers stepped preference shares for those who want a steady income. These are company shares earning a pre-determined income which rises steadily by a set amount each year to the winding-up date. Simon John Knott, head of private client research at stockbroker Greig Middleton, also does not think those holding Pibs should be panicked into selling them. 'We are still expecting a fall in interest rates, and the 9 per cent yield you can get on Pibs is very attractive, especially if you are in a high-quality society. We always recommend that the society be in the top 10.' The societies listed in the table which are in the top 10 by asset size are Halifax, Leeds, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, Bradford &amp; Bingley, Britannia, and Bristol &amp; West. Many private investors may be unable (or reluctant) to buy the minimum holding of Pounds 50,000 for Halifax, Leeds and C&amp;G Pibs. The minimum investment in Bradford &amp; Bingley Pibs is Pounds 10,000, while the most affordable Pibs are those of Britannia and Bristol &amp; West (the ninth and 10th-largest societies) with a minimum Pounds 1,000 holding. 'If you choose the right Pibs, it is an excellent way to lock into high returns for the long-term,' says Knott. 'But if rates start to go up, your capital losses will be higher than for gilts.' Since the only way to get back your capital is to sell in the market, there is always the danger that the price could be lower than what you paid. Investors who appreciate both the advantages and drawbacks of Pibs, and need income, can continue to hold them as part of a wider investment portfolio. Those who have not been aware of the risks, or who want to preserve their capital against the danger of a steep fall in prices, may prefer to consider selling them. But they should take financial advice before doing so.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                 PERMANENT INTEREST-BEARING SHARES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Stock                       Coupon       Minimum     Issue date                            (gross %)     (pounds)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Birmingham Midshires         9.38          1,000      16/12/93 Bradford &amp; Bingley          13.00         10,000       30/9/91 Bradford &amp; Bingley          11.63         10,000       29/6/92 Bristol &amp; West              13.38          1,000      11/12/91 Bristol &amp; West              13.38          1,000      31/10/91 Britannia (1st)             13.00          1,000       13/1/92 Britannia (2nd)             13.00          1,000       8/10/92 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucs         11.75         50,000      21/10/92 Coventry**                  12.13          1,000       28/5/92 First National              11.75         10,000        4/5/93 Halifax                     12.00         50,000       23/1/92 Halifax                      8.75         50,000        7/9/93 Leeds Permanent             13.63         50,000        3/6/91 Leeds &amp; Holbeck             13.38          1,000       31/3/92 Newcastle                   12.63          1,000        8/9/92 Newcastle                   10.75          1,000       15/6/93 North of England            12.63          1,000       23/6/92 Skipton                     12.88          1,000       27/2/92  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Stock                     Issue price     Price*       Yield*                             (pence)       (pence)    (gross, %)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Birmingham Midshires        100.17         93.00        10.08 Bradford &amp; Bingley          100.20        131.25         9.90 Bradford &amp; Bingley          100.13        118.50         9.81 Bristol &amp; West              101.79        125.25        10.68 Bristol &amp; West              100.34        125.25        10.68 Britannia (1st)             100.42        124.75        10.42 Britannia (2nd)             107.13        124.75        10.42 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucs         100.96        119.50         9.83 Coventry**                  100.75        114.75        10.57 First National              100.25        106.75        11.01 Halifax                     100.28        127.75         9.39 Halifax                     100.62         95.50         9.16 Leeds Permanent             100.00        140.50         9.70 Leeds &amp; Holbeck             100.23        128.75        10.39 Newcastle                   100.45        120.00        10.52 Newcastle                   100.32        103.00        10.44 North of England            100.14        119.50        10.56 Skipton                     100.48        122.00        10.55  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Hoare Govett. *Purchase price as at close February 24; excludes accrued interest **includes stamp duty payable on Coventry pibs only  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

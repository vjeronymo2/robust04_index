			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 16 Feb (MENA)--Shulamit Aloni, Israeli  director of scientific research and communications [title as  received], has called for the return of the occupied Golan  Heights to Syria. She has also expressed her opposition to the  idea of holding a referendum on withdrawal from the Heights,  stressing that the Israeli Government has full authority to make  a political decision without the need for a referendum.    In an interview to be published in the 17 February issue of  the magazine AL-MUSAWWAR, she said that in accordance with  international law, the Golan Heights must return to Syria. She  indicated that the problem with the negotiations lies in the  timeframe and the security arrangements.    The Israeli minister criticized the Israeli Government's  lukewarm reaction to the Geneva summit between Syrian President  Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton.    On the Israeli request for a meeting between President  al-Asad and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, Aloni  explained that such a meeting might set things in motion.    On Israel's arbitrary measures in the occupied territories,  Aloni said: In my opinion, we as a people are living with a  sharp moral dilemma. We speak about democracy and human rights  while we rob the Palestinian people of their rights. She  indicated that the mutual recognition between Israel and the PLO  will entrench equality and mutual respect.    Regarding armaments and nuclear deterrents, Aloni said:  Israel's fears are from Iran and Iraq. These fears extend to  the whole region. So Israel is arming itself with long-range  weapons that act as a deterrent against Iraq and Iran and, to  some extent, against Syria. She indicated that after progress  is made in the peace process, this topic will be submitted for  discussion with Egypt and Syria.    On Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon, Aloni said Israel  has no ambitions in Lebanon. It will withdraw from south  Lebanon when peace is established with Syria.</p>

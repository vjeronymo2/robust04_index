			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Tellers Commission has just taken the rostrum  and announced the respective votes. There were two candidates,  I'd like to remind you -- Yuriy Petrovich Vlasov and Ivan  Petrovich Rybkin -- and the vote went the following way: for  Vlasov -- 23 deputies for and 311 against; for Rybkin -- 223 for  and 101 against. So Ivan Petrovich Rybkin, representing the  Agrarian Party, is elected chairman of the State Duma with one  vote over the minimum. He needed 222 votes and got 223, so he  has been elected.    But there is some discussion at the moment about one ballot  being disputed, but it's difficult to say while this discussion  is going on. So far, however, the news is that Rybkin, Ivan  Petrovich, representative of the Agrarian Party, has been  elected chairman of the State Duma. Thank you.</p>

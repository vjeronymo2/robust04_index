			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Taiwan set to lift rice import ban Taiwan plans to lift its two-decade-old ban on rice imports in 1995 if it can join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) this year, the government's Council of Agriculture said yesterday, Reuter reports from Taipei. 'The council has decided in principle how to deal with rice imports once Taiwan enters Gatt this year,' Mr Lee Cheng-chung, head of the council's food and agriculture department, said. 'We would start by importing 1 per cent of our annual rice consumption in 1995 and gradually rise to 4 per cent in the tenth year, similar to South Korea's plans,' he said.</p>

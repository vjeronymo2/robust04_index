			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Kurt Swart] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 22 SAPA -- More than 93,000  policemen and 67 companies of SA Defence Force troops would be  on duty to protect voters on election days, the Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC] and security force officers said on  Friday [22 April]. At a news conference on security arrangements  for the election, IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler said  it would be unrealistic to expect no intimidation or attempted  disruptions on voting days.    "But the security forces are alert and ready to deal with  them," he said.    SA Police Deputy Commissioner Gen Johan Swart said policing  the elections would be the most significant and daunting task  ever undertaken by the SAP [South African Police]. "I believe  the police have the expertise and the motivation to take on this  enormous responsibility. We realise the eyes of the world will  be focused on South Africa. We will do everything in our power  to ensure the elections will be a success."    Each police region had a detailed plan in place and every  policeman who would be on duty at the 9,000 polling stations had  received special training. All available police reservists had  been called up and 8,000 had responded. "We have placed the  entire police force on full standby. We will engage 93,000 men  and women for functional duties. In each police region we have  appointed teams of top detectives to deal with intimidation, to  investigate as quickly as possible and to bring perpertrators to  book," said Gen Swart.    Police would be assisted by thousands of traffic officers  and  civil defence agencies which were on full alert.    "I wish to assure the public to remain calm. There is no  cause for alarm or over-reaction. Security forces will maintain  high visibility."    Gen Swart said there were small groups considering  disrupting  the elections and he warned them they would be arrested and  detained until after the elections. Police would do everything  possible to refuse bail. "There are areas where we expect  trouble. We will monitor these areas but we will not tell you  where they are," he told journalists.    SADF [South African Defense Force] Communications Chief  Director Gen Gert Opperman said the army was committed to the  process of change and would do everything in its power to  contribute to free and fair elections next week. "We have  called up members of part-time forces so that we have sufficient  manpower. We appeal to employers, the men called up, their  relatives and friends to support the call-up as it is in the  national interest. Without them the SADF will not be able to  perform its expected task."    Tons of ballot papers had been stored at army bases and the  air force would transport ballot papers to polling stations.  Operational duties had been well planned in conjunction with the  SAP. Troops would be deployed near polling stations and would  also supply medical support.    The army would deploy 67 companies and more troops were due  to report for duty before April 27. Gen Opperman said he was not  in a position to give the exact number. There would be flexible  and mobile deployment making it unnecessary to have large  numbers of troops at every polling station.    The National Peacekeeping Force was not part of the SADF and  would be disbanded soon after the election. The NPKF would be  deployed on the East Rand in a support role.    "We pride ourselves on our professionalism. We are above  party politics. We do not choose sides and we will act against  any individual who threatens the process regardless of political  affiliations. We are from the nation and for the nation," Gen  Opperman said.    Mr Justice Kriegler said voters who brought firearms or  other  dangerous weapons to polling stations would be  arrested."Contrary to perceptions, security forces will be  entitled to carry arms and will do so at the polling stations.  Police personnel will be present within the inner perimeter of  polling stations and will at all times be under the direction of  the presiding electoral officer at that polling station."    Mr Justice Kriegler criticised a Sunday newspaper report  headlined "Rough Ride on Big Day", which suggested continuous  friction between the IEC and the SAP.    "I met with editors on an off-the-record basis and I  believed  I could rely on the integrity of all those present. Clearly I  was wrong. The report is untrue, malicious, not in the public  interest, and is calculated to induce fear into the minds of the  electorate."    Asked for his hopes and fears for the election, Mr Justice  Kriegler raised chuckles by repyling: "I hope it goes well and I  fear that it won't."</p>

			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Hong Kong (9): Blue collars swapped for white - In a decade, manufacturing output has fallen significantly IT IS largely a matter of nuance. For the government's critics, Hong Kong does not have an industrial policy worthy of the name. But for Mr TH Barma, acting secretary for trade and industry, such a charge is a nonsense. 'We do have an industrial policy,' he insists. 'We have a policy of intervening as little as possible in the marketplace. We see our role mainly as facilitating but we do not intervene to offer direct subsidies and we do not have any predetermined notion of what industries should or should not exist in Hong Kong.' Whether from neglect or design, Hong Kong has undoubtedly adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards economic growth in stark contrast to most other economies in the Asian region - most notably, Singapore. For this reason, Hong Kong is held up by many as an example of the wonders of entrepreneurialism in an environment of unleashed market forces. At one level, the success of the policy is incontestable. As Mr Barma says: 'Over the past 30 to 40 years Hong Kong has had a remarkable rate of growth. With very few natural resources we have become a major trading entity and are now ranked 10th in the league table of industrial powers.' But at a deeper level, there is room for doubt. The policy prescriptions of the past are not always the ideal blueprints for the future and many voices are now being raised urging the government to do more to stimulate growth in higher value-added sectors of the economy. As Hong Kong moves from being a predominantly manufacturing to a service economy, industrialists argue that Hong Kong needs to create more effective 'knowledge' industries which require original research and development. Since the beginning of the 1980s, manufacturing output has fallen from almost 30 per cent of GDP to below 18 per cent. And employment in manufacturing industry has fallen from 900,000 to 650,000. 'We are rapidly changing our blue collars for white,' as one Hong Kong industrialist expresses it. But the fear is that Hong Kong will be left behind in the general upgrading of Asian economies that is currently taking place. The government has a greater role to play in taking the lead but, in the estimation of at least some industrialists, it is in danger of avoiding its responsibilities. Mr James Tien, head of the Textiles Council, says: 'The government's policy of non-interference may have been a good thing in the 1960s and 70s but not now. It is directionless but they dress it up in better terms and call it non-interference.' Officially, the government accepts the need to change and encourage further investment in 'strategic' sectors, such as electronics. The Industry Department has recently set up a HKDollars 200m fund to support investment in industrial research on a matching dollar-for-dollar basis. It intends to invest in research projects before they are mature enough to attract other forms of venture capital. 'We are coming in at the ground floor rather than at the mezzanine level,' as Mr Barma explains it. The Hong Kong Productivity Council, which is subvented by government to the tune of HKDollars 100m a year, also helps to disseminate existing research more widely throughout industry helping to lift levels of productivity. And the government has recently established a University of Science and Technology to raise levels of technological expertise in the colony. In some areas, the Hong Kong government has had a considerable history of being highly interventionist. It has long believed it is government's responsibility to create the framework in which entrepreneurialism can thrive. And so, for example, it subsidises about half of all domestic housing in the colony thereby helping to reduce labour costs. It has also played a substantial role in creating the necessary industrial infrastructure as the vast Port and Airport Development (Pads) project amply testifies. But when critics of the government's industrial policy become too vociferous and claim all this still smacks of too little too late, its supporters rejoin by pushing the unofficial line that it does not matter anyway because of the remarkable fusion of economic activity that has taken place between Hong Kong and China. This line of argument suggests that Hong Kong can defer the day of economic reckoning because of the vast untapped pools of cheap labour it can call upon in China. The rate of expansion in Guangdong province has been prodigious: Hong Kong companies now employ about 3m workers in mainland China, which has recently superseded the US as Hong Kong's biggest trading partner. In this scenario, Hong Kong will act as the service centre for the Chinese hinterland channelling investment into the region and marketing its exports. Mr Ronald Chao, managing director of the Novel Enterprises textiles group, expresses a widespread analogy when he says: 'I think Hong Kong will become like New York and Shanghai like Chicago.' For Hong Kong companies, the appeal of developing businesses in China is easy to see because of the enormous cost advantages. Many industries, particularly in toys, watches and electronics, have largely uprooted their factories in Hong Kong and reopened them on the other side of the border. Ms Christina Cheung, director of Wah Shing Toys a Hong Kong company which has made just such a move, says wages in the toy industry in mainland China are only one-eighth to one-tenth of those in Hong Kong. The rental price of land is only about HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 2 a square foot in China compared with HKDollars 7.50 to HKDollars 10 in Hong Kong. Her views about the economic development of the region are typical of many industrialists. 'I have very strong confidence in the future of China. Once they open up and all the people get in touch with the living standards in the western world and how good a life we have in Hong Kong then they are not likely to go back to the old system,' she says. But such developments throw up new challenges for the Hong Kong government - not least how to ensure by discrete diplomacy that the US does not revoke China's Most Favoured Nation status, a move which would have a devastating impact on many Hong Kong businesses. Mr Dennis Ting, chairman of the Hong Kong toys council, says the withdrawal of MFN status would increase the import duties on Chinese-made toys from 7 per cent to 70 per cent. 'It would kill our industry,' he says.</p>

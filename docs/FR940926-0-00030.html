			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, partnership and direct ownership interests and any voting stock interest amounting to 5% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporate broadcast licensee, cable television system or daily newspaper will be cognizable; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) No minority voting stock interest will be cognizable if there is a single holder of more than 50% of the outstanding voting stock of the corporate broadcast licensee, cable television system or daily newspaper in which the minority interest is held; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Investment companies, as defined in 15 U.S.C. 80a&hyph;3, insurance companies and banks holding stock through their trust departments in trust accounts will be considered to have a cognizable interest only if they hold 10% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporate broadcast licensee, cable television system or daily newspaper, or if any of the officers or directors of the broadcast licensee, cable television system or daily newspaper are representatives of the investment company, insurance company or bank concerned. Holdings by a bank or insurance company will be aggregated if the bank or insurance company has any right to determine how the stock will be voted. Holdings by investment companies will be aggregated if under common management. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Attribution of ownership interests in a broadcast licensee, cable television system or daily newspaper that are held indirectly by any party through one or more intervening corporations will be determined by successive multiplication of the ownership percentages for each link in the vertical ownership chain and application of the relevant attribution benchmark to the resulting product, except that wherever the ownership percentage for any link in the chain exceeds 50%, it shall not be included for purposes of this multiplication. [For example, if A owns 10% of company X, which owns 60% of company Y, which owns 25% of ``Licensee,'' then X's interest in ``Licensee'' would be 25% (the same as Y's interest since X's interest in Y exceeds 50%), and A's interest in ``Licensee'' would be 2.5% (0.1&times;0.25). Under the 5% attribution benchmark, X's interest in ``Licensee'' would be cognizable, while A's interest would not be cognizable.] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Voting stock interests held in trust shall be attributed to any person who holds or shares the power to vote such stock, to any person who has the sole power to sell such stock, and to any person who has the right to revoke the trust at will or to replace the trustee at will. If the trustee has a familial, personal or extra-trust business relationship to the grantor or the beneficiary, the grantor or beneficiary, as appropriate, will be attributed with the stock interests held in trust. An otherwise qualified trust will be ineffective to insulate the grantor or beneficiary from attribution with the trust's assets unless all voting stock interests held by the grantor or beneficiary in the relevant broadcast licensee, cable television system or daily newspaper are subject to said trust. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Holders of non-voting stock shall not be attributed an interest in the issuing entity. Holders of debt and instruments such as warrants, convertible debentures, options or other non-voting interests with rights of conversion to voting interests shall not be attributed unless and until conversion is effected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)(1) A limited partnership interest shall be attributed to a limited partner unless that partner is not materially involved, directly or indirectly, in the management or operation of the media-related activities of the partnership and the licensee or system so certifies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In order for a licensee or system to make the certification set forth in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, it must verify that the partnership agreement or certificate of limited partnership, with respect to the particular limited partner exempt from attribution, establishes that the exempt limited partner has no material involvement, directly or indirectly, in the management or operation of the media activities of the partnership. The criteria which would assume adequate insulation for purposes of this certification are described in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Memorandum Opinion and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  in MM Docket No. 83&hyph;46, FCC 85&hyph;252 (released June 24, 1985), as modified on reconsideration in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Memorandum Opinion and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  in MM Docket No. 83&hyph;46, FCC 86&hyph;410 (released November 28, 1986). Irrespective of the terms of the certificate of limited partnership or partnership agreement, however, no such certification shall be made if the individual or entity making the certification has actual knowledge of any material involvement of the limited partners in the management or operation of the media-related businesses of the partnership. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Officers and directors of a broadcast licensee, cable television system or daily newspaper are considered to have a cognizable interest in the entity with which they are so associated. If any such entity engages in businesses in addition to its primary business of broadcasting, cable television service or newspaper publication, it may request the Commission to waive attribution for any officer or director whose duties and responsibilities are wholly unrelated to its primary business. The officers and directors of a parent company of a broadcast licensee, cable television system or daily newspaper, with an attributable interest in any such subsidiary entity, shall be deemed to have a cognizable interest in the subsidiary unless the duties and responsibilities of the officer or director involved are wholly unrelated to the broadcast licensee, cable television system or daily newspaper subsidiary, and a statement properly documenting this fact is submitted to the Commission. [This statement may be included on the appropriate Ownership Report.] The officers and directors of a sister corporation of a broadcast licensee, cable television system or daily newspaper shall not be attributed with ownership of these entities by virtue of such status. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Discrete ownership interests will be aggregated in determining whether or not an interest is cognizable under this section. An individual or entity will be deemed to have a cognizable investment if: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The sum of the interests held by or through ``passive investors'' is equal to or exceeds 10 percent; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The sum of the interests other than those held by or through ``passive investors'' is equal to or exceeds 5 percent; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The sum of the interests computed under paragraph (i)(1) of this section plus the sum of the interests computed under paragraph (i)(2) of this section is equal to or exceeds 10 percent. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note 3: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  In cases where record and beneficial ownership of voting stock is not identical ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , bank nominees holding stock as record owners for the benefit of mutual funds, brokerage houses holding stock in street names for the benefit of customers, investment advisors holding stock in their own names for the benefit of clients, and insurance companies holding stock), the party having the right to determine how the stock will be voted will be considered to own it for purposes of these rules. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note 4: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section will not be applied so as to require divestiture, by any licensee, of existing facilities, and will not apply to applications for increased power for Class C stations, to applications for assignment of license or transfer of control filed in accordance with &sect;73.3540(f) or &sect;73.3541(b), or to applications for assignment of license or transfer of control to heirs or legatees by will or intestacy if no new or increased overlap would be created between commonly owned, operated or controlled broadcast stations in the same service and if no new encompassment of Communities proscribed in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section as to commonly owned, operated or controlled broadcast stations or daily newspaper would result. Said paragraphs will apply to all applications for new stations, to all other applications for assignment or transfer, and to all applications for major changes in existing stations except major changes that will result in overlap of contours of broadcast stations in the same service with each other no greater than already existing. (The resulting areas of overlap of contours of such broadcast stations with each other in such major change cases may consist partly or entirely of new terrain. However, if the population in the resulting areas substantially exceeds that in the previously existing overlap areas, the Commission will not grant the application if it finds that to do so would be against the public interest, convenience or necessity.) Commonly owned, operated or controlled broadcast stations with overlapping contours or with community-encompassing contours prohibited by this section may not be assigned or transferred to a single person, group or entity, except as provided above in this note and by &sect;73.3555(a). If a commonly owned, operated or controlled broadcast station and daily newspaper fall within the encompassing proscription of this section, the station may not be assigned to a single person, group or entity if the newspaper is being simultaneously sold to such single person, group or entity. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

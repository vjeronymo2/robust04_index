			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / US reports fall in jobless rate to 7.7% THE US jobless rate fell slightly last month to 7.7 per cent partly as a result of increased federal funding for a summer jobs programme, the Labour Department reported yesterday. The figures were a relief for President George Bush after a sharp rise in unemployment in June, but were not good enough to give him a significant economic boost ahead of the Republican party convention in Houston this month. At a news conference yesterday, President Bush said: 'I simply cannot be satisfied until every American who wants a job has one.' The figures represented the first improvement in the rate of unemployment since April, when it dipped to 7.2 per cent. In May and June, unemployment jumped by 0.6 percentage point to an eight-year high of 7.8 per cent, giving Democrats ammunition for their charges that the Republicans had mishandled the economy. In financial markets, the figures were seen as consistent with a raft of data indicating that the economy is creeping ahead, but at a far slower pace than in previous recoveries. Foreign exchange dealers were disappointed, however, and the Fed intervened in the markets during the day. Officials said employment in non-agricultural sectors rose nearly 200,000 last month to 108.6m, one of the strongest gains in the past two years. They also sharply revised down estimates of job losses in June - to a net decline of 60,000 rather than the 117,000 initially reported. However, the headline figures overstated the economy's underlying strength. Nearly all the job growth was concentrated in services and local government. Service sector employment rose 110,000, with much of the gain in health and social services. Local government employment rose 90,000, with two-thirds of the increase reflecting increased federal funding for a summer youth jobs and training programme. Employment in the goods-producing sectors was flat. Manufacturing employment held steady at 18.2m after a sharp decline in June. Construction employment fell slightly for the second month running. The overall unemployment rate fell to 7.7 per cent compared with 7.8 in June and about 5.5 when the recession began two years ago.</p>

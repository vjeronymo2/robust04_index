			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Technology: Military eyes in the sky - A look at a French project to make Europe's spy satellites less US-dependent In one respect, president Saddam Hussein's imitation of the grand old Duke of York in marching his men to the Kuwaiti border and then marching them back again came at just the right time for the French government. It helped remind France's politicians, taxpayers and European partners how essential satellite intelligence was to tracking the vagaries of Iraqi troop movements this time, just as it was during the Gulf war of 1991; it reminded everyone of why Paris plans to raise spending on military space activities, mostly spy satellites, by 24 per cent to FFr5bn (Pounds 590m) in 1995 alone. France's overall political aim is to make itself in particular, and Europe in general, less dependent on the US for military satellite information. In the 1991 war France's Spot civil satellite produced a useful complement to the Pentagon's KH (Key Hole) military satellites, because Spot produces stereoscopic photos, providing a three-dimensional image. But Spot lacks the pinpoint detection of America's 'Big Birds', as it is unable to detect anything less than 10m wide. France has been spending heavily on military satellites since 1986 when it started the Helios I programme with Italy and Spain which are funding, respectively, 14 and 7 per cent of the programme. Early next year Ariane is due to put into orbit the first Helios 1 satellite, whose images will be processed at Torrejon in Spain. This ex-US Air Force base near Madrid has been converted into a satellite picture processing unit run by the Western European Union, the defence wing of the European Union, which has so far only been fed by images from Spot. The French are well aware, however, that Helios I is far from completely answering Europe's needs. It may cost more than FFr11bn, but it is simply an optic system and can take photographs only during the day and in good weather. Enough, perhaps, to cope with the interests that Helios I's three partners have in the Mediterranean, but not much good for covering the often-cloudy regions of northern and eastern Europe. Nor will the planned successor programme, Helios II, be much better in this regard; its infra-red imaging will penetrate night, but not heavy cloud. Spain also said this summer that it would drop out of the FFr7bn Helios II programme because it could no longer afford its 7 per cent share. But hopes are rising in Paris that Germany may at last join in - not necessarily in Helios, but possibly in France's Osiris project for a radar satellite, or in a much more ambitious Europe-wide project being discussed in the WEU. The German government and industry are much more interested in spy satellite detection by radar that pierces clouds and can even reveal subterranean objects, such as bunkers, lying in several metres of loose soil, such as sand. A feasibility study conducted for WEU defence ministers by some 30 companies under the leadership of Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) and a subsidiary, Dornier, which makes medium-range turboprop aircraft, puts the cost of a complete system at up to Ecu14bn (Pounds 11bn) over a life of roughly 1997 to 2022. This seems expensive, but perhaps less so given that WEU's 10 member countries could split the cost over a quarter century and given that the system would include a mix of manoeuvrable radar and optic/infra-red satellites with space-based relay stations. The optic/infra-red satellites would have a resolution down to 50cm-100cm, while that of the radar satellites would be 3m. Different platforms are needed because radar imaging is carried out at an oblique angle and therefore on a satellite on a different orbit to optic or infra-red photography which is conducted vertically above the target. As for relaying images to the processing centre, the only alternative to space-based relay stations would be to have ground stations around the globe. Not surprisingly, the WEU project is hanging fire. Cost is the overwhelming drawback for all WEU members. But there is perhaps another element in the opposition of the two most reluctant countries - Britain and the Netherlands. While both are attached to Nato, the UK is the only Nato ally to which the US gives raw images from its satellites, rather than the processed data Washington gives to the rest of the alliance.</p>

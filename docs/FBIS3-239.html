			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yaounde, 3 Mar (AFP) -- Cameroonian media ran a  number of articles today on the Nigeria-Cameroon border  conflict. The media ran numerous calls to be "vigilant," and  questioned the possibility of a possible "costly war."  Independent newspapers openly criticized the "silence" observed  by the Yaounde government on the matter.    The weekly LA NOUVELLE EXPRESSION ran an article titled  "Sani  Abacha Wants a War" in which it disclosed that France, which has  sent a high-ranking delegation to the two countries, was "now  caught in the middle," involved in a nonaggression pact with  Cameroon and caught up with "its interests" in Nigeria.    Yaounde media were especially critical of the manner in  which  Cameroonian authorities are handling the situation. LE MESSAGER  says that the decision made by the country and announced on 21  February to take the matter to the International Court of  Justice at The Hague is "inadmissible" due to "improper  procedure."    Furthermore, the newspapers blame the government for its  "silence." Neither Paul Biya nor his government has expressed  an opinion on the conflict on the Bakassi Peninsula. LA DETENTE  denounced "the impotence of a decaying power."    Other newspapers, such as PERSPECTIVES HEBDO, describe the  conflict as "a crude plot by foreign secret services" and that  "Paul Biya and Sani Abacha are taking this opportunity to divert  the attention of the people."    Only LA DETENTE condemns some of its colleagues who "have a  tendency to enjoy the misfortunes of the regime," especially by  spreading rumors, like DIKALO, which stated that the 18 and 19  February clashes killed "180 people on the Nigerian side and  four on the Cameroonian side." LA DETENTE reminded the public  that "this is a very serious issue."    Cameroonian television invited Cameroonians to be  "vigilant."  In a program broadcast during the evening of the 2 March  conflict, Cameroonian television asked the public "to sleep with  one eye open, because the enemy never sleeps." The presenter,  reacting to a Nigerian proposal suggesting a bilateral  settlement of the conflict without foreign interference, stated  that this proposal was "a trick to deceive Cameroonians."  However, he added that Cameroon and Nigeria had no interest in  "engaging in a costly war."    Recalling the principle of the inviolability of the border,  the television said that "Cameroon was ready to defend any part  of its national territory. In the television studio, jurists  and professors in the field of international relations denounced  "Nigeria's moves toward annexation," reaffirming the  "non-negotiable character of Bakassi, which is an integral part  of Cameroon."    The television presenter also affirmed that about three  million Nigerians were living in Cameroon and regretted that  "despite the sense of hospitality showed by Cameroonians, these  Nigerians do not always abide by the laws of the land that  welcomed them."</p>

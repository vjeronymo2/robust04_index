			<p>BFN     [Text] The Zambian Government has frozen salary increments  for politicians and top civil servants to help improve the  country's economy. Zambian President Frederick Chiluba has also  asked the international donor community for $10 million to  supplement Zambia's Public Service Wage Bill.    President Chiluba told an International Monetary Fund  representative in Lusaka that Zambia was looking for additional  funds to increase the salaries of poorly paid civil servants.  President Chiluba said the decision to forego salary increments  for top politicians and civil servants was a demonstration of  his government's commitment to the country's economic  restructuring program.</p>

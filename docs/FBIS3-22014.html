			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Colonel Faustino Rico Toro was arrested by the  Special Antinarcotics Force [FELCN] in Cochabamba last night.  Rico Toro was one of former dictator Luis Garcia Meza's close  assistants. But he was not tried with the former dictator.    He was appointed FELCN commander during Jaime Paz Zamora's  government, although he had to resign a few hours later after  observations made by the U.S. Embassy, which had suspicions of  Rico Toro's links to drug traffickers.    His arrest occurred between 2100 and 2300 last night. He is  being detained at a FELCN jail in Cochabamba. There is evidence  against him. He is being questioned, FELCN Deputy Commander  General Rogelio Vargas said.    Vargas added that he did not know whether Rico Toro will be  transferred to La Paz. This is something that must be decided by  prosecutors, he said. In another 48 hours we will know if the  Cochabamba prosecutor's office will bring charges of drug  trafficking against Faustino Rico Toro. If so, he will spend a  few years in prison.</p>

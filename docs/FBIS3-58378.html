			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The NATO summit ended in Brussels this morning.  [passage omitted] Armando Pires, our special envoy, reports.    [Pires] [passage omitted] During a meeting with Portuguese  journalists, Prime Minister Cavaco Silva described as historic  the decisions made at this summit. Cavaco Silva welcomed the  American decision to keep Europe as one of its defense  priorities, and said he believed the summit had eliminated the  areas of disagreement between NATO and the WEU [Western European  Union]. The Prime Minister said the conditions have been  created for both NATO and the WEU to dedicate themselves fully  to the peace operations entrusted to them. One of the decisions  Cavaco Silva described as historic was the Sixteen's approval of  the Partnership for Peace plan. An evolutionary process,  according to him, which will depend on its interpretation by the  East European countries. As is known, the document was not all  the Polish, Hungarians, Czechs, and Slovaks wanted, but Cavaco  Silva explained this with the need not to isolate Moscow in this  process.    [Begin Cavaco recording] We had an Iron Curtain which was  destroyed, and we must not do anything now which would represent  moving an Iron Curtain further east. The main advantage of this  Partnership for Peace is nondiscrimination. It does not  discriminate between any country belonging to the CSCE, it  promises (?peace to all), and I think it would in fact be a  mistake at the moment to discriminate against Russia or Ukraine  or Belarus, or any other country. It is open to all countries  which want to commit themselves to the strengthening of security  in Europe. [end recording] [passage omitted]    [Pires] In the last part of this press conference, Cavaco  Silva expressed the satisfaction of the Portuguese Government  which, following Spain's example, wanted this Brussels summit to  voice its commitment to the defense and security of the  Mediterranean. Europe is today affected not only by the waves  of immigration caused by the regional conflicts spreading in the  region, but also feels the danger caused by the political and  military instability in the so-called European southern flank.  Cavaco Silva revealed that a high-level group was set up to  study the situation in the southern Mediterranean.</p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON SOVIET-AMERICAN RELATIONS;  </P> <P> BUSH HAD STRENGTH NOT TO USE TRUMPS;  </P> <P> THE SOVIETS ARE PLAYING FOR TIME. TO THEIR RELIEF, THE PRESIDENT RESISTED  RIGHT-WING PRESSURES TO APPLY THE HEAT.  </P> <P> It will be awhile before a definitive assessment of the latest Soviet-American  summit is possible, when more becomes known about matters discussed but not yet  revealed and when it becomes clearer how far words will be translated into  actions.  </P> <P> But with the perspective of almost a week's reflection, and leaving aside the  pageantry and the popular excitement, there are some aspects of the summit  whose significance deserves a bit more emphasis than they have received.  </P> <P> From the Soviet point of view, the most important result was that the Soviet  leadership came away reassured that the Bush Administration could be counted  upon not to exploit Soviet weaknesses and troubles -- a matter that the Soviets  had approached with some uneasiness and a sense of vulnerability.  </P> <P> The most significant observation on this point was made by the  independent-minded commentator for Izvestia, Alexander Bovin: "Bush has all the  trumps but he didn't play them. Gorbachev played equal in an unequal position."  The Soviets are, of course, aware of the residual right-wing pressures in this  country to declare victory in the Cold War, and to pressure the Soviet Union  not only for maximum concessions but also with the objective of hastening the  collapse of the Soviet Union. They were relieved that President Bush resisted  these pressures and declared U.S. interest in the continuation of the Soviet  reform efforts.  </P> <P> A related point is that this summit marked a considerable advance in the level  of awareness each side brought to the internal politics within the other  country. They met not simply as two entities but as leaders seeking to manage  and to balance complex political forces at their backs. Each sought to take  account of this additional level of negotiation.  </P> <P> Further, the Soviets recognized that only a centrist and confident conservative  Administration could have successfully weathered the containment of right-wing  pressures in the United States. The attack from right-wing columnists and  politicians has been swift in coming -- on Lithuania, trade, Jewish emigration  and alleged "concessions" on arms control. While George Bush, buttressed by  support from public opinion, could handle these attacks, a Democratic  Administration would have felt politically vulnerable to these charges (as the  cautious sentiment among Democrats on Capitol Hill demonstrates).  </P> <P> Before the summit, the Soviets had been growing increasingly restive and  resentful about the non-responsiveness of the United States on the two issues  of major importance to them -- arms control and trade. They had staked a great  deal on their concessions and overtures to the United States and had come to  feel that this gamble had not paid off. In arms control, they felt that  Washington was playing for unilateral advantages and was not politically  prepared to engage in a major effort to limit the military competition. On  trade, they saw the United States holding back, deterred by residual suspicions  from engaging in more substantial trade relations pending a clarification of  the outcome of the reforms in the Soviet Union. As a result, the Soviets have  been increasingly seeking to cultivate economic relations with Western Europe,  particularly with West Germany.  </P> <P> Now, although they feel that the direction of U.S. policy is more favorable, at  least in tone, they are realistic enough to recognize that progress may be  slow. But they face the future with somewhat greater patience and equanimity.  </P> <P> Although, as has been widely noted, Mikhail Gorbachev's success at the summit  may be of only marginal help to him in facing his domestic problems, about  which he spoke with remarkablecandor and confidence during his visit, he is  palpably restored and confident as he returns to what is likely to be a  critical month ahead. All of his major issues -- the economy, Lithuania and  ethnic violence, the polarization of politics and the future of the Communist  Party -- are coming to a head in this period. Of critical importance will be  the outcome of the remaining regional and local elections and the selection of  delegates to the Communist Party Congress scheduled for July 2. These will  determine whether he will have a working majority among the party apparatchiks,  or whether he will be obliged to let the party decline into splits and  desuetude while he shifts his power base to the office of the presidency in the  state structure.  </P> <P> The unresolved issue concerning the future relations between a reunited Germany  and NATO -- which is a shorthand reference to the broader set of issues  concerning the restructuring of the United States with Europe -- can best be  understood as a dramatic illustration of the way Gorbachev's reforms have  produced unintended and unforeseen consequences, abroad as well as at home.  During the period, in 1988 and early 1989, when Gorbachev was urging the  Communist Party leaders of Eastern Europe to make timely concessions to the  pressures for reform -- in the belief that the process could be controlled and  the parties could maintain traction during the period of change -- it gradually  became clear that the resistance of the old party leaders and their failure to  make timely responses would result in their total loss of power as popular  pressures mounted and took to the streets. Particularly in East Germany, the  unanticipated speed of this disintegration -- and the consequent acceleration  of the movement toward German reunification -- would undermine the Soviet  position in Central Europe. The belated recognition of this outcome was  reflected in the Soviets' rear-guard efforts to salvage some remnants of their  influence by some ill-defined formula for a European security system.  </P> <P> The dilemma for the Soviet Union is that while it badly needs German economic  support for Eastern Europe and for itself, Moscow now contemplates with fear  the prospect of the emergence of Germany over the coming decade as the dominant  power in Europe, which the weakened Soviet Union can see no way of  counterbalancing.  </P> <P> The only way out for the Soviets' is to play for time to seek interim measures  for a transitional period while Germany becomes embraced in a strengthened  European Community, NATO evolves into a political structure for U.S.  participation in European developments and the pan-European institutions begin  to take on vitality and substance.  </P></p>

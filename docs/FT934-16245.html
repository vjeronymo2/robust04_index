			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Irish manoeuvres the non-violent part of the nationalist movement in Northern Ireland - visits Dublin today to give the Irish government a full account of the bilateral talks he has been holding since April with Mr Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein (which represents the violent part), as well as a reaction from Washington where he has been sounding out his friends in the US Congress. The announcement 10 days ago that these talks had reached some kind of conclusion worth reporting to the Irish government has reawakened public interest in that most elusive of political goals, a peaceful settlement of the Northern Irish conflict. The precise content of the report remains private, but its purpose is clear: to devise a political process which would lead to the abandonment by the IRA of their armed struggle, and thereby to bring both strands of nationalism to the negotiating table. Almost simultaneously, it became known the British and Irish governments were jointly drafting a constitutional settlement, to present this to the parties in the province before the end of the year, in which the Irish government would indicate a willingness to modify its constitutional claim to jurisdiction over Northern Ireland to an 'aspiration'. To what extent the two events are linked is unclear, but the sudden publicity given to the second may well have resulted from anxiety in London to minimise the potential fall-out from the first. The British government has enough difficulty fending off the intense suspicion felt by Ulster Unionists about its contacts with Dublin. It knows that that suspicion is liable to become quite unmanageable if it appears at the same time to be negotiating, even indirectly, with the IRA. Intense sensitivities Sir Patrick Mayhew, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, hurriedly confirmed there would be 'no change whatever' in the province's constitutional status without the consent of its people. But he has neither condemned Mr Hume's talks with Sinn Fein, nor ruled out considering their outcome. If these events signify that a peaceful settlement may indeed be moving, however tentatively, within reach, they also highlight the intense sensitivities on all sides to any perceived deviation from established political traditions in dealing with the Northern Ireland issue. The Irish government, under pressure from Britain to alter articles two and three of the republic's constitution (those which lay claim to sovereignty over the whole island), can only do this by referendum, but fears a rebuff from the electorate if a change on such a delicate issue is not part of 'an overall and balanced settlement'. The premature disclosure of the latest Anglo-Irish talks could increase this risk, by making it sound as though Dublin is covertly plotting a deal in which the republic would be expected to give something for nothing. Ringing endorsements Dublin's anger and embarrassment at the disclosure is to be expected and perhaps explains the ringing endorsements of Mr Hume by no less than four Irish cabinet ministers including the Taoiseach, Mr Albert Reynolds, himself. Mr Reynolds has asked the Unionists 'to suspend judgment' on the Hume-Adams talks until it becomes clear what the substance of their joint proposals is. The Unionists are unlikely to hold their breath for long however, especially if the IRA continues with its bomb outrages, as it has done over the past week. Until there is, at least, an effective ceasefire, the idea of Mr Reynolds and Mr Hume considering peace proposals from Sinn Fein will simply reinforce the Unionist belief that all nationalists are the same under the skin, whatever their public statements about violence. The Irish government, too, has it in its power to improve the atmosphere. It could do so by admitting publicly what many Irish politicians will say in private, namely that far from aspiring, let alone claiming, to govern the north, they regard any such prospect with trepidation. A statement to that effect would both give a clearer lead to public opinion in the republic - most of which would probably be more relieved than angered - and offer much-needed reassurance to the anxious majority in the north.</p>

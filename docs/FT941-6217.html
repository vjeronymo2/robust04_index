			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Massacre takes joy from freed prisoners Freedom lacked its zest now they had to live with the memory of last Friday's mosque massacre, released Palestinian prisoners returning to Hebron said yesterday, Reuter reports from Hebron. Israel had said it would release about 500 Palestinian prisoners yesterday, and 300 more by the end of the week in a gesture to calm rage after a Jewish settler gunned down 43 Arabs praying in a mosque at Hebron's Cave of the Patriarchs. A group of about a dozen just-freed young men looked dazed as they walked down a Hebron street carrying their belongings in shoulder bags. Hebron was still under strict curfew and there was none of the public rejoicing that greeted two prisoner releases after September's PLO-Israel peace deal. 'Of course I'm happy to be out. I have not been free for seven years,' said Mr Mohammed Ghaleb Gheith, 29. 'But this is not enough, because of the massacre that happened. I only had five months left to serve anyway.' Friday's massacre and the ensuing clashes were the worst day of bloodshed in Israel's 27-year occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and led to a suspension of Middle East peace talks. The forlorn little group of men had been driven from Ketziot prison camp in Israel's Negev Desert to Hebron in a busload of about 30 prisoners. They were dropped at Israeli occupation headquarters in town and left to find their own way alone. 'I don't even know how I'm going to get home,' said Mr Gheith. Most of the men had been in prison for some years and were first told they would be freed early yesterday. The group included Mr Amin Abu Argoub, 21, who had served 48 months of a 50-month sentence, and Mr Mohammed Abu Kbash, 26, who had served four years and seven months of a five-year sentence. They said all those released were known to the Israeli authorities as supporters of PLO Chairman Yassir Arafat's Fatah faction, although some had become Islamists in prison. They declined to tell what they had been sentenced for, saying only they were involved in 'intifada (Palestinian uprising) activities'. An army communique on the prisoner release said the freed men had not 'shed blood' or been involved in 'terrorist' attacks since the Israel-PLO peace deal. Mr Abu Argoub said he was glad to be out of Israel's notorious Ketziot prison: 'Conditions were bad and getting worse. We were about 25 to a tent and there were a lot of ill prisoners and not enough medicines.' While they talked on the street, an Israeli army patrol stopped and checked their identity papers. Mr Abu Kbash said he had been happy when he heard in prison last year of the Oslo self-rule agreement between the PLO and Israel. But he said the only goal worth achieving was a Palestinian state. 'The Israeli steps, including our release, are not even 1 per cent of what is necessary,' he declared.</p>

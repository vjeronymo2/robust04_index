			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: ENVIRONMENT;  </P> <P> TOXIC WASTE FEARS DELAYED FREEDOM'S NEWSPAPER PURCHASE  </P> <P> When Freedom Newspapers Inc. agreed to buy a group of weekly newspapers in  Orange and Los Angeles counties for an estimated $20 million late last year,  the deal was expected to close by the end of February. But soon March had past,  and still Freedom had not reached a definitive agreement with the seller, Media  General Inc. The contracts were finally signed April 8.  </P> <P> Such a delay would hardly be worth noting, except for the reason behind it:  concerns over environmental liability. Freedom, it seems, wanted to be  absolutely certain that it wasn't buying itself a toxic waste nightmare along  with Golden West Publishing Co., which publishes eight weekly newspapers in the  South County, four in the North County and 10 in the San Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> Golden West chief executive Ron Redfern said the concerns were focused on the  company's printing facility and headquarters in City of Industry. Solvent  contamination had been discovered at a site Golden West had once leased next to  its main plant, and Freedom wanted to be sure there was no repeat.  </P> <P> Redfern noted that the acquisition was a stock transaction and not just an  asset purchase, so Freedom would be liable for any future cleanup obligations.  The company therefore would not sign off on the deal until extensive soil  sampling and other environmental testing had been completed and agreements had  been reached on indemnification.  </P> <P> The astronomical costs of cleaning up toxic wastes -- and a federal law which  allows regulators to seek cleanup money from any company that has ever had  anything to do with the site in question -- has made environmental liability an  increasingly important factor in the corporate acquisitions game.  </P> <P> According to the Wall Street Journal, environmental risk factors have scotched  several recent buyouts, including a $660-million deal by the Sterling Group, a  Houston-based leveraged buyout firm, to purchase a former Koppers Co. chemical  business from Beazer PLC in 1988.  </P></p>

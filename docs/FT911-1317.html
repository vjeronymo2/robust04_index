			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / UK Gilts: Inflation and funding cause concern 'ONE down, two to go' could well serve as the motto for the gilts market at the moment. One worry which the market has put out of its mind concerns a general election. After the Conservative Party's limp performance in Thursday's local elections, the market does not expect a general election until autumn at the earliest. So, after spending much of last week fretting about the outcome of the local elections, the market was firm on Friday and could well see a bounce this week. That leaves two other concerns on which to focus: inflation and funding. May 17 sees the publication of the retail price index for April. The market expects to see a sharp fall in the RPI to 6.1 or 6.2 per cent. It also expects this to trigger another base rate cut, particularly if the unemployment figures, due out that week, show a sharp rise in the number of jobless. In fact the market has already discounted a base rate cut. But, even if the RPI figures are favourable, there is still some uncertainty in the market as to whether underlying inflation is coming down. The other matter currently niggling the market concerns funding. While the Bank of England was delighted with the success of its recent gilts auction, the market is well aware there is still some Pounds 800m of tap stock (the Treasury 9 per cent due 2008) waiting to be taken up. The tap price was set at 94 1/4 while the existing stock has recently traded at around 92 9/16 . Thus the market is eager to know what the Bank of England plans to do next. 'Will the Bank consider cutting the tap price?' is one question the market wants answered. The Bank has cut tap prices before, so such a move would not be unprecedented, though usually the Bank cuts the price only if it feels the market has drifted away from the tap price and is unlikely to bounce back. It would need to feel pretty certain the market had 'bottomed out' or it could find that having cut the tap price, the market simply slipped away again. However, if the market bounces high enough now the local elections are passed, it is conceivable the Bank will get away without having to cut the price at all. Given that the government will need to sell a substantial volume of gilts in order to fund the PSBR (which economists expect will be about Pounds 12bn), there is some pressure on the Bank of England to push ahead with its funding programme. The market is keen to know 'how, when and what' the Bank of England will sell. The Bank has stated it may hold a total of three or four gilt auctions in the 1991/92 fiscal year in addition to gilt taps. However, it claims to have no set calendar for issuance. The assumption in the market is that stock sales will be spread as evenly as possible throughout the year, but few clues have been given as to which maturities the Bank might favour. So far, the Bank has chosen to issue further tranches of existing stock with the intention of improving their liquidity. This is exactly what the market wants - namely more of the same. Mr John Shepperd, economist at S. G. Warburg Securities, thinks the Bank should take the opportunity to improve the liquidity of five and 10-year stocks. Mr John Kendall, economist at Barings, believes there is a strong demand for gilts of up to five years' maturity, both for short-dated liquidity instruments and the swaps market. Also included on the list of desirable issues are: the Treasury stock 10 per cent due 2001, of which there is already about Pounds 2.4bn in existence, but which some would like to see built up as a strong 10-year benchmark gilt; and more of an existing index-linked gilt, preferably one with a maturity of more than 10 years. Traditionally the long end of the yield curve has been left vacant for corporate issuers. But those in the non-gilt sterling market say the lack of suitable longer-dated gilts means even very long-dated corporate bonds, of 20-year maturity and above, have to be priced off gilts, such as the Treasury 9 per cent due 2008.</p>

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Indicator gloomy over recovery THE government yesterday reported that its longer leading index of economic activity fell by 0.9 percentage points last month, adding to the evidence that recovery has been deferred. The Central Statistical Office said the index, which is supposed to identify turning points in the business cycle about 10 months in advance, declined to 103.3 in July from 104.2 in June, after having fluctuated downwards from a recent peak of 106 in October last year. Further evidence of delayed recovery came from the Finance and Leasing Association, which represents organisations responsible for 80 per cent of consumer lending not carried out by clearing banks or building societies. It said 66 per cent of its members expect consumer confidence to improve over the next three months. Gains in confidence predicted after the general election had failed to materialise, however.</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Abolish A-levels, says Royal Society RADICAL reforms to post-16 education and training are proposed in a report by the Royal Society published today. Professor Brian Follett, the society's vice-president, warns: 'The scientific and technological needs of the UK will not be met unless there is radical revision.' The proposals fly in the face of government policy, which is committed to retaining A-levels and resists broadening the traditional two or three-subject course of study for A-level students. The Royal Society, which consists of leading scientists and engineers, is particularly critical of early specialisation, which it says restricts career choice and 'compares unfavourably with the education systems of our European trading partners'. Its report condemns both the low stay-on rate among 16-year-olds and the 'confused and confusing' system for those who do stay on. It cites recent figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which show that only 35 per cent of 17-year-olds in the UK are in full-time education and training, compared with 80 per cent in Germany and 89 per cent in the US. Scotland's staying-on rate is notably higher than England's, and its less specialised and more skills-oriented system is praised by the Society. In its report, the Society proposes a modular two-year 'advanced diploma' to replace A-levels and the wide range of vocational qualifications at present on offer to post-16 students. The Society also proposes a new advanced certificate which would be awarded to those who stay on for only one year after the age of 16. Both the Royal Society's proposed courses would require students to study subjects from three 'domains': the first spanning maths, science and technology; the second economics, industry and society; and the third languages and aesthetics. Maths and science tests for 14-year-olds were postponed yesterday by Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary. He said the tests, due to start next summer, were being delayed for a year while the new national curriculum was streamlined. He also wants the number of attainment targets for science and maths to be reduced. Children would be required to master and then be tested on just five targets in each subject - reduced from 14 in maths and 17 in science. Beyond GCSE.

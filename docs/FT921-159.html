			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: National Westminster Mr Tom Frost of National Westminster was not the City's favourite clearing banker. So one might have expected the bank's share price to rise on news of his departure. Its fall of nearly 1 per cent yesterday simply serves to emphasise the difficulties facing the youthful Mr Derek Wanless, Mr Frost's successor as chief executive. There is little Mr Wanless can do about the effect of high real interest rates on customers such as Heron International. However, he is unproven as a strategist, and some awkward decisions loom, for example over NatWest's US operation which is now returning to profit. A speedy disposal might give the impression of leadership. Unfortunately it would also mean selling at the bottom of the market assets which were originally bought at the top.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["he" report: "Bundesbank Does Not See Any Way To Arrive at </F> Narrower Exchange Rate Fluctuation Ranges Right Now"]    [Text] Frankfurt/Main -- Apart from the targets of the  planned monetary union, the Bundesbank wants a harmonization of  the different "financial cultures" in Europe. It expresses  skepticism about the speed and progress on the path toward the  targets. It says that the prior return of the European  currencies to narrow fluctuation ranges, which were broken down  in mid-1993 in the course of speculation waves, would be  superfluous.    In its business report the Bundesbank once again deals with  the European Monetary system (EMS) crisis, which was mastered by  considerably expanding the fluctuation ranges in the summer of  1993. It calls this solution an "idea that has been advocated by  the Bundesbank in principle in internal discussions for some  time." As advantages of this regulation the Bundesbank cites  the isolation of hard-currency countries from a disturbing  influx of money and the discouragement of currency speculation.  The relatively wide fluctuation ranges were determined by those  countries who want to avoid excessive intervention debts if  possible in the future, because a strong decline in net currency  reserves would damage their credibility. In view of the  efficient and strongly integrated financial markets, a system of  firm, though adjustable exchange rates is always in danger of  being tested.    Conversely, extended periods of stable exchange rates are  better for the cohesion of the monetary union, because the  potential harmony in stability can be better and more quickly  observed. This also includes a rapprochement in the financial  sector. As an "impressive example" for the different "financial  culture" in Europe, the Bundesbank cited the British and the  Germans. While in Great Britain loans with variable interest  rates are widespread, in Germany there is a preference for  longer-term fixed interest rates. Therefore, in Great Britain,  changes in short-term interest rates, which are influenced by  the central bank, have a relatively strong influence on  available income, in particular since private households have  relatively high debts. This has consequences for monetary  policy, as the experience of the EMS crisis in 1992 show.    The experiences gained so far with the wider fluctuation  ranges have shown that the divergence of the exchange rates  stays within narrow limits. Initial exchange rate losses in the  expanded fluctuation ranges have meanwhile been largely  compensated. "Whether and when" narrower fluctuation ranges can  be justified again cannot yet be predicted, in the Bundesbank's  opinion. First of all, it is necessary to observe over a longer  test period how the market courses develop without narrow  "safety fences." The risk of new turbulences should not be  underestimated. One also has to ask whether a formal narrowing  of fluctuation ranges is necessary at all to handle the  transition toward the monetary union.    Nevertheless, the Bundesbank is skeptical regarding the  target of an economic and monetary union before the end of this  century. It refers to the report by the EC Commission, which  shows rather disappointing progress in the member countries.  The situation of public finances has considerably deteriorated  in all countries because of strong slumps in the economic  development, reduced tax revenues, and additional state  expenditures. In 11 of 12 member countries -- including the FRG  -- the budgets did not fulfill the criteria of the monetary  union in 1993. The Bundesbank expressed relief about the  failure of the new "Union loans" to procure money in Brussels  for infrastructure and environmental projects. This would have  opened the door to financing the EC budget via loans in the  longer term and would have undermined the urgently necessary  budget discipline. "The goal of establishing a monetary union  in Europe within the foreseeable future would thus be seriously  endangered," the Bundesbank says.</p>

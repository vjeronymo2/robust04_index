			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Sweden's Securum to seek Pounds 1.73bn Securum, the Swedish state-owned company set up to liquidate Nordbanken's bad loans, yesterday launched a SKr20bn (Pounds 1.73bn) refinancing in the international capital markets in one of the country's biggest non-government debt issues. The funds will be used to repay most of the loans Securum received from Nordbanken, the biggest casualty of Sweden's banking crisis, when it took over SKr67bn worth of sour credits at the start of 1993. The move allows Securum to widen its borrowing base and assists government efforts to privatise Nordbanken by reducing the bank's uncomfortably large exposure to a single client. Privatisation is expected to take place next year, but awaits a formal go-ahead from the new Social Democratic government. Mr Anders Nyren, Securum's chief financial officer, said the company wanted to 'position itself in the international markets for future business transactions.' He stressed there would only be 'a very marginal' increase in the company's funding costs, even though the loans from Nordbanken were granted on a 'cost of funds' basis. Nordbanken will remain Securum's single largest creditor, but outstanding loans are expected to fall to between SKr5bn and SKr10bn from nearly SKr23bn. There are two tranches, both backed by the Swedish government. Under the international one, Chemical Bank and Enskilda Corporate will arrange a Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 857m) five-year syndicated term loan. Terms will be Libor plus 25 basis points. Enskilda Corporate and Nordbanken will arrange a SKr10bn domestic financing programme to run over 10 years, to be split between a SKr5bn subordinated term loan and a SKr5bn subordinated private placement. Securum made a SKr6.3bn profit in the first six months of 1994. It has moved from being a finance company to an investment and property holding group. It has a SKr21bn European asset portfolio outside Sweden and believes its development will benefit from contacts with leading international banks. It plans to list many of its industrial and property operations. The aim is to return at least SKr10bn of its SKr24bn initial equity to the state by the time its assets are liquidated.</p>

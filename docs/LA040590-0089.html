			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LA CRESCENTA AGENCY WILL NOT REDUCE SEWER FEES  </P> <P> Despite widespread protests from residents, directors of a La Crescenta water  agency said this week that they will not lower a 138% increase in sewer fees  imposed last fall.  </P> <P> Hundreds of residents had signed petitions and have protested at meetings since  directors of the Crescenta Valley County Water District raised bimonthly sewer  charges in September for single-family houses from $16.80 to $40.  </P> <P> But after months of study, directors have concluded that the flat per-household  fee is the only acceptable solution to meeting rising costs.  </P> <P> In a statement issued Monday, Robert K. Argenio, district general manager,  said: "Although nobody is happy about the current rate, the pay-as-we-go method  approved by the board of directors some months ago still appears to be the most  equitable and cost-effective way to raise the necessary money."  </P> <P> Irate homeowners led by Marjorie Falloure, a 64-year-old disabled resident,  have called for still another protest at 7:30 tonight at Crescenta Valley High  School.  </P> <P> Falloure has threatened legal action against the water district.  </P> <P> District officials had approved the rate increase in July, saying the higher  fees are necessary to pay the community's estimated $8-million share of about  $3.4 billion in improvements and additions to the Hyperion sewage treatment  plant in Playa del Rey, where sewage from La Crescenta is processed.  </P> <P> State and federal authorities mandated changes at Hyperion years ago and gave  the city of Los Angeles until 1998 to reduce the amount of pollution dumped  into Santa Monica Bay.  </P> <P> The La Crescenta district, like all of the independent agencies and cities that  use Hyperion, is being charged for a portion of the costs. Argenio has warned  that the fees may increase still more.  </P> <P> Falloure and her followers had demanded that the district consider bond  financing, state or federal grants, fees based on water usage, senior citizen  discounts and low-income discounts to help lower the rates for residents who  cannot afford the increase.  </P> <P> But district officials this week said all of those alternatives are too costly,  unavailable, inequitable or unworkable.  </P> <P> Argenio said the study of funding options "has led us back to where we  started."  </P></p>

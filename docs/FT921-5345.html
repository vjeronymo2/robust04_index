			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Arts: The Road - The Cochrane Theatre, WC1 The black Talawa Theatre Company has taken up long-term residence at what we used to know as the Jeannetta Cochrane, now brightly refurbished by a Nigerian architect. Talawa's most recent successes have been in Wilde and Shakespeare, but understandably they have chosen an African play for their housewarming. Not that they play Wole Soyinka's piece (first seen in 1965 at Stratford East) as to the manner born, exactly - there are almost as many different black English accents to be heard as there are actors. The Road is meant to be played out 'on the edge of a Lagos motor park'. Sue Bayes has set it on and among stately heaps of wrecked cars - the Arrabal echo is apt - stacked two and three deep, which immediately fix one theme of the play: that on this road, nobody is going anywhere much. At the rear a handsome arch of stained-glass, suggesting the Christian church that haunts the 'Professor''s mind, is composed of shattered windscreens. There is indeed scarcely any real action, but any amount of colourful byplay, and the car heaps provide ideal springboards for strutting, menacing, leaping and posing, rapid vanishings and reappearances. (The upward hops from ground to car-roofs are particularly impressive.) As directed by Yvonne Brewster, the acting is extrovert and physical above all. The mostly low-life characters have the sharpness of 3-D cartoons: the central pair of no-hopers Samson (Cyril Ikechukwu Nri) and Kotonu, who has gone off being a hired driver (Willie Jonah), the charismatic, obsessive 'Professor' (Ben Thomas with elegant spectacles, watch-chain, shooting-stick and stage-British diction) who has a nice little earner in driver's licence forgery, the American sheriff-style police chief (Gregory Munroe) in cahoots, the wide-boy Say Tokyo Kid (David Webber). Steve Ashton, Lenny Aljernon Edwards and Akim Mogaji offer vivid silhouettes, too. In fact this crew recalls Kurosawa's version of The Lower Depths, and even O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh. Almost everybody projects an image with hopeful, hopeless braggadocio - but nobody believes anybody else. Current folklore has it that Nigerian social intercourse runs on just such funny terms; that may be a myth, but Soyinka illustrates it with bitter, satirical conviction. He does it, however, in language that runs the gamut between what seems to be pungent Nigerian English and his own extravaganzas upon it: polysyllabic, impacted and gnomic. As delivered in all these tantalising dialects, too much of it was impenetrable. For most of the audience, understanding two lines out of three in the first hour or so would have been better than par for the course. Probably we missed flashes of individual character beyond the cartoons; certainly the motor of the play, the Professor's mad, visionary drive toward a blasphemous ceremony which leaves everyone shaken and horrified, revolved in profound obscurity. Though the dramatic rhythm was persuasive enough, we needed - well, subtitles.</p>

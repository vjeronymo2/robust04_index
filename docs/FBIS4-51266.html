			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "China Economic News" column: "China to Set up Gold </F> Exchanges"]    [Text] China's first gold exchange, whose trading  regulations and structure will follow international conventions,  is expected to open for business in Shanghai in the second half  of the year.    According to a manager in the development department of  Shanghai Wanguo Securities, China will set up a few gold  exchanges and has chosen Shanghai to conduct a pilot program  before establishing such institutions in Shenzhen and other  cities. The financial administration of the People's Bank of  China is studying programs on the development of gold exchanges,  including rules and regulations, trading structures, and  traders' qualifications. Gold exchanges in China are aimed  ultimately at opening themselves to the outside world and  establishing links with international markets.</p>

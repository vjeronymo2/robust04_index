			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports, articles, and editorials from the ROK's vernacular  press published on 4 March regarding the 3 March North-South  working-level contact held at Panmunjom to discuss the exchange  of special envoy issue.    The conservative daily CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 a  1,300-word editorial under the headline "North Korea's Endless  Demands." The paper notes that during the 3 March working  contact, North Korea demanded that Patriot missiles not be  brought into South Korea and that President Kim Yong-sam  remarks' saying that "we will not shake hands with people with  nuclear arms" be "canceled officially," in addition to its  previous demand for the suspension of Team Spirit and the  abandonment of the international cooperative system.    Stressing that "pending North-South problems" can be  discussed through the exchange of special envoys and that "more  difficult problems" can be handled by holding a North-South  summit, the editorial points out that the North Korean demand  illustrates that "it is not interested in the envoy exchange,"  and urges Kim Il-song to "apologize" for having triggered the 25  June "southward war of aggression" before North Korea demands  the "cancellation" of President Kim's remarks.    Denouncing the North Korean "haughty attitude," the  editorial  asks: "For what weak points should we always be dragged and  ridiculed by the North Korean authorities?"    Predicting that North Korea will show only the "least false  sincerity" in an attempt to realize a third round of U.S.-North  Korea high-level talks slated for 21 March, the paper condemns  the North for always putting forward "difficult conditions"  after reaching an agreement in principle, referring to our  "experience" in the past North-South dialogue. Pointing to "many  more difficulties and obstacles" laid on the road toward the  settlement of North-South problems, the editorial calls for an  "essential reform" in our attitude toward the North-South  dialogue and for refraining from "making public" our targets for  the dialogue and other plans pertaining to North-South  relations, including public references to a North-South summit.  The editorial urges our side to come to the contact with the  North with "a fair and square attitude" and to employ even "the  strategy of boycott" if the situation does not turns out as we  wish.    The moderate daily TONG-A ILBO publishes on page a  1,300-word  editorial entitled "Preposterous North Korea." Noting that North  Korea uses "negotiation strategy" intended to "disregard" the  South Korean allegation, the paper points out that North Korea  has not changed this strategy in the recent contact for envoy  exchange, and that its demand for the cancellation of President  Kim's remarks and for the abandonment of the plan to deploy  Patriot missiles is "preposterous" and "embarrassing."    The editorial says that since the U.S. delegate to the  negotiations talked about the "abolition" of the South Korean  National Security Law, North Korea will not remain "silent" on  this issue. North Korea will further attempt to "gain more  concessions" while repeatedly putting forward its previous  conditions. Warning that we are apt to regard North Korea as  "easy negotiation partner," the editorial points out various the  "misjudgment" made by our government in the past in dealing with  North Korea, and urges the government and people "not to be  insulted" by the North Korean attitude any longer.    The government-supported daily SEOUL SINMUN publishes on  page  3 a 1,300-word editorial under the headline "North Korea Should  Keenly Realize the South Side's Intention To Suspend Team  Spirit." The paper says that as the result of the beginning of  the nuclear inspection of North Korea by International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA], a North-South working contact was held for  envoy exchange and that the South side announced the  "suspension" of the Team Spirit exercise with a view to urging  the North to accept the inspection and come to North-South  dialogue with "sincerity." Stressing that now is the time for  North Korea to work for ensuring "nuclear transparency" and for  "improving North-South relations," the editorial calls on North  Korea to accept a "special inspection" of the two undeclared  sites on which "suspicion of nuclear development" has been  concentrated and to accept "mutual inspections" between the  North and the South. Recalling the North Korean "stereo-typical  strategy" and "preposterous demands" during North-South  negotiations, the paper warns that if North Korea "stubbornly  adheres to such strategy," the Team Spirit exercise will be  "immediately" resumed. The editorial calls on the North Korean  authorities to be "keenly aware of the significance" of our  government's announcement on the suspension of Team Spirit.    The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO publishes on page 5 a 2,000-word  article by Chon Chong, deputy editor-in-chief of CHUNGANG ILBO,  under the headline, "`Experimentation' by Scholar-turned  Diplomatic and Security Affairs Team."    Pointing to the "negative view" of the people toward North  Korea- U.S. negotiations on the North Korean nuclear issue and  toward our government's countermeasures, the article points out  that from the outset, people were concerned with the  "scholar-turned diplomatic and security affairs team" of the  civilian government and that the people are now aware that "Kim  Il-song is waging a wild game with the United States using the  nuclear issue as his bargaining card." The article stresses that  North Korea's final goal is to establish diplomatic relations  with the United States, because North Korea believes it must  improve these relations if it is to avoid "international  isolation" and "economic crisis," and maintain its political  system.    The article notes, however, that while the United States is  aware of North Korea's delaying tactics, it has been unable to  circumvent North Korean "stubbornness." Commenting on our  government's sandwiched position between the U.S. and North  Korea, the article says that high-ranking diplomats and  government officials are showing increased skepticism on our  "stick and carrot" foreign policy on North Korea and on Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu's "optimism" on North Korea-U.S. talks and  other North-South issues. Thus, the people "undisguisedly"  indicate that there are "problems" in the "strategic concept" of  our scholar-turned security team, including Minister Han, in  diplomatic negotiations. Referring to remarks of a high-ranking  U.S. delegate leading dialogue with North Korea that, "I can  never understand the North Korean intention. North Korea is,  indeed, a shuddering partner," the article warns that adherence  to an "appeasement policy" creates "strategic problems," and  calls for "cool observation" of public opinion.    The moderate MUNHWA ILBO publishes on page 2 a 1,500-word  editorial under the headline, "We Should Look at the Future."  Explaining the process in the past North-South working contact,  the paper says that the stalemate in talks can be attributed to  the South's "passive attitude" and the "insincerity" of the  North Korean authorities' in evading the talks. Pointing out  the significance in the resumption of contacts, the editorial  urges the government to address North-South relations "in an  independent, more positive manner."</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Review of counties' future extended Up to six weeks longer is to be allowed for the first stages of most of the review of local government in the English counties, the Local Government Commission for England said yesterday. The decision follows the government's announcement that it would not appeal against the recent High Court ruling that Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, had acted unlawfully in calling for the two-tier structure of county and district councils to be abandoned in all but 'exceptional' circumstances. The government said some councils had asked the commission for more time to consider their positions because they felt the change of guidance might alter the nature of the submissions they were planning to send to the commission.</p>

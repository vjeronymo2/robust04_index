			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / C&amp;G raises loan rate to 8.1% Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society has followed some of the other large lenders in announcing a rise in its standard variable mortgage rate of 0.46 points to 8.1 per cent. Bristol &amp; West Building Society also announced a rate rise from 7.89 per cent to 8.14 per cent. Any movement in C&amp;G's rates is particularly sensitive because of the agreed cash offer for the society of Pounds 1.8bn by Lloyds Bank. The offer must be approved in separate votes by investing and borrowing members of the society - but C&amp;G has been barred from offering cash inducements to its 370,000 borrowers to vote for the takeover.</p>

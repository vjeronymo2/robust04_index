			<p>BFN     [Text] China does not want the disputes over the  sovereignty of the Spratly islands, a "hot issue" for this  region, to be included in the agenda of the upcoming ASEAN  Regional Forum [ARF] to be held in Bangkok on 25 July. Instead,  it hopes participants will discuss how to establish mutual trust  at the meeting.    Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan made the above  remarks during his meeting with Thai senior foreign ministry  officials in Bangkok yesterday.    Foreign Ministers of the six ASEAN countries, their seven  dialogue partners, and observer nations -- Vietnam, Laos, and  Papua New Guinea -- as well as China and Russia will attend the  ARF meeting to discuss regional political and security  cooperation issues.    Six countries including China, Taiwan, Vietnam, the  Philippines, Brunei, and Malaysia claim sovereignty over the  Spratly islands.    Tang Jianxuan and his delegation arrived in Bangkok late  Monday night for a week-long visit to three ASEAN countries --  Thailand, Malaysia, and Brunei -- to discuss bilateral relations  and issues of common concern.    An informed diplomatic source said during Tang Jiaxuan's  visit to Malaysia from 5 to 7 April and to Brunei from 7 to 9  April, that he will exchange views on the Spratly issue with  Malaysian and Bruneian officials.    During his meeting with Tang Jiaxuan yesterday, Foreign  Minister Prasong Sunsinri assured the Chinese side that Thailand  will uphold the "one-China" policy. He said Thailand will not  invite Taiwan to attend the upcoming ARF meeting in Bangkok.  So, China should not worry about a report that Taiwan would  join the ARF meeting. China had protested when Taiwan President  Li Teng-hui made a "holiday diplomacy" visit to Thailand during  the Chinese New Year.    The informed source also told our correspondent that a  delegation of the Chinese National People's Congress Foreign  Affairs Committee led by its chairman, Zhu Liang, will visit  Thailand from 15 to 21 April as guests of the House Foreign  Affairs Committee. The delegation postponed its visit to  Thailand as a result of Li Teng-hui's visit.    Zhu Liang, age 70, is a native of Chaoyang, Guangdong  Province. He led a delegation to visit Thailand in March 1989  when he was director of the International Liaison Department of  the CPC Central Committee. His former name was Zhou Zhiyi. He  has relatives in Thailand.    Prasong told Tang Jiaxuan that China is an important  consultative partner of ASEAN. ASEAN and China will discuss  ways to strengthen bilateral trade and scientific cooperation  during the 27th Annual ASEAN Foreign Ministerial Meeting in  Bangkok in July.    During the meeting, Tang Jiaxuan welcomed Thailand's  decision  to invite Burma to attend the upcoming annual ASEAN ministerial  meeting as a guest of the host country. Prasong will lead a  delegation to visit Burma in mid-April.    Tang Jiaxuan told Thai officials that Cambodian King Prince  Norodom Sihanouk has recovered and was full of vigor after a  period of recuperation in Beijing. Regarding problems in  Cambodia, China hopes that all Cambodian factions will follow  Prince Norodom Sihanouk's instruction and achieve national  reconciliation.    Regarding the Korean peninsula situation, Tang Jiaxuan said  China wanted to see a nuclear free zone in the Korean peninsula.  He also said that China did not want to see any economic  sanctions against North Korea. China hopes that all parties  concerned will settle the Korean issue through dialogue.    Tang Jiaxuan said that he knew nothing about a report from  Seoul that China will send a delegation to Pyongyang to discuss  the Korean nuclear issue.    Discussing bilateral issues, the Thai and Chinese officials  expressed their satisfaction over their cooperation in all  fields and the exchanges of visits in the past 19 years after  the establishment of diplomatic relations. The two sides agreed  to further strengthen bilateral cooperation in trade, tourism,  and science and technology. The Thai side hoped that Chinese  President Jiang Zemin will pay an official visit to Thailand  this year.    The Buddhist relics preserved in Chinese ancient capital  Xian, will be shipped to Bangkok to be exhibited on the occasion  of the birthday of His Majesty King Phumiphon on 5 December this  year. The Thai side hoped that this exhibition can be extended  till the auspicious 50th anniversary of the present reign of His  Majesty the King.</p>

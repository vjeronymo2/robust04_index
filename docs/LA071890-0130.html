			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GREEN TOLD HE'S STILL IN THE RUNNING;  </P> <P> RAMS: JOHN ROBINSON'S PLANS HAVE ROOM FOR MORE THAN ONE TAILBACK, AND THAT'S  GOOD NEWS FOR ONE FIRST-ROUND DRAFT PICK.  </P> <P> Feeling the crunch of two wasted seasons and an off season dominated by trade  rumors, Gaston Green reported to training camp this week and was told, in  effect, that he had a legitimate shot at salvaging his career and the team's  recent reputation with first-round draft choices.  </P> <P> Then he was sold some swamp land in Florida, right?  </P> <P> Wrong.  </P> <P> Though most have projected Green a distant third behind Curt Warner and  Cleveland Gary in this summer's heated tailback race, Coach John Robinson said  that's simply not the case.  </P> <P> "I just told the players today that we're looking for the three of them to  compete in training camp," Robinson said Tuesday. "There's no one that's the  starter. They're all three competing. The starter comes from the man who  emerges from that group."  </P> <P> Green, of course, has heard it before, only to enter his third NFL season with  61 career carries for 190 yards and no touchdowns.  </P> <P> For some reason, Green likes his chances better this summer.  </P> <P> "I feel that I'm going to get a fair shot," he said. "And all I need is the  opportunity to play."  </P> <P> Green, the 14th selection overall in the 1988 draft and the first running back  taken, has had few opportunities. Through it all, Robinson has defended him,  complimented him, worked with him. He has done everything but play him.  </P> <P> In his rookie season, the former UCLA standout was squeezed out of the picture  by Greg Bell and Charles White. In 1989, the Rams drafted Gary. This spring,  they traded Bell to the Raiders but signed free agent Curt Warner.  </P> <P> Not exactly votes of confidence.  </P> <P> So what has changed about Green and the Rams' offense? For one, Robinson said  one tailback will not dominate his game plans anymore. In other words, the  loser in this summer's tailback derby will not necessarily go directly to the  sideline.  </P> <P> "I do plan to share the job," Robinson said. "So there won't be one person that  emerges who has 90% of the carries and one that has 10%. I don't want to do  that. I won't do that.  </P> <P> "If all three backs are even at summer's end, all will play. At least that's  the company line in July.  </P> <P> "If two are good, and one's not, the one that's not is out," Robinson admitted.  "If three are good, then we'll try to play them. I don't have a solution. I  can't give you a solution to how it's going to end. But I think maybe we've  created the impression that Gaston is not going to get an equal opportunity,  and that's not true. That will not happen."  </P> <P> As a runner, Green has always had blazing straight-ahead speed. His problems in  the pros have been durability, running inside and a lack of open-field moves.  </P> <P> Green has not expressed a great desire to be traded, though it's doubtful the  Rams could get enough in return to match the embarrassment of unloading such a  high draft choice after just two seasons.  </P> <P> Robinson has said from the beginning that Green, 24, must be allowed time to  grow into his body. And while Green said he has not added any weight to his  192-pound frame, he has added muscle with weightlifting.  </P> <P> "He's just a different looking person," Robinson said. "He's thicker, stronger  and more ready for the competition. I think he will look forward to the  competition. I think it took him at least a year to adjust to what's going on."  </P> <P> Green said it's easier dealing with the critics because he has not been allowed  the chance to succeed or fail.  </P> <P> "In the past, if I'd have had the opportunity to do anything then I'd feel  pressure," he said. "But since it's just a matter of me getting the chance of  getting out there to play, there's no pressure. I do think it's going to be a  good fight, because we all want to play."  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> Punter Hank Ilesic, a Canadian citizen, is having trouble getting out of  Montreal to training camp. Monday, he was turned back at the airport because he  didn't have the proper visa papers. Then, he was turned away because he didn't  have a round-trip ticket, a requirement when leaving Canada. When Ilesic does  get here, he'll begin his head-to-head competition with rookie Kent Elmore for  the team's punting position. . . . Other veterans who have joined workouts this  week include wide receiver Aaron Cox, tight end Pat Carter and cornerback  Darryl Henley. Gaston Green will leave camp today and return when the veterans  report to UC Irvine July 25. Cleveland Gary and Curt Warner will remain to  better familiarize themselves with the offense . . . Linebacker George Bethune  suffered a left leg bruise and hamstring strain at Tuesday's practice. He's  been listed as day-to-day. Free agent wide receiver Anthony Sargent pulled a  hamstring and will miss one to two weeks.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Ed for the Prosecution"] </F>   [Text] The resignation of U.S. Ambassador to Israel Edward  Djerejian is an expression of no confidence resounding like a  slap in the faces of President Bill Clinton and Secretary of  State Warren Christopher. The Clinton administration's foreign  policy is currently under attack from all directions, mainly the  Republican direction. Key officials of the previous  administration -- President Bush, Defense Secretary Cheney, and  Secretary of State Baker -- restrained themselves for several  months. Nevertheless, with Clinton entering his second year in  office and with the election season approaching -- congressional  elections this year and presidential elections soon -- these  former officials placed themselves at the spearhead of the  onslaught on Clinton's and Christopher's hesitant and stuttering  international conduct, from Korea, to Haiti, to Bosnia.    Djerejian's notice that he is abandoning his post only four  months after assuming it is a double blow. First, because he  did not opt for a fat salary but is going to work for  Christopher's negative image -- James Baker. Second, because  his resignation makes one of the few areas in the world that  Clinton and his aides portray as an American success -- the  Arab-Israeli peace process -- look like a failure.    The intrigues among the members of the team that was  supposed  to help Clinton and Christopher promote the process have been  clearly visible for a long time. Djerejian, a former ambassador  in Damascus and a Baker loyalist ever since he served as White  House deputy spokesman for foreign affairs in the Reagan  administration, was sidetracked despite the fact that  Christopher kept him on as assistant secretary of state for  Middle Eastern affairs. Dennis Ross, another aide to Baker  during Bush's presidential campaign and at the State Department,  survived and became closer to Christopher, at the expense of  Djerejian and his no-less-competent successor Robert Pelletreau.  Pelletreau decided to settle for and focus on the other half of  his area of responsibility -- the Persian Gulf. Djerejian, who  spent only four months in office here, decided that, since  Christopher and Ross compartmentalized him out of the  Israel-Syria track -- the main track of the process and his area  of expertise -- there was no point in him staying on here.    The resignation is regrettable because the Americans would  have done better to give up on Christopher and his "peace team"  than on Djerejian. The continuing weakness of the Tel Aviv  Embassy started after the important years of Sam Lewis and Tom  Pickering. The Bush administration sent the two Williams --  Brown and Harrop -- here. Clinton sent Brown as acting  ambassador once again, and eventually sent Djerejian, but did  not use him properly. Djerejian joins a list of senior defense  and foreign affairs officials from the Clinton administration  who resigned or were fired with a loud slam of the door: Deputy  Secretary of State Wharton, Defense Secretary Aspin, defense  secretary designate Inman, and Presidential Envoy to Haiti  Pezzullo.    The general impression is one of a crumbling administration.  It is an U.S. problem, but it is also a global and mainly a  regional problem because without U.S. encouragement, the peace  process will be delayed for several more crucial months. It  seems that Djerejian chose not to be on the failing team. This,  however, is not necessarily the end of his involvement in  foreign affairs in general and Israel-Arab affairs in  particular: Should the Republicans return to power and Baker  get a say on policies and appointments, it is reasonable to  assume that Djerejian may return to a yet higher position at the  State Department or on the National Security Council.</p>

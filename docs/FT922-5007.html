			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US silver mine closes because of low prices DEPRESSED SILVER prices have prompted Asarco, the big US mining group, to close temporarily its Galena silver mine in Northern Idaho. The mine, which produced 3.3m troy ounces of silver last year, will be placed on a care-and-maintenance footing. Silver prices are at their lowest in real terms since the late 1960s and there is little expectation in the market that they will turn around soon. Asarco holds a 37.5 per cent interest in Galena's profits and Hecla Mining Company has a 12.5 per cent interest. Coeur d'Alene Mines Corporation, the mine's owner and from which it is leased, takes 50 per cent. Lower metals prices shaved Dollars 100m off Asarco's last year's earnings of Dollars 46m and they have continued to bite into this year's. The company, which has spent heavily to expand, is keen to improve operating results.</p>

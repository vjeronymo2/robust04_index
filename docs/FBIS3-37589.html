According to Yuriy Meshkov, this very issue  was the main objective of his six day visit to Moscow. "All the  necessary agreements were signed," pointed out the Crimean  president. "At present the Crimean republic enjoys the most  favored nation treatment in its relations with Russia." Mr.  Meshkov promised Crimea residents that they would feel the  positive results of the Moscow agreements in the very near  future.    The Crimean president told journalists that a trade and  economic representation of the Crimea would be opened in Moscow  soon and a representation of the Russian Federation and separate  representations of the Krasnodar and Stavropol regions would be  opened in Simferopol.    Dwelling on the appointment of the Moscow economist,  Russia's  former Minister of Economy Yevgeniy Saburov, to the post of the  prime minister of the Crimea, Meshkov pointed out the following:  "Today it would be most advantageous to appoint this very man to  the post of prime minister."    Saburov cannot hold the state post because he is not a  citizen of Ukraine, the leader of the Ukrainian president's  service for issues of domestic policy Mr. Mykhalchenko declared  in this connection. However, according to the press service of  the Council of Ministers of the Crimea, dual citizenship will  soon be introduced in the Crimea thus enabling Mr. Saburov,  currently director of the Information and Social Technologies  Centre under the government of the Russian Federation, to become  the prime minister of the Crimea.</p>

Commenting on the deal Mr Alan Barcock, managing director of Porton Products, said: 'Porton is continuing to develop high quality medicines for specialist indications worldwide. Dopacard is a natural extension to our product portfolio which gives us the chance to make available another valuable product with unique patient benefits to hospital-based physicians.'

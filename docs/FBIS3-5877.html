The two men, confronting each other at an open debate on  trade policy, warned that troubled bilateral ties could even get  worse before it gets better.    "A failure to resolve these issues will result in a  U.S.-Japan economic relationship that continues to erode," said  Bowman Cutter, deputy presidential assistant for economic policy.    The Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington-based think  tank, brought Cutter and Kuriyama together for the first public  encounter of senior Japanese and U.S. officials since the  collapse of bilateral trade talks a month ago.    The breakdown of the so-called "framework" trade  negotiations, which marred the February 11 summit between  President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, has  prompted Washington to threaten unilateral trade action against  Tokyo.    Kuriyama said Japan hopes to return to the negotiating table  as early as possible but admitted that he has "no idea" on how  to resolve the impasse.    Cutter offered no fresh initiative either, saying "It is now  up to the Government of Japan to begin to indicate a direction."    The two men, however, stressed there are no grounds to  expect  a trade war between the two allies.    "There's not a trade war and neither side will intend to  have  a trade war," Cutter said.    Kuriyama readily agreed. "We have too much at stake  together.  We will both be losers," the envoy said.    But the two officials also agreed there is very little trust  between two allies when it comes to Japan's commitment to open  up its markets and close its huge trade surplus.    The Clinton administration, arguing that few of the past 30  or so trade accords have yielded expected results, has demanded  that Tokyo set "numerical indicators" by which the U.S. will  determine the success or failure of a Japanese commitment.    Tokyo has rejected the U.S. demand which, as Kuriyama  reiterated Thursday, is likely to turn into a "legally binding  commitment and therefore subject to sanctions."    Cutter, recalling the predawn session of negotiation that  sealed the fate of the trade framework talks in February, quoted  Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Koichiro Matsuura, the chief  Japanese negotiator, as saying, "You don't trust us without  numbers. We don't trust you with numbers."    The sense of distrust on trade matters between two allies  drew demands for tougher U.S. trade actions from U.S.  legislators who took part in the two-day trade forum.    House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, who spoke at one  session of the trade conference Thursday, said, "A gentle,  gradual negotiating process may work with most other countries.  But time has taught us that it doesn't work with Japan."    Speaking at a later session Thursday, Sen. Max Baucus,  chairman of the Senate finance subcommittee that handles trade  matters, said tougher action -- even sanctions -- is justified  because, in his view, Japan resists change without outside  pressure.    "We will require a policy which understands the unique  nature  of the Japanese economy. We will need the credibility that only  the prospect of sanctions can offer," the Montana Democrat said.</p>

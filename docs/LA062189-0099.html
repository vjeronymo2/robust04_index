			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCOTT OSTLER: FERNANDO WITHIN LEFT ARM'S REACH OF MAKING IT BACK  </P> <P> "It's a hard racket out there," said John Roseboro, sitting on the Dodger bench  before the old-timers' game last Sunday and nodding out toward the pitcher's  mound. "If I was a youngster, that's the last place I would go. That arm is a  delicate thing."  </P> <P> Roseboro was the Dodger catcher during the Koufax-Drysdale era.  </P> <P> That era ended when Don Drysdale's right shoulder wore out and Sandy Koufax's  pitching fingers went dead, forcing him to retire rather than face the prospect  of life nicknamed Rightie.  </P> <P> Even so, Drysdale and Koufax were at Dodger Stadium Sunday to suit up and throw  an inning or two for the sake of nostalgia, and each seemed to feature a  healthy pitching arm. Koufax wasn't out to embarrass any of his former  teammates, but I've heard he is in great pitching shape and could walk to the  mound right now and throw major league heaters for at least a few innings.  </P> <P> Which is more than you can say for Fernando Valenzuela, the Dodger starting  pitcher in the young-timers' game that followed. Once, Fernando had a left arm  as sturdy and durable as a construction crane. He started 255 games without  missing a turn, a streak as impressive to me as Lou Gehrig's.  </P> <P> Then something snapped or stretched or twanged in Fernando's left shoulder and  he became mortal. This is the year of his comeback. He began the season  throwing fastballs that would stick in a spider web. The location of his  pitches, as they say in baseball, was poor, several of them becoming located  beyond the outfield walls.  </P> <P> He had bad stuff.  </P> <P> In the old days, watching Fernando work was a pleasure. Even opposing batters  admired his craftsmanship. His pitches were like snowflakes, no two exactly  alike.  </P> <P> But now, suddenly, he was a joke. It was a question of which was larger --  Fernando's fastball or the hitters' eyes.  </P> <P> How long could the Dodgers afford to keep sending Valenzuela out to the mound  for his twice-a-week shelling? How much damage could his dignity sustain before  he took himself out of the rotation? His record was 0-5. What would be the  cutoff point? 0-10? 0-20?  </P> <P> Then, about three weeks ago, the comeback started to kick in. Going into  Sunday's game against the Braves, Fernando had won two in a row. Under the hot  sun, he seemed to be throwing well, except for a gopher ball in the first  inning.  </P> <P> I went down to watch a few innings from the dugout box seats behind home plate,  the best place to watch a pitcher at work. Dodger scout Mike Brito was there,  as always, aiming his speed gun at every pitch and then making a notation on  his chart.  </P> <P> "He's up to 81, 82 (m.p.h.) today," Brito said. "But it's not the speed. The  important thing is his control. His control was killing him. Now he has good  command."  </P> <P> Brito is like a boxing manager, even down to the big cigar puffs and chomps in  the 90-degree heat. Fernando is Brito's prize heavyweight.  </P> <P> "He's got more confidence in himself now. The cut fastball is working real  well."  </P> <P> The cut fastball?  </P> <P> "He started throwing it about five games ago," Brito said. "I think (pitching  coach Ron) Perranoski taught him. It's like a hard slider. He's throwing it a  lot now."  </P> <P> A man named Frankie, who pitches batting practice to the Dodgers and is  Fernando's friend, joined the discussion.  </P> <P> "Fernando's in great shape," Frankie said. "He's in the weight room every day,  working on the weights, using the Versaclimber (leg- and arm-exercise  machine)."  </P> <P> Behind the plate, catcher Mike Scioscia gave a sign, then shifted his body a  foot closer to the batter.  </P> <P> "He's working inside a lot more now," Frankie said.  </P> <P> Fernando fired, the ball took a quick little swerve to our left and Scioscia's  mitt never moved. Inside corner, called strike.  </P> <P> "There's the cut fastball," Brito said over his shoulder.  </P> <P> Fernando's agent, Tony DeMarco, joined the little gathering behind the screen.  </P> <P> "You know how stoic Fernando is," DeMarco said. "When things were going bad, he  never fell to the floor, never cried. He maintained his dignity."  </P> <P> Did his fans desert him? No Dodger, no athlete, has ever enjoyed support from  the city's Spanish-speaking community the way Fernando has over the years.  </P> <P> "The drama of going through the tough times, betrayed by luck, people got  behind him even more," DeMarco said. "Fernando stopped being the superstar and  they supported him very much. The Dodgers, from the brass to his teammates,  they stayed with him, too. The Mexican (Mexico City) press has been very hard  on him, but now I see stories, 'The Bull Is Charging Again.' "  </P> <P> Scioscia scooted back and forth behind the plate, set his targets and sucked up  the pitches as if using a magnet.  </P> <P> "Scroogie," said Frankie as Geronimo Berroa waved weakly at a two-strike  screwball, a pitch that detours in the opposite direction of the cut fastball.  </P> <P> "I tell you, he's back," Brito said.  </P> <P> Valenzuela faded in the eighth and was replaced. He marched to the dugout and  slammed down his glove. After the game, his once ugly record now improved to  3-5, he turned his back on the reporters gathered at his locker and tossed out  a few grumpy statements. He was more of a fun guy when his arm was unbreakable.  </P> <P> He is not back yet, not all the way. Maybe he never will be. His future rides  on his pitching arm, and that arm is a delicate thing.  </P></p>

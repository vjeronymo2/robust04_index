			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHOT FOR $8 DEBT;  </P> <P> POTENTIAL STAR CAGE PLAYER HITS BOTTOM  </P> <P> Once he was compared to Magic Johnson, but Lloyd Daniels -- an NBA all-star in  waiting -- never escaped the city streets where his game first flourished.  </P> <P> Daniels was in critical condition today after a drug-related shooting. (Story  in Sports Section.) It was the latest episode in a troubled 22-year life that  has taken him through five high schools, two rehabilitation centers and,  finally, to a hospital.  </P> <P> Daniels was shot three times in the neck and torso Thursday in what police said  was a dispute over an $8 drug debt.  </P> <P> Although his talent helped him receive chance upon chance to straighten out his  life, it might have aggravated some of his problems, said a close friend of the  6-foot, 8-inch Daniels.  </P> <P> "I definitely think certain things were overlooked because of his talent," said  Lou D'Almeida, a basketball fanatic who took Daniels under his wing four years  ago. "He wasn't required to make any decisions early on."  </P> <P> Daniels also had academic problems.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Poor Reading Skills  </P> <P> When he arrived at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas in 1987, after playing at  Mount San Antonio College in Walnut, he could read only at a third-grade level.  </P> <P> Time magazine aptly summed up his diploma-less odyssey through five high  schools in three states: "Each school had availed itself of his talents on the  court but never managed to solve his profound reading problems."  </P> <P> As he got older, Daniels began making the wrong decisions: He was arrested on a  drug charge in Nevada. He began drinking heavily. His work habits led to his  release from two teams within three months last year.  </P> <P> But through the drinking, the drugs, the dropouts, Daniels had one thing to  hold on to: his game.  </P> <P> At Andrew Jackson High School in New York City, "Sweet Pea" Daniels averaged  31.2 points, 12.3 rebounds and 10 assists per game -- until quitting in  February, 1986.  </P> <P> In a high school all-star game several months later, Daniels limited Sean  Higgins -- a key performer for champion University of Michigan -- to 8 points  while pouring in 24 himself.  </P> <P> "He's as gifted a ballplayer as I've ever seen," said Jerry Tarkanian, head  coach at college basketball powerhouse UNLV.  </P> <P> Tarkanian compared his overall skills to those of Lakers star Magic Johnson.  </P> <P> "Without question, he could have been an NBA all-star every year," Tarkanian  said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SYMPATHY, AID FOR THE HOMELESS  </P> <P> I have heard people say that they don't give money to homeless people because  they'll just spend it on alcohol or drugs. What I do to get around this is to  give fast-food gift certificates to street people who ask me for change.  </P> <P> The fact that those I give them to are almost always happy to get them  demonstrates that these people don't just want to get high.  </P> <P> TOM SINSKY, Hollywood  </P></p>

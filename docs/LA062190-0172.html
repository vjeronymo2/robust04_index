			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EUROPEANS SEEK CAP ON U.S. MEDIA EXPORTS  </P> <P> In a move certain to set off a battle with Washington, the European Community  wants the right under new international trade rules being negotiated to keep  out foreign films and television shows, government sources said Wednesday.  </P> <P> The EC has served notice that it wants special treatment for television and  films in any agreement on removing barriers to trade in services in the current  four-year talks taking place under the auspices of the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade.  </P> <P> "Our major concern is to protect our cultural values," said one EC negotiator.  </P> <P> The Europeans are concerned that they are being swamped with American  television programs and movies. But Hollywood studios and the U.S. government  say the move is discriminatory and arbitrary.  </P> <P> The EC official said the Community wants to ensure that the new pact, to be  concluded in December, would not clash with last year's EC directive requiring  that a majority of the programs on European television be European-made.  </P> <P> As European broadcasting is deregulated, sharply expanding the number of  channels available to viewers, U.S. programs have soared in popularity.  </P> <P> Similarly, local film producers in Europe have faced increasing difficulties in  competing with high-budget Hollywood films.  </P></p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): September book closingfails to give Nikkei a lift SMALL-LOT selling and futures-linked arbitrage unwinding depressed share prices in thin trading, and the Nikkei average closed down in spite of buying by public funds, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei index fell 224.52 to 17,748.09 after a high of 18,066.21 and a low of 17,565.21. Volume rose to 240m shares from 203m. Declines led advances by 813 to 151 with 138 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 17.37 to 1,331.72 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.29 to 1065.85. Traders noted small-lot buying by public funds in the morning session. However, institutional investors remained inactive, prompting disappointed investors to liquidate holdings. Expectation of a rally ahead of the September book closing had previously lifted share prices. However, Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said that since banks have been exempted from including valuation losses on stockholdings in their interim earnings results, large-lot window dressing has not been seen. The yen moved slightly higher against the dollar, depressing exporters. Toshiba fell Y23 to Y575 and Fujitsu lost Y27 to Y578. Toyota Motor declined Y40 to Y1,370 and Nissan fell Y34 to Y581. Speculative short term traders dominated business. Mitsui Mining &amp; Smelting, the most active issue of the day, fell Y10 to Y498. Aids-related issues lost ground, with Meiji Milk Products down Y1 to Y990 and Green Cross down Y40 to Y1,590. Kubota, a leading maker of farm equipment and ductile iron pipes, rose Y19 to Y570, on its classification as a leading environmental stock. Hazama, the construction company which will become a component stock of the Nikkei index next month, rose Y5 to Y506. Seika also drew buying interest, adding Y7 to Y703. Godo Shusei, which in turn will be dropped from the Nikkei on October 1, rebounded on bargain hunting, advancing Y28 to Y598. The issue was sold heavily on Monday due to the announcement of the exclusion. In Osaka, the OSE average lost 350.52 to 19,151.72 in volume of 20.6m shares. Roundup APART from Taiwan, and in some individual shares, the region's equity markets moved narrowly yesterday. BANGKOK saw Krisda Mahanakorn, the property group, hit its 10 per cent downward limit for the second consecutive day. The SET index was 1.45 higher at 850.52 in turnover of Bt12.2bn. Krisda Mahanakorn dropped Bt20 to Bt184 in turnover of Bt2.3bn while Bangkok Land lost Bt2 to Bt132. TAIWAN rose on institutional buying of blue chips, but brokers said that investor confidence remained weak. The weighted index closed 45.66 or 1.4 per cent higher at 3,397.29. Turnover dropped to TDollars 10.8bn. NEW ZEALAND continued its fall as FCL lost 9 cents to NZDollars 1.91. The NZSE-40 capital index closed 8.55 lower at 1,426.07 in turnover of NZDollars 30m. Carter Holt closed up 4 cents at NZDollars 2.58 while Air NZ lost 9 cents to NZDollars 2.52. AUSTRALIA ended weaker as the market paid little attention to a better than expected August current account deficit. The All Ordinaries index closed 8.7 down at 1,487.7 in turnover of ADollars 289.9m. TNT closed 3 cents lower at ADollars 1.00 following news that Sir Peter Abeles, the managing director, had resigned to concentrate on the group's Ansett Transport Industries. HONG KONG eased after institutional selling reversed morning gains. The Hang Seng index fell 15.28 to 5,581.92 after rising almost 40 points in the morning. Turnover rose to HKDollars 1.78bn from HKDollars 1.57bn. MANILA was stronger on bargain-hunting as PLDT made steady gains. The composite index gained 8.89 to 1,395.36 in turnover of 440m pesos. PLDT gained 5 pesos to 970 pesos. SINGAPORE was steadier on selective gains in blue chips. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 3.98 to 1,353.79 in volume of 51.9m shares. KUALA LUMPUR reversed three consecutive days of advances and the composite index shed 4.72 to 605.93. Falls led rises by 210 to 60, in volume of 63.7m shares against Monday's 119m. BOMBAY fell in thin volume, displaying neither investment nor speculative interest as the BSE index fell 44.23 to 3,195.75. Brokers said that the market was drifting ahead of a four-day holiday weekend beginning this Friday.</p>

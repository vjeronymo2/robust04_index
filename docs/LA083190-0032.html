			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'THE LEMON SISTERS' SINKS DESPITE ITS ABLE CAST  </P> <P> "The Lemon Sisters" (selected theaters) are three white ladies from Atlantic  City who want to be the Supremes. Best buddies Eloise, Franki and Nola have  gone from 1959 to 1982 in a time warp; at 31, they're still doing '60s hits in  small-time bars. As played by Diane Keaton, Carol Kane and Kathryn Grody, this  unrelated threesome might not be offended if you called them "girls"; that's  what they want to be: a girl group. And their movie, a bit like "The Fabulous  Baker Boys," wants to be a ballad for show-biz wannabes.  </P> <P> In a rotten but cute world, you can always rely on your cute pals to get you  through rotten times. They'll be there with the party, the ambulance, the  shopping bag full of money. So says "The Lemon Sisters," and its one of those  pearls of movie wisdom where the shiny thin shell barely covers the grain of  sand inside. The people that made this movie -- writers Jeremy Pikser and Mo  Gaffney and director Joyce Chopra, working from Keaton's idea -- never seem  tight with their material. They don't empathize with these "little people."  Secretly, they condescend, make them into butts and foils.  </P> <P> "The Lemon Sisters" is set in Atlantic City, but it's a kiddie-land resort as  far removed from the boardwalk of blighted dreams and losers that we saw in  Louis Malle's 1980 "Atlantic City" as "Roseanne" is from "Raging Bull." That's  not necessarily bad. "The Lemon Sisters" isn't trying for anything profound or  poetic. But the title is a giveaway. The sisters are called "Lemons" because  they're supposed to be awful -- and they wear their awfulness with pride. One  is a fruitcake; the other a couch potato; the third makes taffy.  </P> <P> Only the occasional monochrome flashbacks to the past -- the three little girls  huddling under piers or playing oceanside -- have any amplitude or warmth. In  the present, Chopra and the writers keep putting their foot on the nutty-cutie  pedal and jamming it to the floor. The candy-colored boardwalk world, shimmery  pink and yellow, has an oddball on every corner, hawking local color.  Bag-ladies, hustlers, goombahs, hoods and flakes: They're all here, jostling  like rush-hour riders on the Goofball Limited. It says something about the  movie's attitude that the only time a "Lemon" succeeds is when she makes such a  tangle-footed wreck of a lounge date that she's hired as a comedian. Keaton's  character, Eloise, lives in a TV museum, full of such cherished boob-tube  artifacts as Ralph Kramden's jacket, Davy Crockett's coonskin cap and an  Enterprise chair from "Star Trek" -- and the movie is a TV show too, a silly  one. In one sequence Elliott Gould, as a lovable bozo of a saltwater taffy  concessionaire married to Grody's Nola, opens a new store with a huge,  dumb-looking mechanical bunny outside and immediately -- that very second! --  he has his business destroyed when a nearby casino starts handing out free  taffy. As Gould stares out toward the ocean with spaniel eyes, his mechanical  rabbit keeps whomping away before his empty store, his blasted dreams. It's the  movie's specialty: big-bunny irony.  </P> <P> The lead actresses -- Keaton, Kane and Grody -- are friends in real life, and  they obviously saw "Lemon Sisters" as a vehicle for that friendship. They're  all good; in fact the movie's ensemble, which also includes Gould, Aidan Quinn,  Ruben Blades and Estelle Parsons, is amazing. But "Lemon Sisters" doesn't  create a world: It packages a cast.  </P> <P> Keaton's role is a showcase for her virtuoso whining, pouting, stomping and  neurasthenic tics; Carol Kane sails off once again into frizzy-haired  ditz-land, and Kathryn Grody seems to be the sensible frumpy type mediating  between her out-there buddies. That isn't a put-down. Kane is an under-used  comic genius, and this is the kind of movie a frizzy-haired ditz can walk away  with. That's exactly what she does: in a tie with slick-haired mensch Ruben  Blades.  </P> <P> There's a built-in self-mockery that cuts apart this whole film. It pretends to  be on the side of losers and dreamers, then keeps snickering at them. Midway  through, Eloise, Franki and Nola start singing "Stop! In the Name of Love," and  Kane starts shaking and Keaton flashes her drop-you-dead grin and suddenly this  cheek-pinching movie opens up. There's something almost insanely pleasurable  about that performance. But, abruptly, "The Lemon Sisters" cuts it short. It's  not about pleasure in performance; it's not even really about friendship. It's  just a taffy-pull of self-congratulatory nostalgia, full of big-bunny irony.  </P> <P> 'THE LEMON SISTERS'  </P> <P> A Miramax Films release. Producer Joe Kelly. Director Joyce Chopra.

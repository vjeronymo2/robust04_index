			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRY RUN HELPS SOME BEAT FEAR OF FLYING  </P> <P> The last time Ada got up the nerve to fly was five years ago. It was a flight  from Florida to California and she nervously paced the aisle the entire trip.  She wasn't herself.  </P> <P> "I had five Valiums and four glasses of wine," she said.  </P> <P> It has been 15 years since Don last flew. That flight -- for reasons he still  can't pinpoint -- left him afraid to fly, even though as a child he often  accompanied his father, a private pilot, into the wild blue yonder.  </P> <P> "I just had a horrible anxiety attack," the 45-year-old Huntington Beach  resident said. "God, I couldn't breathe, I thought I was having a heart attack,  I broke out in a cold sweat. It was like my heart had stopped and I was in  suspended animation."  </P> <P> Don and Ada are among 34 people who have met once a week at a South Bay hotel  since January, hoping to overcome their fear of flying -- a phobia that some  experts say afflicts as many as 25 million Americans.  </P> <P> For six weeks now, they have gathered one evening a week to listen to Carol  Stauffer, a clinical social worker, and former USAir pilot Frank Petee. They  tell them why they should not be afraid. A large part of their message boils  down to this:  </P> <P> The odds of being fatally injured while flying are a whole lot less than while  cruising a Southern California freeway. One estimate says that on a per-mile  basis, a person is a hundred times more likely to die on a highway than in an  airplane.  </P> <P> "The most common fear is not being in control of the situation, that you are  turning your life over to someone else," said Stauffer, who has taught the  class since 1975.  </P> <P> "You almost never hear the good things about flying," she said in an interview.  "It is not newsworthy."  </P> <P> Stauffer and Petee conduct their classes for USAir. It is similar to others  conducted around the country by different individuals or groups. Students, who  pay a $250 fee, come from all walks of life. Despite their dread of flying,  most of them do so out of necessity and they enrolled in the class to make the  experience less traumatic.  </P> <P> "Just sheer grit gets them on the airplane," Stauffer said.  </P> <P> A recent session was a major event for the students, especially those who had  not set foot aboard an aircraft for some time. The lesson plan: Sit aboard a  jetliner at Los Angeles International Airport as it races down a runway.  </P> <P> No, there is no takeoff. The class is not ready to leave the ground just yet.  This is just a warm up. The jetliner reaches a speed of 138 m.p.h. before  braking to a halt. Petee described the experience to the students as an "almost  takeoff," designed to link what they have learned in class with the actual  experience of being on a moving plane.  </P> <P> Before leaving the hotel for the airport, the class was introduced to the  aircraft's crew, including its three flight attendants. The attendants  explained how they are trained to handle any emergency that might arise during  a flight.  </P> <P> "I guess the obvious question is, 'Have any of you been involved in an  evacuation?," one student asked.  </P> <P> No, the attendants replied, although one said she had been aboard an aircraft  when its cabin lost air pressure.  </P> <P> "What happens in that?" asked another student.  </P> <P> "You die," joked another student.  </P> <P> Once the students were assured that depressurization -- when oxygen masks drop  from the plane's ceiling -- is nothing to fear, the other crew members were  introduced. Next, the classroom lights were dimmed and Stauffer led the  students through some relaxation exercises. They were told to wrinkle their  foreheads by raising their eyebrows. Stauffer slowly counted to five, then told  them to relax.  </P> <P> The students then headed for the airport, where they gathered at about 9:30  p.m. at Terminal 1, Gate 14.  </P> <P> Some appeared confident, others nervous as they looked out a window at the 727  that they would board.  </P> <P> As she waited, a woman with fear of flying named Kim said she had not flown for  about a year and half. She said her fear was gradual and may have begun years  ago when an airliner crashed near her home in the Chicago area. "I had worked  myself up to the point where I would almost cry before I had to fly," she said.  </P> <P> Once they were aboard the jetliner and strapped to their seats, the students  repeated the relaxation exercises. Then the plane began to taxi as Petee gave a  nonstop commentary over the plane's public address system, telling students  exactly what was happening inside the cockpit.  </P> <P> Before long, air traffic controllers gave permission for the make-believe  takeoff to begin, and Petee passed the word along. He kept talking as the  aircraft headed down the runway.  </P> <P> "The airplane is already accelerating quite fast. We are already up to 80  knots, 100 knots . . . "  </P> <P> "Let's get it on," Don blurted out, grinning nervously.  </P> <P> " . . . 115 knots, 120 knots," Petee continued.  </P> <P> Then the student passengers felt as if they were being pulled forward, the way  air passengers normally feel during a landing.  </P> <P> "We are reversing," Petee explained. "The brakes are on, the power is back and  the spoilers are up."  </P> <P> The students, now familiar with such terms, applauded, and Petee asked if they  wanted to try it again. They did.  </P> <P> "Now that was so much easier than the first one," Don said after the second  trip down the runway.  </P> <P> Back at the gate, people who once might have rushed off a plane lingered on  board, congratulating themselves.  </P> <P> A student named Elizabeth said she was not frightened by the experience. "I  knew we weren't going anywhere," she said.  </P> <P> Another student, a middle-aged woman who did not want to divulge even her first  name, voiced a similar sentiment: "I have a great sense of reality. I wasn't in  the air." But 36-year-old Celia, who stopped flying more than a dozen years  ago, proclaimed a personal victory. "I am so proud of myself, I am elated," she  said.  </P> <P> Celia said she is still apprehensive about the one-hour graduation flight that  she and the other students were to take soon. Nevertheless, she said, she will  definitely be there.  </P> <P> As for Ada, she had "no problem" with racing down the runway. And she, too,  said she will attend the graduation flight. Being afraid to fly, she said, puts  a crimp in your travel plans. Pretty soon, she said, you run out of places you  can drive to.  </P> <P> "I have seen all of California."  </P></p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Insolvency regime to be tightened THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry is forcing substantial changes to the regulation of insolvency practitioners following the discovery of widespread failures to comply with regulations. A random inspection by the DTI's Insolvency Service of about 55 insolvency practitioners last year found that half were failing seriously to meet their statutory requirements under the 1986 Insolvency Act. A total of 10 per cent of those inspected generated very serious disciplinary problems which led to the withdrawal of licences and criminal prosecutions, according to a confidential report prepared by regulators last year. The investigation has led to mounting pressure in the last few months from the DTI on the professional insolvency bodies to launch regular, random inspections of the individuals under their charge. Plans are now well advanced for a joint insolvency monitoring unit which could be operating by late summer and will inspect all the UK's 2,000 licensed practitioners every three years. It is expected to employ nine staff and have an annual budget of at least Pounds 400,000, jointly funded by the UK's four chartered and certified accountancy bodies and the Institute of Practitioners of Insolvency, which between them monitor two-thirds of practitioners. The other two bodies, the Scottish and English Law Societies, may also participate. Among the requirements of the 1986 insolvency act was that all practitioners should be registered with one of these professional bodies in a response to concern over the number of 'cowboys' operating in the industry. Until now they have concentrated on registering new practitioners and have only inspected members in response to complaints received. The DTI told the professional bodies last year that this was not an adequate response. The DTI acted after it found many serious regulatory breaches among the 150 practitioners it monitors directly, including not filing directors' disqualification reports and estate accounting returns, or not paying funds into the statutory insolvency services account. Some practitioners have been deregistered and others disciplined as a result.</p>

			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Some you win, some you lose - Good news and bad / The impact of the O'Higgins theory in the year so far For readers who follow the O'Higgins theory, outlined many times before on these pages, there has been both good news and bad news in the first half of 1994. The good news is that stocks chosen by the O'Higgins theory have outperformed the FT-A All-Share index over the past six months. The bad news is that both the O'Higgins portfolio and the All-Share have fallen in value; the building society would have been a far better option. Michael O'Higgins is a US fund manager who wrote a book* outlining a simple method for beating the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Taking the 30 stocks in the Dow, he found the 10 with the highest dividend yields. Of those, he selected the five with the lowest share prices (ie, if stock A costs Dollars 1 and stock B costs Dollars 2, choose stock A). Then, he waited a year and performed the exercise again. He found that, between 1973 and 1991, a portfolio chosen by this method produced average annual returns of 19.4 per cent, compared with 10.4 per cent from the Dow. In Britain, applying this method to the FT-30 index also appeared to work. Even allowing for costs of 5 per cent a year, the FT found that the O'Higgins method earned 22 per cent a year between 1979 and 1991 compared with 17.5 per cent for the All-Share. Last year, including gross dividends, the five stocks chosen by the O'Higgins method returned a whopping 46.8 per cent. The law of averages might suggest that, after such a good year in 1993, the method was destined to do less well this year. Indeed, only one of the five stocks chosen (using the FT of December 30) managed an increase in share price: Tate &amp; Lyle. One share, British Gas, has fallen 22.7 per cent. Overall, in capital terms, the five shares have fallen by an average of just under 9 per cent. Nevertheless, that is a better performance than the All-Share, which dropped 12.6 per cent between December 30 and June 30. To be fair, if you allow for costs and also for the higher dividend yield provided by the O'Higgins shares, it is probably a tie between the portfolio and the All-Share. Nevertheless, the results are not completely discouraging. The O'Higgins method is designed to beat the index over the long term, and anyone following it over the past 18 months is still well ahead. So, what about those who are starting from scratch to choose a portfolio today? The components of the FT-30 are: Allied Lyons, Asda, BICC, Blue Circle, BOC, BTR, Boots, British Airways, British Gas, British Petroleum, British Telecommunications, Cadbury Schweppes, Courtaulds, Forte, GEC, Glaxo, GrandMet, GKN, Guinness, Hanson, ICI, Lucas, Marks and Spencer, NatWest, P&amp;O, Reuters, Royal Insurance, SmithKline Beecham, Tate &amp; Lyle and Thorn EMI. Using the share lists in the FT of June 30, the chosen five are: Blue Circle (285p, 4.9 per cent yield); British Gas (266p, 6.8 per cent); BT (376p, 5.7 per cent); Hanson (247p, 6.1 per cent) and Lucas (170p, 5.1 per cent). Three of those five were in the portfolio chosen at the start of the year: out go BICC and Tate &amp; Lyle, in come Blue Circle and BT. Note, however, that the theory says that those who picked their portfolios at end-December should stick with them until the end of 1994. It is worth reminding readers of the caveats. A portfolio containing only five stocks is, inevitably, high risk; and, just because the theory has worked before, there is no guarantee it will work again. *Beating the Dow, by Michael O'Higgins with John Downes, HarperCollins, 10 East 53rd Street, New York, NY 10022.</p>

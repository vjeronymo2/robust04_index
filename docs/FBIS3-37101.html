The attitude of the Tiraspol authorities is completely  different. In Tiraspol some are ready to cooperate with us in  normal conditions, while other think we are spies, the quoted  source states. Our mission's mandate is valid for one single  state -- the Republic of Moldova, recognized by the world  community. Any attempt to create an artificial state within  Moldova is doomed to failure, as it had not and will not have  the support of world community. For the conflict's solution,  the CSCE mission's recommendations suggest, on one hand, the  consolidation of the independence, sovereignty, and territorial  integrity of Moldova, and, on the other, the necessity to grant  a special statute to the Dniester region, which would provide a  series of rights for this region, said the interviewed. Dabrova  referred to the peace-maker role Russia assumed, mentioning that  it declares "wherever and whenever possible that it promotes  peace in various conflict zones on Earth" and it "demands from  international organizations, CSCE in particular, material,  moral, and political support of this role it assumed." At the  same time, "to provide this support we would like first to see  how Russia asks for support while it provides no proof to  persuade us what and how actually happens." Theoretically,  Russia accepts to cooperate with the CSCE mission to Moldova,  but practically hinders its cooperation with the Joint Control  Commission. I believe Moldova will not stand another military  conflict, but it is long until the conflict is solved. The  prospects over the next years cannot be optimistic for Moldova,  which, as all other states in the region, has a period of  dismantling a system and searching for another, more favorable  one, the quoted source notes.</p>

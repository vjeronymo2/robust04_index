			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DIANNE KLEIN: AS THE MEDICAL WOUND FESTERS, THE POOR KEEP COMING  </P> <P> The last Saturday in July was a pretty typical day in Santa Ana. Sticky hot.  </P> <P> By nightfall it had cooled a bit -- there was even a hint of a breeze -- but  Irma Garcia was having trouble keeping an even keel. The physical pain of  childbirth, rhythmic, merciless, was pulling at her strength, draining what  little she had left.  </P> <P> She'd already been to UCI Medical Center, where somebody had told her they'd be  able to help, but she was turned away.  </P> <P> The hospital has been doing that, on and off, for more than a year. "Diversion"  is what they call it. "Please go somewhere else" is what it means.  </P> <P> Officials there say they don't like it, but economics and demographics have  forced their hand. Too many women are giving birth, too few of them are able to  pay. That means not enough labor rooms, not enough beds and not enough  obstetricians willing to take a risk on helping those with nowhere else to  turn.  </P> <P> MediCal isn't working as its planners had hoped.  </P> <P> So Irma Garcia went to a hospital closer to home, with the pain clawing at her  from the inside. Nurse Catherine Maxey reports that the first time she saw her,  Irma was on her side, clutching at the rail of her bed, in a labor room.  </P> <P> A fetal monitor was strapped around her belly. An I.V. ran from her arm. Irma's  eyes were wide. Her breath, heavy, caught as the contractions wracked her, the  internal explosions that were heralding new life.  </P> <P> The obstetrician, though, had other concerns circling his mind. Tired and  angry, he'd seen a lot of "Irmas" before. Their names, really, were  interchangeble. These were strangers who were taking up his time.  </P> <P> He didn't speak Irma's language, Spanish, and because of that, nurse Maxey had  been summoned to his side. After three years as a public health nurse in Santa  Ana, she had picked up the Spanish she heard spoken at every turn.  </P> <P> This is Catherine Maxey's recollection of what went on that night. The doctor  declined to speak to me.  </P> <P> Irma told Catherine that she had had no prenatal medical care.  </P> <P> "Ask her why!" the doctor said, barking his command.  </P> <P> Catherine stared, at the doctor, then at Irma. She was holding her hand. When a  contraction subsided, she relayed the doctor's demand.  </P> <P> Irma said that she had felt fine. Doctors were for the ill.  </P> <P> "Ask her why she didn't go to UCI hospital!" the doctor said. "Why here?"  </P> <P> Irma told Catherine why.  </P> <P> "Ah," the doctor said, impatient. His eyes flashed at the nurse.  </P> <P> "Tell her that we won't accept her either," he said. Then he winked. A little  joke.  </P> <P> "Tell her that!"  </P> <P> But Catherine said that she would not.  </P> <P> Now Catherine, too, was angry; her weariness was showing through. Yes, the  names of these patients are interchangeable. The refrain, on the floor, seems  always put to the same tune. She could hear it, now, running through her mind.  </P> <P>  These people... These people.... Oh, these people always have MediCal. Never  pay a dime. Our hard earned money goes to taxes, to pay for them.... Did you  know that half the census tonight in the hospital is OB and yet this department  loses money?... Oh, these people know English. Just play dumb till the baby's  out, and then they can speak just fine.... These people.... These people.  </P> <P>  Then the doctor broke Catherine's train of thought.  </P> <P> "Tell her that she's stupid to have never seen a doctor," he said. "Tell her  that just yesterday a woman came in and had a dead baby. Tell her that!"  </P> <P> "I won't tell her that," Catherine snapped. "Why tell her now? She won't  understand. How can she listen now. . . ."  </P> <P> "Oh, yes, they can listen now," the doctor said.  </P> <P> "After the baby's out, they won't listen anymore. I want them to know that they  can't not take care of themselves during their pregnancy, never see a doctor,  and think that they can just walk into any hospital and be received with open  arms. Do you understand the risk I take to deliver a baby blind like this?"  </P> <P> Catherine understands, and so do I. This doctor is one of the comparatively few  in Orange County who treat poor pregnant women, many of them who walk in off  the street only when it is time to give birth.  </P> <P> For most obstetricians, the risks -- of a malpractice lawsuit if something goes  wrong and a paltry, late MediCal payment to boot -- are simply too high. The  latest survey in Orange County showed that less than 35% of area obstetricians  will accept a patient on MediCal.  </P> <P> And this comes at a time when births are booming -- an official 12% countywide  increase from 1988 to 1989 -- with no immediate end in sight. The percentage of  indigent patients, meantime, is on the rise. Government funding continues its  decline.  </P> <P> "I still accept MediCal, though they don't pay me beans," the doctor told  Catherine. "I deliver these people, with the risk to be sued every time. I do  this! Yet do I ever get thanks? I get nothing. I'm tired tonight. I had to  leave my family again; my daughter cried. So I'm not going to tell this woman,  'Oh wonderful that you have come here.'  </P> <P> "Ask her if she's applied for MediCal," the doctor said.  </P> <P> The nurse did, and the answer came that she had applied two weeks before.  </P> <P> But this really mattered little, just then. The law says MediCal will reimburse  delivery charges for families with no way to pay. The payment, however, is  rarely enough. The medical establishment, and advocates for the poor, are fed  up.  </P> <P> Task forces have been formed. Calls for solutions -- more money, prenatal care,  hospital beds, doctors, family planning, and the list goes on and on -- abound.  Frustration and anger are rife.  </P> <P> It shows, in the words and expressions, of everybody concerned.  </P> <P> Back in the labor room, the doctor left to prepare for the delivery of Irma's  child. Nurse Maxey, bending over the patient, was angry, confused, and on the  verge of tears.  </P> <P> "You are doing so well," she told Irma. "The time is very near."  </P> <P> Irma squeezed Catherine's hand. Her contraction was debilitating and she let  out her first little scream. Within minutes after that, Irma's son, wailing,  strong and healthy, a U.S. citizen, arrived in the nursery.  </P> <P> Later, I tried to visit this new mother at her home, but the address that she  gave the hospital did not exist. This happens a lot.  </P> <P> So perhaps the name Irma Garcia, too, is just a private myth. I don't know. It  certainly wouldn't be the first time.  </P> <P> But the story of this indigent mother, ubiquitous, with the interchangeable  names, is all too real. It's as typical as a hot, sticky day at the end of  July.  </P> <P>  Dianne Klein's column appears Wednesday, Friday and Sunday.

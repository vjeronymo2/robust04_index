			<p>930806 FT  06 AUG 93 / Arts: Today's Television For a long time the dud night of the week on television was Saturday. Even now you could scarcely call the Saturday schedule compelling, but at least it is not as bad as Friday's. Tonight BBC1 screens repeats of Dad's Army, Casualty, and Critters. ITV shows an absurd American drama series called Dr Quinn: Medicine Woman which smears 1960s feminism like an impenetrable layer of margarine over stories of the Wild West in the 1860s; and another drama series called Stay Lucky which 'stars' Dennis Waterman who seems to have picked up all his acting skills at Ealing Studios before he was out of short trousers. BBC2 shows the second in its series Architecture Of The Imagination. If you thought that Programme 1 provided remarkable insights into the significance and symbolism of the door, then doubtless you will want to watch today's episode about the staircase. Channel 4 continues with its worthy but saddening 'Bloody Bosnia' season and begins another series of the unimpressive American comedy Nurses.</p>

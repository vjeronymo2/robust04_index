			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Election 1992: Mellor condemns sell-off 'muddle' LABOUR was accused yesterday by Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, of 'muddle and confusion' over privatisation. His attack came after Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, said that his party had made 'no decisions' on whether a Labour government would sell the residual shareholdings in British Telecom and the two electricity generation companies. Earlier, Mr Neil Kinnock had said that his party would not stop any of the sales that were already in the pipeline. That would mean that the same resources would be available to Labour as the Conservatives next year. But Mr Mellor called on Mr Kinnock to clarify whether a Labour government would announce new privatisation schemes on top of those already planned. His intervention followed a series of Conservative attempts this week - so far resisted by Labour - to force Mr Kinnock to clarify its projections for public-sector borrowing over the medium-term. Mr Mellor suggested that if Labour took power and failed to go ahead with new privatisation programmes, the public-sector accounts would be a further Pounds 9bn in deficit over the two financial years starting in April 1993. Mr Mellor said the Tories planned to gain Pounds 8bn from privatisation in this financial year, followed by Pounds 5.5bn in both 1993-4 and 1994-5. If Labour took power, it would obtain the Pounds 8bn due this financial year from programmes already started, but would gain at most Pounds 2bn for the subsequent two years, unless it announced new schemes. Mr Mellor said the Conservatives could achieve their own target for privatisation and called on Labour to be more specific on its plans.</p>

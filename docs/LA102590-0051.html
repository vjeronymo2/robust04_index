			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ST. JOHN WINS DELAY IN DECISION ON TRIAL  </P> <P> A hearing on whether Juanita St. John should stand trial for allegedly stealing  $178,000 from a city-funded Los Angeles-Africa trade program was continued  until Nov. 27 to give the defense time to prepare final arguments.  </P> <P> St. John's attorney, who has sought several delays, is attempting to persuade  Municipal Judge David Doi that a trial is unwarranted, despite prosecution  evidence that St. John withdrew large sums of task force money for house  payments and other personal expenses.  </P> <P> A former business associate of Mayor Tom Bradley, St. John has argued she was  entitled to the money, saying that most of the money was actually salary. She  drew a salary of about $75,000 -- nearly twice what investigators say was  legal.  </P></p>

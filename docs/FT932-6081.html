			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Three-way tenancy MY WIFE and I have joint assets of about Pounds 240,000, including a house worth Pounds 130,000. We have one married son who owns his own home. What would be the tax implications of creating a three-way tenancy in common, with the parents each willing their third-share to the son? In order to create such a tenancy, you and your wife would first have to sever your joint tenancy (assuming that is how you own your house). Then, each of you would have to give a one-sixth share of the house to your son. These gifts would be potentially exempt transfers. Assuming the house is worth Pounds 130,000, then the one-sixth shares would be valued at Pounds 21,667 before taking account of any discount. The problem is that because your son is married and living away from your home, the gift would be treated as a gift-with-reservation and would not be efficient for inheritance tax purposes unless you were to pay him a market rent for the use of his share of the property. The amount you have given away would still be treated as being owned by you for IHT even though, legally, you would have given up this share of the property. It would, however, be possible to make the gifts by virtue of your respective wills. Each gift would be covered by the nil rate band of Pounds 150,000 which is available to each of you, assuming that you have no previous chargeable gifts. The gift-with-reservation rules do not apply to gifts made at death. This reply was provided by Barry Stillerman of accountants Stoy Hayward.

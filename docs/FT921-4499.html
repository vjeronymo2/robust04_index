			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Syria and Iran defence link-up: A 'strange marriage' in the Gulf SYRIA and Iran have boosted significantly their defence co-operation since the end of the Gulf crisis, prompting Western suspicions that the two are actively collaborating in securing weapons of mass destruction, notably missiles. There are also fears that the collaboration could ultimately involve joint efforts to secure a nuclear capability. Western concerns about strengthening Syrian-Iranian defence links coincide with a looming international crisis over reports that at least one North Korean ship is bound for Iran's Gulf port of Bandar Abbas with ballistic missiles on board destined for Syria. A Western attache in Damascus described the combination of Iran and Syria as 'potentially very dangerous'. He said the 'strange marriage' could pose the 'next century's threat to the Middle East'. Syria, virtually alone among Arab states, supported Iran in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war. Another Western official said there were also indications that Syria and Iran were building stronger defence links with China and Pakistan, and this was 'troubling' in the light of fears of the further spread of nuclear technology following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Syria, which had relied on the Soviet Union as its main arms supplier and guardian superpower, has been casting around for new allies and sources of military equipment. China, which is supplying missile technology, is filling part of the gap. Syria last month signed a nuclear safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency, entitling it to purchase a small Chinese nuclear reactor for peaceful use. This is Syria's most significant foray into the nuclear technology field. China has also been supplying ballistic missiles to Syria. Last September, a Chinese vessel with what was believed to have been a cargo of either parts or complete M-9 short range missiles called at the Syrian port of Tartus. Washington, meanwhile, is considering whether to order its navy ships in the Gulf region to board the North Korean vessels (there are conflicting reports about numbers), believed to be carrying the Scud-C missiles for Syria and possibly Iran. Israel itself has not ruled out a military strike against the North Korean vessels. But the US feels constrained about boarding ships bound for Iran because its navy deployment in the Gulf is there under United Nations resolutions aimed at enforcing a trade embargo against Iraq. THE US would not be empowered to seize the Scud-C missiles under the terms of the UN resolutions. But a Bush administration official was quoted as saying that in spite of the fact that US naval vessels could not seize the weapons, their discovery would provide 'public proof that Syria and Iran were getting long-range missiles'. The North Korean Scud-Cs are a more accurate version of the Scud-Bs that Iraq launched against Israel and Saudi Arab during the Gulf crisis. Syria's attempts to secure shipments of the North Korean missiles, whose range extends for about 600 kilometres, coincide with signs of a vigorous renewed Middle East arms race, with various states seeking to boost their military capabilities contrary to disarmament trends elsewhere. Iran, the Gulf states and Syria have been at the forefront of these efforts. The US has also been meeting Israeli requests for additional, more sophisticated weaponry, especially to boost its air defences. Western military attaches in Damascus say that the Syrians have been utilising their 'war dividend' of up to Dollars 2bn from Gulf states grateful for Syria's participation in the allied coalition against Iraq to buy weapons cheaply in Eastern Europe.</p>

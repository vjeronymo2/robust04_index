			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' AT OCC SPEAKS WITH A LIKABLE SOUTHERN ACCENT  </P> <P> "Steel Magnolias" can be a mawkish visit to familiar Southern terrain, a  sentimental play built on personality and predictability. But, if you give it  rope, it can also persuade with a gabby charm that makes for a pleasantly  uncomplicated experience.  </P> <P> The latter is what director John Ferzacca is after at Orange Coast College. His  production, tackled by a cast with more experience than in most campus  stagings, has a down-home accessibility that makes the most out of Robert  Harling's personable script -- all the Southern flavoring is pretty quaint but  still likable.  </P> <P> Harling based his play on personal experience, and the events have a feel of  closely observed details that affected him deeply. Because of this, it's not  too difficult to be moved by M'Lynn's pain when daughter Shelby's tragedy  escalates and "Magnolias" takes a serious turn. Susan O'Connell's performance  as the mother and Judy Anderson's as Shelby help; both are able to keep the  emotional backwash from swamping the production's sensible side.  </P> <P> Before this trauma is explored, Harling presents us with several other  relationships, all between local women who congregate at the beauty shop in a  small Louisiana town to give support, get catty with their neighbors and each  other and, all in all, reflect on the day as they see it.  </P> <P> It's a colorful group (when are Southerners ever portrayed as ordinary  citizens?): Truvy (Kathy Collins) runs the parlor and dispenses bits of  cosmetic wisdom, such as, "There is no such thing as natural beauty." Clairee  (Bettie Muellenberg) loves high school football and is thinking about buying a  radio station. Ouiser (Lorraine McWilliams) is a little cranky and owns a weird  dog. Annelle (Christy Craven) is Truvy's simple, spacey born-again assistant.  </P> <P> As the meeting ground for these ladies, David Scaglione has built a large  (probably too large for this small town) representation of a beauty shop with  all the amenities. It's well-made, down to the sit-down hair dryers against the  wall. Eric Person's costumes are as bold as the characters who wear them.  </P> <P> 'STEEL MAGNOLIAS'  </P> <P> An Orange Coast College production of Robert Harling's play. Directed by John  Ferzacca. With Kathy Collins, Christy Craven, Bettie Muellenberg, Judy  Anderson, Susan O'Connell and Lorraine McWilliams. Set by David Scaglione.  Lighting by David Dunbrack. Costumes by Eric Person.

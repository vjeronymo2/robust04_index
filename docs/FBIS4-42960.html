			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alois Mock by Thomas </F> Sautner and Walter Osztovics; place and date not given: "As a  Patriot One Must Vote for It"]    [Text] [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Mr. Minister, you will probably  not want to hear this question anymore: How are you?    [Mock] (laughs) And you will probably not want to hear the  answer anymore: Ask me on 13 June, after the referendum. No,  seriously, I am very well. Just after the operation I was a bit  suspicious, because I did not feel any pain at all anymore. The  next two, three months will be important, then I can overdo it a  bit again.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] You are not worried about your health,  are  you? But what about membership in the European Union [EU]?    [Mock] If one is dedicated to something, one is always a bit  worried. But, in the end, I trust Austrians will understand.  Voters realize that this is not just any election, but a  decision that will determine the country's entire position for a  long time to come.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] How would you evaluate the current EU  debate, do you have any objections?    [Mock] Arguments like the ones that we have to supply water  to Spain and must build nuclear power plants, are simply  irresponsible, they annoy me. I respect anyone who votes "no"  for certain reasons, but I do not respect such arguments.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Which brings us to the role of the  opposition. You are one of those who do not exclude Freedom  Party Chairman Joerg Haider from fundamental considerations.  Will you stick to this position even if accession to the EU  fails because of, among others, him?    [Mock] I have often talked with Haider and also with  Voggenhuber [of the Greens], who certainly does not play second  fiddle to Haider as regards rhetoric. Even in the case of  failure we must continue to be ready to talk to each other. The  fact that Haider is now often using excessive rhetoric is his  business. It is profoundly regrettable for our country, but it  does not excite me much. I do not think of Haider so highly  that I would say that he alone has prevented membership.  However, Haider's extremely harsh rhetoric is certainly not  healthy for our country, and if the referendum fails, Haider  will have to be held largely responsible for it, but the same  also goes for the government.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Haider, who, until recently, said that  the Austrian nation is a monstrosity, now argues that one must  vote against membership of the EU out of patriotism for Austria.    [Mock] Quite apart from the problem that arises when such  arguments come from this side, in particular as a patriotic  Austrian one must vote for membership. Membership strengthens  our country. One must also include history in one's  considerations. In 1948, when the Marshall Plan was initiated  and the first schedules were established: It was said, the  Dutch need loans for seven or, I do not know, 10 years, the  Germans for 15 years, just as the Belgians, and only for one  country was no specific date set; this country was not viable,  it had to be subsidized longer. This was Austria. And today  one has to defend the fact that we are net payers. This is  absurd.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] What kind of feeling is it to know that,  if the outcome of the referendum is yes, you will enter history  as the foreign minister who led Austria into the EU?    [Mock] I do not know whether there is any way to examine  whether, in 100 or 150 years, I will have entered history. Many  people believed that they would figure in the history books and  then did not find themselves there, others have been there for a  very long time for good or bad reasons.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] What would it mean for you personally if  Austria became an EU member?    [Mock] In my political career, EU membership is the most  important thing. I would be enormously glad if we became a  member. I am really very dedicated to this matter. My heart is  really in it. Austria would be able to have its say in Europe  and would not be some sort of appendage. This would mean very  much to me.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Do you see the future of the EU only in a  rosy light or are there also dangers?    [Mock] The greatest danger is that integration is not yet  irreversible. Making it irreversible requires another  generation of forming an awareness and of interaction. Another  outbreak of nationalism in the EU cannot be ruled out. And the  demons of the past are, unfortunately, not yet dead. They are  stored in the cupboard of history, and a wrong policy can bring  them out again. The door to the cupboard has already been  rattled, but it has remained shut so far --thanks also to Helmut  Kohl, who has worked long on integration with great intensity.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Perhaps also out of fear of the strength  of one's own country?    [Mock] Perhaps not out of fear, but out of concern, because  if integration is reversed, if it fails, then, sooner or later,  there will again be the realistic and great danger of a  development toward war in Europe. One must also beware, also of  oneself.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Could there be a problem for Austria if  the EU referendum results in only a very narrow positive vote?    [Mock] Yes, this can be a problem, because then someone will  naturally contest the referendum, and this may lead to a  terrible mess and an enormous loss of reputation. Many  countries are waiting for our referendum results: Switzerland,  the Scandinavians.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] If the referendum were negative, could  you  then imagine that another referendum would be held soon  afterwards?    [Mock] No, the opportunity would then be over for five, 10,  20 years. The Norwegians, who said no in 1972, would be very  happy today if they were already members. At that time there no  Spanish and Portuguese, and fishing rights would not have been  any problem. And, with all due respect, I would not want the  Hungarians and the Poles to dictate the new conditions for  membership to us at some time in the future. Now the  negotiations were good, and this opportunity should be seized.  There are even many in the EU who say that we have been given  too much because we were so stubborn.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] What historic significance does the  result of the EU referendum now have for Austria?    [Mock] Apart from the State Treaty, this is the most  important decision in the Second Republic. The State Treaty  turned us into a member of the community of states again, and  now there is the question of whether we want to remain a member  in the future or to become a subject. It is strange that people  say we must reform the EU from the outside and, at the same  time, claim that, if we are inside, we have no say at all. For  our country this is the most important decision for a long, long  time to come.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] There are polls that say that you are  enjoying the highest credibility both among advocates and  skeptics. Is this not a reason for you to tell the voters: You  are doing me a favor if you vote for the European Union?    [Mock] I think they are not doing a favor to me, but to the  country if they vote yes.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Would you also consider announcing your  resignation to influence voters?    [Mock] No, this would be the wrong thing. With this I would  exert pressure, and this is not what I want to do. I want to  convince them.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] There are many things that speak for  Austria's membership in the EU. Some things speak against it.  Which ones, for instance?    [Mock] There are a number of difficulties that we will face  if we join the EU, for instance stronger competition or the  adjustment of the monopolies to the free market. But without  the EU we would have to implement even tougher reforms to be  able to keep pace. Basically, we Austrians need much more self-  confidence. One can acquire this more quickly abroad. I always  feel five centimeters taller when I come home than I was when I  left. At home they then make me feel two centimeters shorter  again. But, I still end up three centimeters taller!. (He  laughs)    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] On 10 June, two days before the EU  referendum, you will celebrate your 60th birthday. Do you have  any wishes for you birthday?    [Mock] First, that the Austrians give themselves the present  of voting yes to be able to participate in decisionmaking as  equals. Second, that they manage to maintain the ability to  talk to each other despite the ups and downs of political  developments, an ability acquired after World War II, and third,  I want an increase in the standard of living, both in ethical  and material terms, and the ability to work for something and  not to get lost in complete passivity, as is currently happening  in connection with Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] Your altruism does you honor, but do you  not have any private wishes?    [Mock] (laughs) I tell my private wishes to my wife.    [WIRTSCHAFTSWOCHE] What are you plans for the future, for  the time after the referendum? Would you be available for  another term as foreign minister?    [Mock] I feel comfortable with this task and, if I am  called,  I will be happy to be available for another term. But, you see,  I am also pragmatic. I know that we all have our jobs only for  a certain period.</p>

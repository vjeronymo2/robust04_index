Reznikov and L.D. Belyakova, Petrochemical </F> and Coal Chemistry Synthesis Institute and Physical Chemistry  Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow; UDC 543.544]    [Abstract] The separation and identification of complex  mixtures of compounds with similar physicochemical properties  require the creation of new heat-resistance adsorbents that are  sensitive to the electronic structure of the molecules being  separated. In view of this fact, a study examined the mobility  of adsorbed molecules (i.e., the changes in the entropy of  adsorption) of organic materials on barium sulfate  (BaSO[.sub]4[/]). The changes in entropy were calculated from  values of Henry's constant and from changes in internal  adsorption energy that were determined by gas chromatography.  Experimental and calculated values were derived and compared. It  was discovered that saturated hydrocarbons (n-alkanes and  n-alkenes) interact with the surface of a BaSO[.sub]4[/]  adsorbent nonspecifically, mainly on account of dispersion  forces. The energy of nonspecific interaction on the surface of  BaSO[.sub]4[/] is much lower than on the surface of a  nonspecific nonpolar adsorbent such as graphitized thermal black  (35 versus 49 kJ/mol, respectively, for  n-C[.sub]8[/]H[.sub]18[/]). The adsorption of n-alkanes  was found to be delocalized, and the heat of adsorption  increased as the number of hydrocarbon atoms increased, which is  to say that the mobility of the molecules on the surface  decreases because of intensification of the dispersion  interaction. In the cases of n-hexane and n-heptane, ultramobile  adsorption was observed on BaSO[.sub]4[/]. In a homologous  series of n-alkenes, the mobility of the adsorbed molecules  decreased as a result of intensification of the dispersion  interaction with the surface. The adsorption of aromatic  hydrocarbons on the surface of BaSO[.sub]4[/] was also found  to be delocalized. The molecules' mobility was limited because  of -complexing of the -electrons of the benzene ring  with  the Ba[.sup]2+[/] cations. In the series  benzene-butylbenzene, the mobility of the adsorbed molecules  decreased as a result of an increase in the contribution of the  dispersion interaction of the BaSO[.sub]4[/] surface with the  alkyl radicals of the alkylbenzenes. The molecules of  tetramethylbenzene formed stronger bonds with the surface than  those of trimethylbenzene do; however the rotation of  trimethylebenzene's molecules is more difficult than is the  motion of the molecules of tetramethylbenzene because of the  latter's great asymmetry. Adsorption of halogen-containing  aromatic compounds was also delocalized; the mobility of their  molecules on the BaSO[.sub]4[/] surface was limited (i.e.,  the rotational motion of the molecules was difficult).  Adsorption of ethers and both unsaturated and aromatic  hydrocarbons on the surface of BaSO[.sub]4[/] was  delocalized, and the rotational motion of their molecules was  difficult because of the interaction of the electron pairs of  the oxygen atoms with the Ba[.sup]2+[/] cations and the  interaction of the ether's dipoles with the electrostatic field  of the BaSO[.sub]4[/] (an orientation interaction). Ethyl  acetates were absorbed on BaSO[.sub]4[/] with a great deal of  energy (the contribution of the energy of the specific  interaction to the total energy of adsorption amounted to 43  kJ/mol). Adsorption of nitrogen-containing organic compounds on  BaSO[.sub]4[/] resulted in the formation of strong complexes  because of the nonshared pair of electrons at the nitrogen atom.  In the case of pyridine, there was a high degree of localization  of its molecules on BaSO[.sub]4[/]. Tables 3; references 11:  7 Russian, 4 Western.</p>

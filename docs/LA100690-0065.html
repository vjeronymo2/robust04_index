			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CAMARILLO;  </P> <P> D.A. EXPECTS DEATH PENALTY TO BE UPHELD  </P> <P> Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury predicted Friday that the  California Supreme Court will uphold the death penalty for Theodore Frank, who  was convicted in the 1978 rape and torture-murder of a 2-year-old girl.  </P> <P> Bradbury said after sitting through oral arguments before the Supreme Court  Thursday, "My hunch is, judging from the comments of the justices, they'll  uphold it . . . It was a flawless trial. The defense is just scraping to find  an issue."  </P> <P> Frank, now 55, was sentenced twice to the gas chamber for molesting and  murdering Amy Sue Seitz of Camarillo. The second death sentence came in 1987  after the high court overturned the first one in 1985.  </P> <P> On Thursday, state Deputy Public Defender Stephen Matchett argued to the  Supreme Court that the trial judge at Frank's second sentencing had improperly  considered statements by the victim's grandmother, Patricia A. Linebaugh.  Matchett said Linebaugh's statements asking Superior Court Judge John J. Ryan  to sentence Frank to death contained "implied threats" that he could be voted  out of office if he changed the jury verdict from death to life in prison  without parole.  </P> <P> Matchett declined Friday to discuss his predictions on how the Supreme Court  will rule on Frank's sentence. "I would decline to speculate on that," he said.  </P> <P> The high court has 90 days from Thursday's hearing in which to make its ruling.  MACK REED and PHILIP HAGER  </P></p>

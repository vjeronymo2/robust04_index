			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Fan Baochang: "It Is Necessary To Form Policy </F> Early in Order To Prevent Sugar-Related Fiscal Losses"]    [Text] This year is a year of greatly declining sugar  production in our province. According to forecasts, procured  beets have amounted to less than 3 million metric tons,  representing a decline of 50 percent from the best year in  history. Because of the raw material insufficiency, some  sugar-making enterprises have become kitchens without rice, and  have difficulty in surviving. Four sugar refineries, the  Zhaodong, Zhaozhou, Bayan, and Binzhou, have been forced to  suspend production.    Raw material insufficiencies have always been creating  difficulties for the survival and development of our province's  sugar industry; especially, some new refineries which have been  established more recently have experienced even more prominent  problems in this regard as their raw material areas are smaller.  The raw material situation affects the present as well as the  future; this year's raw material insufficiency not only  constrains this year's production but will also affect next  year's.    The overall factors responsible for this year's large  decline  in beet production: The first is the irrational beet price in a  comparative sense. Our province's main cash crops are commonly  called the "two kinds of dou and one kind of  nodules," that is: soybeans, potatoes, and beets. Currently the  per mu value of output of soybeans is 240-320 yuan; the per mu  value of output of potatoes is 160-240 yuan; and the per mu  value of output of beets is 124-186 yuan. In terms of the per mu  value of output, there is a marked difference in price between  beets on the one hand and soybeans and potatoes on the other.  The sales price of sugar has now risen to 2,800-3,200 yuan per  metric ton; the ratio of the raw material price to the finished  product price appears to be very irrational. It is exactly  because of this price factor that the sown acreage for soybeans  is extremely large across our province, thereby seriously  adversely affecting not only beets but also other cash crops and  grain crops.    The second has been the error in the work of guiding public  opinion. Early this year the General Sugar Group Corporation of  the province put forward the argument for "being not afraid of  three things"; one part of the argument was about being not  afraid of peasants' not growing beets. The argument has produced  some negative effects. Sugar-making enterprises have slackened  beet production consciously or unconsciously, and peasants have  also become dispirited and bitter.    The third has been local governments' administrative  interference. In terms of the provincewide situation, the  production of raw material for county-supervised sugar-making  enterprises is generally in better shape than for  province-supervised enterprises. This is because the difference  between the situation of making profits and the situation of  making losses in sugar-making enterprises is great. Thus if the  enterprises do well, they can become a major fiscal pillar for  the localities; but if they are in bad shape, they can become an  unbearable burden. Therefore, with regard to methods of  promoting raw material production, the localities have not only  issued mandatory plans but also used some constraining means,  trying every means to increase raw material production.    The fourth is that the problem of difficulty in selling  beets  has not been fundamentally resolved. In spring when beet  production is being arranged and when sown acreage commitments  are made, sugar refineries would call beet farmers honey  brothers and sweet sisters, visiting the farmers during Spring  Festival and delivering seeds and pesticides to their doors; but  at the time when beets are procured, they would change their  usual attitude, becoming rude and cold and using dirty methods  to withhold part of the payments to beet farmers. The phenomenon  of extorting money and objects has occurred form time to time.  White slips have not been thoroughly eliminated. According to a  source, the sugar front of the entire province still owes 160  million yuan in white slip money. This year there is still a  shortage of 624 million yuan in procurement funds. This means  that more white slips will continue to be issued. If selling  beets does not generate cash, how would peasants acquire  enthusiasm for growing beets?    Over several years the sugar industry provincewide was all  along in a predicament. There were many reasons for the  situation. The main reason was that the sugar price was not  proper. Now the price has grown gradually, and people at home  and abroad are optimistic about the price, resulting in a good  external environment for the development of the sugar industry.  Nevertheless, beet production provincewide is now faced with a  grave situation. A failure to take effective measures to rectify  the situation will not only endanger the development of the  sugar-making enterprises but also make it difficult for them  just to survive. Resolving the raw material insufficiency is now  an extremely urgent issue.    First, it is hereby suggested that the provincial government  immediately adopt a policy on the procurement price of beets.  Raising the procurement price of beets is inevitable. It is  necessary to adopt a prudent attitude toward the question as to  how much the price should be raised. If the damages to peasants'  interests are underestimated, the enthusiasm for growing beets  would still not be raised. But overestimation in this respect  would produce a result unbearable to enterprises, and harm the  state's interest. Only by properly setting the procurement price  of beets would it be possible to take care of the interests of  all three parties, thereby raising everyone's enthusiasm. Under  usual circumstances, it is proper to have the beet procurement  cost account for 50 percent of the sales price of sugar. If the  sales price of sugar is 2,800 yuan, 3,000 yuan, or 3,200 yuan  per metric ton, then it is proper to raise the beet price to 175  yuan, 185 yuan, or 195 yuan per metric ton. A proper price ratio  can play the role of directing and adjusting supply-and-demand  relationships. A situation where the beet price changes with  changes in the sugar price will certainly stimulate beet  production, thereby meeting the needs of sugar-making  enterprises.    Second, enterprise autonomy should be effectively  implemented. According to a source, in recent years some  refineries have formulated some homegrown policies in an effort  to promote raw material production, adopting, for example, such  preferential policies as those of supplying beet farmers with  half-price seeds and paper tubes as well as free pesticides to  be mixed with seeds, the practice of paying some service fees to  county, township (town), and village cadres, etc. In 1992 the  Yi'an Sugar Refinery implemented the new method of  "reward-getting beet growing," distributing forms in spring,  checking the cases in autumn, and giving the rewards at the end  of the year. With 200,000 yuan, it bought peasant willingness to  grow beets. In the spring of this year, although every refinery  knew that the irrational price ratio would adversely affect  peasants' enthusiasm for growing beets, no one would dare to  raise the price by itself.    In view of the abovementioned situation, it is hereby  suggested that the supervisory agencies delegate this power to  enterprises, asking them to do their work boldly and proudly  under the condition of having no misgivings. The belief is that  they will discharge well their accounting responsibilities on  the basis of consideration of their respective economic  capabilities, and will not carry out loss-making operations.    Third, vigorously spread the use of the new technique of  paper-tube seedling growing. This new technique was introduced  from Japan. Over the several years, the refineries have spread  the use, and produced substantial successful experience. But a  new overall situation has yet to be created. There are mainly  three reasons for that: the first is the belief that the  investment is too large; the second is the belief that the labor  input is too large; and the third is the failure of technical  guidance to catch up.    As practice has proven, the new technique of paper-tube  seedling growing provides a great potential for increasing  yield. Under usual conditions, per mu yield can reach  3,000-4,000 kg, equal to the 2 mu yield based on direct  planting; in many instances, the yield is over 5,000 kg.  According to calculations based on a procurement price of 185  yuan per metric ton, the per mu value of output will be 555-740  yuan, which will be more than three times the per mu value of  output of soybeans.    Fourth, enhance the construction of the body of agricultural  affairs officers. The ties and bridges between enterprises and  the raw material areas are created through the work of  agricultural affairs officers. The agricultural affairs officers  of some old refineries maintain many fine traditions, which  should now be advocated, restored, and developed.    Currently some agricultural affairs officers are complacent,  and are not diligent. When they are arranging beet production in  rural areas, they often stay in towns, exercising remote command  through telephones.    Two qualities of agricultural affairs officers are urgently  in need of improvement. It is necessary to formulate a code of  conduct governing the work of agricultural affairs officers. The  construction of the body of agricultural affairs officers should  be managed in a routine, regularized, and standardized manner.    Fifth, be determined to resolve the problem of beet-selling  difficulties. The problem of beet-selling difficulties is an old  and difficult problem which people have wanted to resolve for  many years but which has so far not been resolved in a  satisfactory manner. Peasants hate the problem extremely. This  problem has not only hurt peasants' enthusiasm for growing beets  but also totally broken peasants' hearts. Therefore it is  necessary to be determined to resolve the problem of  beet-selling difficulties.</p>

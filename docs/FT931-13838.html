			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Airline seats market key area for OFT review ONE OF the key areas to be examined in the Office of Fair Trading's review of Airtours' bid for Owners Abroad is the future of the airline seat wholesaling market. According to independent tour operators, Owners Abroad's willingness to act as a large-scale supplier of seats is essential to their viability. Their argument, put crudely, is that he who controls the seats, controls the business. Airtours, on the other hand, says it would assess the profitability of the business. Airline wholesaling, according to Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, is riskier than selling holidays and might not continue on its current scale within an expanded group. If the bid were successful, Airtours says it would use more of the capacity of Air 2000, Owners Abroad's successful charter airline, for its own customers. As a result, fewer Air 2000 seats would be available in the pool of seats which serves the independent tour operators. And Airtours might do less general seat wholesaling - that is buying other airlines' excess capacity and matching it with third party demand. The two group's seat wholesaling businesses are vastly different in scale. Airtours sells to third parties only about 40,000 seats, or less than 3 per cent of the total number of holidays it sells a year. Owners Abroad, by contrast, sells about 3m seats a year - about two thirds with its holiday packages and about 1m seats to other tour operators. Mr Crossland says that, in spite of the protests from the independent tour operators, their access to seats is unlikely to change. The total pool of charter seats would not shrink just because Air 2000 would be supplying more of the enlarged group's own requirements. He dismisses the operators' claim that they might effectively be denied access to some regional airports. Other charterers, like Air UK, Monarch Air and Caledonian, serve many of the UK's regional airports and would be able to supply the seats no longer made available by Air 2000. What is more, these companies have active seat brokering businesses and would relish expanding to fill any gap left by a less active Airtours. In the last year the charter market has also seen the arrival of Excalibur, a small airline backed by 3i, the venture capital group, which caters mainly for independent tour operators. Mr Bob O'Donnell, Excalibur's managing director, says Owners Abroad offers small tour operators flexibility, including the ability to buy a handful of seats on different aircraft from a number of airports. But there would be little to stop Excalibur expanding. 'If there was a capacity shortage in the market because of this deal (a successful Airtours bid), we would bring on new aircraft.' Owners Abroad does not share this vision of flexibility. Mr Roger Allard, chief executive of Owners Abroad Leisure, says the small tour operators would not be able to persuade charter airlines to put on extra capacity. They would lose the flexibility; and to some destinations, the airlines would have difficulty getting extra landing slots.</p>

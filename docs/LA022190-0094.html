			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN, 85, REJECTED IN MIX-UP, HOSPITAL SAYS  </P> <P> A "breakdown in communication" triggered an incident in which an 85-year-old  woman suffering from a brain injury was turned away from the emergency room at  St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica last year, the facility's medical director  said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Dr. Robert E. Fredricks said that the hospital's CAT scanner, which helps  physicians diagnose brain injuries, was not operating Oct. 19, when the woman  was rushed by ambulance to St. John's.  </P> <P> The hospital notified dispatchers with the area's emergency network of the  problem but the ambulance drivers were not told until they arrived at the  hospital, Fredricks said. A nurse diverted the ambulance to a nearby hospital,  where the woman was treated for brain, heart and respiratory problems.  </P> <P> The incident led to an investigation that found emergency room and quality  control deficiencies at the facility, and prompted the U.S. Health Care  Financing Administration to threaten to cut off $37 million in Medicare funding  for the hospital. Fredricks said those problems will be corrected by a March 6  deadline.  </P></p>

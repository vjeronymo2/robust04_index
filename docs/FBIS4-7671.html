			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 1/4/1994 -- Romania's President  Ion Iliescu returned Thursday evening [31 March] to Bucharest  after a two-day formal visit to Greece at the invitation of the  Greek president. On his arrival in Bucharest President Iliescu  stated among other things:    "We had a very busy schedule with interviews with President  Konstandinos Karamanlis, with Premier Andreas Papandreou, with  several members of the government and of parliamentary parties,  as well as with representatives of business and banking circles.  The common note of these interviews was their warm atmosphere.  On one side we assessed the good level of the ties between our  countries and a considerable similarity of opinions as regards  issues of our direct concern, as well as international  developments in our area and in Europe at large. We have also  noticed the firm political will on both sides to support the  expansion, diversification, and development of ties in all  fields, especially the economic ones, and we also considered the  current volume of commercial exchanges as modest compared to the  potential of our economies. From this point of view my opinion  is that there is a real interest and a climate of confidence  among business and economic circles of both countries to expand  these relations. However, these issues will be debated on the  forthcoming session of the joint commission due next week in  Athens. Worth mentioning would be also a new and positive  element in our relations in the banking system."    "As for the issues confronting our area and Europe in  general, we also noticed a similarity of opinions in their  approach. Referring to Yugoslavia, both sides were of the  opinion that progress could be made only by supporting efforts  for a political approach of the potential solutions to be found,  and that steps made until present in this direction are  sufficiently promising."    Romania's president was accompanied during his visit to  Greece by Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu, by Traian Chebeleu,  presidential aide, and by other officials.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["DPA/sav" report: "Mielke, Too, Did Not Know Anything </F> About the Bomb"]    [Text] On Friday [25 March] former Stasi chief Erich  Mielke was unexpectedly questioned as a witness in the trial  concerning the bomb attack on the "Maison de France" [French  cultural institute in Berlin] in August 1983. At the land court  the 86-year-old man said that he was not informed about the  attack beforehand.    The witness, who was brought to the court from prison, did  not want to give any further information about the involvement  of the Ministry of State Security [MfS]. Former Stasi  Lieutenant Colonel Helmut Voigt, who is accused of aiding and  abetting murder, had referred to orders which led to passing  explosives to German Johannes Weinrich, a member of the "Carlos"  terrorist group. Weinrich is considered to be the triggerman of  the attack, in which one man was killed.  <H5>  Stasi Agents Kept Silent </H5>   So far, the court has hardly made any progress in  questioning  the Stasi agents. Before Mielke, Harry Dahl, former head of the  Antiterrorism Main Department, was questioned. However, he  suffered from a defective memory. He was able to remember only  one detail: He did not give Voigt the order. His superior,  Horst Franz, refused to give evidence. Dahl's deputy, Guenter  Jaeckel, also claimed that he did not have anything to do with  the attack.    Despite these meager results, the judges can also rely on  something solid, namely on the MfS documents. They say that in  May 1983 it was feared that the Carlos group would carry out  attacks in order to extort the release of terrorists imprisoned  in France. In the following months, there was talk of planned  attacks. In June 1983 the "Maison de France" is even mentioned  as a potential target.    The reports from Voigt's department prove that the Stasi was  excellently informed about the group surrounding the  internationally wanted terrorist Carlos. It knew of previous  attacks by this group on the Paris-Toulouse train, the  Paris-Lyon fast train, and the Saudi Embassy in Vienna. It knew  Syrian liaison men and was informed about their private lives.  <H5>  Was Syria Involved? </H5>   On 19 August 1983 the MfS received another important message  from Hungary, according to which a certain Al-Siba'i, a  "would-be kamikaze" of Carlos' group, was on his way to Berlin.  Six days later, according to the prosecution, Al-Siba'i ignited  the bomb in the "Maison de France." For Senior Public  Prosecutor Mehlis it is clear that "all strings came together"  in Voigt's hands.    However, the trial does not just raise the question about  the  responsibility of the MfS. Syria, too, was involved in the bomb  attack. Weinrich had not only a Syrian diplomatic passport,  Damascus also supported the "Carlos group" with apartments,  cars, and weapons. The embassies were ordered to fulfill all  wishes of the gang. In Berlin terrorist Weinrich was cared for  by Nabil Sharitah, a member of the Syrian Embassy and a man who  is a mystery.    Even though an arrest warrant was issued for the 43-year-old  Syrian in Germany, he gave himself up to the authorities during  the trial. Voluntarily, as the diplomat stressed. However,  Sharitah did not live up to his boast that he would incriminate  Syria. After a visit by Syrian Embassy members, he cleared  Damascus: "Syria had nothing to do with that."</p>

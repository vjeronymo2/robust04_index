Box 490, Goshen, California 93227, has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 56.14107(a) (moving machine parts) to its Asphalt Mine (I.D. No. 04&hyph;04896) located in San Benito County, California. The petitioner states that it is impossible to provide the guard required by the standard due to pinch points and a heavily congested area in a confined space. Petitioner proposes to prohibit entry of miners while plant is energized by installing a heavy door with a lock. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 8.

No. 11&hyph;00134) located in Rock Island County, Illinois. The petitioner proposes to prohibit entry of employees while equipment is operating by enclosing equipment within a 6-foot fence with a padlocked gate, the gate to be equipped with an electrical interlock wired directly to the motor control circuit which de-energizes the motor if the gate is opened. Petitioner states that this method of guarding will afford the miners at least the same level of safety as would the guarding required by the standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 9.

No. 02&hyph;00151) located in Pinal County, Arizona. The petitioner proposes two alternative sets of stipulations. The first set of stipulations would use pony set shelter holes located 10 feet above the panel floor as designated ``shelter holes'' in all haulage panels at intervals of approximately 35 feet regardless of clearance; to provide training to all crews working on haulage on the use of the pony sets when trains are in the panel; to include new procedures and policies for haulage levels in its new policy manual; to post signs throughout the haulage panels directing crews to use the pony sets as shelter holes when trains are moving in the panel; and to keep train speeds in the haulageways at less than 5 mph to allow ample time to access the pony set shelter holes. Also, petitioner proposes a second alternative set of stipulations to use certain existing manway shelter holes as designated shelter holes in all haulage panels; to train all crews working on haulage; and to include new procedures and policies in its policy manual. The petitioner states that application of the mandatory standard would result in a diminution of safety to the miners. In addition, the petitioner asserts that either of the proposed alternative methods would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Request for Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Persons interested in these petitions may furnish written comments.

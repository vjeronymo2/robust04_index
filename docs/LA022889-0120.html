			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SAN CLEMENTE PLANNER CAN STAY ON PANEL  </P> <P> The San Clemente City Council voted unanimously Monday night to let Hal Joseph  remain on the Planning Commission after hearing a city attorney's opinion that  his role in bringing a developer to a project in the city would result in only  a temporary conflict of interest.  </P> <P> City Councilman Tom Lorch said the question of Joseph's removal from the  Planning Commission was "an emotional issue . . . and something we still don't  have all the facts on."  </P> <P> "So we decided to remove it (from the council agenda)," allowing Joseph to  retain his post, Lorch said.  </P> <P> Mayor Brian J. Rice had called for Joseph's resignation from the five-member  commission last week because of Joseph's involvement in getting Centex  Development Corp. to purchase undeveloped portions of the 1,077-acre Forster  Ranch.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Abstained From Voting  </P> <P> Joseph, who stands to receive a finder's fee from the landowner, Estrella  Properties, has abstained from voting on any matter affecting the Forster Ranch  property and Dallas-based Centex since last March. Rice has contended that  Joseph could be required to abstain from votes on the project through March,  1990, thereby crippling the commission's ability to deal effectively with a  major issue in the city.  </P> <P> But after Monday night's meeting, Rice explained his change of position on  Joseph. "The city attorney's comments that there is a conflict of interest only  lasting 2 months made me decide to move for removal (of the issue from the  council agenda)," he said.  </P> <P> Joseph, a longtime real estate consultant who has been a member of the Planning  Commission for the past 3 years, left immediately after the vote and was  unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> Earlier, however, Joseph said of the controversy: "This is not World War III.  "I haven't done anything wrong or illegal. Everything I've done has been very  up-front and I think the council has gone overboard in saying that I should be  removed."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Centex Plan Approved  </P> <P> Centex, which has expressed an interest in purchasing the Forster property  since last March, has been negotiating with the city over development plans.  Monday night, the City Council approved Centex's plan to build a 233-home  development on the land. Centex was one of eight developers competing for a  limited number of housing units allowed under the city's 1986 growth-control  ordinance, Measure B.  </P> <P> Forster Ranch is one of San Clemente's four major developments slated to be  considered by the Planning Commission in coming months.  </P> <P> On advice from San Clemente City Atty. Jeff Oderman, Joseph has been abstaining  from votes on all matters involving Forster Ranch and Centex that have come  before the commission since last March.  </P> <P> Rice last week called for Joseph's resignation, saying his abstentions leave  only four planning commissioners who can vote, raising the possibility of tie  votes on sensitive issues affecting the property and Centex.  </P> <P> Joseph said he had planned to formally resign his post at tonight's Planning  Commission meeting but changed his mind after receiving a letter from the mayor  last week demanding his resignation by noon last Thursday.  </P> <P> Rice also offered Joseph the option of issuing a public declaration that he  would not accept any money from the Centex Corp. If Joseph did not resign or  issue the declaration, Rice said at the time, he would have the issue placed on  Monday's City Council agenda.  </P> <P> Initially, it was thought that state conflict-of-interest laws would require  that Joseph abstain through March, 1990, a year and a day after close of escrow  on the sale. But the state Fair Political Practices Commission later advised  Oderman that since Centex was the buyer and the finder's fee was being paid by  the seller, Joseph would not be in conflict-of-interest after the close of  escrow.  </P></p>

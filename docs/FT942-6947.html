			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Completed rights means final hurdle cleared  -Eurotunnel financing More than a fortnight before the Queen, Mr John Major and President Mitterand took the 'inaugural' train ride on May 6 through the Channel tunnel, a group of leading fund managers and corporate bankers took the first outsiders' ride. The fact that the City beat the state through one of the modern world's greater engineering feats, speaks volumes for the predicament in which Eurotunnel had found itself. With its money due to run out in June, it was faced with the logistics of securing increased loans from a syndicate of 220 banks, and getting support for a rights issue without having any loyal institutional shareholders. Surprisingly, the Pounds 858m rights issue went through with little difficulty, and no evidence of the arm twisting that institutions had expected from the issue's broker, SG Warburg. The underwriting group - with UK institutions covering one half of the transaction and French the other - took all night to complete the agreement, but once pricing was agreed by the Eurotunnel board at 5pm last night, success was assured. The lead-up was not so smooth. The UK stock market had gone against Eurotunnel from the start. And on Wednesday, when the deal was finalised, it hit its low point of the year. Word of Eurotunnel's difficulty in securing bank finance had spread, creating nervousness among underwriters and potential sub-underwriters, and encouraging a decline in the share price. In addition, cynicism remained over the company's financial projections. This meant that the leading institutions, which would be expected to back such a stock, were uninvested, and unexcited - more than 60 per cent is held by French, mainly retail, investors. In the circumstances, institutions had a professional incentive in talking down the price of the rights, to make it more attractive. They succeeded. Eurotunnel had started with a broad spread on pricing, stretching down to a minimum of 250p, because the company was only mandated to issue 340m new shares, and it needed to raise Pounds 850m. By Wednesday, Eurotunnel's expectations had been forced downwards, and the board was faced with a range from 260p to 275p, and variations on the number of shares to be issued. Underwriters were satisfied with the decision of 265p. The UK tranche was led by Morgan Grenfell and the French by Banque Indosuez, and Swiss Bank took 25 per cent of the underwriting on both tranches. The format of the syndicates remained unchanged in the final stages and the underwriting agreement was completed at 6am. The sub-underwriting went through relatively easily yesterday morning, as the shares recovered from an initial 20p drop. Overall, the financial community has cause for celebration. Of the Pounds 858m raised from the rights, an astonishing Pounds 42m, or 5 per cent, has gone on fees, to cover 2 years of financial advice, more than Pounds 1m for the lawyers, and the usual underwriting fees. Meanwhile, Eurotunnel can celebrate having overcome what it claims to be the final financial hurdle in its struggle to profitability.</p>

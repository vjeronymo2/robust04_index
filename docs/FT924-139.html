			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / International Company News: AMB shrugs off legal move to halt BfG deal A LAST-minute legal bid to stall a three-way deal designed to give France's Credit Lyonnais control of Germany's troubled BfG bank, will fail, according to Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs. AMB, the insurance group controlling BfG, insisted yesterday that today's extraordinary general meeting would go ahead as planned, despite court action by one shareholder. The meeting will be asked to approve the takeover and also grant Assurances Generales de France (AGF) full voting rights on its 25 per cent stake in AMB. An individual shareholder 'obviously' acting on behalf of a third party had asked an Aachen court on Christmas Eve for a temporary injunction postponing the meeting, AMB said. The plaintiff, Mr Wilm Lurken, a lawyer holding one AMB share, had also demanded that if the meeting went ahead, any decisions taken should not be allowed to take effect. AMB said it expected the application to be dismissed as groundless at a court hearing scheduled for January 12. No details were available of the contents of Mr Lurken's application nor of shareholders he might represent. However, most speculation focuses on La Fondiaria, an Italian insurance group with a 20 per cent holding in AMB. A handful of small shareholders has also been agitating against part of the deal. Registration of the state-owned French insurer's effective blocking stake will markedly dilute La Fondiaria's influence at AMB. The extent to which AMB's present shareholders will be required to guarantee outstanding BfG loans after the takeover is also believed to be a further source of friction. The bank, part-owned by a German trade union holding company, is heavily exposed in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Meanwhile, small shareholders say the state-owned French insurer AGF, which engineered the deal with Credit Lyonnais in return for assurances that its shares would be registered, should be obliged to make a full bid for AMB. Contracts on the sale of 50 per cent plus one share in BfG to the state-owned Credit Lyonnais were signed on December 23. The French bank, which recently announced a FFr1.79bn capital increase, plans to inject DM1.2bn into its acquisition.</p>

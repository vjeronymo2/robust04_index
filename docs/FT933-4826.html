			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Building a Eurocompany SLOWLY, with one step back for every two steps forward, a new generation of truly European companies is taking shape. Renault-Volvo, announced yesterday, can hope to build on the apparent success achieved by such recent combinations as Asea Brown Boveri, Reed Elsevier and GEC Alsthom. It must try to avoid the problems that beset Carnaud MetalBox and, a couple of decades before, the ill-fated merger between Dunlop and Pirelli. The way for such ventures has been paved by two longstanding Anglo-Dutch success stories, Unilever and Royal Dutch-Shell; and also by the creation of genuinely pan-European operations by big US companies such as Ford, Exxon and General Motors. Now Renault-Volvo seeks similar gains, going further than those permitted by the two companies' extensive collaboration agreements and cross-shareholdings. European mergers must overcome three different barriers. First, they must resolve the practical questions of legal structure and corporate governance that bedevil all cross-border entities. The absence of a European company statute requires elaborate legal structures that add cost and complexity. At least one now-sundered merger would still be working, in its boss's opinion, if it had been indissolubly glued together under such a statute. The continued existence of two national companies made it too easy to break the venture apart. If an easy exit had not been available, the managers would have worked harder to solve their disagreements. Workable structures Even without a European statute, however, workable structures exist. More important are shareholders' expectations. The most successful cross-border ventures come from countries with similar capital markets and investment horizons. Conversely, the most acrimonious disagreements have arisen between companies based in Britain, on the one hand, and France or Italy, on the other. On this issue, Renault-Volvo is heading off into uncharted waters, not least because the French side is still state-owned. The second task facing all such ventures is to build in practice the integrated pan-European business that they seek in theory. Here, American experience offers a cautionary lesson against over-optimism. Though Ford, for example, has had a high degree of integration in its European operations for decades, it is still grappling with the task of creating a single seamless structure to take a car from the drawing board to the production line and on to the showroom. The big oil companies are able to operate as pan-European buyers and refiners of oil; but too often the vagaries of local demand and regulation hamper integration further downstream. Subtle barriers In building their own seamless systems, the new European companies will benefit from the achievements of the single market programme. But just as important as the subtle barriers of regulation, market structure and customer taste are those created by the venture itself. In the early years of a merged company it is hard to avoid a production plan based, crudely, on sharing out the work. Only when bosses and workers no longer think in such terms is the company clearly on its way to success. That leads to the managers' third task: creating an organisation that is colour-blind to nationality. Companies have a better chance of making a success of a cross-border merger if they already practice such an approach - as at ABB - or if they have a neutral ring-keeper to speak for the company as a whole. This was the solution Carnaud MetalBox adopted to resolve damaging polarisation between the group's French and British managers. As they build a truly European company, the managers involved must always be aware of the wider markets in which they operate. The creation of the single European market is merely a symptom of the remorseless pressures of globalisation which no manufacturer can escape. It is, perhaps, not the best augury for Renault-Volvo's success that its creation coincides with another 'voluntary' agreement to restrain Japanese car exports to Europe. Only when its industries are self-confident enough to eschew such damaging 'protection' will the European company truly come of age.</p>

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Letter: Transport - conflicts and little hope Sir, Your editorial, 'No revolution in British Rail' (July 15), concludes that the rail white paper, by separating track infrastructure from trains, provides an opportunity to level the playing field between road and rail. To complete the process you advocate higher fuel taxes and tolls on motorways. It is perhaps not widely appreciated that legislation which enables the playing field to be levelled reached the statute book last year. This initiative - The New Roads and Street Works Act - allows for privately-financed tolled roads. It has had very little impact. In several instances untolled public schemes have been chosen instead of the tolled schemes suggested by the private sector. A concession has been granted for one privately financed road only and even this is not certain to proceed. The government needs to revive this flagging policy. To do this, it needs to level another playing field by placing the department of transport's road planners, some of whom strongly oppose toll roads, at arm's length from those advising ministers. At the present time there is a clear conflict of interest, especially when rival private and public schemes are seeking approval.

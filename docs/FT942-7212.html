			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Flotation puts Pounds 141.5m value on London Clubs London Clubs International, owner of the Ritz CLub and five other London casinos, yesterday finalised its flotation, pricing the shares at 200p to give it a market capitalisation of Pounds 141.5m. Of the 16.38m ordinary shares to be placed with institutions, 4.09m will be subject to a clawback to meet retail demand through intermediaries. The shares - of which 15m are new - have been placed by Samuel Montagu, which has fully underwritten the issue. The placing will raise about Pounds 27.5m net of expenses, which will be used to pay off bank debt incurred under the 1989 management buy-out from Grand Metropolitan. The group will be quoted on the USM because the management has only two years' experience of the company, and Stock Exchange rules require three years. The change of management followed a police raid in 1991 under the Gaming Act, just days before a previous planned flotation. The clubs were issued with new licences in autumn 1992. Mr Alan Goodenough, chief executive, said the company considered the events of 1991 as 'very much a thing of the past'. The company would be seeking a full listing next year. The prospectus shows the group, which operates casinos in Europe and Egypt as well as on cruise ships, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 14m in the 51 weeks to March 27, compared with Pounds 9.1m in the 53 weeks to April 6 1993. Turnover amounted to Pounds 146.4m (Pounds 143.7m). Pro forma pre-tax profits are put at Pounds 23.1m, and earnings per share before restructuring costs of Pounds 2m at 22.5p, giving a multiple of 8.9. The prospectus said the directors would have recommended a dividend of 11.92p, giving a notional gross yield of 7.45 per cent. Mr Goodenough said the group intended to export its expertise in the industry. Early next month it is opening a new casino in Taba, Egypt, across the border from the Israeli resort of Eilat. COMMENT This issue has been priced to go, even on a day when the market fell sharply and the National Lottery winner was announced. Although the high rolling Ritz accounted for almost two thirds of last year's trading profits, the portfolio of casinos is strong. This helps to minimise the risk of relying too heavily on a few high spending players, although it is worth recalling this week's warning from Ladbroke that credit betting profits were down in the first four months. The yield is very high, and strong cash generation will sustain it. Providing the market does not come back too far, the shares should move to a premium when dealings start on June 6.</p>

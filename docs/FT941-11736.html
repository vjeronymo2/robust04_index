			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Japanese resist US trade talks pressure A last-ditch effort by the US to steer its trade talks with Japan towards agreement appeared to meet stiff resistance yesterday from leading Japanese politicians. Meetings between Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, and Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's foreign minister, and later with Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, trade minister, failed to make a breakthrough. The bilateral trade and economic framework talks are deadlocked because of opposing views on how to increase access to Japan's markets. Mr Kantor is in Tokyo with Mr W. Bowman Cutter, deputy presidential assistant for economic policy, on a special mission to try to push the talks forward ahead of a US-Japan summit due next week. The meetings, which both lasted for nearly two hours, were described as 'tough' by Japanese officials. The discussion with Mr Hata focused on the entire framework agreement, and a great part of that with Mr Kumagai was taken up with one of the most contentious issues - trade in motor vehicles and parts. Although Mr Kantor did not use the word 'sanctions', according to Japanese media reports, he suggested that failure to conclude the agreement would affect relations badly. The Japanese are understood to have stood firmly behind the official position that the use of numerical targets to boost imports, which the US has been insisting on, would lead to managed trade and was therefore unacceptable. Nevertheless, it was also reported that Mr Kumagai hastily arranged meetings with the heads of Toyota and Nissan, suggesting that as on many occasions in the past, the trade ministry could be orchestrating some kind of 'voluntary' effort by the Japanese car industry in order to appease the US.</p>

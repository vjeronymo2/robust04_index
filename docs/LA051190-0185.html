			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> LIZ TAYLOR SUFFERS RELAPSE, WILL BE IN HOSPITAL SIX MORE WEEKS  </P> <P> Pneumonia-stricken actress Elizabeth Taylor has suffered complications in her  fifth week of hospitalization, including new infections, and doctors now say  she will be hospitalized six more weeks.  </P> <P> The recovery of Miss Taylor, near death two weeks ago with a viral pneumonia,  has been complicated by bacterial pneumonia and a yeast infection, her doctors  said today.  </P> <P> "Miss Taylor has a resolving, newly acquired bacterial pneumonia secondary to  her hospital stay at St. John's Hospital and Health Center," the doctors said  in Santa Monica through Taylor's publicist, Chen Sam.  </P> <P> "It is improving significantly," the physicians said.  </P> <P> "She has also developed a fungemia of Candida albicans (infection in the  blood), more commonly referred to as yeast and will be hospitalized for  approximately six more weeks for intravenous therapy," the doctors added  without elaboration.  </P> <P> Bacterial pneumonia is generally considered less serious than the viral  pneumonia Taylor initially contracted because antibiotics are effective against  bacteria but not viruses.  </P></p>

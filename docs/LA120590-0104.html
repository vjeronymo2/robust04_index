			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS TO BUY $1 BILLION IN FOOD FROM ABROAD;  </P> <P> HUNGER: GORBACHEV HOPES TO RESTOCK SHELVES, SQUELCH THE BLACK MARKET AND QUELL  FEARS OF WINTER SHORTAGES.  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, disclosing the highlights of an  emergency plan to get his shortage-plagued country through the winter, said  Tuesday that more than $1 billion in food must be purchased abroad in the next  four months to make up for shortfalls in domestic production.  </P> <P> In a speech to the Soviet legislature, Gorbachev said a task force he created  is working virtually around the clock to devise "urgent measures" to alleviate  deficits in state-run Soviet grocery stores and ensure a reliable supply  nationwide.  </P> <P> "The work is at its final stage," Gorbachev assured the lawmakers. "Today, or  tomorrow at the most, a draft program of action will be finished." It will then  be discussed with the governments of the constituent Soviet republics, he said.  </P> <P> By all accounts, food supplies to the largest cities of the Soviet Union are  their worst since World War II and the immediate postwar period, and consumers  have been further depleting the shops through spates of panic buying and  stockpiling, fueling widespread fears of a possible famine.  </P> <P> Clearly intending to debunk such talk, but acknowledging that the food issue is  the "most urgent question" now facing the Kremlin leadership, Gorbachev said  that it is in the power of the government, through urgent measures he will  recommend, to provide as much grain, eggs, cooking oil and other basic  foodstuffs per citizen as in 1989.  </P> <P> The plan being drawn up includes the following measures to see the country  through the winter and revitalize its agriculture on a longer-term basis,  according to Gorbachev:  </P> <P> * To feed the Soviet Union through March, foodstuffs worth a total of 2.1  billion rubles, or $1.28 billion at the newly introduced official commercial  exchange rate, must be bought abroad.  </P> <P> * To increase domestic agricultural production, a total of 3 million to 5  million hectares, or 7.4 million to 12.3 million acres, should be given to city  dwellers and peasants alike so they can plant gardens. Such small-scale  holdings, allowed in the Soviet Union even in times of great socialist rigor,  are the nation's most productive farmland by far.  </P> <P> * Construction and modernization of food processing plants, traditionally one  of the weakest links in the Soviet food chain, will be stepped up.  </P> <P> * Black marketeers and "speculators" will be tracked down and punished, in part  through the strict supervision of stores and plants by workers committees  ordered by Gorbachev last Friday. Raids on 50 Moscow shops found that when they  close, "a third shift begins," Gorbachev said, meaning that after hours,  workers are dealing in foodstuffs for their own profit.  </P> <P> "Within the next two or three weeks, we think we can control the situation,"  Gorbachev said of the black market, which by many estimates siphons off half  the grocery shipments designated for state-run shops and has become a common,  if expensive, source of supply for Soviet consumers.  </P> <P> Some foreign countries, showing their support for Gorbachev's perestroika  program for social and economic restructuring, are now shipping food aid to the  Soviet Union. The United States, which had originally opposed such assistance  as unnecessary or ineffective, is reviewing its policy.  </P> <P> As his domestic troubles have multiplied, Gorbachev has won long-term,  low-interest credits from some Western European countries to finance foreign  food purchases, which he said Tuesday would pay at least part of this winter's  bill.  </P> <P> "Either the appropriate contracts have been signed and supplies are under way,  or the questions have been thoroughly studied," Gorbachev said. But he said  total needs for 1991, and apparently the cost of food imports for the year as  well, have not been established.  </P> <P> Members of the Supreme Soviet received most of Gorbachev's proposals in silence  or with an audible buzz of skepticism -- for example, when he spoke of creating  a Ministry of Agriculture, which would be the latest bureaucratic organ to  oversee the chronically unproductive collective and state farms.  </P> <P> Some radical approaches were vaguely hinted at. Gorbachev tantalizingly said  the plan includes measures to alter "land relations" -- but they appeared to  consist largely of traditional remedies for Soviet agricultural problems.  </P> <P> In contrast, the more unorthodox Parliament of the Russian Federation on Monday  approved private ownership of land -- not just gardens, but parcels of farmland  -- in hopes of fostering an army of peasant entrepreneurs to feed Russia.  </P> <P> Gorbachev went to the Supreme Soviet to seek approval for his scheme to  restructure the government, a change that would put him in direct charge of a  cabinet-style executive branch. Gorbachev is pressing for revision of the  apparatus of Soviet power at the same time that he is seeking a new, looser  Soviet federation.  </P> <P> Recent actions by Gorbachev have led progressive and radical lawmakers to fear  that in the face of economic woes, ethnic crises and virtual deadlock of the  political system, Gorbachev is backtracking in his reforms or even throwing in  his lot with the KGB, Soviet army, Communist Party apparatus and other  conservative institutions.  </P> <P> One prominent progressive, Alexei M. Yemelyanov, denounced Gorbachev's  governmental reorganization plan in the legislature as a "big step leading to  the limitation of the power of the Supreme Soviet," since it would minimize  legislative control over government ministries.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, a majority of the lawmakers approved Gorbachev's proposal in  principle and sent it to the larger Congress of People's Deputies, which alone  can make the necessary constitutional amendments, for final approval later this  month.  </P></p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / US Mid-Term Elections: Scramble to get Gatt through Mr Newt Gingrich, the new House Speaker-to-be, has promised to work with the Clinton Administration to pass the Uruguay Round implementing legislation when it comes up for Congressional approval in three weeks, according to a senior White House official. Mr Leon Panetta, White House chief of staff, said in a CNN interview yesterday Gatt passage, the first test of bi-partisanship in the new order, would 'send a very important signal' which the president could carry into summits with the Pacific Rim countries next week and Latin American leaders on December 9-10. However, that signal has yet to be sent directly by Mr Gingrich or Senator Robert Dole, who will become Senate majority leader. Business lobbyists yesterday were scurrying from meeting to meeting planning strategies to secure passage this year. It is the outgoing Democratic-controlled Congress which will vote on the Gatt legislation, but party labels matter little on trade. Populists on both sides of the political divide are opposing the proposed World Trade Organisation, which the Uruguay Round creates. The implementing legislation is being depicted as 'a budget buster,' riddled with protectionist clauses and 'sweetheart deals.' At least Dollars 40bn (Pounds 24.3bn) of the projected lost tariff revenue has not been offset by new taxes or programme cuts. Senate rules require 60 senators to approve a budget waiver before implementing legislation can go to the floor. Mr Dole is reported to have said he would like the legislation re-written next year, but that was before the mid-term election. He has since made conciliatory noises about bi-partisan co-operation. Mr Mark Anderson, trade specialist at the AFL-CIO, the labour umbrella organisation, has little doubt that Mr Dole will in the end co-operate with the president on Gatt. 'Dole has a long history on free trade. . . I don't think he'll turn his back on the Business Roundtable or agribusiness.' Opponents are arguing that 'the fired and retired' members who return for the 'lame duck' session have not the right to vote on an issue of such economic importance as the Gatt package. They are alert for signs of business pay-offs to congressmen and congressional staff in search of new jobs. Pro-Gatt lobbyists believe the election has left members free 'to vote their consciences'.</p>

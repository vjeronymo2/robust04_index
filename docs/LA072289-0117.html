			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILDLIFE -- UP CLOSE 'N' PERSONAL  </P> <P> Once upon a time, oh best beloved, there was a summer school for all the wild  animals of the field and forest, veldt and savanna, water hole and river  bottom.  </P> <P> The school was at the San Diego Wild Animal Park east of Escondido, where 250  animal species, 47 of them endangered, roam over 700 spacious acres in the dry,  sunny San Pasqual Valley.  </P> <P> The summer school was for the birds -- and for the tigers, gorillas,  wildebeests, rhinos and, yes, even for weak and puny man cubs. And for their  parents, too. But at this school, the animals were the teachers and the  students were the humans.  </P> <P> The school was such a success and the humans learned so quickly that the  animals got together and voted to continue the program. (Let the record show  that the giraffes had to be bribed with carrots and that Gainda, the Indian  rhinoceros, demanded more quality petting time.)  </P> <P> So once again this summer, from now through August, the Wild Animal Park is  offering one-, two-, three- and five-morning classes for youngsters from Grade  1 through high school. The emphasis is on hands-on learning. Students join  teachers, staff biologists and keepers to pet, feed, count, look at, listen to  and -- most important -- learn about the creatures whose world we share.  </P> <P> And for adults? They haven't been forgotten. From now through September, animal  admirers and wildlife photographers ages 12 and up can sign up for special  family and photo caravan safaris into the huge exhibits themselves.  </P> <P> These open-air, bumpy expeditions, with 10 guests and two guides standing in  the back of a truck, spend a couple of hours driving on the dirt roads through  four of the park's five major habitats, the East and South African, and the  Asian Plains and Asian Waterhole, about 320 acres in all. The guides stop the  truck at various places to talk about the different animals and hand out  carrots and apples.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Taste of Africa  </P> <P> "The caravans are a little taste of Africa," says Larry Killmar, curator of  mammals. "They're not so rugged or stressful as a safari in Africa, but they  get the people down close."  </P> <P> Right! One minute you're adjusting your sunglasses, the next you're looking up  to see three tons of beady-eyed rhino barreling up to the truck. Then he -- or  she -- stops and thrusts that huge wrinkled face and rubbery lips right next to  yours.  </P> <P> You may want to shriek or faint. Yech -- kissed by a rhino! Instead, hand over  an apple and grab your camera. This is a rare chance to shoot wildlife photos  from a distance of six inches.  </P> <P> Bring your telephoto lens too, to snap candids of this year's crop of shy  babies. Says Killmar, who has been with the park since it opened in 1972:  "April to August is the heavy calving season. We can have as many as eight  births in a day -- they happen right out there in the exhibits."  </P> <P> If feeding fruit to rhinos seems unnatural when the park's goal is to create an  authentic living setting for the animals, you are right. And when excessive  contact with humans does interfere with the animals' social group behavior,  park biologists eschew it.  </P> <P> But, Killmar says, offering treats to unpredictable and easily spooked Indian  rhinos is the safest way to manage these 6,000-pound creatures.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Familiarity Breeds Friendship  </P> <P> "From day one we get the rhino calves used to touching by the keepers," Killmar  says. "If you give them apples and carrots and goodies, they'll do anything for  you. This allows us to move them around -- even crate them -- without using any  tranquilizers."  </P> <P> Each caravan has its own surprises. On a recent outing, Wild Animal Park  spokesman Tom Hanscom spotted a newly laid ostrich egg lying on the muddy river  bank. The eggs are a favorite target for hawks, so he stopped to collect it.  </P> <P> The visitors handed it around and agreed it felt large, heavy and very hard.  Just the right size for an omelet, someone commented. "Do you know how to cook  an ostrich egg?" Hanscom asked. "You put the egg and a rock in a pot of boiling  water. When the rock's done, so is the egg."  </P> <P> Youngsters coming to the park from the San Diego area usually are dropped off  by their parents or ride the bus from Escondido, but residents of Los Angeles  probably will find that the park is too far for a daily drive.  </P> <P> A solution is to enroll the child in a one-day class (held each Thursday  morning) and combine it with an all-day family visit to the park. Human cubs,  grades one through six, join a "Wild Walkabout," visiting koalas and kangaroos  and all the other strange fauna and flora from the Down Under continent, while  students in grades seven to 12 enroll in the class called "Close Enough to  Touch," similar to the photo caravans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> For Budding Zoologists  </P> <P> The older students actually accompany the keepers into the exhibits, through  double-chain-link gates to help feed and count the zebras and gazelles and feel  the giraffe's warm breath when it bends down for a carrot.  </P> <P> If a budding zoologist begs for a three-day class, consider a mini-vacation for  the family at one of the golf and leisure resorts east of Escondido or motel  accommodations in that area.  </P> <P> Start a day at the Wild Animal Park with a ride on the Wgasa Bush Line  monorail. The monorail runs around the hills above the major habitats and  provides an overview of the 2,500 animals that live behind special fencing  called "inrigging."  </P> <P> The fencing isn't all that tall, but it has a tremendous overhang at the top.  As our monorail tour guide Becky Boomer announced: "The animals get up next to  the fence and look up. When they see something over their heads, they think  they can't jump out."  </P> <P> On the ride, keep an eye out for a family of wild golden eagles circling  overhead. The eagles are a few of the wild birds that have taken up residence  in the surrounding hilltops and are getting fat on the gophers and mice that  help themselves to animal feed.  </P> <P> "We call them locals," Hanscom says, explaining that the Wild Animal Park  spends between $41,000 and $46,000 monthly on animal food. The grocery bill  would be higher, but the park actually grows some of its own browse food, such  as eucalyptus, on the park's 1,800 acres.  </P> <P> After the ride, visitors walk around the 1 1/4-mile Kilimanjaro Trail for a  closer look into the special, smaller exhibits: the Sumatran tiger's woody  hollow, the elephant enclosure, the lowland gorilla's lair and the cheetah's  grassy plain. The animals are fascinating to watch, but their presence points  to the Wild Animal Park's real purpose.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Protective Coloration  </P> <P> The park's protective coloration -- the Nairobi Village's thatched snack bar,  outdoor cafe, T-shirt shop, souvenir store, live animal shows, the petting  kraal -- is designed like a theme park to attract humans. But, Hanscom says,  the park's real purpose is 'to breed endangered species, and to study breeding  problems of animals in captivity."  </P> <P> For instance, he says, researchers discovered that flamingos wouldn't lay  fertilized eggs unless there were at least 100 birds in the flock. "It's the  number that seems to click the hormones and make them go," he says.  </P> <P> "And the Southern White Rhino . . . for years, the two in the San Diego Zoo  just ignored each other. Then they brought 20 females out here to the animal  park and moved the male out here to retire, but all he needed was space and a  harem. In 11 years, he sired 65 calves."  </P> <P> However, numbers aren't always a determining factor. There are cheetahs in the  wilds, but genetic studies reveal that they're very inbred, probably because  they live in isolated family groups. As a result, many females are sterile or  there's a high infant mortality. So the park is breeding cheetahs with better  genes, then making them available to other zoos.  </P> <P> The park's summer programs are scheduled almost every day of the week. Photo  caravans run on Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday afternoons from May  through September. Groups of 10 booking together can go any day. Each caravan  is 1 3/4 hours long; tickets are $50 for adults 16 and older and $35 for  children 12-15 with an adult. Children under 12 are not permitted on this  caravan. The East African and the Asian Plains caravan leaves at 2:30 p.m. The  caravan to the South African habitat and the Asian Waterhole leaves at 4:30  p.m.  </P> <P> You can take both tours for a full 3 1/2-hour safari; $75 for adults and $50  for children. Because San Diego Zoological Society members get a big discount  on all special tours, it may be possible to save money by joining the zoo at  the time you enroll. The photo caravans always are sold out and must be booked  in advance.  </P> <P> The Family Caravans are similar to photo caravans but emphasize learning about  and visiting family groups of animals rather than photography. They run Monday  evenings from 5:30 to 7 p.m. Tickets are $55 for one adult with one child, and  $80 for one adult with two children. Children must be 8 or older and be with an  adult.  </P> <P> The five-day summer school runs Monday through Friday from 9 to 11:30 a.m.,  with a separate class for each grade level from 1 to 9. The three-day  summer-school program runs Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday from 8:30 a.m. to 1  p.m. The fee is $50 and five different classes serve different grade levels.  </P> <P> The one-day program runs each Thursday from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and costs $22  to $35. Different classes are designed for three age groups.  </P> <P> The "Keeper Connection" is a two-session career exploration class for  10th-to-12th graders who are considering animal-related careers. The fee is  $50; the first session in August is on the 11th, and participants have a choice  for the second second sesssion of any day between Aug. 14 and 18.  </P> <P> You can enroll by telephone and pay by credit card. Call the Summer School  Hotline at (619) 740-9383, or the San Diego Zoo at (619) 236-0163. You also can  write to the Summer School, San Diego Zoo, P.O. Box 551, San Diego, Calif.  92112-0551, but expect a several-week processing delay.  </P> <P> Wild Animal Park hours are 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. through Sept. 4 (Labor Day), and 9  a.m. to 4 p.m. after. The park is 30 miles north of San Diego on Interstate 15,  then east on Highway 78. From Los Angeles take Interstate 5 south to Oceanside,  then California 78 east to the park. A ticket package (entrance, monorail ride,  animal shows and exhibits) is $12.95 for adults, $6.20 for ages 3-15, ages 2  and under free. Stroller and wheelchair rentals are available. No pets, please;  the wild animals frown on it.  </P></p>

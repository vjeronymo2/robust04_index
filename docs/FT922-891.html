			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (9): Free-for-all is over - Speed Limits and the Autobahns IT was July 19, 1986, on the A5 autobahn between Frankfurt and Kassel. A Porsche 911 was flying up the outside lane at 180 kph when a red BMW swerved out of the central lane into its path. What happened next may well come to be seen as the deciding moment in the lingering sacrifice of one of Germany's most sacred cows: the right to drive at speeds without limit on the open roads. The Porsche driver slammed on his brakes, skidded, and crashed into a car and caravan in the slow lane. The caravan broke free and collided into a stationary Opel Kadett on the hard shoulder. Both occupants of the Opel were injured. The red BMW was never traced, so the injured parties decided to sue the Porsche driver for damages. Last March, in court number six of the Federal Supreme Court in Karlsruhe, the judge decided they were right. Because the Porsche driver was not observing the 'recommended maximum speed' of 130 kph, he was partly liable for damages, he ruled. 'The free-for-all on the roads is over,' the newspapers declared. '130 kph has come through the back door.' The roads lobby refused to be moved. Mr Gunther Krause, the Minister of Transport, insisted that 'a general speed limit on the autobahns is not necessary.' A spokesman for Mercedes-Benz declared: 'The case has no effect on the speed limit.' But few others would agree. Mr Gerhard Schroder, prime minister of the state of Lower Saxony, criss-crossed by main transit routes, said: 'The time of unrestricted, reckless driving on Germany's roads is over.' The lack of a speed limit on Germany's open roads - it is the last member state of the European Community without one - has causes which lie buried somewhere between a national machismo for aggressive driving, the elevation of the motor car, and above all the highly-tuned varieties, to the ultimate status symbol, and the lobbying power of the mighty motor industry. Against all the evidence advanced by neighbouring states, the German government refuses to accept that speed limits would improve road safety, or reduce atmospheric pollution. The opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD), as well as the Greens, have stepped up their campaigning for a change. Mr Klaus Lennartz, deputy environment spokesman for the SPD in parliament, cites opinion polls showing that 71 per cent of the population is now in favour of a speed limit. In an urgent appeal to Chancellor Helmut Kohl last February, Mr Lennartz called for his personal support to introduce a general limit. He cited steadily rising accident tolls on the autobahns (as opposed to all German roads) since 1985, including the numbers fatally injured. He quoted evidence to show that noxious exhaust emissions - even with German catalytic converters - increase at an exponential rate with faster speeds. And he said that although only 1.4 per cent of the German road network was actually without a speed limit, that same tiny proportion carries 30 per cent of all traffic movements, which consume an equivalent proportion of overall petrol use. The chancellor's office replied to the letter only three months later - and two months after the Karlsruhe decision. Mr Bernd Schmidbauer, minister of state, said that the government 'does not consider that rigid speed limits are an appropriate means of improving road safety.' He said that the cause of most accidents was not the absolute speed of the vehicles involved, but the fact that they were travelling at 'a speed unsuited to the prevailing traffic conditions.' He said that the evidence available to the government did not suggest that the introduction of a maximum speed limit of, say, 130 kph would have 'any significant effect' in reducing energy consumption, and therefore no appreciable effect in reducing noxious exhaust emissions. The introduction of modern technology would be more important in improving road safety, he said - a clear reflection of the arguments of the motor industry. The car manufacturers maintain that high performance German cars such as Porsches, BMWs and Mercedes would not be so well developed - or sell so well on the world market - if there was not the demand generated by the free-wheeling German motorways. The latest eruption in an increasingly anguished debate is the suggestion that the European Commission will soon be able to force Germany to toe the speed-limited European line. Mr Karel van Miert, the transport commissioner in Brussels, denies any such intention. But the threat has already aroused a backlash. In the present climate of resentment at excessive Brussels' 'interference' in national preserves, Mr van Miert's caution is likely to continue. The debate in Germany will therefore probably be decided in the confrontation between the government, the motor industry, and the courts, with steadily rising pressure from the environmentalists. At the last meeting of Germany's annual traffic courts' assembly, Mr Roman Herzog, president of the constitutional court, the country's ultimate legal authority, spoke out in favour of a maximum speed limit 'if it is not fixed too low. A speed of 130 kph is constitutionally OK.' But he also warned that a speed limit which was not enforced would do more harm than good. The legal argument is that German traffic regulations say that whatever the speed limit, drivers must be 'constantly in control' of their vehicles. It also says that they must drive at a speed 'appropriate' to traffic conditions. And it says that a driver can only avoid damages for an 'unavoidable' accident - defined as one which an ideal driver, travelling at a reasonable speed, would have been able to avoid. Mr Hannskarl Salger, president of the traffic courts, believes that 170-180 kph is probably the 'sound barrier' of controllability for both driver and vehicle. The overwhelming body of legal opinion is now on the side of considering the speed of vehicles in an accident as a clear contributory factor for damages. That means that whatever the government and the roads lobby may or may not decide, the chances are that German road hogs will now have to start paying a stiff price for their speeding. And that is why the sorry story on the A5 outside Frankfurt back in 1986 may be seen as the coup de grace for free speeding on the autobahns.</p>

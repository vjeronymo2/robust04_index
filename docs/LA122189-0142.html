			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIMBER INDUSTRY ATTACKS OWL PROPOSAL  </P> <P> Timber industry spokesmen Wednesday attacked a federal proposal to declare the  northern spotted owl a threatened species in California and Oregon woodlands.  </P> <P> In testimony submitted to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, they asserted  that owls live just as well in managed timber lands as they do in old forests.  </P> <P> The owl has become an issue in the ongoing battle between environmentalists and  the timber industry over logging in Northern California and other parts of the  Pacific Northwest.  </P> <P> Industry leaders charge that the environmental movement's promotion of the owl  for "threatened" or "endangered" status is really aimed at curbing logging of  older trees on private land.  </P></p>

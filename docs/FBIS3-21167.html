			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] MITI's Agency of Natural Resources and Energy will  provide cooperation on safety to Asian countries such as China  and ROK that are proceeding with plans for nuclear power plants.  The government has decided that if the construction of nuclear  power plants in Asian countries does not proceed smoothly, it  will hinder their domestic development of atomic energy as a  source for power. Therefore, the government is considering  technical cooperation through the private sector. Specific  policy will be discussed on 11 November at the meeting of the  Atomic Energy Subcommittee of the Advisory Committee for Energy  (a MITI advisory body).    According to the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy,  among the countries in Asia, China plans to construct a total of  six nuclear power plants, including those presently under  construction, in the future. In addition, by the year 2006 ROK  will increase its capability to generate power from nuclear  energy to 23,200,000 kW, roughly three times the current level,  and both Indonesia and Malaysia plan to begin generating power  by nuclear energy.    Not only is there concern that Japan's environment may be  adversely affected by a nuclear accident in Asia, but such an  accident will make construction of nuclear power plants in Japan  that much more difficult. Therefore, the government is  considering such methods as promoting exchange of human  resources and technology transfer from the private sector in an  effort to encourage international cooperation and ensure safe  operation.</p>

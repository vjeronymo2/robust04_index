			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Lloyd's reports loss of 686 Names LLOYD'S of London has reported that 686 Names - the individuals whose assets support underwriting in the insurance market - had resigned by last Friday. It believed that the figure would be 1,600 by the end of the year. The rate of resignation has showed a marked decline from last year, when 4,000 Names left the market. Lloyd's said this slowdown demonstrated a returning confidence, but conceded it also reflected that those who were doubtful about the market had resigned last year.</p>
